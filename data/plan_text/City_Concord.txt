1. INTRODUCTION
With the largest population of any city in Contra Costa County and a growing and diverse
economic base, Concord has developed into a major residential and economic hub within the
region. Concord has an agricultural history, but developed into a primarily residential community
through the middle of the 20th century, providing housing for people working in San Francisco
and Oakland. The Concord BART station began service in 1973, providing easier access between
Concord and employment locations elsewhere in the Bay Area. During the 1980’s, a number of
companies, most notably Bank of America, constructed mid-rise office buildings in Downtown
Concord adjacent to the BART station, creating a hub of back-office employment opportunities for
people living in Concord and other locations in the Bay Area. Downtown Concord continues to
serve as an office node, while the retail sector, John Muir Medical Center, and a commercial
concrete contractor generate additional economic activity in the City.
Like many other cities in the Bay Area and throughout the country, Concord experienced a
dramatic increase in housing prices between the late 1990’s and 2006, followed by a sharp
decrease between 2007 and 2009 accompanied by a significant increase in foreclosures.
However, sale prices have rebounded in recent years, and foreclosure rates have reached pre-
recession lows.
As Concord looks to the future, the City is developing plans for key infill and other development
sites that will shape the next phase of residential and commercial development in Concord.
Planning for the City’s existing and future housing needs will be an essential element of this
process, and the 2014-2022 Housing Element will assist the City in continuing its strong history
of planning for housing for all segments of the population.
What is a Housing Element?
The Housing Element is one of the seven required elements of the General Plan and is the
primary document that local jurisdictions in California use to plan for current and future housing
needs. State Housing Element law, enacted in 1969, mandates that each local government in
California create a Housing Element to adequately plan to meet the existing and projected
housing needs of all segments of the population. The Housing Element must be consistent with
all other elements of the General Plan and is updated on a regular basis. The law acknowledges
that, in order for the private market to adequately address housing needs and demand, local
governments must adopt plans and regulatory systems that support housing development. As a
result, the successful growth of a community rests largely upon the implementation of local
general plans, and in particular, the Housing Element.
Each jurisdiction’s projected housing need during the Housing Element planning period is
determined through the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process, which is based on
projected Statewide growth in households as determined by the California Department of Housing
                                                    1

and Community Development (HCD). Through the RHNA process, HCD distributes the Statewide
projected housing need among the regions in the State, where each regional council of
government allocates the projected regional growth to local jurisdictions within the region. The
total housing need for each jurisdiction is distributed among income categories, requiring each
jurisdiction to plan to meet the need for housing for households at all income levels. The agency
responsible for distributing the RHNA in the Bay Area is the Association of Bay Area Governments
(ABAG), which works closely with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), the regional
transportation planning agency for the Bay Area.
Each city and county in California is then required to produce a Housing Element that
demonstrates the jurisdiction’s ability to accommodate the housing need identified in its RHNA
during the Housing Element planning period. This Housing Element covers the 2014-2022
Housing Element planning period, which differs from previous update cycles as a result of recent
changes in State Law, which are discussed in the following section.
SB 375 and Changes to Housing Element Law
In an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with passenger cars, Senate Bill 375
(SB 375, 2008) calls for local jurisdictions and regional planning agencies to better coordinate
land use plans with existing and planned transit investments and to plan for a greater proportion
of residential and employment growth in areas accessible to transit. One outcome of the effort to
coordinate housing and transit planning has been the eight-year planning period (2014-2022) for
the upcoming Housing Element Update, rather than the five- to seven-year planning period that
was used in previous Housing Element Update cycles, in order to coordinate the timing of the
Housing Element Update with the Regional Transportation Plan.1
In response to SB 375, ABAG and MTC developed Plan Bay Area, a long-range integrated
transportation and land use plan for the Bay Area that plans for the projected increase in housing
and employment in the region through 2040. A key element of Plan Bay Area is the designation
of Priority Development Areas (PDAs), locally-designated, transit-accessible areas that are ideal
locations for an increase in residential and commercial development, throughout the region. By
focusing growth in PDAs served by transit and working to make these PDAs more pedestrian- and
bike-friendly, Plan Bay Area aims to reduce the need for automobiles and the associated
greenhouse gas emissions in the region. ABAG and MTC have provided planning grants to
support planning processes in PDAs in cities throughout the Bay Area, including Concord.
1 There are some exceptions to the eight-year planning period, but none apply to Concord during the current update
cycle.

Related Ongoing Planning Efforts
Concord is currently in the process of implementing plans for two key areas of the City: Downtown
Concord, which provides infill and transit-oriented development opportunities, and the Concord
Community Reuse Area, which is the portion of the former Concord Naval Weapons Station that is
within Concord city limits.
Downtown Specific Plan
In June 2014, Concord adopted a specific plan for the City’s downtown, which centers on Todos
Santos Plaza and is adjacent to one of the City’s two BART stations. The Downtown Specific Plan
Area is one of the many PDAs that have been established in Bay Area jurisdictions in pursuit of SB
375 and Plan Bay Area.
The Downtown Specific Plan plans for:
        4,020 new housing units, consisting of 3,500 apartments, 220 townhomes, and 300 live-
         work lofts;
        1.6 million square feet of office space; and
        743,200 square feet of retail space.
The Downtown Concord PDA is expected to be a key site for housing development in Concord
during 2014-2022 Housing Element planning period and further into Concord’s future.
Concord Community Reuse Area
The Concord Community Reuse Area consists of the 5,000-acre portion of the former Concord
Naval Weapons Station that falls within Concord City limits. The completed plan for the Reuse
Area calls for:
        12,270 housing units, 25 percent of which will be affordable to lower-income households,
         and facilities for homeless and transitional housing;
        6.1 million square feet of commercial space; and
        3,501 acres of parks and open space.
The Community Reuse Area is a key long-term development site that is anticipated to be a
significant factor in shaping future phases of the City’s development, including future Housing
Element Update cycles. However, it is not expected that the ongoing environmental remediation
and conveyance processes, which must take place prior to development, will be completed during
the 2014-2022 Housing Element Update cycle, making it unlikely that residential development
will take place at the Reuse Area during this planning period.
                                                    3

Housing Element Contents
The Housing Element is required by State law to include:
        An assessment of existing housing needs—with an analysis of housing affordability,
         conditions, special needs and affordable units at-risk of converting to market-rate—as
         well as projected needs as laid out in the RHNA;
        A detailed sites inventory and analysis that evaluates the jurisdiction’s ability to
         accommodate its RHNA;
        An analysis of constraints on housing in the jurisdiction;
        Housing programs that identify adequate sites to accommodate the City's share of the
         regional housing need; assisting in the development of housing for very low- and low-
         income households; removing or mitigating governmental constraints to affordable
         housing; conserving and improving the existing affordable housing stock; promoting
         equal housing opportunity; and preserving the at-risk units identified; and
        Quantified objectives that estimate the maximum number of units, by income level, to
         be constructed, rehabilitated and conserved over the planning period of the element.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Concord 2030 General Plan was adopted in 2007 and establishes a long-range plan for
urban development through the year 2030. The Plan includes a number of key themes and
initiatives, such as the integration of economic development into land use planning, greater
support for mixed use development and transport-supportive land uses around BART and
transportation corridors, and an emphasis on preserving environmental resources and community
assets. The Plan includes six elements required by State law, including Land Use,
Transportation/Circulation, Open Space, Conservation, Noise, and Safety. It also includes four
optional elements, including Economic Vitality, Growth Management, Parks, and Public Facilities
and Utilities.
This Housing Element is intended to serve as the seventh required element of the General Plan.
It takes into consideration new land use designations and other policies in the Plan to ensure
consistency between it and other Plan elements.
Information Sources
The Housing Element incorporates data from numerous sources, including the United States
Census; the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG); the State of California Departments of
Finance (DOF) and Housing and Community Development (HCD); and private demographic and
real estate data vendors. Data provided by the Census Bureau include 2000 and 2010 decennial
Census data as well as data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS publishes
estimates of demographic conditions based on statistical sampling conducted continuously over
one-year, three-year, and five-year periods, depending on the type of data and size of the
                                                     4

geography being sampled.2 While these data cannot represent conditions at a specific point in
time, as in the previous decennial censuses, they are updated on an annual basis and do offer a
valuable means to compare characteristics across geographies. Wherever possible, data from
the City or County were used to facilitate an understanding of local needs and conditions.
Public Outreach
In preparing the Housing Element, the City of Concord conducted a number of public
outreach efforts to ensure the sharing of information and ideas between elected and
appointed officials, City staff, the planning consultants, and residents. The City’s public
outreach efforts have included the following:
        Regular meetings and workshops with the City Council and the Planning Commission;
        Coordination with the City’s Downtown Specific Plan process, which included meetings to
         solicit public input including three public workshops and two recent Planning Commission
         hearings on May 7 and May 21, 2014;
        Focus Group meetings with representatives from regional non-profit and market-rate
         housing developers and housing advocacy groups, conducted on November 20, 2013 and
         January 28, 2014 at the Concord Library to begin to identify strategies to facilitate the
         development of housing affordable to households at all income levels and housing for
         special needs populations in Concord;
        An online survey that allowed residents and non-residents to provide input on Concord’s
         current and future housing needs;
        Publication and circulation of the draft Housing Element for public review and comment
         in July 2014;
        City Council and Planning Commission Study Session on April 8, 2014, Planning
         Commission Public Hearing on June 4, 2014, and City Council Public Hearing on July 8,
         2014, all of which were attended by residents, business owners, housing advocacy groups
         and other stakeholders.
In addition to this outreach, City staff posted information about the Housing Element Update
on the City website. Altogether, a multi-faceted approach was used to ensure the
community’s full participation.
Review by State HCD
State law requires every updated Housing Element be submitted to California’s HCD to ensure
compliance with the State’s minimum requirements. This ‘certification’ process is unique
among the General Plan elements.
2 This data source replaces the information obtained in previous Censuses from the “long form” questionnaire. For
more information on the ACS, see www.census.gov/acs/www/about_the_survey/american_community_survey/
                                                             5

Housing Elements are submitted twice to HCD for review and comment: once during
development of the Housing Element (in draft form), and again after adoption of the Housing
Element by the local jurisdiction. The first review period requires 60 days and must take
place prior to the adoption deadline. The second review requires 90 days and takes place
after the adoption deadline. It is after the second review that written findings regarding
compliance are submitted to the local government.
The City submitted an initial draft of this Housing Element Update to HCD for a 60-day review in
August 2014. After an initial review of the document, HCD staff provided preliminary comments
on the draft in September 2014. The City revised the Housing Element to address the comments
and submitted the revised draft to HCD on October 1, 2014. On October 7, 2014, HCD issued a
letter to the City stating that the revised Housing Element meets the statutory requirements of
State Housing Element law. City staff will bring the revised Housing Element to Planning
Commission for consideration in November 2014 and will bring the document to City Council in
January 2015 to recommend adoption.
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, an initial study was prepared for the Housing
Element Update and the City circulated a Notice of Intent to adopt a negative declaration on the
Draft Housing Element dated August 1, 2014. The environmental document will be considered
concurrently with the review and adoption of the Housing Element Update.
                                                     6
2. HOUSING NEEDS ANALYSIS
The purpose of the Housing Needs Assessment is to describe housing, economic, and
demographic conditions in Concord, assess the demand for housing for households at all income
levels, and document the demand for housing to serve various special needs populations. The
Housing Needs Assessment is intended to assist Concord in developing housing goals and
formulating policies and programs that address existing and anticipated local housing needs. To
provide context for the data presented on Concord, similar data are provided for Contra Costa
County and, where appropriate, for the Bay Area.
Population and Demographics
The type and amount of housing needed in a community is largely determined by population
growth and various demographic variables. Factors such as population size, age, race, and
occupation can be used to analyze the effectiveness of existing housing policies and provide a
general direction and focus for future housing initiatives. The following section provides
background on demographic trends in Concord and Contra Costa County, followed by an analysis
of housing trends.
Population
Concord’s population has grown at an average rate of one percent annually for several decades.
In 1980, Concord had a population of just 101,800, but its population reached 121,800 in 2000.
Growth between 1980 and 2000 was primarily driven by immigration due to the City’s proximity to
job centers and the availability of housing. In 2012, the population was estimated at 124,717, a
two percent increase since 2000. In contrast, both the County as a whole and the nine-county
Bay Area have experienced significantly faster growth of 14 percent and 8 percent, respectively,
over the same time period. However, growth projections suggest an anticipated reversal of this
trend, with Concord growing at a considerably faster rate than the County and region over the next
30 years. Projections are discussed in greater detail below.

Race and Ethnicity
Data on the racial and ethnic backgrounds of Concord residents indicate that the City is becoming
increasingly diverse. According to the US Census, in 2000 the majority of Concord residents (61
                                                             7

percent) were White, 22 percent were of Latino or Hispanic origin, and nine percent were Asian.
By 2012, the White proportion of the population decreased to 45 percent, while the Hispanic
population increased to 30 percent of the population and the Asian population increased to 13
percent of the population. Trends were similar Countywide, where a decrease in the White
population (from 58 percent of the population in 2000 to 47 percent of the population in 2012)
was met by increases in the populations of Hispanic/Latino and Asian origin. Like many other
cities in California, Concord is likely to become more diverse over the course of the Housing
Element period and in coming decades.

Age
Concord’s population is aging over time, though at a relatively slow rate. Between 2000 and
2012, the median age increased from 35 to 36 in Concord, while the median age in the County
increased from 36 to 39. The comparatively small increase in median age in Concord was due
largely to an increase in the City’s population between the age of 21 and 34, which increased
from 21 percent of the population in 2000 to 23 percent in 2012. Countywide, the population
between the age of 21 and 34 decreased from 23 percent in 2000 and to 17 percent in 2012.
The City’s population over the age of 65 also increased slightly during this time period, from 11
percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2012, but at a much slower rate than in the County overall,
where the population over the age of 65 increased from 10 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in
2012. Meanwhile, there was a decline in the population under the age of 21. This cohort
represented 29 percent of the population in 2000 and 25 percent in 2012. Table 3 shows the
age distribution in 2000 and 2012 for both the City and the County.

These data demonstrate that Concord has attracted a large share of young adults in recent years,
many of whom are likely to have slightly lower incomes than their older counterparts. During the
Housing Element planning period, many of Concord’s young residents may seek to purchase a
first home in Concord and be in need of affordable homeownership options or down payment
assistance.
Educational Attainment
Concord residents tend to have slightly lower levels of educational attainment than residents of
the County. In 2012, 87 percent of Concord residents age 25 and older had graduated from high
school, compared to 89 percent of residents 25 and older in Contra Costa County overall.
Furthermore, 31 percent of Concord residents 25 and older had a bachelor degree, compared to
39 percent of Contra Costa County residents 25 and older. The comparatively low proportion of
Concord residents with a bachelor degree could be due in part to the relatively young age of the
City’s residents. These educational attainment statistics are shown in Table 4.

Employment Characteristics
Employment types, income levels, and other factors determine the type of housing residents can
afford, while the unemployment rate is an indicator of the level of housing assistance needed.
Employment and income levels are generally the function of regional growth or decline, which
depends on factors beyond City control. However, an understanding of how Concord is fairing
among peer cities is helpful in allocating resources and formulating housing policies.
Employment Trends
Table 5 shows the number of jobs and employed residents in Concord and Contra Costa County in
2007 and 2012. “Jobs” are defined as employment for which the workplace location is within the
City, while “Employed Residents” includes all employed residents, whether or not they work within
the City.
Similar to many other areas, Concord experienced job losses during the recent recession. As
shown in Table 5, there was a 22 percent decrease in the number of jobs located in Concord
between 2007 and 2012. Countywide, the decrease in employment was less substantial, totaling
six percent between 2007 and 2012. Despite decreases in the number of jobs in Concord and
Contra Costa County, the decline in the number of employed residents was minimal, totaling less
than one percent in the City and County.
Both Concord and Contra Costa County have a net outflow of workers, with more employed
residents than jobs, which is consistent with Concord’s history as a primarily residential city with
larger-scale employment added over the past few decades. The recent decline in the number of
jobs and relative stability in the number of employed residents have resulted in a lower ratio of
jobs to employed residents in 2012 than in 2007. In Concord, the ratio of jobs to employed
residents decreased from 0.80 in 2007 to 0.63 in 2012. In Contra Costa County, the ratio of jobs
to employed residents decreased from 0.70 in 2007 to 0.66 in 2012.

Figure 1 shows the unemployment rate in Concord and Contra Costa County between 2003 and
October 2013. Throughout this period, the unemployment rate in Concord was slightly higher
than the unemployment rate in Contra Costa County overall, by a difference of less than one
percentage point. In both areas, the unemployment rate peaked in 2010, reaching 12 percent in
Concord and 11 percent in Contra Costa County. The unemployment rate has decreased in each
subsequent year, falling to eight percent in Concord and seven percent in Contra Costa County by
October 2013. However, the unemployment rate has not yet returned to pre-recession levels,
indicating that there is a continuing need for housing assistance and emergency support services
to help unemployed and otherwise economically disadvantaged residents.

Employment Projections
According to ABAG projections, Concord is expected to experience significant growth in
employment between 2010 and 2040. As shown in Table 6, ABAG estimates that there will be a
46 percent increase in the number of jobs in Concord between 2010 and 2040. During the same
                                                               11
period, employment is expected to increase by 36 percent in Contra Costa County and 33 percent
in the Bay Area overall.
Employment growth is expected to occur at a faster rate during the first ten years of the projection
period (2010-2020) than in the subsequent twenty years. Concord is expected to gain over
11,000 jobs between 2010 and 2020, at an average rate of over 1,100 jobs per year, and slightly
less than 11,000 jobs between 2020 and 2040, at an average rate of approximately 500 jobs
per year. Contra Costa County and the Bay Area are expected to have a similar growth pattern,
with large employment increases between 2010 and 2020, and more moderate employment
increases between 2020 and 2040.

Household Characteristics
Household type and size, income levels, and other household characteristics determine the type
of housing needed by residents. This section details various household characteristics affecting
housing needs.
Household Types and Sizes
The US Census defines a household as any group of people who occupy a housing unit, including
families, single people, or unrelated persons sharing living quarters. Persons living in licensed
facilities, retirement homes, or dormitories are not considered households. Household
characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a community.
Between 2000 and 2012, Concord experienced a minor increase in the total number of
households from 44,020 to 44,634. The percentage of households consisting of families
remained nearly constant at 68 percent. Most of the non-family households in Concord are
comprised of households with people living alone, as discussed in more detail below.
From 2000 to 2012, the average household size increased slightly from 2.74 to 2.77 persons per
household. The average household size increased more significantly in Contra Costa County
overall, growing from 2.72 persons per household in 2000 to 2.81 persons per households in
2012.
                                                            12

Larger household sizes in 2012 may be due in part to lingering effect of the recession, as
unemployment and underemployment caused some individuals and families to live with friends,
relatives, or roommates rather than form new households. As a result, Concord household sizes
may begin to contract a bit as the economy continues to improve. However, some growth in
household size may be due to the increasing diversity of the City’s population and the higher
prevalence of multi-generational households among many cultures, particularly some Asian and
Hispanic cultures. Table 7 shows the number of households and household size from 2000 to
2012 for the City of Concord, the County, and the Bay Area.

Despite the increase in average household size, single-person households became increasingly
common between 2000 and 2012 in both Concord and Contra Costa County. The percentage of
non-family households composed of single individuals increased from 75 percent of the total
number of non-family households in 2000 to 80 percent in 2012. Countywide, the number of
single-person households increased from 77 percent of non-family households in 2000 to 81
percent of non-family households in 2012.

Household Income
Median household income represents the mid-point in income for all households in the City, with
half earning more and half earning less. According to the American Community Survey, Concord
households tend to have lower annual incomes than the County and region. In 2012, the median
annual household income for Concord was approximately $64,000, compared to $74,000 in
Contra Costa County and $76,000 in the Bay Area overall.

To determine eligibility for housing programs, both federal and State governments categorize
households according to their income in comparison to the area median income (AMI). The AMI is
the median household income for a defined geographic area, as determined by the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The following income groups are the
standard categories used:
                                   Extremely low-income= 30 percent of AMI or less;
                                   Very low-income = 31 to 50 percent of AMI;
                                   Low-income = 51 to 80 percent of AMI;
                                   Moderate-income = 81 to 120 percent of AMI; and
                                   Above moderate-income = above 120 percent of AMI.
California began requesting analysis of households defined as extremely low-income beginning in
the third revision of the Housing Element. While a city is not obligated to include a separate
category for extremely low-income households in its Housing Element, the Housing Element as a
whole must analyze the obstacles and needs for this category and include proposed actions and
programs to meet those needs.
Figure 2 shows the 2012 Concord household income distribution by AMI level for a three-person
household in Contra Costa County. As shown, more than half of all Concord households have an
income that is moderate or higher, and 30 percent of Concord households have above-moderate
incomes. The remaining 44 percent of Concord households have low, very low, or extremely low
incomes, and many of these households may have difficulty affording housing, as discussed in
greater detail in a subsequent section of this Needs Assessment.

Table 10 presents median household income data for Concord and selected Contra Costa County
jurisdictions in 2000 and 2013. The data show that Concord has a lower household income than
all of the selected peer cities. Moreover, Concord households experienced a smaller amount of
income growth than most of the peer cities between 2000 and 2013. While the median
household income grew by 10 percent in Concord, the median household income grew by 14
percent in Martinez, 25 percent in Walnut Creek, and 16 percent in Contra Costa County overall.
The exception among the peer cities was Pleasant Hill, where the median household income
increased by only 7 percent between 2000 and 2013.

Household Projections
Similar to the employment projections shown in Table 6, household projections suggest
significant growth in Concord between 2010 and 2040. Based on the ABAG projections shown in
Table 11, the number of households in Concord is expected to increase by 43 percent between
2010 and 2040, at an annual rate of 1.2 percent. This projected household growth rate exceeds
the projected growth rate between 2010 and 2040 in Contra Costa County (24 percent) and the
Bay Area overall (27 percent), as well as the growth rate in Concord between 2000 and 2012 (0.1
percent annually).
In contrast to the projected employment trends, household projections for Concord suggest that
growth will be moderate during the first ten years of the projection period (2010-2020) and will
increase during the next 20 years (2020-2040). Concord is expected to gain slightly more than
200 households per year on average between 2010 and 2020 and more than 800 households
per year on average between 2020 and 2040. This projected increase in household growth after
2020 may coincide with development of the Concord Community Reuse Area.

Housing Stock
Housing types, age, vacancy rates, conditions, and other factors affecting housing stock
determine if the current supply of housing is in good condition or in adequate supply for residents.
This section will examine various housing stock characteristics that affect the living environment
of Concord residents.
Housing Types
According to the California Department of Finance, detached single-family homes make up the
majority of residential units in Concord, comprising about 58 percent of the total housing stock in
2013 (Table 12). Multifamily apartments with more than five units are the next most common
type, comprising about 24 percent of the housing stock. The composition of the housing stock in
Concord changed between 2000 and 2013, with significant increases in the number of units in
buildings with two to four units, as well as mobile homes. Overall, there was a five percent
increase in housing units in Concord during this period. In Contra Costa County overall, the
number of units increased by 14 percent.

Residential Building Permit Trends
Building permit data for Concord demonstrate that building permit activity decreased
substantially during the recession and has not yet returned to pre-recession levels. Between
2000 and 2007, the City issued permits for 226 units per year on average. In 2008 and 2009,
building permit activity was less robust, and Concord issued permits for 57 units and 69 units,
respectively. There was almost no building permit activity between 2010 and 2012, during which
the City issued permits for a total of six units. Building permit activity increased slightly in 2013,
with a total of 20 units permitted. On average, 140 units per year were permitted in Concord
between 2000 and 2013.
A sizable share of the units recently permitted in Concord has consisted of multifamily units.
Among units permitted in Concord between 2000 and 2013, 39 percent were in multifamily
properties. In contrast, only 21 percent of units permitted in Contra Costa County between 2000
and 2013 were in multifamily properties.

Housing Age and Condition
Housing age is an important indicator of the condition of Concord’s housing stock. Homes and
structures weather with use and deteriorate with time. If they are not properly maintained, units
can deteriorate quickly and become eyesores or potential sources of danger. This directly affects
                                                                18

property prices and the quality of life of city residents. A city with an older housing stock will have
to budget more for preservation assistance, home repair costs, and energy requirements. Thus,
improving and maintaining housing quality is an important goal for the City.
Concord’s housing stock is aging. As shown in Table 14, in the year 2011, more than half of the
existing homes in Concord had been built before 1970, and 26 percent had been built before
1960. However, although one in four units in Concord is more than 43 years old, the majority are
owner-occupied units, which tend to be better maintained than renter-occupied units.

City staff occasionally conducts windshield surveys in the City to assess the age and condition of
Concord’s housing stock. Based on the most recent survey conducted by the Community
Development Department, the City estimates that approximately 37 percent of the housing units
in the City are in need of minor rehabilitation, 2 percent are in need of major rehabilitation, and 1
percent are in need of replacement. Table 15 summarizes these estimates. The Monument
Corridor area is of particular concern with respect to housing units in need of rehabilitation or
replacement.

In addition to identifying housing in need of rehabilitation through inspections and windshield
surveys, the City provides loans as well as information on housing maintenance. Efforts in recent
years include the City’s Neighborhood Code Enforcement and Multifamily Housing Inspection
Program (MFHIP) and loans and grants through the Housing Rehabilitation Loan and Grant
Program (for single family homes and mobile homes) and Multifamily Rehabilitation Loan
Program. In 2004, Concord added a self-certification option to the MFHIP, which provides an
incentive for property owners to conduct a self-inspection of their property prior to the City
performing a 20 percent random unit inspection. As a result of this program, many property
owners have become more accountable and have taken proactive measures to monitor and
maintain older properties. The program requires property owners to inspect their buildings on an
annual basis and that the property meets or exceeds the standards identified on the City’s self-
certification inspection list.
Many homes built before 1978 are at risk of containing lead-based paint, and as seen in Table
14, more than half of all homes in Concord were built prior to 1978. Lead can cause brain and
nervous system damage in young children who can ingest deteriorated interior or exterior lead-
based paint either intentionally or inadvertently through normal play activities. To address this
issue, the City recently implemented a three-year Lead-based Hazard Program (ending in the
2010-2011 fiscal year) funded by a 1.4 million HUD grant to provide grants to home owners with
lead-based paint. The program provided training to 55 private construction contractors as well as
building inspectors and other government staff members on technical and lead construction skills
and resulted in the remediation of lead-based paint hazards in 45 homes. In addition, the
program included over 30 workshop presentations that provided educational outreach to over
200 residents, distributed over 2,500 pieces of educational literature to hundreds of additional
individuals at the workshops and 25 other public events. Parents with young children, community
healthcare and social service providers, real estate professionals, and landlord groups learned
about general lead poisoning awareness, treatment, and prevention, such as lead paint hazard
control (remediation) activities.
Additionally, the City provides a Housing Rehabilitation Loan and Grant program for qualified low
income households, including single-family repair loans, mobile home repair loans, multifamily
housing repair loans, emergency repair and accessibility grants and weatherization and home
security grants for seniors. The program has been significantly reduced due to the loss of
Redevelopment funds and is currently limited to the use of Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) funds. Typically grants are provided for emergency repairs for amounts of between $500
and $2,000, and loan amounts of up to $55,000 for eligible homeowners. During the prior cycle,
the City provided 162 loans and grants based on Redevelopment and CDBG funds and an
additional 65 lead-based paint repair grants through a grant the City received from HUD. The City
currently coordinates with a non-profit organization, Hello Housing, to administer loans and grants
with the City’s funding.

Housing Tenure and Vacancy
Although the majority of housing units in Concord are owner-occupied, the City has a sizable and
growing renter-occupied housing stock. In 2000, 63 percent of occupied units in Concord were
owner-occupied and 37 percent were renter-occupied. By 2012, the share of owner-occupied
units had decreased to 57 percent of occupied units. The share of owner-occupied units also
decreased Countywide, from 69 percent in 2000 to 64 percent in 2012. However, the County
had a lower share of renter-occupied units relative to the City. Tenure data for Concord and
Contra Costa County are shown in Table 16.

Residential vacancy in Concord has increased somewhat since the 2000 US Census. While 98
percent of residential units in Concord were occupied in 2000, ACS data collected between 2010
and 2012 indicate that the occupancy rate had fallen to 93 percent. Trends were similar in the
County overall, where the occupancy rate decreased from 97 percent in 2000 to 93 percent
according to 2010-2012 ACS data. However, gross occupancy figures overstate the number of
units available for occupancy, because a portion of vacant units are held for seasonal or
recreational use, are rented or sold but not occupied, or are otherwise not available for rent or
sale. According to 2010-2012 ACS data, the for-sale vacancy rate was one percent in Concord
and two percent in Contra Costa County and the rental vacancy rate was six percent in the City
and County. A five percent vacancy is typically considered necessary to assure adequate choice
and temper the rise in housing costs.

Foreclosure Trends
Despite a spike in foreclosures at the start of the recent recession, Concord’s foreclosure rate has
steadily declined over the past five years, and has now returned to low pre-recession levels.
Figure 3 shows the number of foreclosures per 1,000 households per quarter in Concord and
Contra Costa County between the fourth quarter of 2004 and the third quarter of 2013. As
shown, the peak in foreclosures in Concord during this period occurred in the second quarter of
2008, when there were approximately eight foreclosures for every 1,000 households in the City
(355 total foreclosures in the quarter). The foreclosure rate dropped significantly in the fourth
quarter of 2008, but remained at approximately five foreclosures per 1,000 households per
quarter through most of 2009, 2010, and 2011. However, the foreclosure rate has steadily
decreased since the first quarter of 2012. In the third quarter of 2013, there were just 0.5
foreclosures per 1,000 households in Concord, the same foreclosure rate as in the fourth quarter
of 2006. Together with decreasing unemployment rates, these figures suggest an ongoing
recovery from the recent recession among Concord households.
                                                                 22

Housing Cost and Affordability
The Department of Housing and Urban Development defines affordable housing as housing for
which the owner or tenant pays less than 30 percent of the household income. The cost of
housing vis-à-vis income directly impacts the degree of affordability. If housing costs are high
relative to income, there will be a correspondingly higher prevalence of borrowing in the case of
home owners, and overpayment in the case of renters. Overcrowding also increases as people
turn to sharing homes and apartments to reduce housing costs. Furthermore, households with
unaffordable housing costs will have less income available to spend elsewhere, and may have
difficulty affording food, healthcare, transportation, or other goods and services. This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of Concord’s housing stock.
As in the rest of the Bay Area, home prices and rents increased substantially in Concord from the
late 1990s to early 2000s until the start of the recession in 2008. Median sales price trends
from recent years are summarized in Figure 4 and comparative median price data from Concord
and surrounding communities is shown in Table 18.
Ownership Housing
Concord home sale prices decreased significantly during the recession and have not yet returned
to pre-recession levels, though prices have demonstrated a recent increase. According to data
from DataQuick, the median home sale price in Concord decreased substantially from $525,000
in 2005 to $227,500 in 2011, a 57 percent decrease over six years. The median sale price
increased slightly in 2012 to $260,000, and increased more substantially to $350,000 in 2013.
More recent data suggest a continuation of this trend, with a median sale price of $390,000 in
March 2014. The median home sale price in Contra Costa County mirrored this trend, but
remained slightly higher than the Concord median throughout this period. The median home sale
price in Concord and Contra Costa County between 2005 and March 2014 is shown in Figure 4.
                                                                                                                23

Median sale price data for Concord and other nearby communities suggest that Concord is among
the more affordable cities in the area with respect to housing costs. Table 18 shows the median
home sale price in Concord and the neighboring cities of Martinez, Pleasant Hill, and Walnut
Creek, as well as in Contra Costa County, in September 2012 and September 2013. In
September 2013, the median sale price in Concord ($385,000) was lower than the median in
almost all of the comparison jurisdictions. The exception was Martinez, where the median was
three percent lower than the Concord median. The relative affordability of Concord in relation to
many neighboring cities is likely one factor that has attracted young adults to the City in recent
years, as discussed above.
However, the median sale price in Concord has demonstrated substantial recent growth,
increasing by 43 percent between September 2012 and September 2013. Meanwhile, the
increase in median sale price increased by 14 to 27 percent in the comparison jurisdictions,
lagging the Concord growth rate. These data indicate that Concord could be entering a strong
housing market recovery period.
While a recovery in the housing market has a positive impact on existing homeowners and the
City’s property tax base, an increase in housing costs also results in a decrease in housing
affordability for potential new home buyers, particularly potential first-time homeowners. Despite
relatively low recent home sale prices, the cost of homeownership continues to exceed the
affordability threshold for many lower-income households. Housing affordability is analyzed in
further detail below.

Data on recent home sales in Concord demonstrate a substantial difference between the price of
condominiums relative to the price of single family homes, with condominiums providing a
significantly more affordable homeownership opportunity. Table 19 shows data on single family
homes and condominiums sold between July and October 2013. The median sale price for a
condominium sold during this period was $182,000, 43 percent of the median single-family
home sale price ($422,500). Moreover, only 15 percent of single family homes sold for less than
$300,000, compared to 86 percent of condominiums.

Rental Housing
Housing costs for renters in Concord are among the lowest in the County, similar to the City’s
ranking in the for-sale market. As of the third quarter of 2013, the average asking rent in
Concord was $1,350 per month, according to data provided by RealFacts, which tracks rental
properties with 50 units or more. Average monthly asking rents were four to 34 percent higher in
Martinez ($1,409), Pleasant Hill ($1,615), Walnut Creek ($1,805), and Contra Costa County
overall ($1,525).

Despite a slight decrease during the recent recession, rent and occupancy rates in Concord have
increased progressively over time. Data from RealFacts indicate that rental rates decreased in
2009 following steady increases between 2005 and 2008. However, rents increased significantly
in 2011, surpassing pre-recession levels, and further increased through the third quarter of 2013.
As of the third quarter of 2013, the average asking rent in Concord was $1,320 per month.
Occupancy trends followed a similar pattern, remaining high (95 to 97 percent) between 2005
and 2008, dropping in 2009 to 93 percent, and returning to pre-recession levels by 2011. As of
the third quarter of 2013, the rental occupancy rate in Concord was 96.5 percent, according to
RealFacts, potentially indicating a tight rental market with limited opportunities for households
seeking rental housing in the City.

Although the data provided above demonstrate that housing costs in Concord are lower than most
surrounding cities, housing costs exceed the affordability threshold for many of Concord’s
households. Using the standard that no more than approximately 30% of a household’s income
                                                                  27

should be devoted to housing costs, a household earning the Concord median household income
($64,000 per year) can afford a home purchase price of up to $287,000, which is approximately
75 percent of the September 2013 median home sale price in Concord. Rental housing is
somewhat more affordable; the average rental rate in Concord ($1,350 per month) is affordable
to households earning $54,000 per year, which is less than the Concord median income.
However, there is a limited supply of rental units affordable to lower-income households in
Concord, particularly households with extremely low or very low incomes.
Affordability
Housing is typically considered affordable if total housing costs do not exceed 30 percent of
household income. Accordingly, the affordability of a housing unit is typically defined based on
the AMI level needed to afford rent or mortgage payments along with any other housing costs,
including taxes, insurance, utilities, or homeowners’ association fees.
Table 21 lists the 2013 income limits for households in Contra Costa County, as determined by
the California Department of Housing and Community Development based on HUD data. These
calculations establish the maximum affordable housing payments for households of different
sizes, which are also shown in the table, and their eligibility for various kinds of housing
assistance. Because household income and size vary, the price which is considered “affordable”
for each household size also varies. For example, a large family with one wage-earner can afford
a different type of housing than a double-income household with no children.

Extremely Low-Income Households: Extremely low-income households earn 30 percent or less of
the County median income. As shown in the table above, a three-person household with an
annual income of $25,250 is considered extremely low-income, and can afford to pay $631 per
month for housing costs. Based on the average rental costs in Concord shown in Table 20,
extremely low-income households are not able to afford market rate rental units in Concord.
                                                            28

Affordable housing for this group is limited to rental housing or housing offered by the City, Contra
Costa County Consortium,3 or nonprofit housing developers.
Very Low-Income Households: Very low-income households earn 30-50 percent of the County
median income. A three-person household with an annual income totaling $42,100 is considered
very low-income, and can afford to pay $1,053 per month for housing costs. Similar to extremely
low-income households, very low-income households are unlikely to find affordable market rate
housing in Concord, and are likely to need considerable housing assistance from the City, Contra
Costa County Consortium, or nonprofit housing developers.
Low-Income Households: Low-income households earn 50-80 percent of the County median
income. A three-person household earning $59,600 per year is considered low-income, and can
afford to pay $1,490 per month for housing costs. Unlike extremely low- and very low-income
households, low-income households are able to afford the average rent for market rate units in
Concord shown in Table 20, and some may be able to afford mortgage costs on some of the
lower-cost homes in the City. Nonetheless, many may have difficulty finding a suitable unit that is
affordable, and many more are likely to have difficultly affording the down payment needed to
purchase a home.
Moderate-Income Households: Moderate-income households earn between 80-120 percent of
the County median income. A three-person household with an annual income totaling $101,000
per year is considered moderate-income, and can afford to pay $2,525 per month for housing
costs. Unlike households in the lower income groups, moderate-income households are likely
able to afford many of the market-rate rental units in the City along with some market-rate
condominiums and single family homes. Many may rent homes while they save up for a down
payment for a home or may rent out of choice.
The following chart shows households of various sizes and AMI levels, and includes occupations
that would typically support each household type.
3 The Contra Costa County Consortium is the primary planning agency charged with providing affordable housing and
supporting the homeless in Concord. It is formed by a partnership of four cities Concord, Antioch, Pittsburg, and Walnut
Creek.

owner households that do not experience cost burden typically own their homes outright and are
therefore not responsible for mortgage payments, and are often senior households that have
been living in the same home for many years. Overall, about 21,400 households in all income
categories in Concord experience housing cost burden.

“At Risk” Housing
California Government Code Section 65583 requires that housing elements include an inventory
of all assisted rental housing units within the local jurisdiction that are at risk of converting to
market rate or being converted to other uses within ten years of the beginning of the Housing
Element Planning period (i.e. between 2014 and 2024 for the 2014-2022 Housing Element
Update cycle). Units are generally considered to be at risk of conversion if the subsidies that
allow units to be rented at a designated affordability level or the restrictions requiring affordability
are set to expire. In all, there are a total of 1,093 units at risk of conversion in Concord.
Information on affordable units at risk of conversion to market rate was provided by the California
Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC), which provided information on units funded through
federal housing programs and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), and the City of Concord,
which provided information on units funded through the City’s RDA. CHPC is a private, nonprofit
organization created by the California Legislature in 1987 to assist nonprofit and government
                                                             31

housing agencies to create, acquire, and preserve housing affordable to lower income
households. Many affordable housing projects on these lists received funding from multiple
sources, often with different expiration dates. Many of the projects that received funding from the
Concord Redevelopment Agency have expiration dates tied to the RDA funding that significantly
exceed the expiration dates tied to other funding sources, thereby extending the affordability
restrictions for these units beyond the expiration dates set by other funding sources. In total,
there are 12 housing developments in Concord with a total of 1,093 units with affordability
restrictions that are set to expire by 2024. These projects are shown in Table 24.
Of the developments shown in Table 24, two are currently in the process of potential conversions
to market rate. The owner of the California Apartments has sent notices to the nine households
that occupy affordable units in the development, and conversion of those units to market rates is
anticipated to occur prior to adoption of this Housing Element Update. The Phoenix Apartments is
currently on the market, and the City has been engaged in ongoing discussions with a potential
buyer to encourage an extension of affordability for the 11 affordable senior units in the project.
The City has attempted to contact the owners of the remaining properties shown in Table 24 as
part of this Housing Element Update process, and will continue these outreach efforts. Owners of
two of these properties (Sunridge Apartments and Jordon Court II) have indicated that they are
willing to discuss a potential extension of affordability with City staff, but have not decided
whether affordability will be maintained. Although the affordability restrictions for Sunridge
Apartments expired in May 2014, the owner currently continues to operate the project as an
affordable development.

Cost of Replacement vs. Preservation
In addition to quantifying the number of assisted units at risk of conversion, jurisdictions must
evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of preserving the affordability of the existing at-risk units
versus replacing the at-risk units with new affordable units. Although costs vary considerably
between projects, Table 25 provides an estimated range of the costs for replacing or preserving
at-risk housing units. Per-unit preservation costs were estimated based on multifamily properties
in Concord that have recently sold or are currently on the market, and rehabilitation costs were
estimated as a percentage of acquisition costs. Construction costs for replacement units were
estimated based on per-square-foot construction costs for recently-constructed multifamily
projects in the Bay Area. Land acquisition costs were assumed to range from zero (assuming a
land donation or use of City-owned land) to $45 per square foot. The high end of this range was
based on recent residential land sales and residential land currently offered for sale in Concord
and the surrounding area. Per-unit land costs are estimated using an assumed project density,
with lower-density projects having a higher per-unit land cost.
Based on these estimates, acquisition and rehabilitation costs are likely to range between
approximately $207,000 and $345,000 per unit, while replacement costs are likely to vary
between $242,000 and $403,000 per unit. As shown in Table 25, the costs associated with
preservation or replacement of all 1,093 at-risk units in Concord are substantial, estimated at
$226 million to $377 million to acquire and rehabilitate all units or $265 million to $440 million
to replace all units. While it is unlikely that Concord will have the resources to preserve or replace
all of these units in the event of possible conversions to market rate, the City can work with
nonprofit agencies and other groups with an interest in preserving or developing affordable
housing to maintain the City’s affordable housing inventory.

 Notes:
 (a) Cost of acquisition is based on current multifamily properties for sale in Concord and
 listed on LoopNet on January 8, 2014 along with recent mulifamily property sales in
 Concord. Cost of rehabilitation is assumed to be 50 percent of the cost of acquisition.
 Financing and other costs are assumed to be 15 percent of acquisition plus rehab costs.
 (b) Low estimate of land acquisition cost assumes no land cost due to land donation or use
 of City-owned property. High cost of land acquisition is based on current residential land
 listings in Concord and Martinez as listed on LoopNet on January 9, 2014.
 (c) Residential construction costs are based on RS Means and information on recent
 multifamily projects in the Bay Area.
 Sources: LoopNet, 2014; RS Means, 2013, BAE, 2014.
As can be seen from the estimates, there is considerable potential variation in the cost to
preserve or replace units at risk of conversion, and the extent of rehabilitation needs, land costs,
construction costs, financing costs, density, and other factors should be expected to significantly
impact project costs. Although acquisition and rehabilitation tend to be more cost-effective than
new construction, replacement could be the more economical option in some cases, particularly if
existing at-risk projects have substantial rehabilitation needs. A multifaceted approach will be
needed to address the potential loss of affordability from at-risk units in Concord, including
continuing to provide rental subsidies, helping property owners keep assisted housing affordable
for lower income households, acquiring and rehabilitating units when necessary and possible, and
supporting the development of new affordable units in the City.
Qualified Entities
A “qualified entity” is a nonprofit or for-profit organization or individual that agrees to maintain the
long-term affordability of housing projects. A list of qualified entities for Contra Costa County is
shown in Table 26, based on information from HCD. As information becomes available on
projects that are at risk of conversion to market rate, the City will contact potential qualified
entities to assess their interest in acquiring and managing at-risk properties to replace any
converted units.

3. REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION AND
         SPECIAL NEEDS
Regional Housing Needs Allocation, 2014-2022
Every city and county in the State of California has a legal obligation to ensure it has the
capacity to accommodate its ‘fair share’ of the projected future housing need in the region in which it
is located. For Concord and other Bay Area jurisdictions, the regional housing need is
determined by ABAG, based upon an overall regional housing need number established by
the State. In accordance with State law, ABAG has determined the fair share of the regional housing
need that must be planned for by each jurisdiction during the 2014 to 2022 planning period. That
need is divided into four primary income categories of housing affordability (in accordance with
State law).
Methodology
On July 19, 2013, the ABAG Executive Board adopted the final Regional Housing Need Allocation
(RHNA) methodology for the period between 2014 and 2022. The RHNA methodology for the 2014-
2022 Housing Element Update Cycle differs in a number of ways from the methodology used for
previous cycles. In particular, the new RHNA methodology is meant to align RHNA allocations with
the Bay Area Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy, which was adopted as a key element of Plan Bay
Area in 2012. The following provides a brief overview of the RHNA methodology for the 2014-2022
RHNA cycle. A more detailed explanation is available in the RHNA Methodology Technical
Documentation.
     1. Input from the Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy Housing Distribution. The Jobs-Housing
         Connection Strategy provides household growth projections for Bay Area cities and counties
         in five-year increments between 2010 and 2040, which form the basis for each jurisdiction’s
         RHNA. The Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy input for the RHNA distinguishes between
         growth in PDAs and growth outside of PDAs.
     2. Sustainability Component. Based on the land use distribution specified in Plan Bay Area, 70
         percent of the RHNA for the Bay Area as a whole (131,593 units) is attributed to future
         growth in PDAs and the remaining 30 percent (56,397 units) is attributed to future growth
         outside of PDAs, which is referred to as the sustainability split. These regionwide totals are
         distributed between jurisdictions based on the share of each growth type in each jurisdiction
         as shown in Plan Bay Area. For example, Plan Bay Area shows that PDAs in Concord will
         account for 1.87 percent of PDA housing unit growth in the region. As a result, Concord’s
         projected PDA growth is equal to 2,461 units (131,593 x 1.87% = 2460.8).
     3. RHNA Fair Share Component. The fair share component is intended to ensure that
         jurisdictions with PDAs are not required to assume an unreasonable share of the region’s
         housing need. It is based on three factors:

                Upper Housing Threshold: In some cases, the calculations for the Sustainability
                 Component result in PDA growth equal to 110 percent or more of the jurisdiction's
                 expected household formation growth. These jurisdictions are not assigned
                 additional housing units in excess to the projected PDA growth, and the non-PDA
                 growth that would otherwise be allocated to these jurisdictions is distributed among
                 other jurisdictions in the region. In addition, the total allocation to a jurisdiction (PDA
                 growth and non-PDA growth) cannot exceed 150 percent of its 2007-2014 RHNA.
                Fair Share Factors applied to Non-PDA Areas: Each jurisdiction in the region is ranked
                 and scored based on the following three fair share factors, which are given equal
                 weight in determining growth in non-PDA areas:
                        Past RHNA Performance: Jurisdictions that permitted a smaller share of their
                         RHNA for very low- and low-income units during the 1999-2006 RHNA cycle
                         receive a higher allocation.
                        2010 Employment: Jurisdictions with a higher number of existing jobs outside
                         of PDAs (based on 2010 data) receive a higher allocation.
                        Transit: Jurisdictions with higher transit frequency and coverage receive a
                         higher allocation.
                Minimum Housing Floor. Each jurisdiction is assigned a minimum of 40 percent of
                 household formation growth.
     4. RHNA Income Allocation Adjustment to Jurisdiction’s Total RHNA. The income allocation is
         meant to ensure that each jurisdiction considers the housing needs of households at all
         income levels. To this end, each jurisdiction’s RHNA allocation is divided into the four
         income categories defined by HCD (very low-, low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income).
The income allocation methodology assigns a lower allocation of units in each income category to
jurisdictions with a relatively high proportion of existing households in that category. Meanwhile,
jurisdictions with a relatively low proportion of existing households at a given income level receive a
higher allocation of units in that category. For example, 28 percent of existing households in
Concord are very low-income households, while the regionwide RHNA allocations call for 25 percent
of units to be affordable to very low-income households. Because Concord’s existing share of very
low-income households exceeds the projected share of growth in very low-income households
regionwide, Concord’s share of RHNA allocations in the very low-income category is lower than the
regionwide share of units in the very low-income category.
Concord’s “Fair Share” of the Regional Housing Need
Table 27 summarizes the housing need determinations for all of the jurisdictions in Contra Costa
County during the 2014-2022 update cycle. Concord’s ‘fair share’ of the regional housing need has
been determined to be a total of 3,478 units, distributed among AMI categories as follows:
        798 units affordable to very-low-income households (households earning less than 50
         percent of the median household income);
        444 units affordable to low-income households (households earning between 50 and 80
         percent of the median household income);
                                                     38

           559 units affordable to moderate-income households (households earning between 80 and
            120 percent of the median household income); and
           1,677 units affordable to above-moderate-income households (households earning more
            than 120 percent of the median household income).
Concord’s allocation represents approximately 17 percent of the total Countywide need for new
units, and between 14 and 19 percent of units serving each income category. This represents an
increase in the City’s share of the County’s housing need over the last Housing Element Update
cycle, during which Concord was responsible for 10 to 13 percent of the total Countywide need in
each category.

The income distribution of Concord’s 2014-2022 RHNA is slightly skewed toward the higher end of
the income scale. As shown in Table 28, almost half (48 percent) of Concord’s 2014-2022 RHNA
consists of units for households with above moderate incomes. Countywide, 43 percent of the RHNA
is targeted to above moderate-income households.
Although the RHNA does not include allocations for extremely low-income households (households
earning 30 percent of AMI or less), Housing Element Law requires that jurisdictions estimate the
need for housing units affordable to extremely-low income households and plan to accommodate
this need. Table 28 shows the projected 2014-2022 housing need for Concord, assuming that
extremely low-income households account for half of the need among very low-income households.
                                                           39

As shown, this suggests that there is a need for approximately 399 housing units for extremely low-
income households and 399 housing units for low-income households in Concord between 2014
and 2022.

What the Numbers Mean
The RHNA numbers represent the number of units the City must plan to accommodate between
2014 and 2022. Local jurisdictions need to ensure there is enough land, zoned at the appropriate
densities, for a variety of housing types, including housing units affordable to lower-income
households. However, jurisdictions are not responsible for ensuring construction of housing units.
Further, HCD does not penalize jurisdictions for not constructing all of the units in the RHNA
allocation, as long as the jurisdictions have allocated enough land for the construction of units and
have made a good faith effort through the implementation of housing policies and programs to help
meet the RHNA targets.
Special Housing Needs
In addition to the general housing needs of the population, cities and counties must plan for the
special housing needs of certain groups. For the Housing Element, Government Code (65583(a)(6))
requires that several populations with special housing needs be addressed: people who are
homeless, persons with disabilities (including people with developmental disabilities), female-
headed households, large households, seniors, and farmworker households. To meet the needs of
these groups, Concord must be creative and look to new ways of increasing the supply, diversity, and
affordability of this specialized housing stock.
Homeless Families and Individuals
Homeless individuals and families have perhaps the most immediate housing needs of any group.
They also have one of the most difficult sets of housing needs to meet, due to both the diversity and
complexity of the factors that lead to homelessness, and to community opposition to the siting of
housing that serves homeless clients.
                                                       40
According to Contra Costa County Homeless Program’s 2004 plan “Ending Homelessness in Ten
Years”, the most common reasons for homelessness in the County are: the inability to find a job
because of lack of education or skills, high housing costs in comparison to incomes, and family
disputes. For some, homelessness may also be the result of chronic health problems, physical
disabilities, or substance abuse. While the reasons that lead to homelessness are diverse, there are
generally three categories of homelessness:
        Chronically Homeless: This category is estimated to comprise approximately 40 percent of
         the Contra Costa County population that is homeless on any given night, and more than 10
         percent of those who experience homelessness over the course of a year. Most are either
         severely disabled with a mental health condition, physical illness, or substance abuse
         problem. Though a small percentage of the overall yearly homeless population, the
         chronically homeless use the majority of resources within the homeless service system and
         are costly to tax payers. Unfortunately, this high service cost does not translate into long-
         term gains in stability because most in the group are either unable to leave their homeless
         situation or content to stay in their current state.
        Discharged into Homelessness: This category consists of people who are released from
         public institutions such as jails, mental health programs, drug and alcohol programs, and
         hospitals directly to the streets or shelters. Too often these systems do not engage in pre-
         release permanent housing planning to facilitate the transition back into society. Individuals
         who have serious disabilities without receiving the appropriate assistance often become part
         of the chronic homeless population.
        Transitionally Homeless: Almost 90 percent of those who experience homelessness each
         year belong to the transitionally homeless group. These are first or second time homeless
         persons who lack permanent housing for less than a year. Typically a job loss, injury, or
         eviction causes these families and individuals to become homeless. Most are able to find
         new homes with minimal assistance from the County or non-profit organizations.
The population of unsheltered homeless individuals or families is difficult to quantify because a large
portion of them are transitory in nature. According to the biennial Countywide homeless count
conducted by the Contra Costa County Health Services Department in January 2013, there were 223
unsheltered homeless people in Concord and 1,350 in the County. This represents a decrease from
the 2009 homeless count, which found that there were an estimated 294 unsheltered homeless
people living in Concord and 1,872 unsheltered homeless people living in Contra Costa County.
However, the decrease in the Countywide unsheltered homeless population was met with an
increase of similar magnitude in the sheltered homeless population, resulting in very little change to
the total number of homeless individuals Countywide. Approximately 55 percent of unsheltered
homeless people in Contra Costa County were living in encampments in 2013, which is similar to the
share of the population living in encampments in 2009. Table 29 provides data on the homeless
population in Contra Costa County based on estimates provided in the 2009 and 2013 homeless
counts.

The Homeless Program, Public Health Division of the Contra Costa County Health Services
Department, is the coordinating and primary planning entity for the continuum of homeless services
that are provided within the County. The Homeless Program provides staff support and coordination
for the Contra Costa Interagency Council on Homelessness (CCICH). CCICH is charged with providing
a forum for communication and coordination about the overall implementation of the County's Ten
Year Plan to End Homelessness and providing advice and input on the operations of homeless
services, program operations, and program development efforts. CCICH provides a forum for
orchestrating a vision on ending homelessness in Contra Costa County, educating the community on
homeless issues, and advocating on federal, State, County and City policy issues affecting people
who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness.
The Contra Costa HOME Consortium is the primary planning entity charged with providing affordable
housing in the County (excluding Richmond, which manages its own HOME fund allocation
independently). Formed by a partnership of four cities (Concord, Antioch, Pittsburg, and Walnut
Creek) and the County, the HOME Consortium pools the HOME funds allocated by the federal
government for housing activities. These HOME funds are administered by the County and allocated
to qualifying affordable housing projects as they are proposed in all jurisdictions. The availability of
affordable housing, especially for households with incomes equal to 30 percent of AMI or less, is
essential to quickly transition individuals and families from emergency shelter to permanent housing.
The Consortium also brings together the County and all cities including Richmond to coordinate
various processes surrounding the allocations and management of federal CDBG funds received by
each of the entitlement jurisdictions.
Every five years, the Consortium produces a Countywide strategic planning document called the
Consolidated Plan. This plan identifies local needs for housing and community development and
services, and guides the investment of resources to provide affordable housing and services for
homeless individuals. This Consolidated Plan is submitted to and approved by HUD.
According to the Contra Costa Consortium 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, an estimated 15,000
people experience homelessness in Contra Costa County at some point during the year. Of the
people living in shelters, one-third were members of homeless families, 5,200 were single adults,
and 162 were youth under the age of 21. In addition, many others are at risk of becoming
                                                      42
homeless, especially low- and very low-income families paying more than 30 percent of their income
for rent (see preceding section on housing cost burden). Based on the current best estimate of the
homeless population, the County as a whole has an unmet need for emergency shelters for the
homeless. The Contra Costa Consortium plans to address this need through increasing the inventory
of homeless services as well as through homeless prevention policies.
Homeless services in Contra Costa County are provided by a number of public, private, and non-profit
agencies. The Contra Costa County Health Services Division offers a variety of homeless programs,
including youth and adult shelters, services and transitional housing for homeless youths,
permanent supportive housing, and community homeless court. These services are available to all
Contra Costa residents, including those in Concord.
Other providers of homeless services in Contra Costa County include, but are not limited to, Anka
Behavioral Health, Bay Area Rescue Mission, the Greater Richmond Interfaith Program (GRIP),
Lutheran Social Services, SHELTER, Inc., Shepherd’s Gate, STAND! Against Domestic Violence,
Winter Nights shelter, as well as numerous soup kitchens and food pantries throughout the County.
The North Concord Homeless Shelter (NCHS), a County facility located on Arnold Industrial Way, is
the sole emergency shelter in Concord. The NCHS serves men and women with 75 beds and
provides meals and lodging to homeless individuals. The facility is currently at maximum capacity.
In June 2010, the Philip Dorn Respite Center opened immediately adjacent to NCHS, and is a 24-bed
respite care program for homeless adults who are discharged from local hospitals and require
medical stabilization services. Respite care refers to recuperative services for those homeless
persons who may not meet medical criteria for hospitalization, but who are too sick or medically
vulnerable to reside in an emergency shelter and cannot be returned to the streets. Clients are only
admitted when discharged from a hospital; walk-ins are not accepted.
Following the adoption of Concord’s previous Housing Element, the City updated its Development
Code in accordance with State law to allow emergency shelters by right in certain zoning districts in
the City. Although the zoning allows for emergency shelters by right in these areas, the City does
retain the ability to apply development standards to emergency shelters provided that these
standards are consistent with standards applied to other uses in the same zoning district, including
design compatibility with the character of the surrounding neighborhood, site screening, and
required site development standards. Suitable sites for emergency or transitional housing would
likely be close to arterial roads with public transit services to offer convenient access to shopping,
employment, and service centers.
While the current Housing Element supports the creation of emergency shelters and programs
conducted by homeless service providers, it recognizes that the best strategy to deal with
homelessness is to prevent it from happening in the first place. This involves keeping housing costs
low, increasing the supply of affordable housing, growing the local economy, and creating job
opportunities for residents.

Persons with Disabilities
Housing needs for persons with disabilities vary greatly depending on the type of disability, personal
preference, and lifestyle. However, persons with disabilities often require special housing that
provides additional accessibility and barrier-free design, health care options, and proximity to
services. Some residents may also suffer from disabilities that require living in a group home or
other supportive environment.
Concord is comparable to Contra Costa County with respect to the number of residents that report
having a disability. The US Census Bureau defines six types of disability: hearing difficulty, vision
difficulty, cognitive difficulty, ambulatory difficulty, self-care difficulty, and independent living
difficulty. According to ACS data, there were 11,964 Concord residents with one or more disabilities
in 2012, approximately 10 percent of the City’s population. Concord was generally comparable to
the County with respect to the share of the population that reported having one or more disabilities,
with the exception of a slightly higher share of individuals between ages 5 and 17 with a disability
that causes cognitive difficulty (six percent of people in the age cohort). Overall, the most common
types of difficulties among Concord residents and Contra Costa County residents with disabilities
were ambulatory difficulties, followed by cognitive difficulties and independent living difficulties.

 The American Community Survey (ACS) data used in this table are estimates
 based on statistical sampling conducted continuously in 2012.

As Concord’s population gradually ages, there will be a greater need for disabled and senior housing.
As shown in Table 30, approximately one third of City and County residents over the age of 65
reports some type of disability, the most common of which is ambulatory difficulty. As a result,
housing options for this population should include accessible housing units with ramps and other
accessibility devices, group home facilities with varying degrees of medical or nursing care, and
special care homes in close proximity to public services and commercial centers. Additionally, non-
seniors with disabilities will require special accommodations tailored to their specific needs. While
some can count on their parents or other family members to care for them, there are also those who
require public assistance, particularly those with long term impairments, for medical and financial
help. Because many disabled people are unable to work as a result of their disability, the availability
of housing affordable to very low, low and moderate income households is also an important factor
in planning to accommodate housing needs for persons with disabilities.
                                                                     45

In 2002, State law was amended to require localities to include in their Housing Element an analysis
of potential and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance, and improvement of
housing for persons with disabilities; as well as to demonstrate local efforts to remove government
constraints that hinder the locality from meeting the need for housing for persons with disabilities.
The current Housing Element has a number of policies and programs that seek to remove
constraints or provide greater accessibility for persons with disabilities.
According to the State of California Community Care Licensing Division, as of June 2014 Concord
had 292 licensed care facilities; these included 90 residential care facilities for the elderly, five adult
day care centers, seven group homes for children, one social rehabilitation center, and one
transitional housing development. However, these numbers fluctuate year to year as facilities open
or close. Local housing policies promote barrier-free design in all new housing development, as well
as accessibility in the street network and public buildings. As part of this effort, the City’s Housing
Rehabilitation Loan and Grant Program offers Emergency Repair and Accessibility Grants to low-
income and disabled homeowners to make their homes and/or mobile homes more accessible.
Accessibility improvements funded through the program include providing grab bars and railings in
baths and hallways and building ramps for easier access, and modifying bathrooms for accessibility.
The City’s Public Works Department and Parks and Facilities Maintenance Division updated its ADA
Transition Plan in 2005 to ensure new buildings are designed to meet stringent accessibility
standards.4 Additionally, transportation services for seniors to the Senior Center’s Nutrition Program
are made available through the County Connection’s LINK services.
The City also has supported a number of private or nonprofit projects designed to assist persons with
disabilities. They include:
         Caldera Place, 12-units for very-low income persons with physical disabilities;
         Concord Residential Club, a 20-unit apartment complex for very-low and low-income people
          with developmental disabilities;
         Respite Inn, a facility that offers care to developmentally disabled teenagers and adults; and
         Las Trampas, a single-family home that provides supportive living for up to four individuals
          with developmental disabilities.
Information on housing resources for persons with disabilities is readily available from the City’s
Economic Development & Housing Division. The City also provides information through its website
and at community centers.

Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Effective January 2011, California Housing Element law was amended to require that Housing
Elements include an evaluation of special housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities.
Portions of the text provided in this section are drawn from a memo issued by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development in June 2012 that provides guidance regarding
this portion of the Housing Element.
A "developmental disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual attains age
18 years, can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that
individual. Developmental disabilities include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and
autism, as well as disabling conditions that are closely related to mental retardation or require
treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but do not include
disabilities that are solely physical in nature.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
services to approximately 235,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families.
Services are delivered primarily through 21 regional centers, which are nonprofit agencies that
contract with local businesses to provide services to individuals with developmental disabilities.
The Regional Center of the East Bay provides these services in Contra Costa and Alameda Counties.
According to information provided by the Regional Center of the East Bay, there are 971 individuals
with developmental disabilities currently living in Concord, approximately 14 percent of the
population with developmental disabilities Countywide.

There are a number of different housing types that are appropriate for individuals with
developmental disabilities, which reflect the range of housing needs among this group. Many
individuals with developmental disabilities are able to live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment and do not require housing that differs from the housing available
to the population at large. Individuals with more severe developmental disabilities require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require
an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided.
                                                    47

Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for
the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult. Additional considerations include housing
accessibility modifications, proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living
opportunities. Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all newly constructed multifamily housing (as
required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest
range of choices for disabled residents. Similar to individuals with other types of disabilities,
individuals with developmental disabilities often have limited employment options, so special
consideration should be given to the affordability of housing for individuals with developmental
disabilities.
As noted above, there are four facilities in Concord that provide housing for individuals with
developmental disabilities.
Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households often face difficulties affording suitable housing because households with
a single income typically have lower incomes than two-earner households, and may have additional
childcare expenses that further reduce disposable income. Female-headed households are more
likely than other households to have incomes below the poverty line and struggle to find decent
housing that is affordable.
Concord has a relatively small share of female-headed households with incomes below the poverty
line, and the poverty rate among female-headed family households has decreased somewhat in
recent years. As shown in Table 32, in 2000 there were 5,305 female-headed family households in
the City, 735 of which (14 percent) were living below poverty level. By 2012, the number of female-
headed family households in the City decreased slightly to 4,916, and the number of female-headed
family households with incomes below the poverty line dropped to 498 (10 percent of female-
headed family households). Overall, 12 percent of all female-headed households in Concord (family
and non-family) had incomes below the poverty line in 2000 and 2012.
Meanwhile, poverty rates Countywide showed a more substantial and growing share of female-
headed households with incomes below the poverty line. The poverty rate among female-headed
households in Contra Costa County increased from 13 percent in 2000 to 18 percent in 2012, and
the poverty rate among female-headed family households Countywide increased from 17 percent to
23 percent.

 Note:
 Poverty level, based on OMB Directive 14, uses a set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition.
 The thresholds do not vary geographically and are updated annually to allow for changes in the cost of living using the
 Consumer Price Index (CPI). Poverty thresholds are determined by multiplying the base-year poverty thresholds (1982) by
 the monthly inflation factor, based on the 12 monthly CPIs and the base-year CPI.

The poverty rate is especially high for female-headed households with children under 18 years old.
Among families with children under the age of 18, ACS data collected between 2010 and 2012
indicate that approximately one third (32 percent) of female-headed single-parent households had
incomes below the poverty line, while only seven percent of married couple families and eight
percent of male-headed single-parent households had incomes below the poverty line. As suggested
by these data, a significant portion of single-parent female-headed households can greatly benefit
from expanded affordable housing opportunities, and many may also need access to childcare
services and youth services. Innovative shared living arrangements that might include congregate
cooking and childcare facilities could be suitable for many lower-income single-parent households.
Poverty rates by family type are shown in Table 33.

Concord responds to the needs of its female-headed households through its Fair Housing Program,
administered through Echo Fair Housing. One of the goals of the program is to eliminate
discrimination against female-headed households, as well as provide on-going support for childcare
programs for lower income families. The City implements a fee on new construction and tenant
improvements to help fund the development of childcare programs. According to City staff,
approximately $217,000 in fees for childcare services was collected in Concord from 2008 to 2014.
Large Households
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development defines a large family as one having five or
more members. Large families typically face greater difficulties in renting or purchasing housing as
housing units with five or more rooms are more difficult to find, and when available, are rarely
affordable. Information on large households is based on Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy (CHAS) data, which are detailed cross-tabulations of US Census and ACS data intended to
provide insight on housing conditions. CHAS data express income as a percentage of HUD Area
Median Family Income (HAMFI), which is slightly different than the AMI distribution used elsewhere in
this chapter. The most recent CHAS data currently available are based on ACS data collected
between 2006 and 2010.
According to 2006-2010 CHAS data, there were almost 4,000 large family households in Concord,
accounting for approximately nine percent of all households Citywide. Approximately 60 percent of
large family households lived in owner-occupied homes. Almost two thirds (65 percent) of large
families living in owner-occupied homes had household incomes that are higher than the HAMFI (see
Table 34).
In contrast to large owner families, many large families living in rental housing have fairly low
incomes. As shown in Table 34, half of all large renter families have a household income equal to
50 percent of HAMFI or less, and fewer than one in four large renter households earn more than the
HAMFI. This suggests that many large families that do not own a home have difficulty finding
affordable rental housing. Difficulties faced by large households seeking rental housing are often
exacerbated by a lack of rental units large enough to accommodate households with five or more
people, regardless of cost. To maintain affordability, multifamily housing is generally developed with
one or two bedrooms only, and rarely includes units with four or more bedrooms. In Concord, only
eight percent of rental units had four or more bedrooms in 2012, according to ACS data.

The City’s Fair Housing Program, contracted through ECHO Housing, provides comprehensive
counseling and referral services for large families that need assistance in finding housing. The
topics they cover include rent increase issues, harassment and discrimination, and other
tenant/landlord services.
Overcrowding
The Census defines a housing unit as overcrowded if there is more than one occupant per room,
excluding kitchen and bathrooms. Overcrowding usually occurs as a result of high housing costs,
such that families double-up or reside in smaller units to devote income to other basic necessities
such as food and medical fees. Table 35 shows the incidence of overcrowding in Concord and
Contra Costa County, according to ACS data collected in 2012. As shown, six percent of Concord
households were overcrowded, a slightly higher rate of overcrowding than in the County overall,
where four percent of households were overcrowded. Most cases of overcrowding were found in
renter-occupied units, where lower-income families commonly reside. Twelve percent of renter-
occupied units in Concord were overcrowded in 2012, compared to nine percent of renter-occupied
units in Contra Costa County. Among owner-occupied units, the rate of overcrowding in Concord (two
percent) was comparable to the rate Countywide.

Addressing overcrowding will require the construction of new units and rehabilitation of existing units
to meet the needs of larger families, a correction in the local balance between supply and demand
so the market provides a greater number of large units, and addressing the gap between local
incomes and housing prices. Given the high rate of overcrowding in renter-occupied units in
Concord, there is a particular need for additional large units in the rental market. The City must
continue with policies that assist lower-income households to alleviate overcrowding.
Seniors
Special housing needs for senior households vary substantially between households. Senior
households often have a limited amount of income to spend on housing or other needs, particularly
if members of the household experience sickness, require medical attention, or have mobility
issues.5 In addition to affordability requirements, a number of factors impact the type of housing
that is appropriate for a senior household. For example, while many seniors are able to stay in their
homes as they age, particularly if the home is modified to provide accessibility features, many may
need or want to move to a smaller home that requires little maintenance. Moreover, some seniors
may need housing that includes additional services, such as on-site food preparation or medical
care.
As shown in Table 36, Concord had over 9,000 households with a senior head of household in 2012,
approximately one fifth of all households in the City. This is a slightly smaller share than in the
County overall, which is consistent with the City’s slightly smaller share of people over age 65.
Approximately three quarters (74 percent) of senior households in Concord live in owner-occupied
units. This is a slightly smaller share than the share of senior households living in owner-occupied
housing Countywide (81 percent), but consistent with the Concord’s higher share of rental housing.
Many senior households that have owned their homes for many years have paid off all mortgage
costs and therefore have low housing costs.
5 The definition of senior households can vary by data source, two differing sources are used to present data on senior
households in this Housing Element Update. The Census Bureau generally defines seniors as people age 65 and older,
and their survey data are usually grouped in five-year increments, while CHAS tabulations define elderly households as
households with no more than two people in which one or both members of the household are age 62 or older. HCD’s
Housing and Policy Development’s Housing Element samples follow the Census Bureau in grouping seniors in the 65 and
older age group. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the State’s Governor’s Office of
Planning and Research (OPR) General Plan Guidelines (2003), however, define seniors as 62 years and older. The Civil
Code defines “senior citizen” as “a person 62 years or older, or 55 years or older in a senior citizen housing development”.

Table 37 shows elderly households by income and tenure, based on CHAS tabulations from 2006-
2010 ACS data. CHAS tabulations define an elderly household as a household with no more than
two people in which one or both members of the household are age 62 or older, which differs from
the households highlighted in Table 36. As shown, there were almost 10,000 senior households in
Concord, 53 percent of which had incomes below 80 percent of MFI. Among elderly renter
households, 41 percent had incomes that were 30 percent of HAMFI or less, and 57 percent had
incomes that were 50 percent of HAMFI or less. Elderly households living in owner-occupied units
tended to have slightly higher incomes; more than half (53 percent) had incomes over 80 percent of
HAMFI. Measured in absolute numbers, however, the number of extremely low- and very low-income
owner households (2,175) was almost twice the number of extremely low- and very low-income
renter households (1,185). Because people generally need more medical care as they age, very low-
and low-income senior households may face greater financial difficulties than other households with
similar incomes. While the City does not specifically assist lower income seniors with housing, it
does help them through its many affordable housing programs aimed at very low- and low-income
households.

A primary issue facing seniors is lack of availability of barrier-free housing. The City encourages
barrier-free design in all developments and requires new multifamily housing developments to
                                                            53
include accessible units in accordance with State law.6 All multifamily units on the lowest floor in
buildings without elevators are required to be accessible to persons with disabilities. In multifamily
units in buildings with elevators, all units are required to be located on an accessible route. The City
also supports the development of senior housing near shopping and other services. Since 2002, the
City has approved two senior housing developments that are located on transit routes, near
shopping areas or in Downtown. They include Oakmont Senior Living and Vintage Brook Senior
Apartments.
Because of the number of people having physical disabilities or other types of disabilities in Concord
(see discussion above and Table 30), it is imperative that the City continue to promote barrier-free
housing with close access to transit, community, and shopping facilities.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farmworkers work in fields, processing plants,
or support activities and generally live in the vicinity. Temporary workers are hired during harvest
periods and travel from one location to another. Thus, cities with strong farming traditions can
expect a sudden influx of temporary workers during certain periods of the year. If housing is not
provided by their employers, temporary workers will have to find temporary housing within a
reasonable commute distance from their place of work. This can place a temporary strain on the
housing supply, particularly multifamily rental units.
The provision of adequate housing for farmworkers is a rising concern because farmworkers tend to
have difficulty securing safe, decent and affordable housing. Additionally, farmworker households
tend to have high rates of poverty, often have high rates of overcrowding, and live disproportionately
in housing which is in poor condition. In 1999, the State legislature amended housing element law
to mandate that jurisdictions address housing for agricultural workers.
Agricultural employment has been gradually declining in Concord and is projected to continue to
decline in the coming years. ABAG and MTC estimate that there were 49 jobs agricultural industry
located in Concord in 2010, 0.1 percent of total employment in the City. This category includes
workers in the mining industry and those working in nurseries and greenhouses, so the actual
number of farmworkers is likely lower. ABAG and MTC estimate that by 2040, the number of
agricultural jobs in Concord will drop to 42, while total employment in Concord is projected to
increase by 46 percent.
The projected decrease in agricultural employment in Concord is consistent with recent trends
throughout Contra Costa County. Table 38 shows farmworker employment in Contra Costa County in
2002 and 2007, according to the USDA Census of Agriculture. As shown, there was a 28 percent

codified in California Building Standards Code (Title 24), which is used by Concord.

decrease in farmworker employment in the County between 2002 and 2007 and a 42 percent
decrease in the total number of farms.

Under the 2030 General Plan, there are few opportunities for large-scale agricultural development in
Concord. The City allows orchards, crop production, vineyards, livestock, and grazing in the rural
residential district and farm housing is also permitted in some of these districts.
Given the small number of existing and projected agricultural jobs in Concord, trends toward a
decrease in agricultural employment Countywide, and the limited availability of land for large-scale
agricultural development in the City, it is not likely that farmworker housing will be a significant issue
in Concord during the 2014-2022 Housing Element Update Cycle.
                                                               55
4. LAND INVENTORY
This section assesses housing development potential in Concord during the upcoming planning
period. It summarizes the findings of a comprehensive inventory of local sites with the potential to
accommodate housing during the planning period. The inventory builds off of a 2008 inventory
compiled as part of the 2007-2014 Housing Element. Each site in the 2008 inventory was
reviewed to determine if it is still available, and to provide updated information on zoning, existing
conditions, and potential yield. Several new sites have been added based on zoning and General
Plan changes, new opportunities, and emerging plans and programs. Conversely, a few sites have
been removed from the 2008 inventory because they have been developed or are no longer
considered viable.
Appendix A provides a detailed list of the housing sites. The text and tables in this chapter provide
a summary of the list, using several categories to describe residential development potential.
Most of these categories have been quantified in order to demonstrate that Concord has sufficient
land available to provide its fair share of the region’s housing needs. Other categories are
described qualitatively, to demonstrate the breadth of opportunities that may be created during
the planning period. This chapter also evaluates the adequacy of infrastructure to serve the City’s
housing sites, summarizes environmental constraints on the sites, and presents information on
development trends in the various zoning districts where housing sites are located.
Programs to address the needs of Extremely Low Income Households are included in Chapter 7, in
response to AB 2634 (2006 Statutes), but this income group is not addressed separately by the
RHNA.
Overview of Housing Site Inventory
The State requires that a Housing Element identify a city’s ability to meet its Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA). This not only requires demonstrating the capacity to accommodate the
total number of housing units, but also the capacity to accommodate the number of units assigned
to each income category. Larger cities must plan for a variety of housing types, including multi-
family housing at a range of densities as well as single family homes. Section 65583(a)(3) of the
California Government Code states that the inventory must be site specific to help localities
determine the appropriate zoning, development standards, and infrastructure capacity to
accommodate the new construction needed. In 2004, Assembly Bill 2348 further clarified the
sites inventory requirements, stipulating that the inventory must include the size of each site, its
address or assessor’s parcel number, a description of the existing use, and information
demonstrating the feasibility of development on sites that are not currently vacant.
The Government Code also requires that all sites identified must be available for residential use in
the planning period. Sites that require rezoning may be included in the inventory provided that
actions are taken to address the re-zoning early in the planning period. Many of the sites identified
                                                      56

in the 2007-2014 Housing Element were rezoned to incentivize residential use in 2012 when the
City of Concord adopted a major revision of its Development Code. As a result, no additional
rezoning is needed to meet the 2014-2022 RHNA.
The types of sites that are appropriate for residential development include:
        Sites that are committed to specific residential development projects expected to come on
         line in 2015 or later.
        Vacant and underutilized sites zoned for low and moderate density residential
         development. These are principally small infill sites in residential neighborhoods.
        Vacant and underutilized sites zoned for high density residential development (over 30
         units/acre).
        Vacant and underutilized sites zoned for mixed use development (over 30 units/acre).
         Zoning of these sites also allows non-residential uses, but incentives are in place to
         support and encourage residential development. This includes land in Downtown Concord
         and along many of the City’s major corridors.
        Industrially zoned sites with live-work housing potential.
Table 39 shows the housing development potential under the Housing Element, summarized by
General Plan land use category. As seen from Table 39, a total of 4,523 residential units can be
built on the identified sites within the Housing Element planning period. Figure 6 shows the
location of these sites. The Figure identifies 12 numbered subareas, corresponding to census
tracts or aggregations of census tracts in the city. Each subarea is highlighted on a full page map
in Appendix A of this document, allowing the potential housing sites to be shown in greater detail.
Each site is labeled in Appendix A, and detailed tables are provided to show relevant site
characteristics.

Relationship of Density to Affordability
According to ABAG, the City is required to provide capacity for 3,462 residential units, including
1,236 low-and very low-income units, for the 2014-2022 planning period. Assembly Bill 2348 (AB
2348) established two alternatives for cities to demonstrate the suitability of their housing sites to
accommodate the low and very low income share of the RHNA. Cities can either provide evidence
that the sites are capable of supporting housing affordable to these groups based on market
demand, financial feasibility, and recent trends—or they can zone the sites at a density which is
more likely to accommodate an affordable product. Due to the high cost of land and construction
in the Bay Area, most cities in the region have chosen the latter alternative. The so-called “default
density” for cities with more than 25,000 residents in the Bay Area is 30 units per acre.
Development above this density has the greatest potential to accommodate very low and low
income housing because it offers the possibility for lower per unit construction costs.
Applying the default density to Concord’s RHNA means that the City must demonstrate that it has at
least 41.2 acres of developable land zoned at densities of 30 units per net acre or more (1,236 units
divided by 30). The sites do not need to be vacant, for sale, or immediately available for
development, but the City must be able to demonstrate their suitability for development at the zoned
density. Likewise, if the sites are zoned for mixed use, the City is required to demonstrate that there
is a reasonable probability that housing will be included in future development proposals.
In this Element, Concord has identified an excess supply of housing sites zoned at densities of 30
units per acre or more to recognize that not all of its mixed use sites will include residential uses. In
fact, there are 109 acres of sites listed in the inventory zoned to allow at least 30 units per acre.
These sites could realistically produce 4,064 units at these densities, based on the analysis
prepared for this Element and its predecessor in 2010. This is 228 percent greater than the RHNA
for low and very low income households. Of the capacity identified, 833 units are on sites zoned
exclusively for medium and high residential use, and 3,231 units are on sites zoned for mixed use.
                                                               59

It should be emphasized that zoning a site at 30 units per acre alone does not guarantee that the
site will contain affordable housing. The City has created incentives to encourage affordable housing
on sites zoned in excess of this density, but these incentives are voluntary. The sites identified in this
Element as suitable for very low and low income housing may also develop with market-rate housing.
Methodology for Identifying Sites and Calculating Development Capacity
The foundation for the sites inventory is a 2008 inventory of sites conducted by the City of Concord
for use in the 2010 Housing Element. Aerial photos were initially used to identify prospective sites.
Field surveys followed, to document existing land uses on each site.
Sites that were too small or deemed unsuitable for residential use were dropped from the inventory.
Environmental constraints such as noise, slope, flooding, and earthquake hazards were described.
Infrastructure constraints were also noted for each site. For non-vacant sites, building condition was
noted. The existing General Plan and zoning designations were identified for each site, the acreage
was noted, and an estimate was made of the housing unit potential. The distance from each site to
transit, parks, schools, and the nearest grocery store also was noted.
The 2008 inventory identified 159 sites altogether, with a capacity of 4,189 units. Many of the sites
consisted of multiple parcels, in some cases under common ownership and in other cases with
multiple owners. Sites were rated based on their potential for redevelopment. The metric for making
this determination was primarily the ratio of improvement value to land value, as defined by the
Contra Costa County Assessor’s Office. Sites where land values significantly exceeded building
values received the highest rankings.
The 2008 Inventory assigned an alphanumeric identification number to each site. Sites were
lettered with a suffix of “A” through “N” depending on where they were located. Within each lettered
area, sites were numbered. Thus, site A1 was the first site on the list within subarea A.
As part of the 2014 Housing Element Update, a comprehensive review of the 2008 sites data base
was completed. Each site was individually reviewed using aerial photos and Google “street view”
images. Field visits to the larger sites (capacity greater than 16 units) were conducted to verify
existing conditions and the continued suitability of each site. Current tax assessor records and
acreage data were reviewed for each parcel, and an updated calculation of assessed improvement
value to assessed land value ratio was prepared.
In 2014, the 2008 site ID numbers were updated so they nested within 2010 Census Tracts. There
are 26 tracts that include residential land uses. Several of the tracts were grouped together,
resulting in 12 subareas, or aggregations of tracts. The Subareas were numbered “1” through “12.”
The sites were also renumbered, with the “old” ID number retained as a column in the data tables for
reference purposes.
Data on zoning and General Plan designation was updated for each site. This was a critical step
since the City adopted a new Development Code (including a new zoning map) in 2012, along with
                                                     60

numerous amendments to its General Plan Map. Zoning on many of the sites had changed since
2008, and a new calculation of development yield was required in many cases. In a few cases, the
“realistic capacity” of the site was adjusted downward due to a General Plan Amendment and
downzoning to a less intense designation. However, in a larger number of cases, the realistic
capacity was adjusted upward due to the adoption of zoning designations with minimum density
standards in 2012, or due to General Plan Amendments and rezoning actions to more intense use
categories. In all cases, sites that had existing dwelling units were reported to note the net gain in
units, so as not to double count units that were already in place or that might be demolished in the
future.
Sites which were developed between 2008 and 2014 were removed from the data base, and
changes in the status of other sites were noted as appropriate. A separate category was created for
“approved” development and other known projects expected to come on line after January 31, 2015.
In the course of moving the 2008 sites forward, the following changes were made:
        Five sites were removed because they are now developed
        In four instances, sites were “split” into two sites each (e.g., the four sites became eight
         sites). This is because they either contained different zoning designations, or because they
         included a mix of vacant and non-vacant parcels with differing levels of redevelopment
         potential.
        Two sites with “Neighborhood Commercial” zoning were removed from the data base, since
         that zoning category does not incentivize residential uses as the mixed use categories do.
        In one instance, two sites were merged into one site. This is because they were formerly
         adjacent properties under separate owners and they are now under one owner.
        Three sites were added because they contain approved development projects. These three
         sites were not counted as housing sites in the 2007-2014 Element.
The above changes resulted in a net loss of one site.
In addition, 29 new sites were added to the inventory. These include parcels identified as
“opportunity sites” or “areas of interest” in the Downtown Concord Specific Plan, as well as sites
identified through the 2014 review of the County Assessor Data files.
The Assessor data base includes land use (Use Code), acreage, ownership, and property value
records for all 38,668 parcels in the City of Concord. This data base was sorted by Use Code to
identify all vacant parcels. The vacant parcels were further sorted by size and several new vacant
residentially zoned sites were identified. Assessor data was also sorted based on improvement/land
value (I/L) ratios. Large parcels with I/L ratios less than 0.25 were flagged and reviewed on aerial
photos to determine if they might be viable housing sites. Sites in the CMX, DP, and DMX zoning
districts were visited to identify their housing potential. Of the 29 new sites added, 19 are zoned for
low density residential uses and 10 are zoned for high density mixed use.
                                                      61

The updated sites data base includes 187 housing opportunity sites, with the capacity for 4,523
units. This is an increase of 334 units over the 2008 total. Appendix A includes a profile of each
site, including its realistic capacity. Later sections of this chapter describe how realistic capacity was
calculated. This chapter also demonstrates the suitability of small and non-vacant sites for housing,
based on recent development trends and other factors.
For presentation and analysis purposes, the 187 housing sites have been organized into several
categories. These categories allow a quick determination of which sites are vacant and which are
“underutilized.” The categories also differentiate sites above the “default” density standard of 30
units per acre from sites below this density standard. As noted earlier, sites above the default
density standard are considered more viable locations for housing affordable to low and very low
income households. For moderate and above moderate income households, sites may be either
high or low density to be deemed suitable.
In addition to the housing capacity quantified in Appendix A, this Housing Element also includes a
qualitative discussion of other housing opportunities in Concord. A new section has been added to
this chapter to describe the potential for development on the former Concord Naval Weapons
Station, the Coast Guard Housing site, and the BART station properties. Because these sites are not
immediately available for development and because the City already has sufficient zoned capacity to
meet its RHNA , the capacity of these properties has not been quantified. However, it is likely that at
least some residential development will occur in these locations before the end of the planning
period.
Description of Housing Sites
Table 4.2 provides a summary of housing sites using the categories described above. Twelve of the
187 sites are associated with committed development projects, expected to come on line after
January 31, 2015. Approximately half of the 187 sites are vacant and underutilized sites zoned for
exclusively residential uses at densities of less than 30 units per acre. These are primarily small infill
sites in established residential neighborhoods, and they account for only about six percent of the
City’s housing unit capacity.
Approximately 40 percent of the sites are vacant and underutilized parcels zoned to allow higher
density residential uses. Of this total, there are 21 sites zoned for residential uses and 54 sites
zoned for mixed use. The mixed use sites have the greatest potential, with capacity for over 2,800
units. Live-work sites, which have a maximum density of 24 units per acre, round out the total with 7
sites and the potential for 173 units. The 187 housing sites are located in all parts of the City.
Capacity for about 2,000 units has been identified in Downtown Concord. This is lower than the
capacity identified in the Downtown Specific Plan, reflecting more conservative assumptions about
density and the potential for non-residential uses on some of the housing sites. Areas located to the
north of Downtown in the Broadway/Fremont/Harrison area and along Concord Avenue represent
another 260 units of housing potential. Areas located to the southwest of Downtown (in the Detroit
Avenue area) represent another 200 potential units.
                                                       62

About 1,300 units of higher density potential has been identified on sites along major corridors
outside of Downtown Concord. This includes roughly 420 units on sites in the Clayton Road corridor,
650 units on sites in the Monument Boulevard corridor, 175 units on sites in the Willow Pass Road
corridor east of downtown, and 40 units on the Concord Boulevard corridor.

 Notes:
 (a) Generally includes the RS and RR zoning districts. Includes a few sites that are zoned RM, which allows
 32 units per acre. However, because these sites are located in low density neighborhoods their presumed
 density is significantly lower and they have been assigned to the low density category.
 (b) Generally includes the RH and RM zoning districts. See note above about select projects in the RM zone.
 (c) Generally includes the CMX, DMX, and DP zoning districts.
 (d) Generally includes the IMX zoning district. Live work development is also permitted in commercial districts.
Committed or Entitled Development Projects
Committed projects were only counted if the units are expected to come on line after January 31,
2015. Thus, buildout of projects that are already under construction in early 2014 (such as Wisteria)
were not included.
There are 12 sites in this category, with a total expected yield of 539 units. The largest projects are
Renaissance Phase II in Downtown Concord (179 units) and the Palmera apartments on Enea Circle
(224 units). Both are to be market rate rental developments, and both are to be built on sites with
mixed use zoning. Based on prevailing market rate rents, these units have been assigned to the
“moderate income” category. The average density of these two projects is 58 units per acre. This
provides a useful benchmark for estimating the realistic capacity of other sites zoned for mixed use
development.
Other committed projects include Enclave Townhomes (26 units) and Poetry Gardens Townhomes
(28 units). These are both being developed on sites zoned RM. The average density of these two
projects is 20.5 units per acre (the zoning range allows 11 to 32 units per acre). Most of the
                                                                 63

remaining committed projects are small single family subdivisions of 12 lots or less.7 Several of
these projects were identified as pending in the 2010 Housing Element, but their construction was
stalled by the economy.
Low and Moderate Density Residential Sites (less than 30 units/acre)
While this category constitutes the largest number of sites (93), it represents only 6.2 percent of the
identified housing capacity (282 units). Included are 59 vacant sites and 34 underutilized sites. The
vacant sites total 46 acres, while the underutilized sites total 55 acres. The average expected
density is 2.8 units per acre. The relatively low average density is due to the fact that a few of the
sites have rural residential zoning with a 40,000 square foot minimum lot size. Other sites have
minimum lot size requirements ranging from 6,000 to 12,000 square feet, but may be constrained
by steep slopes or other factors.
Most of the vacant sites are individual lots that have been bypassed by development. In fact, 38 of
the 59 vacant sites in this category are capable of only supporting one home each. A few of the
vacant sites are subdividable, with the largest (4.3 acres) capable of supporting 11 units.
The underutilized sites include parcels that are zoned to support much higher densities than
currently exist on the lot. Many of these lots are remnants of Concord’s rural past, and include
former orchards, pasture land, or semi-agricultural uses, typically with a small, older single family
home on the property. The lots are typically one to two acres in size, and are hemmed in on all sides
by development at densities of 3 to 5 units per acre. Land values are often more than double the
improvement values. Many of these sites are flat and could easily be subdivided. In a few cases,
driveway easements would be required. In other cases, the sites are large enough to support a small
street or court.
Two of the underutilized sites have RM zoning. Although these sites could theoretically develop at 32
units per acre, there are constraints (such as overhead transmission lines) which reduce their
realistic capacity. These sites are subject to a minimum density standard of 11 units per acre, which
is the presumed density for Housing Element purposes.
High Density Sites with Residential Zoning
Table 4.2 notes that 21 of the identified housing sites have zoning which allows densities of at least
30 units per acre. Of this number, five are vacant and 16 are underutilized. All of these sites meet
the “default density” criteria and could be considered as opportunities for low and very low income
housing, as well as moderate and above moderate income housing.
The vacant sites include three with RM zoning and two with RH zoning. The RM sites may develop at
up to 32 units per acre. Less dense development is also allowed on these sites. The RH sites may
develop at densities up to 100 units per acre, and are subject to a minimum density requirement of
7 Other committed projects include LaVista Villas (8 units), Clayton and LaVista (12 units), Copperleaf (11 units),
Chestnut Grove (10 units), Willows (7 units), 4985 Olive (6 units), and Farry Grove (5 units), plus individual homes.
                                                              64

33 units per acre. The largest vacant RH site is an 8.2 acre site owned by BART located about four
blocks south of the Concord BART station. To be conservative in estimating its potential yield, the
minimum density of 33 units has been applied here.
The underutilized sites include eight with RM zoning and eight with RH zoning. These sites have the
capacity for 433 housing units. Most of the sites are currently developed with older single family
homes and have very low assessed improvement values and high assessed land values. In at least
one instance, the existing use is a non-conforming commercial warehouse. These sites offer
excellent opportunities for infill development ranging from 20 to 60 total units. In a few cases, the
sites consist of parcels in multiple ownership and would require lot consolidation prior to
development (see discussion later in this chapter on the feasibility of consolidation).
Mixed Use Sites Where High Density Housing is Encouraged
More than half of Concord’s housing potential is associated with sites in the Downtown Mixed Use
(DMX), Downtown Pedestrian (DP), and Commercial Mixed Use (CMX) zoning districts. The 14 vacant
sites in these three zones are estimated to have the capacity for 752 housing units. The 40
underutilized sites in these three zones are estimated to have the capacity for 2,076 units. Sites in
the DMX and DP zones are subject to a minimum density requirement of 33 units per acre and a
maximum density of 100 units per acre. CMX sites have a minimum density of 11 units per acre and
a maximum of 40 units per acre. All three zoning districts have regulatory incentives for affordable
housing production (through the City’s Affordable Housing Incentive Program) and allow projects that
are entirely residential, as well as mixed use and commercial projects.
The vacant sites in this category include two former Redevelopment Agency sites (the Masonic
Temple site and the Oak Street parcels). Each of these sites is capable of accommodating over 200
units. Both are level sites, cleared of former structures, with available infrastructure and services.
Both are within a few blocks of the Concord BART station, and immediately adjacent to shopping,
employment, and other high density residential uses. Other large vacant sites include the city block
bounded by East, Salvio, Willow Pass, and Port Chicago Highway, which was recently consolidated
into single ownership. There are also smaller vacant sites in this vicinity.
The underutilized sites in this category are also concentrated in and around Downtown Concord.
They include a series of older retail parcels on the south side of Willow Pass Road between the
Gateway Office complex and the Renaissance development. These parcels are capable of supporting
over 400 units, developed at densities similar to the already completed Renaissance Phase One and
the approved Phase Two. There is also a concentration of underutilized sites on the east side of
Downtown, along Galindo (opposite the police station) and along East Street. These sites are only a
few blocks from the BART station and are characterized by older retail buildings with high vacancy
rates, auto-oriented services, and parking lots. Another cluster of such uses exists along Concord
Avenue between Highway 242 and Todos Santos Plaza.
Underutilized sites with housing potential are also located along the City’s commercial corridors—
particularly along Clayton Road, Monument Boulevard, and Willow Pass Road. Clayton Road includes
                                                     65

older shopping centers with high vacancy rates, large commercially zoned parcels with very low
improvement values, and marginal commercial uses which date back to the city’s early development.
The Monument and Willow Pass corridors contain similar uses, including drive-through restaurants,
motels, auto repair shops, single family homes, and vacant gas stations, most developed between
1945 and 1965. There are also several churches on the corridors with overflow parking lots and
potential surplus property.
At the time of the 2010 Housing Element, these properties were commercially zoned. Adoption of
the new Development Code in 2012 changed their zoning to “mixed use,” with incentives provided
for housing development. The 2012 Code also created specific incentives for affordable housing,
improving the prospects (and increasing the capacity) for residential uses on these sites.
Live Work Potential
Table 4-2 identifies the potential for 173 live-work units on 18 acres of land. These properties have
been designated by the Concord General Plan for “Industrial Mixed Use,” explicitly acknowledging
their potential for live-work based on their surrounding land uses, proximity to transit and services,
and the condition of existing structures. Several parcels on Arnold Industrial Way are included, as
are properties in the Whitman Road area. Densities in these areas fall below the 30 unit/acre
“default” density standard, and thus the live-work sites are not counted in the tally of potential sites
for low and very low income housing.
Sites Not Quantified
In addition to the 4,523 potential housing units quantified in Appendix A, there are other sites in
Concord that are likely to come on line during the 2014-2022 planning period. The sites described
below are either not yet zoned for housing or are still in the planning stages. They have not been
quantified for RHNA purposes, but may provide supplemental opportunities to meet the RHNA and
expand the range of housing choices available in the city.
Concord Reuse Project
The 5,046-acre former Concord Naval Weapons Station is one of the largest development
opportunities in Northern California. In 2012, the City of Concord adopted an Area Plan for the reuse
of the site (the “Concord Reuse Project” Area Plan), along with new General Plan land use
designations and policies for the site. Approximately 69 percent of the site will be dedicated to open
space, parks, and recreational facilities. The remaining 31 percent will be developed with transit-
oriented mixed use neighborhoods and employment centers, along with ancillary public facilities and
services.
Plans for the Reuse Project area include over 12,200 housing units, developed at densities up to
150 units per acre. An estimated 25 percent of the future housing units—more than 3,000 units in
total—are slated to be affordable. Buildout of the project will depend on market demand, but is
anticipated to occur over a period of several decades.
                                                    66

The Reuse Project Area is currently zoned “Study Area” and is not yet available for development. The
site is still owned by the Navy and is undergoing environmental studies and clean-up. The City
anticipates transfer of the site from military to civilian ownership during 2015. The City is in the
process of considering proposals from master developers to conduct more detailed design and
infrastructure planning studies. Once basic infrastructure is in place, it is expected that specialty
developers will be selected for specific parts of the property. More specific plans for housing would
be developed at that time.
Given the timeline for property clean-up, transfer, planning, and improvement, the first units are not
likely to come on line until after 2017. However, at least some portion of the RHNA is likely to be met
on the site during the 2014-2022 planning period. The City estimates that 10% of the site’s
potential (1,220 units) will be available by 2018-2022, but this potential has not been included in
the quantified site inventory since the zoning is unlikely to be in place within 12 months after
Housing Element adoption.
Coast Guard Housing
The US Coast Guard manages a 60-acre residential community located on the east side of Olivera
Road adjacent to the Reuse Project Area. The property consists of two distinct neighborhoods:
Victory Village, which includes 234 apartments, and Quinault Village, with 82 single level duplexes.
Quinault Village, which is the northerly of the two neighborhoods, is approximately 30 acres. Most of
the units are not occupied, and much of the site consists of open space and large common yard
areas. The site is located adjacent to the parking lot for the North Concord/ Martinez BART station
and is approximately 1/3 mile from the station platform. While there are no immediate plans for the
property, it offers the potential for reuse with transit-oriented development.
It is possible that the Coast Guard will declare as excess all or part of its housing complex before the
end of the planning period in 2022. The site is currently zoned for public/quasi-public uses and has
a General Plan designation of “Military.” A General Plan Amendment and rezoning action would be
required before civilian housing development could be considered.
BART Parking Lots
Concord’s two BART stations are both surrounded by expansive surface parking lots owned by BART.
Development on these sites, accompanied by parking structures and other transit improvements,
would be consistent with BART’s transit oriented development policies.
The Downtown Concord BART station parking facilities contain 2,397 spaces and include a multi-
story parking structure and approximately 10 acres of surface parking lots. Approximately 4.5 acres
of BART-owned surface parking is located east of the tracks along Oakland Avenue. Approximately
5.5 acres of BART-owned surface parking is located west of the tracks along both sides of Oak Street
and Grant Street, and south of Park Street.
The Downtown Concord Specific Plan has identified the potential for future development on the
parking lots, potentially including high-density housing. The properties already have a General Plan
                                                       67

and zoning designation of Downtown Mixed Use, permitting densities of 100 units per acre. Even
higher densities could be achieved using Transit Station overlay and affordable housing density
bonuses. There are no specific BART-related plans for the parking lots at this time.
The North Concord BART parking lots contain 1,977 spaces on over 15 acres, generally located
south of the station platform. The parking lots are included within the boundary of the Reuse Project
Area, but are owned by BART rather than the US Navy. Collaborative planning between the City and
BART could result in development during the time horizon of the Housing Element. The parking lots
have a General Plan designation of “Concord Reuse Project – Transit Oriented Development” and are
zoned “Study Area.”
Considerations in Determining the Capacity of Housing Sites
The 187 housing sites listed in the City’s opportunity site inventory include:
        61 sites zoned to allow non-residential uses as well as residential uses;
        Several sites which have development constraints, such as high noise levels (e.g., BART
         tracks or highways), proximity to the Concord Fault, and steep slopes.
        110 sites which are smaller than one acre in size
        47 sites which consist of adjoining parcels in multiple ownership
This section of the Housing Element examines the extent to which these characteristics create
potential impediments to housing development. It also documents development trends and
market conditions to demonstrate the viability of these sites for future development. Finally, it
discusses aspects of the new Development Code which mitigate potential constraints by creating
incentives for residential development.
Feasibility of Residential Uses in Mixed Use Areas
As discussed earlier, the City’s Downtown Mixed Use (DMX), Downtown Pedestrian (DP), and
Commercial Mixed Use (CMX) zoned sites will accommodate a majority of the housing need for
lower income units based on their minimum and average expected densities. This analysis is
based upon two assumptions: Firstly, most sites identified in these districts will be developed as
residential; and secondly, developers will build to the average expected densities for each of these
districts.
The first of these assumptions is prudent in light of recent trends. As shown in Table 4.3, most
proposed mixed use projects in Downtown Concord between 2006 and 2010 were residential
projects rather than office, retail, or service uses. The total retail/commercial portion in each case
did not exceed 10 percent, and commercial uses were only proposed on ground floors that faced a
major street. The Enclave Townhomes project, for example, which was zoned for commercial use
at the time the project was proposed, is 100 percent residential. The proposed Clayton Market
project (a mixed use project that was not constructed) was 94 percent residential, while Mira Vista
(expired) and Renaissance Square were 98 percent residential and 96 percent residential,
                                                     68

respectively. Projects proposed since 2010, including Renaissance Phase II, have had similar
characteristics. Additionally, every project exceeded the midpoint of the density range for the zone
it was located in.

 Notes:
 (a) Mira Vista was proposed on what is now the Grocery Outlet store on Willow Pass Road. Although the project was not built, it
 would have added 155 units on a 1.5 acre site with ground floor retail along the Willow Pass frontage.
 (b) The Clayton Market project was proposed on a 1.2 acre site at 1810 Market Street. The project would have included ground floor
 retail facing Clayton Road, with residential above. It was not submitted for approval.

There are several other reasons why the majority of mixed-use sites are likely to develop as
exclusively multi-family residential during the planning period:
      1. Mixed use zones have no minimum commercial component requirement, so developers
            are able to develop 100 percent residential (i.e. there is no vertical mixed use requirement
            on mixed use sites).
      2. The City has adopted minimum densities of 33 units per net acre on the DMX and DP sites,
            and 11 units per net acre on the CMX sites.
      3. The General Plan supports residential development in mixed-use areas with incentives and
            programs for reduced parking and other cost-reducing measures.
      4. The majority of mixed-use sites are not prime corner sites favored by commercial
            establishments.
      5. The sites are located in close proximity to where other new residential development has
            been built or approved.
      6. The City adopted a Downtown Concord Specific Plan in June 2014 which promotes transit-
            oriented development and identifies many of the sites identified in the Housing Element as
            locations where housing is the desired future land use.
Thus, it is reasonable to assume that while not all future mixed use sites will be developed as
majority residential-use projects, the vast majority of them will be developed as such with densities
at or above the density range mid-point.
The second assumption (developers will build to the midpoint of the range or higher) is supported
by a review of recent projects in the city, as shown in Table 4.4. The results of this review revealed
that developers typically build to about 60 to 65 percent of what is allowed. Even higher density
                                                                    69
development may result in the future, with implementation of new housing policies and greater
awareness by developers of the development incentives in the Development Code.

Calculated Unit Capacity
The calculation of dwelling unit capacity, as shown in Appendix A, is based on net acreage and
zoning densities. The City has removed from the inventory those sites which did not have realistic
development potential. The calculation of ‘developable units’ includes a 25 to 50 percent
reduction in acreage to account for streets, sidewalks, and other improvements, as well as site
constraints that may reduce the overall developable area.
As an example, on Site 3.3, City staff looked at the size (0.36 acres), multiplied it by an factor of
0.75 (assuming only 75 percent of the site is usable even though the entire lot has no constraints),
and then by the average density of 24 units/acre to get 6.48, and finally rounding it down to get 6
units. The unit count for other sites was estimated in a similar fashion, with a factor of between
0.50 and 1.00 for each site. The upper range of 1.00 was typically used for Downtown sites where
no setbacks are required and no site or infrastructure improvements are needed. The lower range
of 0.50 was typically used for sites where setbacks, site, or infrastructure improvements are
needed, or where there are constraints such as the Concord Fault Alquist Priolo Special Studies
Zone, elevated BART tracks adjacent to the site, or overhead transmission lines. Additionally, if
there are existing residential units located on underutilized sites, these units are subtracted from
the total unit count.
Consolidation of Small, Adjoining Lots into One Larger Development Site
Some of the sites identified in the inventory consist of individual parcels of less than 0.5 acres
that are located adjacent to one another. These parcels have been grouped together, recognizing
that housing development would be more viable on a larger parcel. In some cases, the parcels are
in common ownership and would not need to be consolidated. In other cases, the sites are under
multiple ownerships and have different land uses. Site consolidation was determined to be viable
in these locations based on field observations, the compatibility of uses, the condition of
structures, and the location and configuration of the parcels.
                                                    70

As noted above, 47 of the sites are comprised of parcels with multiple owners. There are 157
separate owners associated with these sites. Of the 47 sites with multiple owners, 29 are zoned
at densities of 30 units/ acre or more. These sites represent 1,041 units of the 4,529 unit
capacity shown in the inventory (capacity for 3,488 units is associated with sites with just one
owner, which is still greater than the RHNA). Of the sites with multiple owners, 20 have two
owners, 12 have three owners, nine have four owners, and six have five owners. None of the sites
have more than five owners.
A review of the sites after consolidation shows that they not only have the capacity to
accommodate the RHNA requirements for lower income households, they also have the capacity to
accommodate these requirements on larger sites where affordable housing is most viable. Of the
75 sites zoned to accommodate 30 units/acre or higher (e.g., the “default” density”), there are 25
large enough to accommodate at least 40 units. Collectively, these 25 sites can accommodate
2,717 units, which is roughly double the RHNA for low and very low income households.
The 40-unit threshold reflects the fact that most affordable housing in Concord and similar Central
County communities that use local, state and federal financial resources include 40 to 80 units or
more. The range may be a bit higher (50 to 80) statewide, but in urban infill situations a 40 to 50
unit size range for affordable housing project is viable. Sites capable of supporting at least 40
multi-family units are located in the following General Plan categories:8
     1,876 units in Downtown Mixed Use (DMX)
     402 units in High Density Residential (HDR)
     60 units in Medium Density Residential (MDR)
     50 units in Downtown Pedestrian (DP)
     329 units in Commercial Mixed Use (CMU).
Under Government Code section 65583.2, all of these units can be counted as potentially
affordable, as they are on sites where the density is greater than 30 dwelling units/acre.9 In other
words, these sites satisfy both the minimum density requirement (30 du/acre and above) and the
minimum size requirement (must be large enough to develop 16 units and above) to be counted
towards accommodating affordable units. The actual number of affordable units that can be
accommodated could be higher than 2,717 since the unit count for sites here does not take into
account density bonuses and other incentives.
Units affordable to lower-income households may also be developed on smaller sites (between 5
units and 39 units). There are 45 sites zoned for multi-family or mixed use in this category, with
the capacity for 814 units. Assuming 10 percent of them are affordable, 81 units may be
produced. An analysis of units produced by small development projects (between 5 units and 39
units) during the previous housing planning period shows that this assumption is reasonable.
8 Excludes committed projects such as Renaissance Phase II and Palmera.
9 The calculated density for each site is shown in Appendix A.
                                                            71

From 1999 to 2006, 29 units or 8 percent of all residential projects with 5 to 39 units were
affordable. Moreover, under the City’s inclusionary housing requirements, for-sale projects are
required to set aside at least 10 percent of the units as affordable (or contribute to affordable
housing production through in-lieu fees).
Counting the 2,717 units that can be developed on sites that allow 40 or more units, and 81 units
that might be developed on sites that allow 5 to 39 units, the City can accommodate a total of
2,798 units. This is more than double the RHNA requirement of 1,236 units for the very low and
low-income groups. In sum, this Housing Element has made available an inventory of sites that is
sufficient to accommodate the current RHNA.
Rehabilitation
During the 2014-2022 planning period, Concord will continue to assist in the rehabilitation of older
units as it did during the prior planning period. Although the City does not intend to count these
units toward its fulfillment of the RHNA since it has provided adequate sites, the implementation of
such programs can further the City’s achievement of its housing conservation, preservation, and
rehabilitation objectives.
Market Trends and Incentives
The underlying assumption in the estimate of potential capacity of available land based on
development size, is that individual sites can and will be consolidated into larger sites.
Development trends in Concord in the past several years indicate that this is a very likely
possibility. Many housing projects, either proposed or actually built, involved the consolidation of
several smaller adjoining lots into a larger site, often with different land ownership at the time
when it was proposed.
Table 4.5 shows some of the projects that required site consolidation. The developer for the
Esplanade Condominiums project, for example, proposed to purchase and consolidate 10
adjoining sites totaling 3.1 acres. Other projects similarly consolidated several sites into a larger
site. To be sure, there were also projects that were built on single lots. But as the City becomes
more populated and large, single lots become more scarce, the market trend is towards site
consolidation.

There is also a trend towards transit-oriented, mixed use development in Concord, as there is in
many Bay Area cities. Much of the residential development activity in the city is taking place in and
around the Downtown area and close to the BART station. This trend started with the construction
of Legacy/ Park Central in 2001. It is a four-story project located just a few blocks from BART and
a few blocks from Todos Santos Plaza. The units wrap around two multi-story garages and share
common amenities and open spaces.
In the ensuing years, several other projects were either constructed or proposed that continued
this trend. These projects are profiled below:
          The Renaissance Square project was a five story multifamily development with two levels
           of subterranean parking. The project is being built in two phases. Phase I, with 131
           apartments is complete and Phase II, which will add another 179 units, is expected to
           complete construction in 2015. Phase I includes 4,500 square feet of retail floor area at
           the street level. When it was initially proposed, the project was in the Downtown Business
           (DB) zoning district with an “Office” use overlay that permitted office, restaurant, religious,
           nonprofit, and public uses, and residential use up to 43 units/acre. The site was
           subsequently rezoned to Downtown Mixed Use, allowing densities up to 100 units per acre.
           Leasing of ground floor retail space proved difficult and spaces were converted to
           residential units, after the project was completed.
          The Mira Vista Condominiums project was a 155 unit mixed use retail and condominium
           project proposed for a site immediately west of Renaissance Square. Like Renaissance
           Square, the applicant proposed a five story building with two levels of recessed parking
           and retail space at the podium level. The 3,657 square feet of retail space was intended to
           help sustain an economically viable downtown district, offering a broad range of goods and
           services. The proposed density was 97 units/acre. The project was withdrawn due to the
           recession and the existing retail building on the site is now being used as a Grocery Outlet
           store.
          Likewise, Clayton Market was another mixed use project proposed in Downtown Concord.
           The applicant proposed 41 units of one to three bedroom condominiums on a 1.2 acre lot,
           with 5,500 square feet of retail space at the ground floor level. It should be noted that the
                                                               73

         project was a schematic proposal by a developer that requested a General Plan land use
         designation change during the General Plan Update. The City made the requested change
         and the site is now zoned Commercial Mixed Use. This project did not move forward due to
         the recession.
Since 2000, the City has taken several major steps to promote mixed use. In 2007, the City
adopted the 2030 General Plan, whose goals included promoting transit-oriented development
around BART and mixed uses in Downtown. Besides establishing a comprehensive set of policies
to encourage mixed use, the Plan created new land use designations that allowed for mixed use.
In 2013, the City adopted a new Development Code that established new zoning designations for
Downtown and Concord’s commercial corridors. Mixed uses were not only permitted, they were
incentivized through higher allowable floor area ratios. Parking requirements were reduced around
transit stations, and numerous incentives were created for developing affordable housing or
including affordable units in new mixed income projects.
Zoning incentives for multi-family development on commercial sites are discussed in more detail in
Chapter 5. These incentives include:
        Allowing densities of up to 100 units per acre in the DMX and DP zones, and densities of
         40 units per acre in the CMX zone
        Requiring a minimum density of 33 units per acre in the DMX and DP zones, and a
         minimum of 11 units per acre in the CMX zone
        Allowing residential uses on the ground floor
        Allowing floor area ratios up to 6.0 and building heights of 200 feet in the DMX zone
Further incentives are offered for projects in which at least 40 percent of the units are affordable
to low and very low income households. These include a waiver of the use permit requirement for
ground floor residential, reduced parking requirements, guaranteed height bonuses in the CMX
and DP zones, and reduced open space requirements.
In 2012, the City initiated a planning process for its Downtown area, with a focus on encouraging
transit-oriented development and filling gaps in the urban fabric between the Plaza and the BART
station. The Plan is expected to be adopted in 2014, providing additional policy and program
guidance to encourage mixed use. Although no zoning changes are proposed, the Plan will identify
capital improvements, design guidelines, and transportation improvements which will support
private investment and create a positive environment for housing development.
Developer interest in mixed use developments is also driven by Concord’s increasing lack of space
for large tract single-family developments. As land becomes more scarce, many developers
increasingly look to opportunities in Downtown infill sites. This trend is expected to continue as
time passes.
                                                    74

Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Environmental factors, such as topography, soils, landslides and seismic hazards, and noise, as
well as the lack of infrastructure, such as roads, water, and sewer lines, are potential constraints
to housing development in the City. However, most of the housing sites identified by the City are
not affected by such constraints. The 2030 General Plan has taken these factors into account in
establishing policies and land use designations for residential and mixed use development. Where
development is planned, any site constraints that remain can be mitigated through appropriate
design and environmental planning.
Noise
A portion of the City is exposed to noise from vehicular traffic, specifically from SR-242, SR-4 and I-
680. Other noise sources include overhead aircraft noise related to Buchanan Field Air- port and
rail noise associated with the BART train tracks. All of these noise sources may have an impact on
adjacent residential areas. The Concord General Plan has different noise exposure criteria for
different residential land uses. For single-family homes, duplex, and mobile homes, the “normally
acceptable” noise levels range from 50 to 60 dB. Noise levels from 60 to 70 dB are considered
“conditionally acceptable”, and noise levels between 70 to 75 dB are considered “normally
unacceptable”.
For multi-family residential areas, noise levels from 50 to 65 dB are “normally acceptable”. Noise
levels from 65 to 70 dB are considered “conditionally acceptable”, and noise levels between 70 to
75 dB are considered “normally unacceptable”. For mixed-use and high density residential areas,
noise level from 50 to 65 dB are “normally acceptable”. Noise levels from 65 to 75 dB are
considered “conditionally acceptable”, and noise levels between 75 to 80 dB are considered
“normally unacceptable”. Figure 7-8 of the General Plan shows acceptable noise levels for these
three residential land use types.
In all, only 1.5 percent of the Concord planning area is exposed to noise above 65 dB. These areas
are mainly situated within very close distance of busy roads, BART train tracks and the Buchanan
Field Airport. Of the potential housing sites identified, about one-third are within areas subject to
over 65 dB noise levels. These include sites along BART and sites fronting major thoroughfares
such as Clayton Road, Monument Boulevard, and Willow Pass Road.
The 2030 General Plan has included a number of policies to reduce the impact of noise on
housing development adjacent to noise sources. These include: requiring a noise study and
mitigation measures for all projects that have a noise exposure greater than 70dB, requiring noise
attenuation measures in new homes located on arterial streets, and requiring noise sources to use
best available control technology (BACT) to minimize noise emissions. These policies may be
found in the Safety and Noise Element.
                                                    75

Geologic and Seismic Hazards
Geologic hazards, including landslides, mudslides, and erosion, can be related to seismic activity
but can also occur independently. The highest potential for future landslides exists in the upland
areas along the flanks of Mt. Diablo, at the east and southern edges of the planning area. Pockets
of high landslide potential also exist on sloping terrain, such as the intersection of Port Chicago
Way and SR-4.
Like most Bay Area cities, Concord is susceptible to earthquakes. A number of regional and local
faults are close-to or within the planning area. The Concord Fault runs in a northwesterly to
southeasterly direction through the City, and the Hayward Fault is located approximately 15 miles
to the west. In general, the western portion of Concord is more susceptible to earthquakes than
the eastern portion due to underlying soils and seismicity. A “Special Studies Zone” (SSZ) has
been designated along the Concord Fault, and there are limitations on construction within this area
to protect life and property. As noted in Appendix A, several of the housing sites fall within the SSZ
and could be subject to costlier construction codes or open space requirements along the fault
line.
To mitigate potential impacts from an earthquake, General Plan policies require a thorough
evaluation of geologic and soil conditions as part of the development review process. All
development must meet applicable State and local building standards. The Safety and Noise
Element may be consulted for geologic and seismic safety policies.
Slope Considerations
In general, areas with significant slope constrain housing development by reducing the potential
number of units per acre and increasing the cost of construction. Not only do hillside areas hinder
development of high density housing, they also discourage low-income housing as the cost of
construction increases. Currently, most of the hillside areas are zoned as permanent open space.
Of all the potential housing sites identified, only about 10 percent are in areas with greater than 15
percent slope. These are largely single family sites with low density residential zoning rather than
multi-family or mixed use sites. To mitigate any potential impacts from hazards resulting from
building on slopes, the General Plan sets specific requirements for development on hillsides and
prohibits development on slopes over 30 percent.
Flood Hazards
Flood-prone areas in Concord are generally located in low-lying areas and in areas close to
shorelines, streams and creeks. According to flood zone maps provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Authority (FEMA), the areas north of Mallard Reservoir to Suisun Bay, along Pacheco
Creek and near Buchanan Field Airport, lie on a 100-year flood plain. These areas are located
north of SR-4 and are currently zoned for Business Park use. Hence, they pose no danger to
housing, nor do they affect land where housing might be built in the future. However, there are
many creeks in the City near residential areas that could flood after heavy storms. This is
especially so if these storms occur during high tides which could reduce the ability of the storm
                                                     76

drains to conduct water. Of the potential housing sites identified, only about four percent are
within a 100-year flood plain.
The City has adopted a Flood Management Ordinance and a Stormwater Management and
Discharge Control Ordinance to manage storm water runoff. General Plan policies require
adequate building setbacks for development adjacent to creek banks and engineering standards
which protect against flooding. Other policies are also in place to reduce the potential impacts
associated with stormwater runoff due to new or increased intensity of urban land uses. The
Safety and Noise Element and the Public Facilities and Utilities Element of the General Plan
provide details on flood risk reduction policies.
Utilities
Water. The Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) is the City’s water supplier, providing water service
to the City from the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta. CCWD serves treated and raw (untreated)
water to over 500,000 people in a service area that includes Concord as well as Clayton, Clyde,
Pacheco, Port Costa and parts of Martinez, Pleasant Hill and Walnut Creek. In addition, the District
sells wholesale treated water to Antioch, the California Cities Water Company in Bay Point and
Brentwood.
CCWD has a water supply contract, recently renewed to 2045, with the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation, for water from the Central Valley Project that provides up to 195,000 acre feet per
year. According to the Concord General Plan EIR, as supplemented through 2012, CCWD does not
envision any constraints to providing water to infill developments in Concord between now and
2030. CCWD has considered the growth allowed by the Concord General Plan, including the
Concord Reuse Project, in its Urban Water Management Plan.
Wastewater. The Central Contra Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD) is the wastewater treatment
provider for the City as well as nine other municipalities in Contra Costa County. The CCCSD
wastewater treatment plant, located northeast of the Interstate 680/SR 4 interchange in
unincorporated Martinez, currently treats approximately 45 million gallons per day (mgd) of
wastewater. The 2012 General Plan Supplemental EIR indicates plant capacity is 55 MGD, with
240 MGD of wet weather flow. The SEIR indicates no anticipated capacity constraints at the
treatment plant, provided that growth occurs in the locations identified in the General Plan. As
such, wastewater discharge and treatment capacity is expected to be sufficient for the housing
planning period ending in 2023.
Electricity and Gas. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) currently provides gas and electric services to
Concord homes and businesses and is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC). PG&E obtains its energy supplies from power plants and natural gas fields in northern
California and delivered through high voltage transmission lines. Electrical power is provided to the
City of Concord from various distribution feeders located throughout the City.
                                                   77

The availability of electricity and gas services is not expected to become an issue during the
housing planning period since almost all land inventory sites are located within urban infill areas
close to existing development. If increased capacity is needed, PG&E can increase demand from
regional power plants and natural gas fields or construct new electrical substations in Concord as
necessary.
Utility Equipment On Site. Among the sites in the land inventory, two are partially located below
high voltage power lines. Another two sites have PG&E pipes on the ground. All four sites are
located in the southeastern part of the City. Neither the high voltage lines nor PG&E pipes
presents safety hazards for residential uses, and the land area beneath the lines and over the
pipes has been deducted from the calculation of developable area. These sites may be less
attractive for developers due to the on-site constraints. They have not been included in the list of
sites where zoned density exceeds 30 units per acre.
Roads
Almost all the potential housing sites are infill sites located in existing built-out areas of the City.
Only a small fraction of sites are inaccessible or land-locked. In such cases, developers must
obtain access to a public street by obtaining easements. Alternatively, land owners could
consolidate sites to gain access to roads so this does not present an obstacle to housing
development.
                                                      78
5. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
The availability of federal, State, and local financing resources, as well as financing from
private lenders and non-profit organizations, is essential to the construction and
rehabilitation of housing. The success of housing projects is also affected by governmental
constraints (such as land use controls and development fees) and non-governmental
constraints (such as the housing market and environmental constraints). These factors will be
discussed in this chapter.
Financing and Subsidy Sources
Federal, State and local agencies provide a wide variety of resources to help support the
construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of housing units for lower-income households in
Concord. Some of these resources are made available to local tenants, owners, and
developers of affordable housing through City and County programs and services. Although
there are a wide range of programs, the availability of funding through these programs is
typically inadequate to satisfy all needs. As a result, there is a considerable amount of
competition for program funds that are available, and each development often needs to draw
upon multiple resources to be financially feasible.
Federal Resources
The federal government offers a wide variety of housing resources. The mortgage interest
deduction and the real estate tax deduction are two of the most common resources for
homeowners and are provided through the income tax code. The deductions promote
homeownership and reduce tax liabilities for home-owning taxpayers and apply to a large
number of households nationwide.
In addition to tax deductions, the federal government provides housing assistance to California
jurisdictions through a number of programs. Like State programs, federal programs often
change in terms of program details, application procedures, and the amount of subsidy
dollars available. For detailed descriptions, current subsidy levels, and up-to-date application
procedures, refer to program literature available online from HUD at http://www.hud.gov.
Some of the largest programs, based on current funding levels, include:
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG). Through the Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG), the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD) funds
local community development activities such as affordable housing, anti-poverty programs, and
infrastructure development. Cities with populations of over 50,000 receive CDBG funds
directly from HUD while smaller cities apply to the County or State for a portion of the funding
that is allocated and administered by those entities. HUD makes allocations based on a
formula that takes population, poverty, and housing distress into account. CDBG funds can be
                                                 79
used for a variety of housing efforts including activities aimed at reducing costs for private
development (helping fund site acquisition, improvement, and other soft costs); housing
acquisition and rehabilitation through short and long-term loans, grants or loan guarantees;
direct payment of rent or mortgage and housing counseling services; activities relating to
energy conservation and renewable energy resources; and fair housing activities. CDBG funds
are best used in combination with other subsidy sources or to provide pre-development
funding to initiate housing development.
The City’s Community Grants Division of the Parks and Recreation Department administers the
CDBG program for the City of Concord. CDBG funds in Concord have been used to support
multifamily housing acquisition and both multifamily and single-family rehabilitation activities
(including grants and low-interest loans), as well as lead-based paint abatement activities. CDBG
funds also fund programs and services for homeless individuals and families, people at risk of
homelessness, and other special needs groups, in collaboration with the other entitlement
communities of Antioch, Pittsburg, Richmond, Walnut Creek, and the County. Program and service
priorities are established and implemented through the five-year strategic plan of the Contra Costa
Consolidated Plan. In fiscal year 2013-2014, Concord budgeted $229,351 of its allocated CDBG
funds on housing.
Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) Program. HUD’s Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program
provides funds for emergency shelters and transitional housing. The ESG Program strives to
help homeless individuals and families, including victims of domestic violence, youth, people
with mental illness, families with children, and veterans. Grantees use ESG funds to
rehabilitate and operate these facilities, provide essential social services, and prevent
homelessness. ESG also provides short-term homeless prevention assistance to persons at
imminent risk of losing their own housing due to eviction, foreclosure, or utility shutoffs.
The Contra Costa County Department of Conservation and Development, Housing Division,
receives ESG funds from HUD and makes them available to eligible recipients serving all areas
of the County. Agencies and organizations which actually run the homeless assistance projects,
apply for ESG funds to the County. Grantees must match ESG grant funds dollar for dollar with
their own locally generated amounts.
Although the City does not apply for ESG funding, non-profit agencies that operate in the City
regularly apply for and receive funding from the ESG program. In the 2012-13 fiscal year, for
example, Echo Fair Housing received $14,000 to provide counseling on housing discrimination
issues, Contra Costa Health Services received $12,150 to provide interim housing for adults,
and Shelter Inc. received $12,000 to provide homeless prevention services.
HOME Investment Partnership Act. HOME is the largest federal block grant to State and local
governments designed exclusively to create affordable housing for low-income households.
Also a HUD program, HOME funds must be spent only on housing and are intended to provide
incentives for the acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental and owner-
occupied residential units. HOME requires local governments to provide matching funds,
                                                   80

though the matching ratio depends on the use of the funds. The HOME program is
administered in Contra Costa County through the County Department of Conservation and
Development (DCD), which selects projects throughout the County to receive funding (excluding
Richmond, which manages its own HOME funding).
The County uses HOME funds towards the following:
          Acquire, rehabilitate, and construct new multifamily rental housing.
          Assist the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless by providing emergency,
           transitional, and permanent affordable housing with appropriate supportive services.
          Assist Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDO). CHDO’s are funded by
           the HOME Program, which is obligated to reserve 15 percent of its annual funding to
           support housing construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation projects by certified CHDO’s.
           According to the County and HUD, there are no certified CHDO’s in Concord at the
           present.10
Housing for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA). The HOPWA program provides funds for the acquisition,
conversion, lease and repair of facilities to provide housing and services for lower-income
persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. Funds are provided on an annual basis to
the City of Oakland for the Alameda/Contra Costa eligible metropolitan area. Contra Costa
County receives approximately $450,000 each year.11 The HOPWA funds are primarily used for
the development of permanent housing. Some funds are used for support services, which help
people with HIV/AIDS obtain or maintain housing.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). The LIHTC program is a large federal and State
housing subsidy program that provides substantial financing for the development of
affordable housing. It provides tax credits to the private sector for the construction or
acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. These tax credits are crucial to the
success of affordable housing developers, who sell credits directly to corporations and
private investors or receive the equity from one of a number of investment entities now
making tax credits available.
To be eligible for a tax credit, 20 percent of the units in a housing development must rent to
very-low-income households earning less than 50 percent of area median incomes, or 40
percent of the units must rent for incomes under 60 percent of the median. California law
also requires that developments retain these levels of affordability for at least 55 years. Several
affordable apartment projects in Concord have been funded in part by LIHTC proceeds,
including Lakeside Apartments (in 2004), La Vista Apartments (2007), and Windsor Apartments
(2007).

                                                        81

Mortgage Credit Certificates. The Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCC), administered by
the Contra Costa County Department of Conservation and Development, provides financial
assistance to "First time homebuyers" for the purchase of new or existing single-family homes
though a federal income tax credit. Under the MCC program, the maximum tax credit
available is equal to 20 percent of the annual interest paid on the borrower's mortgage. This
enables first-time buyers to qualify for a larger mortgage than otherwise possible, and can
thus bring homeownership within reach of some lower-income households.
MCCs are available only to first-time homebuyers and have a number of application
requirements, and are therefore available to a limited number of households. Authority for the
issuance of MCCs must be obtained from the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee
(CDLAC) and use of MCCs involves converting some mortgage revenue bond funding authority.
Mortgage Revenue Bond Program. The County has a Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program to
help support the development of affordable housing. Under the MRB program, the County
issues tax-exempt bonds for affordable housing projects which meet program requirements.
In particular, the Multifamily Residential Rental Housing Revenue Bond Program assists
developers of multifamily rental housing in increasing the supply of affordable rental units
available to qualified households. The proceeds from bond sales are used for new
construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation of multifamily housing developments.
Loans under the multifamily bond program will generally be amortized for 30 years and will be
due at the expiration of the credit enhancement. In recent years, the County has issued
bonds as small as $425,000 for a ten unit development and up to $125 million for a larger
project.
Section 8 Assistance. HUD’s Section 8 housing choice voucher program is the federal
government's major program for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and the
disabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market. Since housing
assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find their
own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The participant is
free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program and is not limited to
units located in subsidized housing projects. Households are provided with vouchers that
are paid to private market-rate landlords, who are then reimbursed by HUD. Section 8
assistance in Concord is administered by the Contra Costa County Housing Authority. As of
March 2014, there were 965 families receiving Section 8 assistance in Concord.12
State Resources
State agencies play an important role in providing housing assistance by allocating federal
housing funds and making loans available to affordable housing developments. The three

                                                       82

principal agencies involved are the State Treasurer’s Office, the California Housing Finance
Agency (CHFA), and HCD.
Programs for housing assistance change frequently and detailed descriptions of programs,
application procedures and amounts of subsidy available are provided by the concerned
agencies. The major sources of State housing assistance include:
The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee (CDLAC). CDLAC, an agency within the Treasurer’s
Office, is responsible for overseeing private bond issuances.
The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC). CTCAC, also an agency within the
Treasurer’s Office, is responsible for allocating federal and State tax credits that are crucial to
the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing developments. See the discussion of
Low-Income Housing Tax Credits above for additional information.
California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA). CalHFA offers a variety of programs to fund new
construction and resale of single-family housing for first-time homebuyers. CalHFA’s 30-year
Fixed Mortgage Program loan offers up to 95% financing with a 30-year term and a low,
fixed interest rate. CalHFA also provides government insured and guaranteed loans and
down-payment assistance loan programs, including the Affordable Housing Partnership
Program (AHPP) whereby a deferred payment subordinate loan from a locality is utilized by a
first-time homebuyer to assist with down payment or closing costs.
Department of California Housing and Community Development (HCD). HCD administers more
than 20 programs that award loans and grants for the construction, acquisition,
rehabilitation and preservation of affordable rental and ownership housing, homeless
shelters, transitional housing, public facilities and infrastructure, and the development of
jobs for lower income workers. With rare exceptions, these loans and grants are not made to
individuals, but to local public agencies, nonprofit and for-profit housing developers, and
service providers. In many cases these agencies then provide funds to individual end users.
The HCD Financial Assistance website (http://www.hcd.ca.gov/fa/) provides current
information on the various grants and funding programs available.
City of Concord
Mobile-home Rent Stabilization. The City has a Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Ordinance in its
Municipal Code (Chapter 58) to regulate mobile home rent increases. The ordinance controls
the frequency of rent increases and ties any adjustments to the consumer price index. This
policy covers all 11 mobile home parks in the City, which together offer approximately 1,800
mobile home spaces.
City of Concord Redevelopment Agency. In 2011, the California State legislature mandated the
dissolution of all redevelopment agencies (RDAs) throughout the State. Prior to 2011, RDAs in
                                                  83

California jurisdictions, including Concord, generated significant revenue for affordable housing
through affordable housing set-aside funds. RDAs also had the ability to acquire and assemble
land for redevelopment purposes, including the construction of new housing, and were able
to provide low-or no-cost land subsidies for affordable housing and other forms of assistance
to aid in the preservation and upgrading of the redevelopment project area. Similar to many
jurisdictions throughout the State, Concord will seek to identify new funding sources and
develop new strategies to facilitate affordable housing production following the loss of the
City’s RDA.
Financing and Subsidy Sources
The following table shows the amount of funds that are available under each program which
have not been legally obligated for other purposes and therefore could be used to preserve at-
risk, assisted housing units. However, use of these funds to preserve at-risk units must be
balanced with use of these funds to for other housing programs, such as construction of new
affordable units.

Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Under State law, the Housing Element must include an analysis of the opportunities for energy
conservation in residential development (Government Code Section 65583 (a)(7)). Curbing energy
use in residential construction helps to meet environmental goals through a reduction in greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions and can help to make housing more affordable by lowering utility costs.
GHG emissions consist of a number of gasses, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane,
that are produced as by-products in the combustion of fossil fuels in power stations as well as cars.
GHGs are widely considered to be harmful to the environment, and, in large quantities, may also be
detrimental to human health.
                                                                  84

In 2006, the Governor of California signed into law the California Climate Solutions Act, which
requires the reduction of statewide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. In September
2008, California passed SB 375, the nation’s first law to control greenhouse gas emissions by better
coordinating land use and transportation planning and providing incentives for local governments
and developers to focus new development in infill areas near transit, as discussed in Chapter 1.
In addition to reducing GHG emissions, planning for energy conservation can reduce utility and
maintenance costs, which in turn reduces housing costs. Depending on the age and condition of the
home and the number and type of appliances, energy costs can represent more than 25 percent of
overall monthly housing costs. As a result, the incorporation of energy saving features, energy saving
materials, and efficient systems in new and existing homes can have a significant impact on housing
affordability.
This section of the Housing Element will provide information on public and private efforts to reduce
residential energy use.
Market Factors to Facilitate Energy Conservation
Concurrent with governmental efforts to reduce energy consumption in new and existing structures,
the development industry is becoming increasingly aware of opportunities for energy conservation in
both residential and commercial development. Many new developments are being planned with
energy-efficient features, such as solar panels, insulation, energy-efficient appliances, and building
orientations that provide passive solar energy benefits. Many of these strategies can be utilized to
increase energy efficiency in existing homes in addition to new developments. Developers are also
responding to increased market demand for mixed-use land use patterns that allow residents to
walk, bicycle, or use transit to access places of work, shopping, or other services, thereby reducing
car trips and the associated GHG emissions.
Public Utility Programs
Gas and Electricity. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) is the gas and electricity provider for much of
Northern California, including Concord. PG&E offers a range of programs designed to assist
residential consumers with energy conservation.
        The Residential Rebates Program offers rebates on a first-come first-serve basis to
         residential customers that purchase and install specified energy-efficient appliances,
         including clothes washers, water heaters, refrigerators, and pool filtration pumps.
        The Energy Efficiency Rebates for Multifamily Properties (EERMP) Program offers multifamily
         property owners and managers of existing residential dwellings, that contain two or more
         units, rebates for appliances and general improvements. The program encourages the
         installation of qualifying energy-efficient products in individual tenant units and in the
         common areas of residential apartment buildings, mobile home parks and condominium
         complexes.
        The SmartAC program is a program that uses a device supplied by PG&E to switch air
         conditioning systems to a lower-capacity setting during energy supply emergencies to help
                                                   85

        avoid power interruptions.
       The Winter Gas Savings Program provides residential and commercial gas customers with a
        gas bill rebate if they reduce their gas consumption as compared to their average
        consumption over the same monthly period during the past three years. The maximum
        rebate is 20 percent, which is earned by achieving a 10 percent or more reduction in natural
        gas usage. Customers who conserve less than 10 percent will receive a rebate equal to their
        gas consumption reduction.
In addition to offering these programs, PG&E participates in statewide programs to reduce energy
consumption in California.
       Energy Upgrade California is a statewide program that offers up to $4,500 in incentives to
        homeowners who complete select energy-saving home improvements. The program is
        designed to address energy efficiency in the home as a whole rather than through small
        individual improvements.
       The California Solar Initiative (CSI) is a State program that offers rebates on fixed and
        tracking photovoltaic systems to PG&E customers and customers of other investor-owned
        utilities in California. However, the funds for PG&E customers that were offered through this
        program have been depleted, and it is not yet known whether additional funds will become
        available in the future.
Water. The Contra Costa Water District (CCWD), the water supply utility for Concord, offers programs
to incentivize water conservation in the District:
       Rebates to customers who replace their front lawn with water-efficient landscaping, equal to
        one dollar per square foot, up to a total of $1,000.
       Free home water use surveys by CCWD staff to help consumers identify opportunities for
        water conservation in their homes.
       Rebates for high-efficiency appliances and fixtures, including clothes washers, toilets, and
        smart sprinkler timers.
City Programs and Strategies
Concord has instituted a number of plans, policies, and programs to aid in the reduction of GHG
emissions. Policies in the 2030 General Plan aim to curb GHG emissions and reduce sprawl, in part
by supporting land use decisions that reduce reliance on cars and promote compact development.
In addition to implementing Plan policies, the City coordinates with regional agencies to ensure its
transportation plans, programs, and projects conform to the most recent air quality and GHG
reduction requirements. The City’s Downtown Specific Plan, adopted in June 2014, supports State
and regional GHG reduction goals by planning to accommodate a significant share of future growth
in Concord on infill sites near transit. Furthermore, the citywide Climate Action Plan adopted in July
2013 provides a number of strategies for Concord to help the State meet its greenhouse gas
reduction targets through land use and transportation strategies, energy and water conservation,
and green construction practices.
                                                   86

With respect to energy efficiency in housing, energy conservation is addressed when new
development is proposed, when old buildings are rehabilitated, and through continuous public
education.
New Construction. City building codes and recycling requirements support energy efficient systems
and the use of energy conserving materials. Concord’s Building Division enforces Title 24, Part 6 of
the California Code of Regulations (Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential
Buildings) through its permit process. These regulations were established in 1978 and most recently
updated in 2013 (with changes going into effect July 1, 2014). All new construction must comply
with the standards in effect on the date a building permit application is made.
Aside from the building permit process, energy conservation is also addressed through the
environmental review process. Environmental review documents for new development projects
identify energy impacts, and require mitigation measures when necessary.
The City’s 2030 General Plan also contains a number of energy saving policies that affect new
construction. These policies include, but are not limited to, the following:
          Support higher density and mixed use development in Downtown and near transit centers
           and corridors.
          Promote transit-oriented development and activities that take advantage of nearby transit
           services, such as BART, bus services, and the Buchanan Field Airport.
          Upgrade the quality of new and existing multifamily housing by requiring high-quality design.
          Encourage provisions for compatible live/work arrangements and telecommuting in
           residential areas.
          Encourage sustainable building practices for new development and the remodeling of
           existing homes.
          Promote pedestrian-oriented urban design.
In addition, the 2030 General Plan contains numerous transportation and land use-related policies
that reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. The Downtown Specific Plan further
supports these goals by planning to accommodate a significant share of future growth in Concord in
infill sites near BART. The City encourages new development to incorporate active and passive
power and adopt housing designs that conserve energy.
Rehabilitation. Concord works to facilitate the rehabilitation of existing housing to incorporate
energy-efficient features. Older homes often use significantly more energy than homes built more
recently, due largely to changes in building codes within recent decades that require more energy-
efficient features in new construction. Many older homes are also in need of repair or rehabilitation,
which can present an opportunity to incorporate energy efficiency upgrades. The City offers a Single
Family Housing Rehabilitation Loan and Grant Program to assist lower income households in
rehabilitating their properties and a Multifamily Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program. For seniors
age 60 and over or disabled persons, the City offers a Weatherization Program that can help defray
                                                    87

the costs of weatherization repair such as adding insulation for attic and walls and obtaining more
energy-efficient windows. Through low interest loans or grants, these programs help to rehabilitate
older properties and bring them into compliance with current Building Code requirements.
Public Outreach. The City of Concord promotes energy conservation through contact with residents,
including public outreach through the City newsletter, its website, and personal contact during permit
applications and City events. Efforts at public outreach include advising residents and developers on
adopting energy efficient designs and features, choosing appliances that save energy, installing solar
panels, recycling batteries and other e-wastes, and the use of fluorescent light bulbs. In recognition
of the City's efforts to promote energy conservation, Concord was named one of ‘America’s 50
Greenest Cities’ by the Popular Science Magazine in 2008.
The City has initiated a number of green initiatives in the last few years, including convening a ‘Green
Ribbon Task Force’ to develop recommendations to improve the environment by decreasing the
City’s production of greenhouse gasses, lowering the City’s energy usage, and reducing the City's
overall environmental footprint. The City has implemented many of the Task Force suggestions,
including replacing a gas-powered City vehicle with an all-electric utility vehicle, giving away energy-
efficient LED holiday light strings to residents who trade in strings of traditional lights, and
exchanging gas-powered golf carts at the City’s Diablo Creek Golf Course for electric carts.
Government Constraints on Housing Production
Adoption of land use and building standards is essential to protect the general welfare of the
community and the health and safety of residents. However, regulations, fees, and procedures can
also become a barrier to housing production and can discourage private investment in the housing
market. Because the cost of regulation may be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices
and rents, such requirements may also make housing less affordable. Accordingly, the Government
Code requires the Housing Elements to include an evaluation of government constraints on housing
production. Potential constraints include local plans and policies, the zoning ordinance, subdivision
regulations, building codes and standards, permitting and processing procedures, and local fees.
Because these constraints affect some times of housing more than others, this chapter also
examines standards for specific housing types, such as emergency shelter and mobile homes.
County Policies and Programs
County policies and programs include voter-approved Measures J and L. These are discussed below.
Contra Costa County Measure J – 2004. Contra Costa County voters initially approved a half-cent
transportation sales tax in 1988 (Measure C). In 2004, voters approved Measure J, which extended
the sales tax for 25 more years. Measure J also included revisions to the County’s Growth
Management Program to encourage the provision of affordable housing. Communities are required
to periodically document their progress toward achieving their housing objectives, including
affordable housing production and conservation. Measure J also includes a requirement that future
                                                    88

Urban Limit Lines (ULLs) be established by mutual agreement by both the County and cities. It also
includes a “Transportation for Livable Communities” component, to encourage more transit-oriented,
pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly communities, and more affordable housing. Since one of the
purposes of the Measure is to increase the availability of affordable housing, Measure J is not
considered a constraint.
Contra Costa County Measure L – 2006. This initiative, approved by county voters in 2006, extends
the term of the County’s ULL to the year 2026 and requires voter approval to expand the line by
more than 30 acres. In November 2007, the City of Concord adopted the County’s ULL by resolution.
The resolution includes a provision that allows the City to review the ULL every five years to
determine if there is a need for a voter initiative to modify it. Adoption of the County’s ULL will have a
positive fiscal impact on the City as it ensures receipt of “Measure J” Return to Source monies of
approximately $1.5 million per year to Concord. Measure L is not considered a constraint to housing
since the City can review and change the ULL by voter initiative. A Measure L amendment is not
needed to support development of the Concord Reuse Project, since the portion of the former
military base planned for urban uses is within the existing ULL.
Concord 2030 General Plan Policies
The City of Concord adopted a new General Plan in 2007. The Plan was amended in January 2012
to incorporate the Concord Reuse Project, including new land use designations for over 5,000 acres.
The amendment substantially increased the buildout capacity of the City, adding 12,200 potential
new housing units on the former Naval Weapons Station site. A subsequent amendment to the
General Plan was approved in July 2012. That included numerous small changes to the City’s
General Plan Map, along with policy amendments to ensure internal consistency with the new
Development Code.
One of the major goals of the 2030 General Plan is to promote housing by increasing allowable
densities and promoting mixed uses. The various land use categories in the 2030 General Plan
provide for residential growth at different density levels and will not constrain housing development.
Likewise, land use policies contained in the General Plan are supportive of housing development by
encouraging infill residential development and mixed uses in Downtown. The General Plan
established density ranges of up to 100 units per acre for three land use categories—Downtown
Mixed Use, Downtown Pedestrian, and High Density Residential. It also called for minimum densities
of 33 units per acre in these areas, ensuring that land near transit is efficiently used and developed
with multi-family housing rather than single family homes.
Some of the Conservation and Open Space related policies understandably may limit the extent in
which housing can be developed, but these policies are required to protect community resources
and to ensure living standards do not deteriorate for current and future generations. No policy was
found to impact the ability of the City to meet housing goals and objectives for this Housing Element,
particularly housing for lower-income groups.
                                                     89

Other Local Plans
Concord Reuse Project (CRP) Area Plan
The decision to close the Concord Naval Weapons Station (CNWS) in 2005 created an
unprecedented opportunity for the City of Concord. Reuse planning for the 5,000-acre “inland area”
portion of the site was initiated in 2006, following 65 years of military use. Several alternative
concept plans were evaluated and a preferred alternative was ultimately selected and evaluated
through an Environmental Impact Report (EIS). In 2010, the City Council adopted a conceptual
Reuse Plan for the site. A subsequent process was initiated to amend the Concord General Plan to
incorporate the site, and to create an Area Plan with land use and development standards. This
process concluded in January 2012. A Climate Action Plan for the CRP Area was included in the Area
Plan.
The CRP includes land use designations which strongly support housing production at a variety of
price points and densities. The Plan explicitly encourages affordable housing, including multi-family
housing, transitional and supportive housing, second units, and housing for persons with special
needs. It is envisioned that one-quarter of the 12,200 units to be accommodated on the site will be
affordable to lower income households. The Area Plan includes implementation strategies for
infrastructure financing, mitigation of environmental constraints and hazards, transportation, and
sustainable development.
Thus, over the long term, this Plan creates an opportunity, rather than a constraint, for meeting
Concord’s future housing needs. However, it should be noted that this opportunity will likely not
coincide with this 2014-2022 Housing Element update, due to extensive additional steps needed
prior to actual housing production. For example, the site’s environmental remediation will take
several years, given the slow pace of federal appropriations to fund remediation at Base Closure and
Realignment Commission (BRAC) sites. In addition, redevelopment of developable portions of the
CNWS site will require significant upfront investment in new backbone infrastructure, including new
roads, transit, utilities, and stormwater treatments. The funding and construction of this
infrastructure will be conducted in partnership with a master developer, a process which was
initiated with the recent release of a master developer Request for Proposals. Selection is expected
in early 2015, with an additional unknown period to negotiate agreements.
Downtown Concord Specific Plan
The Downtown Concord Specific Plan (Downtown Plan) is a community planning effort intended to
guide the long-term improvement of Downtown Concord. Preliminary work began in 2013 and the
Plan was adopted in June 2014. A special focus of the Downtown Plan is to determine funding
sources and strategies for future improvements, given the loss of Concord’s Redevelopment Agency.
Policy guidance is being provided by a steering committee, a Technical Advisory Committee, and the
community at large. The Plan will be used as a tool to obtain additional funding for many of the
implementation strategies.
                                                    90

Much of the Downtown Plan area is within a 15-minute walk of the BART station. Thus, the Plan
explores ways to leverage proximity to BART to encourage walkable, higher density development.
The existing land uses in the area include a mix of walkable urban districts, suburban shopping and
residential areas, and underutilized gaps (parking lots, etc.) with the potential for new infill
development. A strong emphasis is being placed on attracting higher density housing to the area,
including affordable units. By locating such housing near transit, personal transportation costs can
be lowered, further increasing housing affordability.
The Downtown Plan will positively increase housing production by establishing strategies to
encourage infill construction and to further diversify Concord’s housing choices. No zoning changes
are proposed, but future public investment called for by the Plan can become a catalyst for
additional downtown growth.
Concord Climate Action Plan
The City adopted a Climate Action Plan in July 2013. The Plan explores ways in which Concord can
help the State of California meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets through land use and
transportation strategies, energy and water conservation, and greener construction. The CAP
combines previously adopted plans to reduce GHG emissions at the former Naval Weapons Station
with new strategies applicable to the previously-developed portions of the City. These include
strategies that make it easier for children to walk to school, reduce reliance on automobiles, and
reduce home energy costs. The CAP supports affordable housing goals by reducing the amount of
household income expended on transportation and heating/cooling, thereby providing more
disposable income for housing. It proposes no actions that will increase the cost of housing or
require more expensive construction methods.
Zoning Ordinance Requirements
The process of updating the Concord Development Code (e.g., the zoning ordinance) began in 2002.
The ordinance had not been comprehensively updated since 1953 and had become as an obstacle
to housing development in that it did not respond to current market trends, was difficult to use, and
had been amended in piecemeal fashion for 50 years. Most new development in the city was
occurring through the creation of Planned Development (PD) districts because the zoning standards
were not responsive to contemporary housing products and the context of infill sites. This added
cost and time to the permitting process.
In July 2012, the City adopted a new Development Code, the culmination of a 10-year update
process to modernize the code and ensure that it supported local goals, including affordable housing
production, higher densities, and mixed use development. The updated Code reorganized the City’s
zoning districts to match General Plan categories. It replaced long “lists” of permitted and
conditionally permitted uses with a Use table “matrix” indicating permitting requirements for various
uses. It consolidated development standards in a single part of the code, and it established a new
section with standards for specific uses. The Code also includes standards for small lot subdivisions,
a dedicated section for affordable housing provisions, and an updated definitions section that is
consistent with state law.
                                                   91

Under the updated Development Code, multi-family housing is allowed in the Medium and High
Density Residential Districts, and in three mixed use districts. The mixed use districts are
Commercial Mixed Use (CMX), Downtown Pedestrian (DP), and Downtown Mixed Use (DMX). The
zoning revisions also established a new Industrial Mixed Use (IMX) district where live-work uses are
encouraged. The ordinance also includes provisions for limited multi-family uses in Neighborhood
Commercial areas and in the North Todos Santos zone.
Since adoption of the Code in 2012, the City has completed two rounds of “clean-up” amendments.
These amendments responded to unintended or erroneous provisions of the Code that were
discovered during the first year of its application. A number of the revisions affect housing, including
provisions to allow rear yard additions to encroach into the required setback, limits on new single
family homes in the RM zone, provisions to allow reduced lot dimensions with a use permit in the
CMX zone, and clarification of residential parking requirements. These revisions have helped
remove constraints, both by adding clarity to the code and facilitating housing development.
Residential Zoning Districts. Zoning standards in Concord support the creation of housing of
different densities, ranging from high density developments (33-100 units per acre) in the central
portions of the City near Downtown; to medium density developments (11-32 units per acre) along
major arterial roads; to low density developments (2.5-10 units per acre) in neighborhood areas; to
very-low density developments (below 1 unit per acre) in the rural residential areas. These densities
are consistent with the General Plan.
The single family “RS” and “RR” districts each include a suffix indicating the minimum lot size
applicable. The Rural Residential zones include RR-15, RR-20, and RR-40, corresponding to
minimum lot sizes of 15,000, 20,000 and 40,000. The Residential Single Family zones include RS-
6, RS-7, RS-7.5, RS-8, RS-8, RS-9, RS-10, and RS-12, with minimum lot sizes ranging from 6,000 to
12,000 square feet. There is also an RL zone which permits single family lots as small as 1,920
square feet, but with densities not exceeding 10 units per acre. It is intended for small lot
subdivisions with common open space areas and will be used in lieu of “PD” (Planned Development)
districts for future small lot projects.
The multi-family “RM” and “RH” Districts are each subject to minimum densities as well as
maximums. New development in RM must be at least 11 units/acre and new development in RH
must be at least 33 units/acre. Development standards in RM have been structured to allow
townhouse and attached housing products as well as garden apartments and similar medium
density products. Lots as small as 1,440 square feet are permitted, and lot widths as narrow as 18
feet are allowed. The RM zone also allows 80 percent lot coverage and 40 foot building heights.
Standards in the RH zone anticipate multi-story apartment and condominium development, with a
5,000 square foot minimum lot size established. In the RH, a 75 percent lot coverage allowance
applies, along with a 6 story or 60 foot height limit. Additional height is allowed with a use permit.
                                                    92

A review of recent developments including affordable housing units show that they have been
developed under a variety of zoning designations and at various densities. As such, existing and
proposed land use controls in the Development Code do not represent a constraint to housing
development.
Mixed Use and Commercial Districts. The new Development Code replaced Concord’s former
nomenclature of “commercial” districts with a series of mixed use districts that encourage
residential uses as well as commercial uses. The three primary mixed use districts are Commercial
Mixed Use (CMX), Downtown Pedestrian (DP), and Downtown Mixed Use (DMX), consistent with the
General Plan. There is also an Industrial Mixed Use (IMX) district where live-work development is
permitted, and a Neighborhood Commercial (NC) district where medium-density multi-family uses are
permitted with a use permit, subject to standards described below.
Development standards for the DP and DMX zones strongly support housing development. DP has a
minimum floor area ratio (FAR) requirement of 0.75, while DMX has a minimum FAR requirement of
1.0. DP has a maximum FAR of 4.0, while DMX has a maximum FAR of 6.0. Both zones have a
minimum height requirement of 30 feet. DP has a maximum height of 70 feet while DMX allows up
to 200 feet. Setback requirements are minimal and there are no daylight plane requirements unless
the project abuts a lower density residential zone (which is not the case for any DP parcels, nor most
DMX parcels). Open space requirements are 200 square feet per unit in DP and 175 square feet in
DMX (see later discussion about how open space requirements are applied).
Use permit requirements apply for projects that are 100% residential and for mixed use projects. As
is noted later in this chapter, this is not considered an affordable housing constraint because the
requirement is waived for projects in which at least 40 percent of the units are affordable to low and
very low income households (see later discussion under Affordable Housing Incentives).
Development standards in the CMX zone also support housing development, although density limits,
floor area ratio requirements, and setback requirements for parcels abutting residential zones may
make it more challenging to develop affordable housing. The maximum floor area ratio is 1.0 and
the height limit is 30 feet. These standards tend to accommodate garden apartments, or three story
construction with surface parking, rather than four story buildings with podium parking. In fact, most
construction in the CMX zone has been closer to 20-25 units per acre rather than 40 units per acre.
This is not considered an affordable housing constraint, because the City has adopted a higher FAR
and height limit for projects in which at least 40 percent of the units are affordable to low and very
low income households.
Section 122-311 of the Development Code establishes transitional requirements for buildings
adjacent to residential zones. This includes a requirement that the parcel adhere to the setback
requirements of the adjoining zone (along the adjoining property line). Thus, if a CMX parcel abuts
an RS-7 parcel at the rear property line, it is subject to a 20 foot rear setback requirement. if it abuts
an RS-10 parcel it is subject to a 25 foot rear setback. Since most CMX parcels are located on
corridors they often abut single family parcels along the rear property line and are subject to this
                                                     93

requirement. This is not a constraint on deep parcels, but it could be a constraint on shallow
parcels. The rear setback areas may be used for surface parking or required multi-family open
space, which mitigates the constraint somewhat.
The Development Code allows residential uses on the upper floor of mixed use structures in the
Neighborhood Commercial (NC) district. However, such development is limited to densities of 24
units per acre, and a maximum FAR of 0.35 applies. These standards make it difficult to build multi-
family housing on these sites. The standards are generally oriented toward auto-oriented single story
commercial buildings. However, a program to mitigate this constraint is not required, since the NC
zone is not intended as a housing zone. Although housing is permitted, the City has ample capacity
to accommodate multi-family demand in its mixed use zones. In mapping the NC and CMX zones,
the City carefully distinguished parcels where housing was desired and feasible (e.g., CMX parcels)
from those where commercial uses were preferred (e.g., NC parcels) in order to provide services
within walking distance of residents, jobs, and economic and revenue opportunities for the city.
Affordable Housing Incentives. In its overhaul of the Development Code, the City consolidated
provisions for affordable housing in a single section rather than having them dispersed throughout
the Municipal Code as they were before. Article IV, Division 8 includes the City’s Inclusionary
Housing requirements and density bonus program. It also includes an Affordable Housing Incentive
Program, which is intended to supplement and expand the State-mandated density bonus. Other
sections of Division 8 establish provisions for affordable housing agreements, the duration of
affordability, application requirements, and compliance monitoring.
Density Bonus Provisions. Concord’s existing Density Bonus regulations are consistent with State
law and grant the appropriate density bonuses in each of the following cases:
       Lower Income Units. A density bonus of 20 percent if 10 percent of the total units of a
        housing development are affordable to lower income households, as defined in Section
        50079.5 of the Health and Safety Code. For each additional one percent increase above 10
        percent units, the density bonus is increased by 1.5 percent up to a maximum density bonus
        of 35 percent of the maximum allowable residential density for the site.
       Very Low Income Units. A density bonus of 20 percent if five percent of the total units of a
        housing development are affordable to very low income households, as defined in Section
        50105 of the Health and Safety Code. For each additional one percent increase above five
        percent in the proportion of units affordable to very low income households, the density
        bonus shall be increased by 2.5 percent, up to a maximum of 35 percent of the maximum
        allowable residential density for the site.
       Senior Citizen Housing Development. A density bonus of 20 percent if 100 percent of the
        units are designated for senior citizens, as defined in Section 51.3 of the Civil Code.
       Moderate Income Units in Condominium and Planned Developments. A density bonus of five
        percent if 10 percent of the total dwelling units in a condominium project, as defined in
        Subdivision (f) of, or in a Planned Development, as defined in Subdivision (k) of Section 1351
        of the Civil Code, are affordable to persons and families of moderate income. For each
                                                    94

          additional one percent increase above the 10 percent units affordable to moderate income
          households, the density bonus shall be increased by one percent, up to a maximum of 35
          percent of the maximum allowable residential density for the site.
Consistent with State law, additional bonuses are granted to projects that include childcare facilities.
The Code also provides for concessions and incentives to facilitate the achievement of the density
bonus. The number of incentives varies based on the level of affordability, as defined by state law.
Concessions could include reduced setbacks, increased height, reduced lot sizes, increased lot
coverage, reduced street widths, expedited permitting, reduced fees, and similar provisions.
The Density Bonus provisions are not considered to be a constraint to housing development, but
rather function as an incentive for the development of affordable housing.
Affordable Housing Incentive Program. The 2010 Housing Element included an action program to
adopt an Affordable Housing Overlay District as part of the Development Code. In meeting with
housing advocates, elected and appointed officials, and the community at large, it was determined
that an Affordable Housing Incentive Program (AHIP) would be a more effective tool for producing
affordable housing. Whereas the overlay zone would have mapped specific sites for affordable
housing, the AHIP applies universally to all sites in zoning districts where high density housing is
allowed. This provides significantly more flexibility for the non-profit development community, while
also addressing public concerns about overconcentration of affordable housing on particular sites or
in particular neighborhoods.
The AHIP is essentially a modified version of the state density bonus program, with two important
additions: (a) the density bonuses are higher; and (b) rather than giving the city the discretion to
identify which concessions are appropriate, the AHIP specifies different standards for height,
setbacks, lot size, parking, and other provisions for projects which include 40 percent or more
affordable units.
Provisions of the AHIP apply in the RM, RH, CO, NC, CMX, DMX, and DP zones. For rental projects,
eligibility requires that 20 percent of the units are affordable to very low income households and
another 20 percent are affordable to low or very low income households (40 percent total affordable
units). For for-sale projects, at least 20 percent of the units must be affordable to low or very low
income and another 20 percent must be affordable to households earning up to the area median
income. A minimum parcel size of 10,000 square feet also is required.
Projects meeting the above criteria are eligible for density bonuses of 40-45 percent, FAR bonuses of
50 percent in the CMX zone (1.5 instead of 1.0), smaller minimum lot sizes, reduced lot widths and
lengths, and higher lot coverage limits (in the RM and RH zones). Projects are also allowed to be 45
feet in height (instead of 40’) in RM, 75 feet (instead of 60’) in RH, 85 feet (instead of 70’) in DP,
and 45 feet (instead of 30’) in CMX. The CMX bonus is particularly important, as it supports four
story construction, and is coupled with a 50 percent FAR bonus as described above. Even higher
bonuses are provided for projects within one-half mile of a BART station. The AHIP also includes
                                                     95

parking standards that are more lenient than those available through the State density bonus
program, with additional reductions provided for projects near BART.
One of the most important incentives available through the AHIP program is the waiver of the use
permit requirement. Projects that would otherwise require a use permit in the CMX, DMX, and DP
zone can be approved with a zoning clearance only (e.g., ministerially) if they are AHIP eligible. Since
most of Concord’s housing opportunity sites are located in the CMX and DMX zones, this is likely to
produce a substantial number of new affordable units during the planning period.
Planned District. Prior to 2012, the Planned District (PD) provisions in the Zoning Ordinance allowed
development that did not meet predefined development standards. However, creating a PD was an
expensive and time-consuming process, and record-keeping for PD development standards was
poor. With the adoption of the 2012 Code, the City prohibited the creation of new PDs. Existing PDs
have been retained. Where written records of development standards exist, they remain in effect.
Where they do not exist, the zoning regulations applicable in the most comparable (“best fit”)
residential district apply.
Developers can still seek approval for development plans that vary from adopted standards without
changing the zoning. The new Code includes provisions for Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
which include relaxed setbacks and lot size requirements. This enables projects to respond to
General Plan goals and policies related to environmental protection, tree preservation, and
avoidance of steep slopes. The PUD provisions allow considerable latitude to reduce developer costs
and help encourage infill development.
Parking Standards. The City’s residential parking requirements vary by housing type and parking
needs. The City has held a number of study sessions on parking, and has addressed parking
standards in the context of the Development Code, the Downtown Plan, the CRP Area Plan, the
Climate Action Plan, and numerous transportation plans.
Under the 2012 Development Code, single family units are expected to have two spaces per
dwelling. For existing homes, at least one of these spaces must be covered. For additions to
existing homes which result in 5-6 bedroom homes, three spaces are required, two of which must be
covered. If there are more than six bedrooms, four spaces are required. For brand new homes with
four bedrooms or fewer, two covered spaces are required, and tandem spaces are allowed. An
additional space is required for 5-6 bedrooms, and for 7+ bedrooms.
Requirements for multi-family housing are presented in Table 45 below. The Code requires 1 space
for a studio, 1.5 spaces for a one-bedroom apartment, and 2 spaces for a 2-3 bedroom apartment.
One guest space is required for every three units. Projects eligible for the Affordable Housing
Incentive Program may provide fewer spaces. If these projects are near a BART station, the number
of required spaces is even less.

Residential lots that contain second units are required to have one space for the second unit, in
addition to the required parking for the primary residence. State law requires cities to allow parking
for secondary units to be provided in tandem or within setback areas.
The Development Code provides opportunities to reduce required parking where shared parking
facilities are available. These provisions are based on a review of travel characteristics and auto
ownership around BART stations in studies of transit-oriented development. The conclusion from a
number of studies is that even if transit ridership rates are higher near BART, residents still own –
and need to park – the same number of cars. The allowable reduction (roughly 25 percent over
comparable development elsewhere in the city) is intended to strike a balance which recognizes the
benefits and opportunities of transit proximity as well as the rates of auto ownership expected in
transit-oriented development.
The Development Code also includes provisions for reduced parking within one-half mile of the City’s
two BART stations. However, the Code indicates that only non-residential uses are eligible.
Allowances for similar reductions for residential uses are included as an implementation program in
this Housing Element.
In the two Downtown zoning districts (DP and DMX), two options are provided for meeting off-street
parking requirements. First, parking may be provided on-site or on other sites within walking
distance (1,000 feet for employees and 700 feet for others). Second, an in-lieu fee may be paid if
the development site is within a vehicle parking district. Both Fees collected through the parking
district may be used to develop shared off-street parking facilities, improve mass transit, or
implement transportation systems management programs The opportunity to pay an in-lieu fee can
reduce the costs of providing parking on-site and improve development feasibility.
The City also may approve individual requests for alterations to these standards for special
circumstances subject to the appropriate discretionary approval and completion of a parking study.
The City also may allow reduced parking standards under the Density Bonus program and the
Affordable Housing Incentive Program. Density Bonus incentives may also include reduced parking
space dimensions, driveway width, location and setback spaces, reduced landscaping for parking
lots, reduced bicycle parking requirements and increased percentage of allowable compact spaces.
                                                            97

Separate parking standards for group homes and other assisted living facilities consistent with State
law also are included in the Development Code.
While the City recognizes that off-street parking provisions add to the costs of housing development,
it also recognizes that parking is a critical feature of residential development and a necessary
element for livable neighborhoods and marketability. The current standards balance housing
affordability and neighborhood livability concerns, while also providing incentives for smaller and
more affordable units.
Secondary Living Unit Standards. Secondary living units – mostly one-bedroom attached apartments
or detached cottages – are allowed in Concord in a manner that is consistent with the State
Government Code. Units meeting specified criteria (discussed below) are allowed subject only to
administrative approval in all residential zoning districts, including multi-family as well as single
family zones
Requirements for secondary living units are specified in Section 122-631 of the City’s Development
Code. The unit may not be located within a designated setback (yard) area, and may be established
through conversion of floor space in an existing dwelling, an addition to an existing dwelling,
conversion of an accessory structure, or construction of a new structure located behind the principal
dwelling. At least one unit on the property must be owner-occupied. Size allowances for secondary
units vary with lot size. On lots less than 12,000 square feet, the total floor area may be no less
than 275 square feet and no more than 640 square feet, with a maximum of one bedroom. On lots
more than 12,000 square feet, the total floor area may increase up to 1,000 square feet, exclusive
of the carport of garage. A maximum of two bedrooms is permitted on the larger lots.
In addition, secondary living units which have dedicated covered parking may not exceed 75 percent
of the area of the primary dwelling (counting covered parking in both cases). Secondary living units
created through conversion of an existing residence may not occupy more than 25 percent of the
residence. The Code also provides basic guidelines for the design of secondary living units,
addressing placement on the lot, location of the entrance, and the compatibility of exterior
appearance with the primary home. For one bedroom units, one off-street parking space is required
and it may be uncovered or tandem. For two bedroom units, two spaces are required and one must
be covered.
A minor use permit is required for secondary living units larger than 640 square feet. Smaller units
may be approved by the Planning Division, and are exempt from appeals.
In summary, the regulations support secondary living unit construction and create opportunities for
secondary living units throughout the city. Given the relatively large size of Concord’s lots and the
characteristics of its housing stock, such units represent a substantial opportunity to meet the
housing needs of smaller households, young adults, seniors, persons with special needs, and
extended families.

Licensed Care Facilities. Licensed residential or community care facilities with six or fewer beds are
allowed by right, consistent with State law. Larger residential care facilities are permitted
administratively in the RR district and the RL district, require a minor use permit in the RM and RH
districts, and require a use permit in the RS districts. According to the Contra Costa County
Consortium, a total of 292 licensed community care facilities with a capacity of 1,175 persons were
located in the City in 2009. Table 46 shows the breakdown of licensed care facilities and their
capacity.

Development Review Process
Processing and Permit Procedures. Costs associated with the development review process can
become significant for developers due to overhead and financing, as well as start-up costs.
Generally, the length of the process is proportional to the magnitude and complexity of the
development proposal. Factors that can extend the length of time for development review include
required General Plan Amendments or Rezoning, or the environmental review process, particularly if
special studies or an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) are required.
Concord’s Development Code provides for three distinct approval processes for new uses: Permitted
Uses and Administrative Approvals; Conditional Uses, subject to Zoning Administrator approval; and
Conditional Uses subject to a Use Permit approved by the Planning Commission.
Permitted Uses and Administrative Approvals. Permitted uses are allowed by right in most Zoning
Districts, with no action or approval required from the Planning Division other than a Zoning
Clearance. A Zoning Clearance is required before any structure is altered or constructed, and
precedes issuance of a building permit.
                                                                    99

In some districts, an Administrative Permit (AP) is required for certain permitted uses or occupancies,
such as second units, home businesses, and sidewalk cafes. Administrative Permits are an approval
letter with standard conditions, issued by the Planning Division. Conditions typically include
applicable provisions of City codes or standards, such as Zoning requirements, Building permit or
code requirements, business license requirements, or permit requirements of other agencies, such
as the fire district or Contra Costa Water District.
Minor Use Permits and Use Permits. Minor Use Permits and Use Permits are discretionary approvals
subject to a public hearing. The Zoning Administrator is a hearing officer designated by the City. The
Zoning Administrator may refer any application to the Planning Commission for a decision. When the
Planning Division expects that a project will be controversial, and therefore the Zoning Administrator
decision is likely be appealed to the Planning Commission, the application will go directly to the
Planning Commission to streamline the process.
Approval of either a Minor Use Permit or Use Permit requires findings by the review authority. The
proposed use must be consistent with the Development Code and General Plan. The site must be
physically suitable for the use, the use must be compatible with existing and future land uses in the
vicinity, and the permit must not jeopardize public health, safety, or welfare. Conditions of approval
may be placed on a project to ensure that these findings can be made.
Streamlining Procedures for Project Review. The City of Concord has taken significant steps to
streamline the development review process. Approval of the new Development Code was an
especially important achievement in this regard, as one of its major objectives was to expedite
project review. Concord encourages neighborhood meetings early in the process and pre-application
review to provide applicants with feedback on potential issues and conditions. The Planning Division
has regularly scheduled meetings to review formal applications for completeness, to meet the 30-
day requirement of the Permit Streamlining Act.
The following is an analysis of the planning permit procedures for new residential development.
Single Family Housing. Single-Family Zoning Districts include the RS-6 to RR-40 Districts. Any new
single family home that complies with the requirements for setbacks, lot coverage, parking, height,
and other zoning requirements, only requires review and approval of a building permit (preceded by
an “over the counter” Zoning Clearance). Subdivisions of two lots or more are subject to discretionary
review of the Tentative Map under the City’s Subdivision Regulations and State Map Act.
Multi-family Housing. Zoning Districts that allow apartments, cluster developments, townhouses, row
houses, and other attached single-family ownership projects include the RM and RH Districts, and
the CMX, DMX, DP, CO, NC, and NTS districts. Attached single family housing is also permitted in the
RL district and in various PD (Planned Districts) corresponding to previously approved subdivisions.
Permit requirements vary by district and type of development. Multi-family housing is allowed by
                                                    100

right in the RM and RH districts. In addition, projects in which at least 40 percent of the units are
affordable are permitted by right in the CMX and DMX districts.13 Since market-rate housing requires
a use permit in the CMX and DMX districts, the current requirements create a strong incentive for
affordable housing.
Mixed-Use Development. The 2030 Concord General Plan included a number of land use
classifications that promote a mix of residential and non-residential uses including the Downtown
Pedestrian, Downtown Mixed Use, Industrial Mixed Use, Commercial Mixed Use, Neighborhood
Commercial, and Community Office. The Development Code Update created zoning districts that are
consistent with the General Plan classifications and include incentives for multi-family development
in these areas.
Residential Care Facilities. The Development Code allows Small Residential Care Facilities (six or
fewer persons) by right in all residential districts, in accordance with State law. Residential care is
also allowed by right in the two Downtown districts (DP and DMX), in the North Todos Santos (NTS)
district, and in the Commercial Mixed Use (CMX) district. General Plan Policy LU-1.1.11, states
“Establish standards for residential care and group homes to ensure that the scale, operation,
location and other characteristics of these facilities do not adversely affect the character and quality
of neighborhoods.” At the present time, there are no special standards for residential care facilities
beyond those provided for under State and Federal laws.
Emergency Shelter. Emergency Shelters are permitted by right in the OBP, IBP, and IMX zoning
districts. These three districts (Office Business Park, Industrial Business Park, and Industrial Mixed
Use) cover 831 acres and include more than 300 parcels, ranging from small lots under 10,000
square feet to large tracts in business park settings. These areas are served by public transit (bus)
and some are within one-half mile of the Concord and North Concord BART stations. Shelters are
subject to a 75-bed size limit, although larger shelters may be approved with a Use Permit. The
listed zones provide sufficient opportunity to meet Concord’s need for emergency shelter space, as
identified in the Housing Element Needs Assessment.
Transitional Housing. Transitional housing is not explicitly listed in the Development Code use
tables. The Code indicates that “Group Housing” is defined as including transitional housing.
“Group housing” is currently allowed with a use permit in the RM, RH, NTS, CO, CMX, and DMX
districts. An action program in this Housing Element would amend the Code to add a separate
definition (and use category) for transitional housing and specifically state that transitional housing
is subject to the same standards as other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Design Review
Design Review is required for all new development in the City of Concord. Exceptions are provided
for additions and alterations to existing single family homes, unless they result in a floor area ratio
 See earlier discussion in this chapter under “Affordable Housing Incentive Program” for definition of “affordable”
                                                            101

greater than 30 percent, or a second story addition that adds more than 40 percent to the floor area
of the structure. For smaller projects, with no other discretionary action required, Design Review is
an administrative approval, with or without review by the Design Review Board, as appropriate.
Examples of smaller projects include additions to multi-family buildings and alterations to non-
residential buildings. For larger projects, Design Review applications are submitted with and
reviewed concurrently with plans for other required discretionary actions. Examples include new
residential subdivisions and multi-family apartment and condominium buildings.
Design Review is incorporated into the development review process. Final recommendations are
made by the Design Review Board to the appropriate review authority for the overall project (e.g., the
Planning Commission, the Zoning Administrator, etc.). The Development Code establishes specific,
objective criteria for evaluating design review applications. These are listed in Section 122-908 of
the Code and relate to public safety and security, visual and historic compatibility, view impacts,
lighting, screening of mechanical and utility equipment, environmental sensitivity, functionality,
landscaping, and scale compatibility with uses on adjacent sites.
The Design Review process does not affect housing costs. The City has adopted Design Guidelines
for specific areas in the downtown as well as Citywide Design Guidelines. The Citywide Design
Guidelines were adopted in the 1980’s. An action program in this Housing Element recommends
that the Guidelines be updated during the 2015-2022 planning period to incorporate more
contemporary graphics and current examples. The existing Guidelines express good design practices
and create certainty in the approval process but they are dated.
Environmental Review
The City conducts environmental review for all development projects, consistent with the
requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires an environmental
analysis for all projects that are not exempt. Projects with potentially significant impacts typically
require preparation of either a Mitigated Negative Declaration with special studies (addressing topics
such as traffic or soil conditions), or an Environmental Impact Report (EIR). Preparation of these
reports adds time and costs to the development review process and may require additional expenses
if additional measures are required to mitigate potential environmental impacts.
Some projects are “categorically exempt” from CEQA because they comply with certain thresholds
such as limited size or scope or because there is no reasonable possibility that they have the
potential to significantly affect the environment. Article 19 of the CEQA Guidelines lists the types of
projects that are normally exempt; including replacement or rehabilitation of existing facilities,
construction, or conversion of small structures, and minor alterations to existing land. Certain
projects providing affordable housing or infill housing that meet specified acreage, affordability, and
unit criteria are also exempt from CEQA by statutory law. The requirements for environmental review
apply statewide and are not particular to Concord alone, so they do not present a unique constraint
to housing development in the City.
                                                   102

Applicable projects funded with HOME, CDBG or other sources of federal funding (depending on the
administration of the funding source), are also subject to the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
Fees and Exactions
The City has established fees for building permits, planning, and engineering services for all
residential developments. The most common fees charged to new residential developments are
shown in Table 47. Other City fees for specific types of developments (e.g. hillside) may also apply.
A full listing of the City’s fees is available online from the City’s website or from the City’s Permit
Center. Most planning fees have actually declined since 2010 (generally about 10 percent), while
engineering fees have remained about the same. Impact fees, such as park fees, have generally
gone up slightly or stayed the same since 2010.
Fees are collected by the City’s Planning Division, Public Works Department, and Building Division
through the Permit Center. The manner and amount of fees charged to new residential development
depends on the number of units and size of the project. Of all the fees, the highest fee charged for a
conventional single-family subdivision is the park in-lieu fee. However, this fee can be reduced or
waived by providing on-site open space and recreational facilities. The City’s current regulations
require dedication of 697 square feet per unit for residential development in rural and low-density
zones, 479 square feet per unit for medium density zones, and 414 square feet per unit for high
density zones, or the payment of in-lieu fees equal to those established by the City. Lower
requirements (305 sq. ft./unit) apply to senior housing and downtown housing. According to the
City’s Municipal Code, Section 78-94, the park in-lieu fee would not apply to units awarded as
density bonuses as part of an affordable housing project, and all affordable housing projects are
given a 50 percent credit for payment of in-lieu fees.

Based on a relatively recent project approval, the typical permitting fees for a single-family attached
home (e.g., townhome), assuming a 1,750 square foot living space with an attached 400 square foot
garage on a 2,000 square foot lot, add up to about $15,280.14 Impact fees (for a project that
provides on-site parkland rather than paying the in-lieu fee) will add about $11,280 per unit.
The average per unit fees for multifamily housing costs about 30-50 percent less than a single family
home. The Legacy Apartments project that constructed 259 units on 4.6 acres with a mix of single-,
two-, and three-bedroom units, had permitting costs of about $3,700 per unit.15 Similarly, the
developer paid impact fees of about $4,000 per unit.16 Although this project is now more than six
years old, it is the most recent large multi-family project built in the City.
Larger single family homes typically have higher per unit fees. The third example below is for a
3,700 square foot house on a 20,400 square foot lot in the Kings Crest subdivision.

These fees provide the City with a necessary source of income to fund basic services and are
reviewed each year by the Finance Department to ensure they are compatible with the cost of doing
business. The City is sensitive to comparable costs in other jurisdictions and endeavors to ensure its
fee structure does not become a barrier to housing development.
To assist developers affected by the economic downturn, the City passed a resolution in March 2009
to approve the deferral of payment of development impact fees, including Parkland Dedication fees
on a per unit basis, to the time a certificate of occupancy is issued. This would help improve the
economic feasibility of residential development in Concord.

15 Legacy Apartments have 140 one-bedroom, 107 two-bedroom, and 12 three-bedroom units.

parkland and do not pay park dedication fees.
                                                                   105
While the impact fees in Concord do not represent a constraint to housing development, the water
service hook-up fee charged by the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) can be considerable
depending on the size of development. Typically, developers are required to pay fees for service
hook-ups and/or for their proportionate share of new water infrastructure. The present hook-up fee
costs around $23,000 including water line, new meter, and other service charges. Sewer services
are provided by the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD) which maintains a treatment
plant located northeast of I-680 and Highway 4 in unincorporated Martinez. The CCCSD charges a
one-time sewerage hook-up fee of just over $5,000 per unit and up, depending on size, location, and
height of ground. Both the water and sewerage connection fees may be a disincentive and
constraint for the construction of new housing units. Implementing program 1.9.4 has been
incorporated in the Housing Element to address this issue.
The current fee structure requires payment of impact fees for secondary units, albeit at lower rates.
For example, a secondary unit is subject to an $8,345 park impact fee, a $2,774 sewer connection
fee, and a $1,626 off-street improvement fee. These fees could constitute a constraint to the
construction of new secondary units (particularly those within the footprint of existing dwellings).
Consideration could be given to reduced fees under certain circumstances.
On/Off-site Improvements
The provision of on- and off-site improvements has an impact on the cost of residential development.
In Concord, most of the on-site requirements established in the Municipal Code (Chapter 78) or in
the Subdivision Ordinance (Municipal Code Chapter 94) are required as part of the conditions of
approval. These include frontage improvements for residential lots including street structural
section, curbs, sidewalks, driveway approaches and transitions; pedestrian ways within and between
neighborhoods; bikeways and trails (if a route is shown passing through the subdivision or site on the
City’s Trail Master Plan); street trees; storm drainage; sanitary sewers; gas, telephone, electricity,
cable, and other utility lines; water supply; fire hydrants; and walls and fences with appropriate
setbacks. Besides these improvements, additional off-site improvements may be established on a
case-by-case basis for new housing development. For large developments, specific improvements
may be required to ensure that public health and safety are protected.
Generally, off-site improvements are only required when a nexus exists between the development
and its impact on existing facilities and infrastructure. Concord’s on- and off-site improvements do
not appear to create a constraint to housing as most of the housing opportunity sites are located in
infill and urban areas where infrastructure is already in place. No major fees are charged for
improvements, except a fee in the form of an “Off-Site Street Improvement Program” to generate
fees to fund new traffic improvement programs (at $3,251 for a single- family home, $1,626 for a
secondary unit, and $2,624 for a multifamily unit). Additionally, the City allows the deferral of
payment of development impact fees, including the Parkland Dedication Fee, to the time of
Certificate of Occupancy. These savings are especially significant for small affordable housing
projects which have minimal off-site impacts.

Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
The purpose of the City’s Inclusionary Housing Program is to facilitate the development and
availability of housing affordable to a broad range of households with varying income levels within
the City. It is intended, in part, to implement State policy declaring that local governments have a
responsibility to exercise their powers to facilitate the development of housing necessary to
adequately provide for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community. It is also
intended to implement the Housing Element, which calls for increased production of housing serving
persons of very low, low and moderate income. The goal of the program is to have a minimum
percentage of very low, low and/or moderate income housing units included within new residential
developments or have in-lieu fees paid so such housing can be provided elsewhere in the City.
Requirement to Provide Inclusionary Units or Pay In-lieu Fee. As initially adopted, all residential
development projects in Concord were required to either include the number of Inclusionary Units
required under the Concord Municipal Code (CMC) ), or, if eligible, pay an in-lieu fee. In 2009, the
California Court of Appeals ruled that cities could not enforce inclusionary housing requirements for
rental properties (Palmer/Sixth Street Properties vs City of Los Angeles). As a result, Concord’s
ordinance is only enforced on for-sale projects and on rental projects that receive financial
assistance from the City or that are subject to a development agreement.
As required pursuant to Government Code Section 65589.8, the developer of an ownership project
may satisfy all or a portion of the inclusionary housing requirement by constructing rental housing at
the affordability levels set forth in the Development Code. Similarly, the developer of a rental project
may satisfy all or a portion of this requirement by constructing for-sale housing at the affordability
levels set forth in the Development Code. Except as permitted under CMC Section 122-579(i), Off-
Site Alternatives, all required Inclusionary Units must be provided on the same site as the Market
Rate Units included within the Residential Development Project. No application for a General Plan
Amendment, rezoning, tentative subdivision map, parcel map, preliminary development plan, use
permit, design review, hillside development plan, or building permit for a Residential Development
Project can be approved, nor can any such Residential Development Project be constructed or
occupied, without compliance with this division, unless specifically listed as an exemption under
CMC 122-579(b).
The inclusionary requirements do not apply to a residential development project consisting solely of
the construction of one to four single-family dwelling units; or to the reconstruction of any dwelling
units that were destroyed by a fire, flood, earthquake, or other act of nature. As noted above,
residential rental projects that are not subject to a development agreement and that are not
receiving financial assistance from the City also are exempt.
The City Council may approve a reduction or waiver of the requirements of this program for projects
which are the subject of a disposition and development agreement, owner participation agreement,
acquisition agreement, or other contractual arrangement with the City of Concord; and are receiving
assistance from the City of Concord, such as relocation of occupants, acquisition and disposition of
                                                    107

land for site assemblage, use of eminent domain, write-down of land costs, fee waivers, or other
forms of direct Agency assistance.
Any applicant requesting such a reduction or waiver must submit a pro forma and such other
financial analysis sufficient to support a determination that the reduction or waiver is necessary to
ensure the economic feasibility of the residential development project. Consistent with its
responsibilities under the Public Records Act, the City must take reasonable steps to protect the
confidentiality of any proprietary financial information submitted by the developer.
Required Number of Inclusionary Units. The required number of Inclusionary Units to be provided for
a residential development project varies, depending upon the total number of dwelling units in the
project and the income category for the Inclusionary Units being provided. Within the parameters set
forth in Table 49 below, the developer may choose which income category of Inclusionary Units to
provide.
Table 49: Required Percentage of Affordable Units
 Project Size and Type                  Inclusionary Requirement
 Rental Projects (not otherwise exempt) Either 10% at low income, or 6% at very low income
 Ownership Projects                     Either 10% at moderate income, or 6% at low income
 Source: City of Concord, 2014
When the application of the percentages set forth above results in a number that includes a
fractional unit, the fraction must be rounded up to the next whole number if the fraction is 0.5 or
more. If the result includes a fraction below 0.5, the developer has the option of either rounding up
to the next whole number and providing an additional Inclusionary Unit, or paying an in-lieu fee.
A developer may request that the development project include Inclusionary Units affordable to a mix
of income levels (Very Low, Low and Moderate), instead of a single income level. Authority to approve
a particular mix of income levels rests with the final City decision-making body for the underlying
application. The developer of a residential development project containing from five to nine units,
inclusive, has the option of either providing one Inclusionary Unit or paying an in-lieu fee.
In-lieu Fees. A fee may be paid in-lieu of providing Inclusionary Units either for a residential
development project which contains less than 20 acres in gross land area or for fractional units. The
fee is set by resolution of the City Council in an amount sufficient to pay the proportionate cost of
providing Inclusionary Units elsewhere within the city. All fee revenues are deposited in a restricted
fund earmarked for housing projects affordable to Very Low, Low and/or Moderate Income
Households.
In-lieu fees must be paid prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or prior to building permit
issuance for projects in which a certificate of occupancy is not issued, or as otherwise provided in
the conditions of approval.
                                                         108
The downturn in housing prices during 2007-2010 prompted an adjustment to the in-lieu fee to
reflect changes in market conditions. For for-sale projects, the in-lieu fee was reduced from
$17,660 a unit to $5,043 a unit. The reduction reflects the relatively small gap between a market
rate for-sale product and an “affordable” for-sale product in Concord as of 2010-2011. Future
adjustments to the in-lieu fee should be considered to reflect the recent (2012-2014) increase in
housing prices.
Duration of Restrictions. The sale price for ownership of Inclusionary Units is restricted for a period
of 45 years pursuant to an Affordable Housing Agreement recorded against the property. The
monthly rent for rental Inclusionary Units is restricted for a period of 55 years pursuant to an
Affordable Housing Agreement recorded against the property.
Affordable Housing Agreements. The conditions of approval attached to discretionary approvals for
all residential development projects subject to a requirement to provide Inclusionary Units pursuant
to this program must require the developer to enter into an Affordable Housing Agreement to be
recorded against the property in order to ensure implementation of the requirements of this
program. The form and contents of the Affordable Housing Agreement are subject to approval by the
City Attorney in consultation with the Housing Manager.
Development Incentives. The City may grant one or more of the following affordable housing
development incentives in order to mitigate the financial impact of this program's requirements on a
particular residential development project:
        A Density Bonus (or related concession) authorized by the Development Code;
        Provision of housing set-aside funds, tax exempt financing, or other financial assistance as
         approved by the City Council;
        Modification of zoning or development standards; or
        Expedited processing or deferral of fees
Authority to act on a request for these development incentives rests with the final City decision-
making body regarding the underlying application.
Compliance Monitoring Fees. The City Council, by resolution, may establish compliance monitoring
fees to recover the City's actual, reasonable costs incurred for ongoing implementation of this
program. For Inclusionary Units in Ownership Projects, the fee is payable at the time of each sale or
transfer during the term of the applicable Inclusionary Housing Agreement. For Inclusionary Units in
Rental Projects, the property owner must pay an annual fee each year during the term of the
applicable Inclusionary Housing Agreement. In 2014, the Compliance Monitoring Fee was $262 for
ownership units and $38 for rental units.
                                                   109

Off-Site Alternatives. As a complete or partial alternative to the provision of on-site Inclusionary
Units, the developer of a residential development project may propose a plan for providing affordable
housing units at an off-site location within the City of Concord, as follows:
        Acquire existing unrestricted multifamily units located elsewhere within the City and
         rehabilitate those dwelling units. At least two rehabilitated dwelling units shall be provided
         for each Inclusionary Unit required pursuant to this division.
        Construct new residential dwelling units. At least two new dwelling units shall be provided for
         each Inclusionary Unit required pursuant to this program; or
        The developer may partner with a nonprofit affordable housing provider in order to meet its
         Inclusionary Housing obligations through one of the alternatives set forth in this section.
Any new or rehabilitated dwelling units provided off-site must be regulated pursuant to an Affordable
Housing Agreement between the developer and the City. All Inclusionary Units must be rehabilitated
or constructed and occupied prior to or concurrently with the Market Rate Units for the related
residential development project. For phased residential development projects, the Inclusionary Units
may be constructed and occupied in proportion to the number of dwelling units in each phase of the
project. Authority to act on the off-site alternative proposal rests with the final City decision-making
body regarding the underlying application.
Design Standards and Construction Timing. The following design standards apply to all Inclusionary
Units constructed pursuant to this program:
        Inclusionary Units must be dispersed throughout the residential development project and
         have access to all on-site amenities that are available to Market Rate Units.
        The construction quality and exterior design of Inclusionary Units must be comparable to the
         Market Rate Units. However, Inclusionary Units may be smaller in size, developed on smaller
         lots, and/or have alternative interior finishes.
        The average number of bedrooms for all Inclusionary Units must be equivalent to the average
         number of bedrooms for Market Rate Units within the same project.
        All Inclusionary Units must be constructed and occupied prior to or concurrently with the
         Market Rate Units within the same project. For phased projects, the Inclusionary Units may
         be constructed and occupied in proportion to the number of dwelling units in each phase of
         the project.
Waivers or Adjustments. As noted earlier, the City may adjust or waive the requirements of the
program if the project is the subject of a disposition and development agreement, owner
participation agreement, acquisition agreement, or other arrangement with the City of Concord. The
requirements also may be waived if the project is receiving assistance from the City. Adjustments or
waivers also be granted if the applicant demonstrates that strict application of this program would
effect a taking of private property without just compensation or otherwise constitute a violation of
the United States Constitution, California Constitution or other applicable federal or State laws. Any
person requesting a waiver or adjustment must submit a pro forma and other financial analysis to
                                                     110

support a determination that the reduction or waiver is needed to ensure the economic feasibility of
the project.
Assessment of the Inclusionary Ordinance. Between the approval of the Inclusionary Ordinance in
2004 and 2010, the City approved five projects (Willow Walk, Concordia, Hidden Grove, Wisteria,
and Silver Leaf) which together produced a total of 15 inclusionary housing units. One project
(Sendera Hill) opted to pay an in-lieu fee which was subsequently deposited in the City’s Low- and
Moderate-Income Housing Fund. By 2012, the Program had resulted in a total of 29 homes
constructed or rehabilitated (including 14 units at the Concord Corners condo conversion) and an
additional 32 homes approved but not yet constructed.
The success of the Ordinance has been hampered by the inability to enforce it on rental projects as a
result of the Palmer decision, and by the downturn in the housing market in 2007-2011. By 2012,
potential buyers and private sector lenders viewed the ordinance as onerous, given the marginal
difference between inclusionary units and market-rate units, and the resale limitations on for-sale
units. In 2012, the City approved amendments to the Ordinance which allowed case by case review
of the removal of a resale restriction based on hardship on existing for-sale units to help homebuyers
facing foreclosure as a result of being unable to sell their units.
Resale restrictions were designed with an appreciating market in mind, and did not anticipate the
drop in value that occurred after 2007. With the market now in recovery, the Ordinance may require
another look to ensure that it is achieving its desired purpose. Changes to the income mix of units
(e.g., 10 percent at moderate/low or 6 percent at low/very low) could also be explored to improve
the effectiveness of the Ordinance and increase production. The City also could consider a nexus
study (either on its own, or collaboratively with other cities) to determine the feasibility of linkage
fees that would support affordable housing development, including rental units.
Building Codes and Enforcement Standards
The City has adopted the California Building Code, in addition to Fire, Mechanical, Plumbing,
Electrical, and Uniform Codes as the basis for its building standards. The City has also adopted the
Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings. Permits are required for all electrical and
plumbing work, and other major home improvements and modifications.
Concord has made several administrative changes to the standard California Codes, including
setting its own fees and applicable penalties for violations. However, these codes represent basic
standards and do not vary much from city to city. They do not place an undue burden on the
construction or rehabilitation of housing. For older housing that was constructed under less
stringent codes, the City has a rehabilitation loan program to assist developers who remodel or
rehabilitate housing and bring it into compliance with the current codes. The City also has Multifamily
Housing Inspection and Multifamily Housing Maintenance programs that provide regular, periodic
inspections to apartment buildings with more than four units. The inspections are conducted on a
tri-annual basis. Inspections are designed to identify and abate existing and potential health and
safety code violations, and to promote overall maintenance of the properties. Where issues are
                                                    111

identified, the City works closely with building owners to address them. In 2005, Neighborhood
Services commenced tracking the number of violations that have been identified and corrected
during the course of these inspections. Between 2005 and 2010, more than 8,000 building code
violations were identified and corrected.
Concord’s building codes and enforcement procedures do not create an undue constraint on housing
development.
Constraints to Housing for Special Needs Groups
Single-family homes, which comprise 60 percent of the housing stock in Concord, are often too
expensive for low-income persons and others with special needs. Therefore, it is necessary for the
City to establish policies and processes that facilitate other housing types. This section addresses
policy constraints and opportunities that affect special needs groups, including seniors, people with
disabilities, the homeless, large families, female-headed households and low-income individuals and
families.
As described in the zoning section earlier in this chapter, the City has adopted several ordinances to
encourage alternative housing types.
Constraints to Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, and Supportive Housing
In January 2008, Senate Bill 2 (SB 2) went into effect, requiring that every jurisdiction in the State
identify one or more zoning districts that allow emergency shelters and transitional housing without
discretionary review (such as a conditional use permit). The law requires that the identified zones
contain sufficient capacity to provide shelter for homeless persons that have unmet housing needs.
SB 2 further requires that transitional housing and supportive housing be subject to the same
standards as other housing units in their respective zoning districts (e.g., supportive multi-family
housing in the RH zone must be treated the same as market rate multifamily housing in the RH
zone). As noted earlier, the City allows emergency shelter by right in the IBX, OBP, and IMX districts.
Constraints to Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
SROs represent another affordable housing alternative. The Development Code defines “Group
Housing” as including single-room occupancy (SRO) units under the ‘Group Housing’ use category.
This use is allowed with a Use Permit in all zones where multi-family housing is allowed, including
RM,RH, CO, CMX, and DMX. Other types of group housing, such as rooming and boarding houses,
private residential clubs, and residential hotels intended for long-term (30 day or more) occupancy,
are also allowed with a use permit in these zones. In general, the City views SROs as single-room
apartments which may or may not have kitchen facilities. They may be subsidized by federal and City
funds, as well as non-profit groups and are counted as part of the city’s affordable housing stock.
Constraints to Housing for Mobile Homes
City policies regulate the location of mobile homes. Individual mobile and manufactured homes are
considered single-family homes and therefore are permitted in all residential zones, as long as they
                                                   112

comply with the requirements within that zone, are placed on a permanent foundation, and are
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Mobile Home Parks are permitted with a conditional use
permit in Medium Density Residential Districts. The City believes that mobile homes are an
important source of affordable housing and implements a number of policies to keep them viable. It
has a Mobile Home Conversion Ordinance to discourage the conversion of existing mobile home
parks to other uses and a mobile home repair loan program to help mobile home owners maintain
their homes in good condition. Recently, the City approved amendments to the rent stabilization
division of the Mobile Home Ordinance to allow park owners to pass on some of the park-related
expenses to tenants. The intent of these changes are to promote reinvestment in capital
improvements and park maintenance, discourage the flight of capital and the conversion of existing
parks to other uses.
Constraints to Housing for Large Families and Female Headed Households
Large families and female-headed households may require more traditional housing types; the SROs,
mobile homes, and shelters described above are not always well-suited for families. According to
2012 ACS data, approximately 11 percent of households in Concord were female-headed
households with children. According to 2006-2010 CHAS data, nine percent were large families
(defined as five or more persons per household). These populations are described in more detail in
Chapter 3.
Multifamily housing is usually a more affordable housing option than single-family housing for large
families and female-headed households. This form of housing is permitted in all Medium Density
Residential and High Density Residential Districts. It is also permitted with a use permit in the
Commercial Mixed Use District, the Downtown Pedestrian District and the Downtown Mixed Use
District. As noted earlier, under the City’s Affordable Housing Incentive Program, a use permit is not
required in these zones if at least 40 percent of the units are defined as “affordable.”
Although the Development Code does not restrict the number of bedrooms per unit, the market often
does. To remain affordable, multifamily housing is often developed with one or two bed- rooms only.
This poses a problem for large families who may need five or more rooms. Nonetheless,
overcrowding is a declining problem in Concord, as only six percent of all occupied units were judged
overcrowded in 2012, compared with 9.3 percent in 2000.
Constraints to Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As noted in the Special Needs section earlier, persons with physical disabilities have a number of
housing needs related to accessibility of dwelling units; access to transportation; employment, and
commercial services; and alternative living arrangements that include on-site or nearby supportive
living services.
The Development Code includes specific references to assisted living facilities, nursing facilities,
special needs housing, and large and small residential care facilities. The Code’s regulations are
consistent with the state and federal laws which provide special protection to mentally and physically
                                                   113

handicapped persons. In most districts, such facilities would require a determination of similarity or
compatibility by the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission.
Various provisions in both Federal and State law limit the authority of local agencies regarding
facilities for mentally and physically handicapped persons. These regulations have the following
important effects:
         The use of property for the care of up to six mentally disabled persons including support staff
          necessary to assist residents must be regulated as a single family residential use;
         Family care homes, group homes and foster homes cannot be subject to regulations that are
          more restrictive that those imposed on similar dwellings in the same zone; and
         In-patient and out-patient facilities licensed to treat persons with mental disabilities or
          substance abuse problems to be regulated in the same manner as properties used for
          treatment of general medical patients.
Responding to Federal and state laws that require local agencies to allow physical modifications
which make properties fully accessible to persons with physical handicaps, the State Attorney
General has advised cities and counties to revise their Zoning Ordinances to make it possible to
grant accommodations where needed. The new Development Code includes provisions to address
this requirement. Section 122-956 of the Code allows minor exceptions for Reasonable
Accommodation, with or without conditions of approval, if the exception is necessary to meet the
needs of a disabled person. The City has developed a Reasonable Accommodation request form and
made it available on its website.
The City also permits educational, residential, health care, and other supportive services of the type
that could benefit persons with physical disabilities in residential zones. Most of the sites currently
zoned for multifamily use are located along major streets and transportation corridors to facilitate
access for persons with disabilities. Adoption of the new Development Code in 2012 created more
opportunities for higher density residential use near transit, including sites in the Commercial Mixed
Use, Downtown Pedestrian and Downtown Mixed Use districts.
Apart from the Development Code, the City ensures that new housing developments comply with
California building standards (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations) and federal (Americans
with Disabilities Act) requirements for accessibility, such as the provision of ramps and parking
spots, etc.
In light of current planning policies and zoning regulations, the City believes that it has mitigated any
potential constraints to the availability of housing for persons with physical disabilities.
Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
As noted above, the City has established procedures to ensure that reasonable accommodations are
made for persons with disabilities. Under the Concord Municipal Code Section 122-956, any person
with a disability currently has the right to submit an application for an adjustment in development
                                                    114

standards that would be a reasonable accommodation from the requirements of zoning that
otherwise would apply. If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable
accommodation, the Planning Division will endeavor to provide the necessary assistance to ensure
the process is accessible to the applicant or representative. A filing fee equivalent to one hour of
permit center consultation under the current fees and charges resolution is required.
Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities. The State of California has
removed City discretion for review of small group home projects (six or fewer residents). The City
cannot impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures other than those allowed
by State law. As a consequence, there are no City-initiated constraints on housing for persons with
disabilities.
The City allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for persons with dis-
abilities in compliance with ADA requirements. Such retrofitting is permitted under Chapter 11 of the
1998 version of the California Code. The City works with applicants who need special
accommodations in their homes to ensure that application of building code requirements does not
create a constraint.
Information Regarding Accommodation for Zoning, Permit Processing, and Building Codes. The City
implements and enforces Chapter 11 of the California Code, which is very similar to ADA. The City
provides information to applicants or those inquiring of City regulations regarding accommodations
in zoning, permit processes, and application of building codes for persons with disabilities. It also
provides referrals to independent living centers and other re- sources on inquiry.
Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations. One of the programs of the 2002 Housing Element was to
conduct a comprehensive review of zoning laws, policies, and practices in Concord for compliance
with fair housing law. The City has not identified any zoning or other land use regulatory practices
that could discriminate against persons with disabilities and impede the availability of such housing
for these individuals. Examples of the ways in which the City facilitates housing for persons with
disabilities through its regulatory and permitting processes are:
As required by State law, the City allows non-medical residential care facilities of six or fewer people
by right in all residential districts and several mixed use districts. The Development Code provides
for similar homes serving seven or more persons in mixed use zones and medium to high density
residential districts with a use permit.
The City permits housing for special needs groups, including for individuals with disabilities, without
regard to distances between such uses or the number of such uses in any part of the City. The Land
Use Element of the General Plan does not restrict the siting of special needs housing.
Permits and Processing. The City does not impose special permit procedures or requirements that
could impede the retrofitting of homes for accessibility. The City’s requirements for building permits
                                                     115

and inspections are the same as for other residential projects and are fairly simple and straight
forward.
As discussed above, the City allows non-medical residential care facilities of six or fewer persons by
right in all residential districts, in the North Todos Santos District, and in the CO, CMX, DP, and DMX
districts. No conditional use permit or other special permitting requirements apply to such homes.
For homes with more than six persons, the use permit requirement is considered a normal procedure
to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses.
The City does not impose special occupancy permit requirements for the establishment or retrofitting
of structures for residential use by persons with disabilities. If structural improvements are required
for a group home or residential care facility, a building permit is required.
All non-single family projects for which a building permit is required require design review. The
hearing process is the same for group homes and special needs housing for persons with disabilities
as for other projects.
Parking Requirements. In the case of parking requirements for persons of disabilities, the California
Building Code includes handicapped parking provisions requiring each lot or parking structure where
parking is provided for the public as clients, guests, or employees, to include parking accessible to
handicapped as near as practical to a primary entrance and in accordance with the standards for the
number, size, location, signing, and markings under Chapter 71, “Site Development Requirements
for Handicapped Accessibility” of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.
Building Codes. The City provides reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the
enforcement of building codes and issuance of building permits through its flexible approaches to
retrofitting or converting existing buildings and construction of new buildings that meet the shelter
needs of persons with disabilities. The City has adopted and implements the 2013 California
Building Code, California Code of Regulations.
Market Constraints on Housing Development
High land and development costs constrain housing production throughout the Bay Area, and
place a significant constraint on the production of housing for low- and moderate-income
households. Contributing factors include the cost of land, materials, labor, fees and
associated development requirements, sales commissions, and developer profits.
Land Costs
In general, the high cost of land for new projects is a constraint to housing development in Concord
and throughout much of the Bay Area. According to online property listings, asking prices for vacant
residential land in Concord currently average approximately $28 per square feet, or $1.2 million per
acre. While this level of cost is not as high as some other parts of the Bay Area, it requires relatively
strong market rate rents or sale prices to support feasible new construction. Although land prices
                                                     116

may have declined due to the recent recession, currently rising rents and sale prices, along with
generally strong pent-up demand, are putting upward pressure once again on land prices.
Construction Costs
Construction cost is a large factor in determining the costs of housing or home improvement.
While construction costs are generally more stable than land costs because they are not open
to speculation, construction costs are still influenced by market forces. Total construction costs for
a project consist of “hard costs” such as labor, raw materials, and shipping; and “soft costs” such
as architectural fees, environmental studies, taxes, and other services required to bring a project
to completion. Additionally, the type of construction, such as a timber frame building or
masonry building; and the quality of finishing materials, such as windows, kitchen cabinets, and
floor finishes, will also affect the final cost.
According to RS Means, a standard source used for estimating construction costs, an average-
quality 1,600-square-foot single-family home in Concord averages approximately $200,000 to
$270,000 per unit, or approximately $125 to $170 per square foot. However, construction
costs vary substantially depending on product type, building design, and the quality of
finishes, and construction costs are often considerably higher for custom or luxury-quality housing
units. In addition, soft costs such as financing, permit fees, and marketing, have all risen
substantially over the past two decades.
On a per-square-foot basis, construction costs for multifamily residential units tend to be slightly
higher than construction costs for single-family homes. RS Means estimates that average
construction costs range from approximately $175 to $230 per square foot for a one- to three-
story multifamily project and approximately $200 to $230 for a four- to seven-story multifamily
residential project in Concord. Assuming an average unit size of 1,200 square feet (including
common areas), these estimates result in construction costs ranging from approximately
$210,000 to $280,000 per unit in Concord. Treatment of parking associated with a project,
from surface parking to structured parking in a podium or wrap arrangement, to underground
garages, all add substantially to per-unit costs as density rises.
The high land and development costs in Concord mean that new rental units affordable to very
low and low-income households are very difficult to provide at a feasible rate of return to a
developer or investor without subsidies. This also tends to hold true for for-sale housing at the
moderate income level. Local regulations can help to make housing more affordable by
allowing for greater density or reducing parking requirements. In some cases, developers also
can reduce costs by using newer construction methods such as modular construction o r
prefabrication. Many of these techniques help save time, control quality, eliminate waste, and
decrease labor costs, leading to minimization of cost to produce housing units.
Availability of Financing
The availability of construction and permanent financing for new development projects has
served as a housing production constraint in the past several years. Residential developers
                                                   117

reported that lenders substantially restricted the availability of financing for new residential
construction following the 2007 mortgage crisis. While private lenders often offered loans
equal to 70 to 90 percent of the building value prior to the crisis, many began limiting loans
to 50 percent of the building value after 2007. Furthermore, lenders instituted strict
standards to determine whether developers would qualify for loans, even at the reduced
loan-to-value ratios. These lending standards significantly lowered the pace of new housing
development throughout the Bay Area and nationally.
The availability of mortgages for homebuyers was also severely restricted following the
2007 subprime mortgage crisis, but lenders have begun to make financing more accessible
as the housing market has shown signs of recovery. Prior to 2007, prospective
homebuyers were often able to purchase homes with little or no down payment. However,
in response to the 2007 mortgage crisis, lenders instituted strict lending standards,
typically requiring a 20 percent down payment and high credit scores. One outcome of
these stricter standards was reduced access to homeownership for low- and moderate-
income households unable to afford the large down payment required to purchase a home.
As the housing market and economic conditions in general have improved, lenders have
begun to relax some of the lending restrictions that were instituted after 2007. Although
lending standards continue to be less flexible than they were prior to the mortgage crisis,
and may remain so indefinitely, loans have become more accessible for developers and
individual homebuyers.
Current home mortgage interest rates for home loans are at historically low levels, averaging
3.98 percent in 2013 for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. This means that prospective
homebuyers that are able to qualify for home loans under more stringent lending standards
are often able to benefit from low interest rates, reducing ownership costs.
The Concord First-Time Homebuyer (FTHB) program aims to assist qualified low- and
moderate-income individuals with the purchase of their first home. The City provides down
payment assistance loans for up to 20 percent of the home sales price, up to a maximum of
$40,000, based on household income and household size. The loan is a zero-interest, 15-year
loan and is due only when the house is sold or at the end of the 15 year period, and carries a
shared appreciation provision. The City also manages an Inclusionary Housing Program with
the goal of providing an increased number of owner-occupied housing units affordable to
lower income households.
Limited Attraction of Developer Interest in Concord
A notable local challenge to meeting RHNA goals for the 2014-2022 cycle will be the lack of new
residential construction that has occurred in Concord since 2000. On average, Concord issued
building permits for 149 residential units per year between 2000 and 2012, with individual years
ranging from a low of zero permits issued in 2010, to a high of 385 permits issued in 2001. With an
                                                  118
average of approximately 435 units per year needed to meet RHNA goals for the upcoming cycle, an
increase in development activity compared to historical activity will be necessary.
To address this notable lack of interest in new housing development in Concord, and despite the
availability of densely-zoned, fully-serviced sites, the City and its consultants sought to explore this
issue further as part of the outreach conducted for the 2014 Housing Element Update process by
convening three roundtable discussions with market-rate and affordable housing developers and
advocates. The discussions were structured to obtain insight into factors that have contributed
to the lag in housing production, as well as to obtain suggested actions that the City could take
to increase production.
Issues cited by market-rate housing developers during the roundtable discussions included:
       A gap between market rents or sale prices needed to support current development
        costs, especially compared to nearby communities such as Walnut Creek, which
        command substantially higher rents or sale prices for similar units;
       A need for improved community amenities such as higher-quality retail options, aesthetic
        improvements to retail space, and a walkable downtown environment;
       A perception of a higher crime rate in Concord compared to neighboring communities;
        and
       Problems with the public schools that serve Concord residents.
Additional challenges cited by affordable housing developers and advocates included:
       Lack of City funding sources for affordable housing, particularly with the loss of the City’s
        Redevelopment Agency; and
       Challenges associated with finding sites that will be competitive for tax credit financing,
        which prioritizes sites within close proximity to transit and retail.
Some of these constraints are addressed by the recently-adopted Downtown Specific Plan for
the City of Concord. This Specific Plan has implementation strategies to foster increased retail
attraction, upgrades in the retail quality and mix, and increased pedestrian improvements
throughout Downtown Concord. In addition, the City was recently selected by the Urban Land
Institute and Greenbelt Alliance to be the focus of a Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) of national
experts to explore this issue further and provide additional recommendations.
                                                     119

6. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING
        ELEMENT
The City of Concord’s prior Housing Element was adopted in November 2010. It amended the
Element that was adopted in January 2003 to plan for the 2007-2014 Housing Element cycle and
was certified by HCD.
State law requires that the Housing Element include an evaluation of the status of implementation of
programs included in the previous Housing Element, to provide an understanding of which programs
should be carried forward to the next Housing Element Update cycle and insight on factors that may
have hindered full implementation of some programs.
Goals of the 2007 Housing Element
The policies and implementing programs of the 2007 Housing Element are organized under the
following five goals:
  Goal 1.     Housing Supply and Mix
              Promote a balanced supply of housing types, densities, and prices to meet the needs
              of all income groups residing or who wish to reside in Concord.
  Goal 2.     Quality Neighborhoods
              Preserve and enhance Concord’s residential neighborhoods and improve the quality of
              life for all residents.
  Goal 3.     Meeting Special Needs
              Promote the expansion of housing opportunities for all special needs groups, including
              seniors, female-headed households, people with disabilities, first-time homebuyers,
              large families, and homeless individuals and families.
  Goal 4.     Equal Housing Opportunities
              Strive for equal housing opportunity and access for all people regardless of race,
              religion, gender, marital status, age, ancestry, national origin, color, sexual orientation,
              familial status, source of income, or disability.
  Goal 5.     Energy Conservation
              Protect the environment and lower the cost of energy through energy conservation
              policies.
Summary of Accomplishments
During the previous Housing Element planning period (2007-2014), a total of 524 units were built or
approved in Concord and two units were substantially rehabilitated and given resale restrictions to
make the units affordable to very low-income households, totaling 526 units counted toward the
City’s RHNA goals. This was significantly fewer units than the City’s total RHNA of 3,043 units, as
                                                   120

shown in Table 50. Units constructed, approved, or rehabilitated in Concord between 2007 and
2014 achieved less than one percent of the RHNA goals for very low- and low-income units, five
percent of the RHNA goals for moderate-income units, and 34 percent of the RHNA goals for above
moderate-income units. Overall, Concord achieved approximately 17 percent of the City’s RHNA
during the previous Housing Element planning period. The shortfall in unit production is indicative of
the challenges associated with developing affordable housing and the lack of developer interest in
building new housing in Concord, which were discussed in earlier chapters of this Housing Element.
The following chapter contains goals, policies, and programs to address potential barriers to
residential development in Concord in an effort to better achieve the City’s RHNA goals during the
2014-2022 Housing Element cycle.

Despite the shortfall in achieving the City’s 2007-2014 RHNA goals, the City made some significant
achievements in improving the quality and standards of housing in Concord and implementing
programs to facilitate residential development affordable to households at a range of income levels
to ease development looking to the future. Major achievements include:
         Initiation of the planning process for the Downtown Specific Plan and adoption of the Specific
          Plan in June 2014, which facilitates residential development adjacent to the Downtown
          Concord BART Station.
         A comprehensive revision of the City’s Development Code with changes that allow for
          increased densities, provide enhanced guidance on permitted uses including standards for a
          range of housing types, and facilitate and incentivize residential and mixed-use development.
         As part of the revision of the City’s Development Code, adoption of the Affordable Housing
          Incentive Program provides significant incentives to projects in which at least 40 percent of
          units are affordable. Incentives include increased height and lot coverage limits as well as
          decreased minimum lot size, setback, and parking requirements. Additionally, projects
          eligible for the program are waived from use permit requirements.
         Approval of several small-lot subdivisions which would provide homes to low- and moderate-
          income homebuyers.
         Provision of grants and low-interest loans to support the rehabilitation of homes in need of
          repair or lead abatement.
         Implementation of the City’s multi-family rental housing inspection program.
         Disbursement of 17 first-time homebuyer loans.
         Amendments to the City’s Development Code to allow emergency shelters by right in the IBX,
                                                           121

        OBP, and IMX districts.
       Adoption of Green Building Standards effective January 2011.
Additionally, the City has committed significant staff and financial resources to planning for the
Concord Community Reuse Area, which will provide a considerable amount of additional market-rate
and affordable residential development potential in Concord along with commercial development
potential and open space. The environmental remediation and conveyance process that must take
place prior to development of the Reuse Area is ongoing, making it unlikely that much of the site’s
development potential will be realized in the 2014-2022 Housing Element planning period.
However, the Reuse Area is anticipated to be an important development site during future Housing
Element planning periods.
A detailed list of programs and achievements from the previous Housing Element planning period is
included as Appendix B to this Housing Element
                                                  122

7. HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND
        QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
This chapter presents Concord’s housing goals during the 2014-2022 planning period as well
as policies and programs to support these goals. While Concord has long had an active set of
housing programs, much of the activity was dependent on federal, state, and Redevelopment
Agency funding resources. Given the limitations imposed by current economic conditions and
budget constraints, and reductions in available funding, this Housing Element adds policies and
programs balanced with these limitations. All policies and programs have been reviewed to
maximize development of affordable housing, generate funding for affordable housing activities,
provide housing for special needs populations, and prevent displacement of existing residents.
It should be noted that certain prior programs have been modified or deleted to reflect current
market and fiscal conditions, as well as accomplishments during the previous Housing Element
period.
Many of the programs for the 2014-2022 planning period include quantified objectives, as
shown below. Unless noted otherwise, all quantified objectives are objectives for the entire
planning period.
Housing goals, policies, and programs are grouped under five headings: Housing Supply and Mix;
Quality Neighborhoods; Meeting Special Needs; Equal Housing Opportunities; and Energy
Conservation.

Policy H-1.1:    Ensure an adequate supply of housing sites to achieve the City’s Regional
                 Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) goals for the 2007-2014 planning period.
Program H-1.1.1: Continue to identify potential sites for reuse to ensure an adequate supply of
                 land for residential development.
                 To maintain adequate sites throughout the planning period to accommodate
                 the City’s RHNA, on a project basis, pursuant to Government Code Section
                 65863, the City will monitor available residential capacity and evaluate
                 development applications, particularly in non-residential and/or mixed use
                 zones. Should an approval of development result in a reduction of capacity
                 below the residential capacity needed to accommodate the remaining need
                 for extremely low-, very low-, low, or moderate-income households, the City
                 will identify and zone sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall.

                 Funding:                  General Fund.
Program H-1.2.3: Facilitate the development of housing in the Downtown that is affordable to a
                 households at a range of income levels (extremely-low, very-low, low,
                 moderate, and above-moderate incomes).
                 This program provides financial and regulatory incentives where possible to
                 encourage mixed-income housing developments (i.e. developments with
                 units affordable to extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate-, and above
                 moderate-incomes households) to help meet the need for units affordable to
                 lower income households.

                 Time Frame:               Ongoing.
                 Quantified Objective:     The Downtown Plan envisions up to 4,020 new
                                           units being added over the next 20-25 years. Much
                                           of Concord’s recent planning has been structured
                                           to promote the inclusion of units affordable to
                                           extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate-, and
                                           above moderate-incomes households within these
                                           anticipated new projects. In keeping with
                                           Concord’s current Inclusionary policy and In-Lieu
                                           Fee, it is expected that approximately 400 of these
                                           units will be targeted to be affordable to extremely
                                           low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income
                                           households, creating a mixed-income transit-
                                           oriented urban neighborhood. Based on the 8-year
                                           RHNA cycle, it is anticipated that at least 1,600
                                           new units will be developed during the period in the
                                           Downtown.

Program H-1.4.3: Review the development code as it relates to secondary units and consider
                 amendments to make the development of secondary units more feasible.
                 Potential amendments include eliminating the owner-occupancy requirement
                 for properties with secondary units in the transit overlay zone and
                 modifications to the requirements based on lot size, lot dimensions, and unit

Program H-1.4.4: Help to reduce the costs associated with building a second unit by working
                 with the Contra Costa Water District to examine the fees charged by the
                 District for extending service to a new detached second unit. The District’s
                 upcoming Facility Reserve Charge update process provides an opportunity to
                 engage with the District on this issue. At the municipal level, the City will
                 evaluate its fees for second units and determine if they can be “scaled” so
                 that small units or units created through the conversion of already habitable
                 floor space are charged at a lower commensurate rate than larger second
                 units, units created through a net addition of floor space, or single-family

Program H-1.5.3: Promote parcel consolidation to facilitate the assembly of new housing sites.
                 The City has been successful in promoting parcel consolidation for site
                 development, as noted in Table 43, and has incorporated parcel
                 consolidation efforts into the Downtown Concord Specific Plan, adopted in
                 June 2014. The City has also led an effort to consolidate Successor Agency
                 sites that have been included within the City’s Long Range Property
                 Management Plan (LRPMP), which is anticipated to be approved by the State
                 Department of Finance in early 2015. To continue to facilitate development
                 of new housing sites, the City will:
                    Initiate the Request for Proposal (RFP) process, once the LRPMP is
                     adopted, to invite qualified developers to propose housing projects on the
                     Oak Street and the Galindo Street Successor Agency sites.
                    Work in partnership with private landowners that are receptive to lot

Policy H-2.4:    Ensure that new development in Concord does not lead to the displacement
                 of existing residents.
Program H-2.4.1: Establish a mechanism to determine whether there is a risk of displacement
                 of existing Concord residents as new development activity takes place in the
                 City. Displacement might be direct, resulting from the redevelopment of
                 existing residential properties, or indirect, resulting from increases in market
                 rents as an area becomes more desirable due to new development. If this
                 mechanism determines that new development creates a displacement risk,
                 establish programs to mitigate this risk. Potential programs include:
                    Monitor residential rental rates, sales prices and commercial and office
                     lease rates on a quarterly basis to identify trends;
                    Monitor local and regional displacement studies such as the Institute of
                     Urban and Regional Development TOD Displacement Study through U.C.
                     Berkeley, which is examining ways to measure and predict displacement
                     of existing residents as a result of increasing investment in transit-
                     oriented development (TOD);
                    Prior to upzoning additional sites outside of the City’s Transit-Oriented
                     Development overlays, consider potential impact on existing residents
                     with respect to displacement risk;
                    Study and examine current local and regional just-cause eviction controls;
                    Study and examine local and regional relocation benefits provided by
                     developers to residents displaced by the demolition and redevelopment
                     of existing residential units and first right of return; and
                                               139

Quantified Objectives for 2014-2022
Local jurisdictions are required under Section 65583 of the California Government Code to propose
quantified housing objectives and seek to meet them through Housing Element goals, policies, and
                                                  148

programs. The quantified objectives do not represent a ceiling on development, but rather set a
target goal for the jurisdiction to achieve based on needs, resources, or constraints.
Table 51 shows proposed quantified objectives for the 2014 to 2022 planning period. The
objectives represent the analysis of prior Housing Element accomplishments and land use policies of
the City’s General Plan, and show the estimated number of units to be built, rehabilitated, or
conserved during the planning period.
Although the RHNA does not include allocations for extremely low-income households, Housing
Element Law requires that jurisdictions estimate the need for housing units affordable to extremely-
low income households. The quantified objectives assume that half of the very low-income housing
need consists of a need for housing to serve extremely low-income households
Table 51: Proposed Quantified Objectives, 2014-2022

 Notes:
 (a) Rehabilitation goals are based on anticipated funding available for rehabilitation through CDBG
 and Inclusionary Housing In-Lieu Fee revenue.
 (b) Preservation objectives are based on the number of existing affordable units at risk of
 conversion to market rate, assuming that approximately half will be preserved due to limited City
 resources to extend affordability. Information on the affordability of units at risk is not available for
 all properties, and is therefore estimated based on affordability levels at properties for which this
 information is available. Preservation objectives do not include additional units to potentially be
 preserved through the City's Condominium Conversion Ordinance, Mobile Home Conversion

2 ECONOMIC VITALITY
   Concord is committed to maintaining a vibrant and healthy
   economy, providing land for planned development, ensuring the
   fiscal and financial health of the City, and working with the private
   sector to ensure an adequate supply of skilled workers and capital
   needed to attract and maintain business. The goals, principles, and
   policies in this Element support business growth and development,
   which will result in increased employment, expansion of office and
   research and development uses, and a growing mix of retail
   shopping opportunities. Business attraction and retention programs
   will reflect the importance of Concord as a regional office and
   shopping destination, and as a center of innovative businesses that
   require highly skilled labor. In sum, the Element is intended to:
   •    Enhance linkages between economic development, land use and
        zoning;
   •    Provide further support for Downtown development and retail
        businesses;
   •    Affirm existing programs that have a bearing for economic
        development; and
   •    Capitalize on the unique economic development opportunities
        presented by the Concord Reuse Project site.
   2.1      CONCORD’S ECONOMIC BASE
   The Beginnings
   Concord’s economic growth was initially spurred by the post-World
   War II population growth, as schools and retail centers were built to
   serve the growing population. Following the start of BART service
   in 1973, Concord and other central Contra Costa County
   communities experienced substantial development of commercial,
   office, and industrial park space. Spurred by the formation of the
   redevelopment area in 1974, downtown Concord’s skyline also
   changed, with completion of The Bank of America Technology
   Center, Salvio Pacheco Square, One Concord Center, and other
                                                                     2-1

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          projects. The City’s central location, excellent transportation access,
                          an educated and skilled labor force, an attractive and affordable
                          residential community, educational and training resources,
                          Buchanan Field Airport and other regional assets have all helped
                          stimulate business development and economic growth in Concord.
                          Today, Concord has a strong economic base, including:
                          •    4.3 million square feet of Class A office space;
                          •    5.8 million square feet of industrial space;
                          •    70,000 square feet of space for research and development
                               (R&D) uses;
                          •    More than 900 hotel/motel rooms; and
                          •    48,000 square feet of exhibit space for meeting and convention
                               activities.
                          Concord has been a good location for business, and the City has
                          benefited from business growth. Citywide population expansion has
                          helped fuel the growth of businesses, including retail and
                          commercial service uses. By affirming this positive relationship in
                          the General Plan through sound economic and physical planning
                          and supporting infrastructure and services, the City will strengthen
                          its ability to serve future residents and businesses.
                          Job Growth Since 1980 and 2005 Employment
                          The number of jobs in Concord increased in the 1980s and 1990s
                          with completion of major office buildings and industrial parks, and
                          the City has continued to capture a significant share of countywide
                          employment increases. According to the Association of Bay Area
                          Governments         (ABAG),       Concord      businesses    employed
                          approximately 33,912 people in 1980 (16.8 percent of Countywide
                          employment), and the 2005 employment is estimated to be 66,560
                          (17.8 percent of countywide employment) – nearly doubling the job
                          base.
                          Between 1980 and 1990 the City was able to increase its capture of
                          County employment growth to 20 percent of the total, but over the
                          1990 to 2005 period, the City’s “capture rate” declined to 12.8
                          percent. This was due in part to the growth in retail and service
                          employment elsewhere in the County.
                          The growth in employment by industry group between 2000 and
                          2005, shown in Table 2-1, reflects marginally greater strength in the
                          City’s capture rate for retail trade and financial and professional
                          services. The overall decline in jobs since 2000 reflects slower

                                                    Future Employment
                                                    Employment growth in Concord will allow the City’s economic
                                                    base to expand in tandem with its population. Growth
                                                    accommodated under this General Plan will consist of an
                                                    employment mix that continues growth in the Central Area, the
                                                    Monument and Clayton Road corridors, North Concord, and the
                                                    Concord Reuse Project Area. This growth is expected to
                                                    accommodate regional businesses and local-serving jobs (in retail,
                                                    services, and other economic sectors) in existing and planned
                                                    shopping areas, offices, industrial parks, and mixed use areas. Over
                                                    50,000 jobs are projected to be added at buildout, an 84 percent
                                                    increase over 2006.
                                                    Concord is expected to have 167,360 residents at buildout under the
                                                    General Plan. The City’s population growth will help fuel expected
                                                    employment growth by creating demand for local serving jobs such
                                                    as those in the retail and service sectors. Employment growth will
                                                    also be stimulated by growth in the regional economy. This latter
                                                    growth will occur because of Concord’s ability to capture a share of
                                                    regional growth. This is influenced by the degree to which
                                                                                                                    2-3

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Concord’s assets, including its central location, good transportation,
                          affordable housing, and skilled labor force, attract business. These
                          twin demands also will spur the growth of other service jobs
                          (business, professional, medical, etc.) and public-sector uses.
                          Diversity in employment will expand job opportunities for local
                          residents and help to further stabilize the local economy.
                          Future Non-residential Land Needs
                          The land use program of the Concord 2030 Urban Area General
                          Plan reflects Concord’s historic economic evolution. It adjusts the
                          City’s historic economic mix to take into account the types of new
                          jobs the region as a whole attracts, and the type of jobs that
                          gravitate to Concord based on Concord’s capture of regional
                          economic growth. It provides for space to accommodate the kinds
                          of employment economically suited to Concord. During the time
                          horizon of the General Plan—assuming continuing strong regional
                          growth—it is reasonable to expect strong absorption of non-
                          residential development.
                          Even before the Reuse Project Area was added to the city’s
                          developable land supply, the General Plan allowed for significant
                          commercial growth in Concord. When the General Plan was
                          adopted in 2007, its Land Use Plan (referred to as the “General Plan
                          Diagram”) accommodated the following quantities of additional
                          development:
                          •    Office space, up to 6.1 million square feet;
                          •    Retail space, up to 4.5 million square feet;
                          •    Industrial and “flex” space, up to 2.2 million square feet; and
                          •    Wholesale and distribution space, up to 300,000 square feet.
                          These increases in built space for employment uses would take
                          place both on lands not currently in urban use as well as on lands
                          previously developed. In the latter case, the existing level of urban
                          activity could be increased through reuse or mixed use development
                          at higher intensities than existing uses.
                          The addition of the Concord Reuse Project site to the City’s land
                          supply substantially increases its capacity for employment growth.
                          The CRP Area is estimated to have the potential for 6.1 million
                          square feet of non-residential floor space, including a mix of office,
                          retail, and office-flex space. The precise of mix of each of these
                          activities is unknown at the time of Area Plan adoption, and will be
                          determined by market demand and future planning activities.
                          Additional square footage could be associated with institutional and

public uses. The CRP Area sites are large and potentially less
constrained by adjacent land uses than those in the existing
urbanized area of Concord. This supplemental land supply will
create unprecedente economic opportunities for the city and could
help diversify the employment base in the future.
2.2 CITY’S ROLE IN ECONOMIC
       DEVELOPMENT
The City of Concord has an important role in encouraging economic
development and providing support for businesses. For example, by
“streamlining” its design review, permitting, and licensing
processes, the City makes the approval process less complicated,
costly, and time-consuming for businesses. In addition, through its
General Plan, the City determines the amount of space available for
new business growth and sets guidelines for land use and
development intensity. The City is also responsible for maintaining
streets and other infrastructure, and overseeing workforce housing
programs and housing development incentives. City actions in these
areas can help to create an environment that is attractive for
business investment.
One of the most important contributions Concord will make to
ensure future economic development is simply to allocate land for
employment development, as described in greater detail in the
chapter on land use. Beyond that basic commitment, the City’s
support for economic development can take a variety of forms,
which are described generally in the following section on Goals,
Principles, and Policies. The General Plan also includes measures to
address potential future growth constraints, and emphasizes and
reinforces features of the Concord setting that contribute to the
City’s image, preserving the characteristics that make Concord a
desirable business location.
Economic Vitality Strategy
The City of Concord’s Economic Vitality Strategy is a tool for
guiding policy considerations that will inform Concord’s future
growth. The ability of the City to grow, develop, and provide goods
and services to its residents depends, in large measure, on the
strength of the local economy. Economic development programs
support business growth and development, which will result in
increased employment, expansion of office and research and
development uses, and a growing mix of retail shopping and dining
opportunities. Economic development programs are focused in the
areas of business retention, expansion, and attraction. The purpose

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          of the City’s Economic Vitality Strategy is to continue the City’s
                          proactive role in attracting and retaining businesses, reflecting the
                          importance of Concord as a regional office center and shopping
                          destination, and as an emerging center for technology enterprise.
                          The strategy focuses on the provision of effective and efficient local
                          government services, in tandem with efforts to support the local
                          economy’s adaptation to changing conditions. Concord’s ability to
                          thrive will be measured by the improved prosperity of its residents,
                          businesses, and employees.
                          Concord’s Economic Vitality program has produced both new
                          development and employment growth. The program has also
                          received public recognition for the following accomplishments:
                          •    The facilitation of job development (2,612 new jobs in Concord
                               between 1999-2005) through business expansion, attraction,
                               and retention. Examples include BEI Systron Donner, Cerus
                               Corporation, Seatel Inc., Biznet, El Tegra, Old Navy, IT
                               Corporation, Fry’s Electronics, Mimi’s, and BMW.
                          •    Redevelopment efforts, such as Bank of America Technology
                               Center, One Concord Center, Legacy            Apartments, two
                               downtown parking structures, Fry’s Electronics and Home
                               Depot, Brenden Theatre in Downtown Concord, and Downtown
                               and BART streetscape improvement projects.
                          •    Received recognition and a first place award by the Contra
                               Costa Economic Partnership for having the best permit center in
                               Contra Costa County.
                          Redevelopment Strategy
                          Effective February 1, 2012, all 400 redevelopment agencies in the
                          State of California were dissolved by order of the California
                          Supreme Court. The City of Concord has been named the
                          Successor Agency for the purpose of managing the former Concord
                          Redevelopment Agency’s non-housing assets and obligations. An
                          oversight board has been formed to address the fiduciary
                          responsibilities of the former Agency and the transfer of its assets
                          and responsibilities.
                          Prior to its dissolution, the Concord Redevelopment Agency had
                          produced plans that aimed to achieve strategic urban development
                          goals. The guiding strategies of the Concord Redevelopment Plan
                          focused on strengthening the City by using the City’s
                          redevelopment powers to redevelop underutilized uses at highly
                          visible and strategic locations, attracting and retaining businesses,
                          and supporting Concord’s strong retail base. The City is presently

                                                     Economic Vitality
evaluating ways to achieve these objectives without the tools
previously available to its Redevelopment Agency.
The City of Concord’s Redevelopment Areas include Central
Concord, portions of Monument Boulevard and Willow Pass Road
Corridor, portions of North Concord, and the Concord Reuse
Project Area, comprised of the former Concord Naval Weapons
Station Inland Area and the North Concord-Martinez BART station
property. The Monument Boulevard, Willow Pass Road, and North
Concord areas were added to the Redevelopment Plan in October
2006, as illustrated in Figure 2-1. The Concord Reuse Project was
added in 2011. The overall objective in the entire redevelopment
area was to alleviate blight and improve adverse conditions and to
implement the principals and policies of the City’s General Plan.
Although the Agency has been dissolved, this remains a valid
objective and will continue to guide public policy in these areas.
In the past, redevelopment in Central Concord was guided by the
Concord Redevelopment Strategy and Implementation Action Plan
(Strategic Plan). This Strategy set forth a vision, with goals and
objectives for downtown development. The implementation
component of the Plan provided a strategic guide for realizing these
approaches, identifying catalyst projects, specifications, and timing
for carrying out the strategy recommendations. Without the benefit
of a Redevelopment Agency, the City will need to explore new
funding sources for implementation in the coming years.
Past Redevelopment Plans recognized Concord’s opportunity to be
a “premier community to live, work, and do business.” The
Strategic Plan stated that Concord could provide a setting for “in-
town living and state-of-the-art business enterprise as well as
services and activities for residents of all ages.” The Plan included a
specific vision for different districts within the Redevelopment area
based on the unique physical characteristics and special assets of
each area.
The Goals, Principles, and Policies that follow build on these early
initiatives, providing an overall coordinating framework for the
General Plan for future implementation actions.

 2.3     KEY INITIATIVES
Six key initiatives underlie the goals, principles, and policies of this
element.
•    Promote Concord’s commitment to maintaining a vibrant and
     growing economy, providing land and infrastructure for
     planned development and services for residents and business,
     and ensuring the financial health of the City through sound
     fiscal management.
•    Integrate economic development into land use and
     transportation planning. Sites for new employment centers are
     proposed in the General Plan Diagram; the Plan also envisions
     more mixed use development in Central Concord and around
     the City’s two BART stations. The City will continue to seek
     out businesses in growth industries, streamline permit
     processes, and expedite permit decisions in support of a
     “business-friendly” climate.
•   Improve the quality and mix of uses in Downtown. By
    encouraging Downtown business growth, development, and
    investment, Concord can pursue a vision of in-town living in a
    pedestrian oriented environment and continue to support
    Downtown as the social, cultural, and entertainment center of
    the community.
•   Eliminate adverse physical and economic conditions throughout
    the City. Adverse physical and economic conditions have
    prevented the proper utilization of buildings and land. These
    conditions include deficient or deteriorated buildings, poor
    access, lots or buildings of inadequate size or substandard
    design, incompatible uses, and properties containing hazardous
    wastes.
•   Foster investment in the retail sector by providing appropriately
    located areas for a broad range of retail businesses, ranging
    from neighborhood convenience stores on small sites to larger
    sites for comparison shopping and value-oriented retailing. By
    emphasizing pedestrian amenities and mixed use, the City can
    make the retail experience more lively than in the past. A
    vibrant retail sector will confer a strong sense of place and also
    strengthen Concord’s community image.
•   Develop the Concord Reuse Project as a sustainable, transit-
    oriented community. This community should include new
    workplaces, shopping areas, services, visitor facilities, a diverse
    housing mix that enables affordability, and other activities

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          which create economic benefits and complement established
                          employment areas elsewhere in the city.
                          The Goals, Principles, and Policies that follow build on these
                          initiatives, providing an overall coordinating framework for the
                          General Plan for future implementation actions.
                          2.4      GOALS, PRINCIPLES, AND POLICIES
                          G O AL E - 1:     A F I SC AL LY H E AL T H Y CIT Y
                          Principle E-1.1:      Make Concord an Ideal, Fiscally Stable
                                                Place to Live and Work.
                          Policy E.1.1.1:       Ensure that Concord has adequate fiscal
                                                resources to secure the highest quality
                                                environment for its residents and businesses.
                                                The City’s current practice of providing long
                                                range planning, budgeting and performance
                                                accountability enables Concord to manage its
                                                resources efficiently and provide cost-
                                                effective service. Development under this
                                                General Plan will provide additional tax
                                                revenues to support governmental operations
                                                and investments in infrastructure and
                                                community facilities and services.
                          G O AL E - 2:     A ST RO N G RE G IO N AL C E NT ER
                          Principle E-2.1:      Establish Concord as the Major
                                                Regional Business and Employment
                                                Center of Contra Costa County.
                          Policy E-2.1.1:       Establish land use priorities that foster
                                                entrepreneurship, growth, and innovative
                                                business development.
                                                This will be done by promoting commercial
                                                development and establishing clear
                                                expectations for a streamlined development
                                                review process with minimal discretionary
                                                review.
                          Policy E-2.1.2:       Retain and attract business and facilitate
                                                businesses’ efforts to develop and expand.

                                              Economic Vitality
Policy E-2.1.3: Strengthen the business climate to ensure the
                growth, development, and prosperity of
                Concord’s business community.
                Through implementation of the Economic
                Vitality Strategy, adoption of the Development
                Code, streamlined review procedures, and
                expedited permit decisions, Concord will
                continue to foster a “business-friendly”
                climate.
Policy E-2.1.4:  Continue to improve the streamlined
                permit processes and expedited permit
                decisions.
Policy E-2.1.5: Attract businesses in growth industries that
                require highly skilled labor.
Policy E-2.1.6: Partner with the private sector to create and
                sustain markets that foster economic growth.
Policy E-2.1.7: Support the creation of job and contracting
                opportunities for Concord residents and
                businesses through the establishment of local
                hire preference, apprenticeships, internships,
                and other programs which support local hiring,
                training, and skill enhancement. Within the
                Concord Reuse Project Area, a good faith goal
                of 40% of project labor—first from Concord,
                and then from Contra Costa County—will be
                set on a project by project basis for public and
                private construction.
                Certified training and apprenticeship
                programs with proven performance can create
                stable employment opportunities and create
                jobs for returning veterans and others in the
                community. The Concord Reuse Project will
                create thousands of jobs in the construction
                sector for an extended period of years,
                creating unique opportunities for
                apprenticeships in the building trades.
Policy E-2.1.8: Support the regional role of the John Muir
                Health, Concord Campus for attracting
                medical related business employment for
                Concord.

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Policy E-2.1.9:     Recognize Buchanan Field Airport and
                                              Concord’s port facilities as regional economic
                                              assets.
                                              The Buchanan Field Airport is a county-
                                              owned facility that contributes to the local
                                              economy. Similarly, the Concord Naval
                                              Weapons Station-Tidal Area (Port Chicago) is
                                              designated as a “Port Priority Use” area in
                                              the San Francisco Seaport Plan, and non
                                              port-related uses generally would not be
                                              allowed in order to protect this asset.
                          Policy E-2.1.10:    Continue to maintain Concord’s infrastructure
                                              to support economic development including
                                              high       quality      streets,     transportation

                          Policy E-3.1.1:    Continue to promote the Downtown as the
                                             primary social, cultural, and entertainment center
                                             of the community.
                                              Concord’s historic Downtown plays a vital role
                                              in the City’s economy, and provides a niche

                                              The City will sustain this unique role for
                                              Downtown as commercial centers are developed
                                              in other parts of Concord. Downtown
                                              development should capitalize on the area’s
                                              historic architecture, public spaces, and
                                              established role as a pedestrian shopping

                                              districts in the City should complement
                                              Downtown in their mix of uses and activities.
                          Policy E-3.1.2:    Promote and support an urban, pedestrian-

Policy E-3.1.4: Encourage Downtown business growth,
                development, and investment.
                New Development Code standards for
                Downtown coupled with continued
                investments in streetscape improvements will
                help support Downtown development.
Policy E-3.1.5: Promote        transit-oriented       Downtown
                development and activities that take advantage
                of nearby transit services, such as BART, bus
                services, and Buchanan Field Airport.
Policy E-3.1.6: Ensure an attractive, pleasant, safe, clean, and

                patronage of nearby existing businesses is not
                negatively impacted.
                The City recognizes that new development
                construction can have unanticipated negative
                impacts on nearby existing businesses, such
                as a temporary reduction in available parking
                or reduced retail visibility. The City will work
                with all vested interests to ensure Downtown
                retail “business as usual” conditions are
                maintained during construction periods.

                                             development tools is to build on the City’s
                                             existing businesses and promote “going
                                             wholesale” with business-to-business
                                             relationships.
                          Policy E-4.1.4:    Encourage a mix of retail that draws local

                                             Bay Area.
                                             Specialized businesses can attract customers
                                             who would not normally shop in Concord.
                                             Diversity in the City’s retail base also will
                                             help fuel growth and maintain the City’s
                                             position as a regional center.

3 LAND USE
      This element of the General Plan constitutes the framework for land
      use planning in Concord to the year 2030. To provide context, the
      evolution of the City is described, and existing land use in the City
      is summarized. The guiding principles of the land use framework,
      the General Plan Map, the land use designation system, and the
      buildout of this Plan to the year 2030 are then presented. The goals,
      principles, and policies are intended to set the land use framework
      into motion and shape development for the life of this General Plan.
      3.1 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT:EXISTING
           LAND USE PATTERN
      Historical Land Use Development
      Much of Concord’s land use pattern can be traced to its evolution as
      a primary job center within the valley, with the focus on Downtown
      and subsequently on the radiating transportation corridors. Most of
      the residential development in the City is low density single-family
      housing, and much of the commercial development is retail-related.
      Office, business park, and light industrial uses are located adjacent
      to transportation infrastructure. Schools and parks are distributed
      throughout the residential neighborhoods in the City. This existing
      land use pattern is displayed in Figure 3-1.
      Land Use Characteristics
      As shown in Table 3-1, single-family residential is the most
      significant land use within the City limits. Occupying roughly 6,270
      acres, it comprises 32 percent of the land within Concord.
      Commercial and mixed use development is clustered in Concord’s
      Downtown and along the major transportation routes that radiate

Concord 2030 General Plan
Blank back of 11 x 17 figure
3-4
                                                     Land Use
 When considering the entire Planning Area—not just within the
 incorporated City limits—parks and open space uses account for
 the most land area. Although Concord has a sizeable inventory of
 community and neighborhood parks and recreation opportunities,
 as discussed in Chapter 6, the vast majority of the acreage in this
 category comes from open space areas in Los Medanos Hills and
 the Mount Diablo foothills, located in the eastern and southern
 portions of the Planning Area (see Figure 3-1).
The former Concord Naval Weapons Station (CNWS) takes up
another significant portion of the Planning Area. Historically, the
CNWS was treated as two major subareas—a “Tidal Area” along
Suisun Bay and an “Inland Area” which is predominantly south of
Highway 4.         Together these areas comprise 7,500 acres and
account for 26 percent of the Planning Area. The “Tidal Area” is
indicated in Table 3-1 (and on Figure 3-1) as being in “Military”
use. It includes a deepwater port used by the Army for weapons
shipment, as well as undeveloped land and wetlands. The “Inland
Area” is now known as the Concord Reuse Project (CRP) Area. It
is transitioning from military to civilian use and is planned for a
combination of development and open space. The Reuse Project
Area comprises about 5,000 acres, more than half of which will
become parkland under the CRP Area Plan.
Other land uses shown in Figure 3-1 include Vacant and
Public/Quasi Public. These sites are dispersed throughout the City,
and are not clustered within any specific area. Within the existing
urbanized area of Concord, one percent of the land is Vacant and
eight percent is used for Public/Quasi-Public use.
3.2      GENERAL PLAN LAND USE MAP
The land use framework of the General Plan is illustrated in the
General Plan Map (Figures 3-2 and 3-3), which is a graphic
representation of the themes and policies in the Plan. It designates
the proposed general location, distribution, and extent of land uses
through buildout. As required by State law, land use designations—
shown as color/graphic patterns, letter designations, or labels on the
Map—specify a range for housing density and building intensity for
each type of designated land use. These density/intensity standards
allow circulation and public facility needs to be determined.
The Map is to be used and interpreted only in conjunction with the
text and other figures contained in the General Plan. The legend of
the General Plan Map includes the land use designations described
below, which represent an adopted component of the Plan. The Map
                                                          3-5

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          is not parcel-specific, and uses on sites less than one acre in size
                          may not be depicted.
                          The Plan’s land use designations are presented in two maps. The
                          first map covers the entire Planning Area, while the second map is
                          an “inset” map covering the Concord Reuse Project area only. The
                          inset map is used because a unique set of land use designations
                          applies to the Reuse Project Area as a way to achieve specific
                          sustainability and placemaking objectives. The Reuse Project Area
                          is also displayed on the citywide map, but with more generalized
                          categories.
                          Density/ Intensity Standards
                          The General Plan establishes density/intensity standards for each
                          use designation. Residential density is expressed as housing units
                          per net acre (excluding existing and proposed public streets and
                          other rights-of-way and land undevelopable because of hazards or
                          physical or environmental constraints). Maximum permitted ratio of
                          gross floor area to site area, called Floor Area Ratio (FAR), is
                          specified for non-residential uses. FAR is a broad measure of
                          building bulk that controls both visual prominence and traffic
                          generation. It can be clearly translated to a limit on building bulk in
                          the Development Code and is independent of the type of use
                          occupying the building.
                          Density (housing units per net acre) and intensity (FAR) standards
                          are for net developable land (that is, excluding proposed streets and
                          other rights-of-way and areas subject to physical or environmental
                          constraints, which include ridgelines and steep hillside slopes, creek
                          corridors and floodways, and areas to be dedicated for greenways or
                          habitat protection). The density/intensity standards do not imply that
                          development projects will be approved at the maximum density or
                          intensity specified for each use. Development Code regulations
                          consistent with General Plan policies and/or site conditions may
                          reduce development potential within the stated ranges.
                          A separate set of land use policies and development standards
                          applies on the Concord Reuse Project site. These are described in
                          detail in the CRP Area Plan. Like the standards used elsewhere in
                          the City, density and FAR are used to specify the allowable
                          intensity of future development. However, a mix of land use and
                          densities are encouraged in most of the categories. The intent is to
                          create neighborhoods and business districts that contain a mix of
                          residential, commercial, public, and open space uses, and a high
                          level of walkability. An area wide cap on the total allowable
                          number of housing units and square feet of commercial space
                          applies within this area.

Land Use Designations
The following descriptions apply to land uses indicated on the
General Plan Land Use Map. Land use designations are organized
into the following categories: Residential, Commercial and Mixed
Use, Business Park/Industrial, and Community Land. Acreage by
land use designation is summarized in Table 3-2. The land use
designations are as follows:
Residential
Rural Residential (RR)
This designation is intended for very low density residential
development, at densities less than 2.5 units per net acre. Clustered
development is preferred to maximize open space.
Low Density Residential (LDR)
This designation is intended for residential development at densities
from 2.5 to 10 units per net acre. This density range is typical of a
single-family residential neighborhood, such as Sun Terrace or
Turtle Creek.
Medium Density Residential (MDR)
This designation is intended for residential development at densities
ranging from a minimum of 11 units per net acre to a maximum of
32 units per net acre. This density range accommodates a variety of
housing types, from small-lot single-family homes to townhomes
and other forms of multi-family development. It is applied along
major streets and transit corridors, including Monument Boulevard,
Willow Pass Road, and Clayton Road.
High Density Residential (HDR)
This designation is intended for residential development at densities
ranging from a minimum of 33 units per net acre to a maximum of
100 units per net acre. This density range would accommodate
attached homes, two- to four-plexes, and apartment buildings. This
designation is intended for areas in and adjacent to central Concord
and near BART stations, where higher densities may be appropriate.
Residential design standards will ensure land use compatibility.
North Todos Santos (NTS)
The designation is applied to the North Todos Santos neighborhood,
an area characterized by pre-World War II development, including
historic buildings. The designation allows a mix of offices, single-
family homes, and multifamily residences. Residential densities
range from 2.5 to 32 units per net acre and the maximum FAR is
0.5. Because of the area’s historic fabric, it is especially important

                          that new uses are compatible with prevailing neighborhood
                          character and maintain and enhance the neighborhood environment.
                          CRP Neighborhood and Village Districts (CRP-NV)
                          This designation applies within the Concord Reuse Project (CRP)
                          Area only. It is primarily intended for residential development at
                          densities ranging from 6 to 50 units per net acre. Residential areas
                          are focused around village centers containing a mix of residential,
                          commercial, public, and open space uses. The text box below
                          provides additional detail on allowable uses and intensities within
                          these areas.
                          Commercial and Mixed Use
                          Neighborhood Commercial (NC)
                          This designation is intended for neighborhood commercial centers
                          that provide convenience and comparison goods and services to the
                          local community. The maximum FAR is 0.35. Residential uses are
                          allowed above the ground level at densities from a minimum of 11
                          units per net acre to a maximum of 24 units per net acre. Examples
                          include neighborhood shopping centers, supermarkets, dry cleaners,
                          video stores, and small restaurants. This designation is distributed
                          throughout the City in order to locate commercial services within
                          close proximity to all of Concord’s residents.
                          Commercial Mixed Use (CMU)
                          This designation allows for a mix of commercial uses, offices,
                          multi-family uses, and mixed use development. The maximum
                          FAR is 1.0. Densities range from a minimum of 11 units per net
                          acre to a maximum of 40 units per net acre. The designation is
                          intended for use along commercial corridors such as Clayton Road,

                                   Village Neighborhoods. These areas will have a mix of detached and attached housing. Densities
                                   generally range from 6 to 45 units per net acre, although most of these areas will be developed at the
    CRP Neighborhood and Village
                                   lower end of this range (6 to 24 units per acre). Densities will be lowest near the established
                                   neighborhoods on the southern edge of the site.
                                   Village Center. At the heart of each Village Neighborhood is a mixed use center containing retail/
                                   service uses, multi-unit housing, civic facilities such as schools, and a public space such as a park
                                   or plaza. Additional uses that would contribute to the function of these areas as gathering places
                                   for the surrounding neighborhood could be considered. FARs range from 0.5 to 2.0 and net
                                   residential densities range from 18 to 50 units per net acre.
    Districts
                                   Central Neighborhoods. This is a mixed use residential district with a variety of housing types.
                                   The character is predominantly residential, although some of the multi-unit buildings could have
                                   ground floor retail and service uses. Community services and open spaces, including
                                   neighborhood parks, also will be located in these areas. FARs range from 0.5 to 2.0 and net
                                   residential densities range from 14 to 50 units per net acre.
                                   North Concord TOD Core. This district is envisioned as a high-intensity mixed use employment
                                   center adjacent to BART. It will include offices, retail, services, and open space. Multi-unit
    CRP TOD Districts
                                   housing, dining and entertainment, community and cultural/ civic facilities, and hotels are also
                                   appropriate here. FARs range from 2.0 to 4.0 and net residential densities range from 60 to150
                                   units per net acre.
                                   North Concord TOD Neighborhoods. This is a mostly residential mixed use district within easy
                                   walking distance of BART. It will include multi-unit housing, retail stores and services, community
                                   facilities, and open space. Other uses, such as dining and entertainment, live-work units, and
                                   offices may be appropriate. FARs range from 1.0 to 3.0 and net residential densities range from
                                   18 to 100 units per net acre.
                                   Commercial Flex. The Commercial Flex area is planned to accommodate light industrial,
                                   research and development, retail, hospitality, and office uses. The specific mix of uses in the
                                   Commercial-Flex district will be determined through future market and design studies. Activities
    CRP Non-residential
                                   which take advantage of this area’s proximity to Willow Pass Road and Highway 4 are
                                   encouraged. FARs in the Commercial-Flex area may range from 0.2 to 1.0.
                                   Campus. The Campus district will provide a master planned campus environment for a major
                                   educational, health care, research and development, or comparable use. One prototype use for
                                   this site would be a university with up to 10,000 students and 1,700 employees.
    Development Districts
                                   First Responder Training Facility. This site will include training grounds and other facilities
                                   required to serve regional first responders, including the Contra Costa County Sheriff and Fire
                                   Departments.

 To ensure the efficient use of land, the districts are subject to minimum density standards as well as maximum density
standards. They are also subject to “convenience standards” which indicate the minimum distance from future parcels in each
area to transit stops, bike lanes, open space, and other facilities. The CRP Area Plan should be should be consulted for further
detail and the additional provisions which apply in each district.

                                                         Land Use
Regional Commercial (RC)
This designation is intended for large-scale commercial
development (greater than 80,000 square feet) that serves both local
residents and residents from the surrounding region. A broad range
of retail uses and personal services are envisioned, including
regional shopping centers, big box retail, home improvement sales
and service, and warehouse membership clubs, as well as new auto
sales and services, and travel-related services such as hotels, gas
stations, and restaurants. The maximum FAR is 0.5.
Service Commercial (SC)
This designation is intended to provide sites for commercial
businesses that are not appropriate in other areas because of high
volumes of vehicle traffic and potential adverse impacts on other
uses. This designation allows small scale commercial uses that
provide goods and services to employees, residents and visitors. It
includes automotive sales and services, building materials,
warehousing, distribution and personal storage located on major
arterial streets, as well as retail uses, services, and small offices. The
maximum FAR is 0.8.
Concord Reuse Project                Non-Residential       Development
District (CRP-NR)
The CRP-NR designation is mapped on the Concord Reuse
Project (CRP) site only. It includes three contiguous areas, as
shown on Figure 3-3. These include: (a) a Commercial-Flex
district south of Highway 4; (b) a Campus district on the west
side of Willow Pass Road south of Mt. Diablo Creek; and (c) a
First Responder Training Facility north of Highway 4. Additional
information on this category is provided in the text box above.
Business Park/ Industrial

                          This designation allows primary manufacturing, refining, and
                          similar heavy industrial activities. It also accommodates
                          warehousing, distribution and port-related uses, with support
                          commercial services and ancillary office space. No retail uses are
                          allowed. This designation is applied primarily to facilities north of
                          SR 4. The maximum FAR is 0.6.
                          Community Land
                          Public/Quasi-Public (PQP)
                          This designation is applied to property owned by governmental
                          entities and to semi-public facilities. It includes Buchanan Field
                          Airport, hospitals, schools, government offices, corporation yards,
                          and public facilities such as recycling centers, sewage treatment
                          facilities, and fire stations. Smaller governmental offices, places of
                          religious assembly not occupying extensive land areas, and similar
                          smaller public facilities are not shown on the General Plan Land
                          Use Map. New public/quasi public facilities may be appropriate in
                          any land use designation based on need, subject to environmental
                          review. The maximum FAR is 1.5.
                          Hospital/Medical Center (H/MC)

                                                     Land Use
Military (MIL)
This designation applies to the Tidal portion of the former Concord
Naval Weapons Station, the Military Ocean Terminal Center, and
the Coast Guard housing area adjacent to the CRP site. The Tidal
Area contains port and industrial buildings, and additional land for
support uses and facilities, which will continue to be used by the
Army for an undetermined period of time.
Open Space (OS)
This designation is intended for large areas that are necessary for
natural resource protection, the managed production of natural
resources, the provision of natural resources, outdoor recreation
(including trails), scenic value, and the assurance of public health
and safety. This designation includes private recreation facilities
and larger privately-owned areas dedicated as permanent open
space within residential subdivisions.
Concord Reuse Project Open Space (CRP-OS)
This designation includes the portions of the Concord Reuse Project
identified for long-term preservation as open space. It is comprised
of two “districts” (see Figure 3-3). The Conservation Open Space
District includes environmentally sensitive lands and other natural
areas in the Los Medanos Hills and along Mount Diablo Creek.
Most of this area is planned to become part of a new regional park.
The Greenways and Citywide Parks District includes a “frame” of
open space and linear parks around future neighborhoods, as well as
large areas planned for active recreation.
Active Parks (P)
This designation is intended for improved public park facilities. It
includes neighborhood and community parks; public golf courses;
and recreational facilities that provide visual open space and serve
the outdoor recreational needs of the community. Active parks are
also permitted in the other designations on the General Plan Map,
and a General Plan Map Amendment is not required if a new park is
created.
Wetlands/Resource Conservation (WRC)
This designation applies to wetlands and resource conservation
lands. It is intended to protect the wildlife, hydrological, and
biological resources in these areas. It allows only very low intensity
open space uses that are compatible with and do not disturb the
resources to be protected.
                                                        3-17

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Rural Conservation (RCON)
                          This designation provides for protection of rural hillside areas.
                          Single family residential development of up to 1 unit per 20
                          developable net acres would be allowed, with clustering encouraged
                          to minimize impacts on views of the area.
                          Other
                          Unclassified (U)
                          This designation is intended for canals and rights-of-way and
                          reflects no prescribed land use designation.
                          Summary of Density and Intensity
                          The density and intensity (FAR) standards used in the General Plan
                          are shown in Table 3-3. The table is based on net density (based on
                          net acreage), rather than gross density (based on gross acreage). A
                          gross acre is a measure of total land area of any lot including future
                          streets, parks, and other land dedications. In comparison, a net acre
                          excludes land to be dedicated for required easements for vehicles
                          and right-of-ways, land determined to be hazardous and/or
                          unbuildable, or land to be dedicated for schools and parks or other
                          facilities dedicated for public use. Formulas based on net density or
                          net acreage exclude such areas from the calculation.
                          In a few instances, the net density in existing neighborhoods is
                          higher than the range shown on the General Plan Map. In other
                          words, the lot sizes are smaller than those typically found in the
                          corresponding General Plan Map category. This may be due to the
                          dedication of areas as private open space within larger subdivisions,
                          with housing clustered on the flatter portions of a site. This was
                          historically encouraged as a way to preserve hillsides and creeks,
                          and create neighborhood parks and greenbelts. Future development
                          will be required to adhere to the density standards established in the
                          General Plan. Creative approaches to site planning and open space
                          dedication will continue to be encouraged to protect natural
                          features.

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Urban Limit Line
                          An Urban Limit Line (ULL) is established as shown on the General
                          Plan Land Use Map (see Figure 3-2). The ULL is a line beyond
                          which urban development will not be allowed, except for public
                          parks and recreational facilities. Only uses consistent with the
                          General Plan “Wetlands/Resource Conservation,” “Rural
                          Conservation,” and “Open Space” land use designations and public
                          uses not otherwise provided for within the City are allowed beyond
                          the ULL. Specific policies for administering the ULL are in the
                          Growth Management Element.
                          Concord’s ULL reflects a commitment to focus future growth
                          within the City in order to prevent urban sprawl into hillsides and
                          environmentally sensitive areas surrounding the City. The ULL
                          protects the health, safety, welfare, and quality of life of the
                          residents of Concord by concentrating future residential,
                          commercial, and industrial growth in areas already served by urban
                          services or areas where such services are to be provided consistent
                          with this General Plan. The policies in the Growth Management
                          Element implementing the ULL allow sufficient flexibility within
                          its limits to respond to the City’s changing needs over time. The
                          ULL complements General Plan policies promoting additional
                          housing opportunities, emphasizing infill and mixed development,
                          and supporting a thriving downtown.
                          As noted in Chapter 1, the General Plan covers land outside the
                          Concord City Limits as well as land within the City limits. This
                          land area encompasses both sides of the Urban Limit Line, and
                          includes developed areas as well as open space. Although the City
                          does not have zoning jurisdiction over land outside the City limits,
                          it has assigned General Plan Map designations to express the City’s
                          position on appropriate future land uses in these areas. In the event
                          these areas are annexed in the future, the City’s General Plan Map
                          designation would be used to determine future zoning.
                          Special Overlays
                          Buchanan Field Airport
                          State law provides for a special planning process to assure
                          consideration of airport interests in the formulation of local
                          community plans. Pursuant to State law, the Contra Costa County
                          Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) has been established as an
                          independent body to advise local jurisdictions, such as the City of
                          Concord, on appropriate land use policy for the area near Buchanan
                          Field Airport to assure development compatibility with planned
                          airport operations. To aid in this task, the ALUC has adopted the
                          Contra Costa County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, which
3-20

                                                      Land Use
covers the area near the airport. The Plan identifies areas near the
airport where structural height limits, and public safety and noise
compatibility restrictions are applicable. These restrictions have
been incorporated into the General Plan Land Use Map to ensure
continued compatibility between the City’s land uses and future
airport operations.
Transit Station Overlay
The Development Code will include a transit station overlay
district for the Downtown and North Concord BART stations.
Incentives for additional density and intensity will be provided
within this area to encourage transit-oriented development.
General Plan Land Use by Planning Subareas
Concord is divided into eleven planning subareas, as shown in
Figure 3-4. The City’s subareas are defined geographically,
following major transportation routes, natural topographic features,
or city/neighborhood boundaries. Although all subareas include a
variety of land uses, each is generally dominated by one land use
type that defines its identity. A description of these subareas
follows.
1. Central Concord
The Central Concord subarea lies along both sides of Willow Pass
Road from the westerly City limits to the Civic Center near Parkside
Drive. The subarea includes West Concord, Stanwell Business Park,
Concord Industrial Park (south of Willow Pass Road), Central
Downtown (between SR 242 and Port Chicago Highway), Sun
Valley Mall and the Willows Shopping Center, and frontages along
Willow Pass Road between Downtown and the Civic Center.
2. Four Corners/Ygnacio Valley
The Four Corners/Ygnacio Valley subarea is a diverse residential
area located north and south of the Monument Boulevard business
corridor. The subarea includes the following neighborhoods: Ellis
Lake, Meadow Homes, Cambridge, San Miguel, Treehaven, Colony
Park, and north Ygnacio Valley including the Oak Grove/Treat area.
The subarea is bounded by the Concord City limits on the west,
Clayton Road near Downtown on the north, and the Contra Costa
Canal and its regional trail on the east and the south.
3. Clayton Valley
The Clayton Valley subarea is the most extensive developed
subarea in the City. The subarea encompasses the Clayton Road
corridor and the residential areas lying to the north and south of the
commercial corridor. The neighborhoods in Clayton Valley include:
                                                         3-21

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Crawford Village, El Monte, Canterbury, Turtle Creek,
                          Crossings/Walnut Country, Clayton Valley Highlands, Farm
                          Bureau/Walnut Lands, Dana Estates/Landana, Westwood, Mt.
                          View, Silverwood, Ayers Ranch, and Kirkwood. The Clayton
                          Valley subarea is bounded by Willow Pass Road, the Concord
                          Reuse Project area, the City of Clayton, Pine Hollow Road, Ygnacio
                          Valley Road, and Cowell Road.
                          4. Olivera/Port Chicago
                          This subarea is a large residential area extending from downtown
                          Concord north to SR 4; the subarea is bounded on the east by the
                          Concord Reuse Project area and to the west by the Concord City
                          limits and Buchanan Field Airport. This subarea contains various
                          neighborhoods including Hillcrest, Uplands, Holbrook, and Sun
                          Terrace, as well as the North Todos Santos area, which is the oldest
                          and most historically significant neighborhood in the City. The
                          other neighborhoods in this subarea were, for the most part, built
                          during the period of the 1940s to the 1960s.
                          5. Concord Reuse Project (CRP) Area
                          The CRP subarea is located south of SR 4 and generally comprises
                          the flatter portions of the former Concord Naval Weapons Station
                          lnland Area, including those areas planned for future development.
                          The subarea adjoins the North Concord – Martinez BART station
                          and SR 4, the Los Medanos Hills to the east, and developed
                          properties (primarily single family lots) along the south and west
                          edges of the Navy lands. Most of this area is vacant, although there
                          are remnants of the site’s prior use as a military weapons storage
                          facility.
                          6. North Concord
                          The North Concord subarea is the developed industrial land north of
                          SR 4. The subarea extends from the eastern City limit to Solano
                          Way; it includes the administrative area of the former CNWS,
                          which is now planned for a County First Responder (police and fire
                          training) Facility. It also includes Diablo Creek Golf Course
                          (owned and operated by the City), the Bates Avenue and North
                          Point areas, Mallard Reservoir and Bollman Treatment Plant
                          (owned and operated by the Contra Costa Water District), the
                          Concord North Industrial Park, the Military Ocean Terminal
                          (operated by the US. Army) and those properties along Arnold
                          Industrial Way between Port Chicago Highway and Solano Way.

                          of Port Chicago before that community was acquired by the Federal
                          Government for safety reasons in the middle of the 20th century. A
                          large majority of this subarea is either owned by the U. S.
                          Government or identified for preservation and protection as a salt-
                          water marsh at the south edge of Suisun Bay. The Southern Pacific
                          Railroad and Atchison-Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad both traverse
                          the study area in an east-west alignment.

11. Los Medanos Hills
The Los Medanos Hills subarea consists of the hills lying along the
northeastern edge of the Planning Area on both sides of Highway 4.
It also includes the Mt Diablo Creek corridor on the Concord Reuse
Project site. The hills are an important topographic feature that
provide an open space “frame” between Concord and Pittsburg.
This area is largely undeveloped, with some remnant uses from
former military activities. The area is planned for long-term
conservation as open space.
3.3 GOALS, PRINCIPLES, AND POLICIES
Residential Neighborhoods
Residential Neighborhoods are areas of the City characterized by
housing, parks, and public facilities. Most residential neighborhoods
have land use designations of Rural Residential, Low Density
Residential, Medium Density Residential, and High Density
Residential. Residential Neighborhoods are also envisioned within
the CRP Neighborhood and Village Districts and Concord Reuse
Project Transit Oriented Development District designations.

Principle LU-1.1: Preserve and Enhance Neighborhood
                      Character.
Policy LU-1.1.1:      Support land use decisions that reinforce and
                      capitalize on neighborhood strengths and
                      benefit neighborhood identity and scale.
Policy LU-1.1.2:      Require new development in residential areas
                      to preserve and enhance positive neighborhood
                      characteristics.
                      New design standards for residential
                      development will help implement this policy.
Policy LU-1.1.3:      Ensure that the scale, operation, location, and
                      other characteristics of community facilities,
                      including parks, schools, childcare facilities,
                      religious institutions, and other public and

                                             and quality of neighborhoods.
                                             This will be addressed by design guidelines
                                             and standards for transitions between
                                             different uses.
                          Policy LU-1.1.4:   Protect residential uses from the impacts of
                                             more intensive land uses through good site

                                             driveway access, and limitations on hours of
                                             operation can help minimize adverse impacts.
                          Policy LU-1.1.5:   Identify opportunities for public/private
                                             cooperation and City actions for the mitigation
                                             of noise, traffic, and other potential conflicts
                                             between commercial uses, multi-family
                                             residential uses, and single-family residential
                                             neighborhoods.
                          Policy LU-1.1.6:   Prohibit conversion of residences backing onto
                                             roadways to commercial or office uses which
                                             would gain access or seek visibility from the
                                             roadways.
                          Policy LU-1.1.7:   Encourage high quality design upgrades for
                                             existing multi-family uses and require high
                                             quality design for new multi-family projects.
                          Policy LU-1.1.8:  Continue to support and promote housing
                                             conservation      and     home      remodeling,
                                             expansion, and updating to maintain the
                                             quality of the housing stock.
                                             Examples of the City programs that will be
                                             used are in the Housing Element.
                          Policy LU-1.1.9:   Preserve visible hillsides and open space areas
                                             through      techniques    such    as    cluster

                  encourage retention of historic buildings
                  through flexible reuse provisions.
                  The General Plan has established a new land
                  use designation for the North Todos Santos
                  neighborhood. A zoning district has been
                  created for the neighborhood to help conserve
                  its character.
Policy LU-1.1.11: Allow residential care and group homes in a
                  manner consistent with State law, while
                  ensuring that the scale, operation, location and
                  other characteristics of these facilities does not
                  adversely impact the character and quality of
                  neighborhoods.
Policy LU-1.1.12: Adopt design guidelines for single family
                  homes in existing neighborhoods to ensure
                  that new construction and exterior alterations
                  and additions are compatible in scale to the
                  character of surrounding homes.
                  These guidelines could address such issues as
                  the design of second story additions and
                  limitations on house size based on lot size.
Principle LU-1.2:Facilitate Community-Oriented
                  Neighborhoods.
Policy LU-1.2.1:  Provide opportunities for neighborhood
                  participation in the land use decision-making
                  process.
                  The City will encourage and support
                  community input in the review of new projects
                  adjacent to residential areas. This will
                  provide an opportunity to identify key issues
                  and allow applicants to respond early in the
                  process.
Policy LU-1.2.2:  Pursue neighborhood planning strategies to
                  conserve and enhance neighborhood livability
                  and     safety,    and      eliminate      adverse
                  characteristics that lead to neighborhood
                  decline.

                                            residents and business owners. Solutions
                                            depend on the specific issue, and span the
                                            spectrum from adding neighborhood watch
                                            groups, implementing traffic calming
                                            programs, funding organizations that provide
                                            specific neighborhood services, to ensuring
                                            that business and residential owners comply
                                            with City codes regarding private property
                                            maintenance.
                          Policy LU-1.2.3:  Foster amenities and services that make
                                            Concord’s neighborhoods desirable places to
                                            live.
                                            Examples include sidewalks, appropriate
                                            street lighting, bike paths, trees, parks, high
                                            quality schools and natural features, which
                                            enhance neighborhood character.
                          Policy LU-1.2.4:  Encourage neighborhood retail and service
                                            uses within convenient walking distance of all
                                            residential neighborhoods, where feasible.
                          Principle LU-1.3: Encourage             Infill        Residential

                          Policy LU-1.3.1:  Encourage a variety of housing types on infill
                                            development sites.
                                            Townhomes, zero-lot line single family
                                            dwellings, courtyard apartments, and small-
                                            scale multi-family projects are some of the
                                            types of housing that are suitable for infill
                                            sites.
                          Policy LU-1.3.2:  Establish standards to address the transition
                                            between existing neighborhoods and new infill

                                            Such standards could include height and
                                            setback requirements and standards for
                                            screening, lighting, landscaping, refuse
                                            collection, and location of parking.

                       that would be appropriate.
Principle LU-1.4: Protect the Unique Character of Rural
                       Residential Areas Throughout the City.
Policy LU-1.4.1:       Maintain the character of rural residential
                       areas by preserving large lot sizes and limiting
                       lot coverage.
Policy LU-1.4.2:       Allow the keeping of horses on lots larger than
                       one-half acre in a manner that preserves the

                       the surrounding neighborhood.
Centers
Concord is a City of neighborhoods, connected by several clusters
of commercial uses that provide goods, services, and employment
opportunities to both local residents and people from the
surrounding communities. These clusters—referred to as
“centers”—are the basis for organizing policies in the General Plan
that pertain to maintaining and improving the quality and selection
of commercial opportunities in Concord. The General Plan
identifies three types of centers in Concord: Neighborhood/ Village
Centers, Regional Centers, and Central Concord.
Neighborhood/ Village Centers
A neighborhood center is typically located on an accessible, main
transportation artery and is composed of low-scale commercial land
uses that provide goods and services to the local community. It is
often surrounded by higher density housing, which helps to support
ridership for a transit stop. Existing neighborhood centers are found
throughout Concord, such as at the intersections of Treat Boulevard
and Oak Grove Road, or at Ygnacio Valley Road and Clayton Road.
Neighborhood centers are also planned on the Concord Reuse
Project site, where they form the focal point of residential “villages”
surrounding them. To ensure that a diverse range of neighborhood
shopping opportunities is available and easily accessible in
Concord, the Plan promotes the vitality of existing centers and their
renovation. As appropriate, it also promotes the creation of new
centers.

                          Policy LU-2.2.1:     Designate sites for local-serving office use in
                                               close proximity to neighborhoods that provide
                                               convenient access         to      local patrons,
                                               complement nearby retail enterprise, and
                                               buffer residential uses from arterial streets.

Policy LU-2.2.2:      Allow resident-serving offices in existing

                      they are ancillary in size, scope, and location
                      to primary retail uses.          Resident-serving
                      offices are also permitted in new neighborhood
                      commercial centers, and need not be ancillary
                      to retail uses in such cases if sufficient retail
                      choices exist nearby.
                      Resident-serving offices are small offices
                      serving walk-in clientele, such as accounting,
                      legal aid, real estate brokers, and insurance
                      and travel agents.
Regional Centers
Shopping and the use of services are activities that provide for
social contact as well as business transactions. Since Concord
attracts shoppers from a large region, and stores in one part of the
City are often frequented by residents from other neighborhoods,
regional centers are critical in shaping the identity and image of the
City in the region and the neighborhoods within the City itself.

                          Central Concord
                          Central Concord is the historic, economic, and cultural heart of the
                          City. It encompasses the original townsite that grew into Concord,
                          and this rich historic legacy is visible in the number and variety of
                          historic sites in the area, such as Todos Santos Plaza, the Salvio
                          Pacheco Adobe, and the County Fire House. Central Concord is
                          also a focal point for modern-day activities in the City. Its shopping
                          opportunities, cultural activities, and pedestrian-oriented scale in the
                          Downtown area ensure that it remains a main attraction for residents
                          and visitors alike. Many of the City’s major employers are also
                          located in Central Concord, including the Bank of America Concord
                          Technology Center, Chevron Credit Card Center, the Civic Center,

                     a focal point for business, entertainment,
                     dining, cultural, and civic gatherings.

                     active street frontages, particularly around
                     Todos Santos Plaza, and through limitations
                     on uses that would not be compatible with or

                          Policy LU-9.1.6:  Establish standards for new development and
                                            additions to existing development to
                                            incorporate green building measures.
                                            Green building measures will be established
                                            through the City’s Climate Action Plan.

                   landscaping. Permeable pavements, in
                   particular, have tremendous potential for
                   stormwater management. Pedestrian safety
                   can be achieved through installing better
                   security lighting and signage, creating grade-
                   separated walkways, and marking pedestrian
                   crossings.

4 GROWTH MANAGEMENT
    4.1 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
    The purpose of the Growth Management Element is to provide
    guidance and specific actions to manage and mitigate the impacts of
    future urban growth and development within the City of Concord.
    The Growth Management Element has four key objectives:
    •    To ensure that new residential, business, and commercial
         growth pays for the facilities required to meet the demands
         resulting from that growth
    •    To support cooperative transportation and land use planning
         among Contra Costa cities, towns, and transportation agencies,
         including the City of Concord
    •    To support land use patterns within Concord that make more
         efficient use of the transportation system
    •    To support infill and revitalization in existing urban and
         brownfield areas.
    This comprehensive, long-range Element establishes goals,
    principles, policies, and benchmarks for the City’s transportation
    systems and public services. The intent is to balance the demands
    for transportation improvements and public facilities generated by
    new development with the plans of service providers, capital
    improvement programs, transportation improvement programs, and
    development mitigation programs.
    New urban growth and development in the City will increase the
    need for transportation improvements and infrastructure. The City
    regards the performance standards and benchmarks in this Element
    as an important component in assessing and mitigating the impacts
    of this development. The Growth Management Element not only
    ensures that adequate transportation infrastructure and public
    facilities are provided as Concord grows, but also that the quality of
    life enjoyed by Concord’s residents and businesses is preserved and
    enhanced.

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          The Growth Management Element responds to the requirements of
                          the Measure J Growth Management Program, approved by Contra
                          Costa County voters in 2004 and administered by the Contra Costa
                          Transportation Authority (CCTA). Measure J authorized a 25-year
                          extension of the previous Measure C Contra Costa Transportation
                          Improvement and Growth Management Program (GMP) approved
                          by the County’s voters in 1988. The extension will raise a total of
                          $2 billion, which will help fund transportation improvements. The
                          money is derived from a ½ percent transportation and retail
                          transactions and use tax intended to address existing, major regional
                          transportation problems. The funding is allocated to the 18 cities in
                          Contra Costa County on a per capita basis.
                          Local jurisdictions receive 18 percent of Measure J sales tax
                          revenues only if they comply with the GMP requirements. To
                          qualify for these funds, each jurisdiction must:
                          •   Adopt a Growth Management Element or Correspondence
                              Table demonstrating compliance;
                          •   Participate in an ongoing cooperative planning process with
                              other jurisdictions in Contra Costa County;
                          •   Adopt a development mitigation program that ensures that new
                              development pays its fair share of the costs of additional
                              facilities needed to support it;
                          •   Disclose the impacts of local land use decisions on the
                              transportation system;
                          •   Adopt a transportation systems management resolution or
                              ordinance;
                          •   Address housing options to demonstrate reasonable progress in
                              providing housing opportunities for all income groups; and
                          •   Adopt an Urban Limit Line (ULL).
                          The Growth Management Element incorporates specific
                          requirements of Measure J and augments them with additional
                          policies and level of service (LOS) benchmarks. These benchmarks
                          are consistent with those referenced in other elements of the 2030
                          Concord General Plan, including the Concord Reuse Project (CRP)
                          Area Plan.

  On November 13, 2007, the City approved Resolution 07-80, thereby adopting Contra Costa County’s voter-approved 'Measure L'
ULL. The resolution included a provision that if the tidal portion of the Concord Naval Weapons Station is closed and becomes
available for civilian or joint use under the City of Concord’s planning jurisdiction, the City will initiate proceedings for a voter
approved ULL.

                          Under this goal, the Growth Management policies meet a specific
                          requirement of the Measure J GMP to address housing options for
                          all income levels in Concord. The Housing Element provides
                          additional goals, policies and programs that promote a balanced
                          supply of housing types, densities and prices to meet the needs of all
                          income groups in Concord.

Under this goal, the City seeks to reduce the number and length of
commute trips by encouraging implementation of Transportation
Demand Management (TDM) measures.                      These measures
complement other General Plan policies supporting land use
patterns that make more efficient use of the transportation system.
Principle GM-4.1: Promote reduced commute trips and
                        lengths.
Policy GM-4.1.1:        Encourage new development to develop and
                        implement TDM measures which reduce
                        commuting by single occupant vehicles and
                        instead promote and encourage transit,
                        ridesharing, bicycling, walking, and other
                        measures for the journey to work.
                        The City’s TDM measures are specified in the
                        adopted “Concord Transportation Demand
                        Management Program Ordinance.” The
                        Concord TDM Program serves to promote and
                        encourage the use of alternatives to
                        commuting by single-occupant vehicles. It
                        supports regional efforts to relieve traffic
                        congestion, thereby reducing noise, pollution
                        and energy consumption. TDM measures may
                        include but are not limited to promoting the
                        use of transit, ridesharing, bicycling, walking,
                        flexible work hours and telecommuting as
                        alternatives to single- occupant vehicles.
Principle GM-4.2: Support transit, bicycling and walking.
Policy GM-4.2.1:        Require new development to incorporate
                        transit, bicycle and pedestrian access where
                        feasible and appropriate, consistent with the
                        General Plan Transportation and Circulation
                        Element and the Countywide Bicycle and
                        Pedestrian Master Plan.

                          Under this goal, the Growth Management Element incorporates
                          principles and policies to manage future traffic congestion by
                          incorporating level of service (LOS) benchmarks for City
                          intersections and roadway segments. The benchmarks will be used
                          by the City to determine appropriate mitigation measures for future
                          projects, and to help inform land use planning and transportation
                          investments. “Benchmarks” are used rather than “standards” so that
                          the City has the flexibility to develop place-based transportation
                          solutions. These solutions balance transportation goals with other

                                                generate less than 100 net new peak hour
                                                vehicle trips, based on local conditions.

                                                A financial plan listing funding sources for
                                                such projects as well as the intended project
                                                phasing shall be identified in the City’s
                                                CIP/TIP.
                          GOAL GM-7: DEVELOPMENT MITIGATION
                          The City will continue to implement a comprehensive program
                          which links the review and approval of new development to
                          forecasts and plans for transportation improvements, public
                          services, and public facilities.
                          Principle GM-7.1: Mitigate           the     impacts       of     new
                                                development on public facilities and
                                                services.
                          Policy GM-7.1.1:      Continue to require new development to pay a
                                                local traffic impact fee based on its
                                                proportional share of the cost to construct
                                                citywide transportation improvements to
                                                mitigate development impacts.
                                                The revenue provided from this program shall
                                                not be used to replace developer funding of
                                                any project-specific improvements that are
                                                required above and beyond the citywide
                                                improvements identified in this program.

                  Likewise, Measure J funds will not be used in
                  lieu of developer funding for transportation
                  projects deemed necessary to mitigate the
                  impacts of specific development projects.
Policy GM-7.1.2:  Participate in the TRANSPAC Sub-regional
                  Transportation Mitigation Program to fund the
                  regional transportation improvements needed
                  to mitigate the impacts of new development on
                  the regional transportation system.
Principle GM-7.2: Establish performance standards for
                  public services and facilities.
                  Performance standards for public services and
                  facilities such as parks, schools, and utilities
                  have been established through other elements
                  of this General Plan. For example, the Parks,
                  Open Space, and Conservation Element
                  establishes a standard of five acres of parkland
                  per every 1,000 residents. Future developers
                  must dedicate land or pay an in-lieu fee to
                  ensure that this standard is met as new housing
                  is constructed. The intent is to establish a
                  clear linkage between future urban growth and
                  the adequacy of community services and
                  facilities.
Policy GM-7.2.1:  Require new development to contribute to or
                  participate in the establishment and
                  improvement of parks, fire, police, sanitary
                  sewer, water, and flood control systems in
                  proportion to the demand generated by project
                  occupants and users. The City will manage a
                  development mitigation program that ensures
                  that development pays its share of the costs
                  associated with the provision of these
                  facilities, consistent with the policies in other
                  elements of the General Plan.
                                                              4-15
Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Policy GM-7.2.2: Approve new development projects only after
                                           making findings that one or more of the
                                           following conditions are met:
                                           a.   An adopted mitigation program will result
                                                in performance standards being achieved
                                                before or at the time of project
                                                occupancy;

                                                mitigation measures are needed in order
                                                to ensure maintenance of performance
                                                standards, and such measures will be
                                                required of the project applicant; or
                                           c.   Capital improvement projects planned by
                                                the City or a special district(s) will result
                                                in maintenance of the performance

   5 Transportation
     5.1       OVERVIEW
     The Transportation Element (Element) is intended to provide guidance and specific actions to
     ensure that people and goods can safely and efficiently move within Concord and connect to the
     regional transportation system. The Element is based on a fundamental philosophy that efficient
     transportation that reduces the impacts of transportation on the region’s environment and
     provides a variety of travel options for residents and visitors is best provided through a
     comprehensive program of transportation planning, land use planning, and growth management
     strategies. This Element includes provisions for passenger vehicle, transit, freight, aviation,
     maritime, pedestrian, and bicycle transportation modes.
     State law recognizes that transportation and land use are closely related and requires that
     policies in this Element and the Land Use Element be linked. Careful integration of the City’s
     transportation policies with its land use policies will ensure that the transportation network is
     designed to accommodate the travel needs of current and future users. At the core of this
     Element is the City’s vision for a transportation system that encourages healthy, active living;
     provides a range of transportation options; reduces the impacts of transportation on climate
     change; supports environmentally-friendly transportation options; and provides safe,
     comfortable transportation options for all residents, persons patronizing local businesses,
     employees of Concord businesses, and other system users.
     The people who will be traveling around Concord include pedestrians, cyclists, motorists,
     children, persons with disabilities, seniors, public transportation passengers, people moving
     freight, and emergency service providers. This reality underlies the entire Element and is
     consistent with the concept of “complete streets,” which State law requires be incorporated
     throughout this Element. Complete streets are designed to meet the needs of multiple users,
     including motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians, transit users, and persons of different physical
     capabilities.
     In Concord, complete streets will be created over time by retrofitting existing streets so they
     become more pedestrian-friendly and by designing new streets with continuous sidewalks,
     pedestrian crossings, bicycle lanes, and other features which make them safer and more
     comfortable for non-motorized travel. On the Concord Reuse Project (CRP) site, the complete
     streets philosophy is an integral part of community design and transportation. The Reuse
     Project has been designed to make walking, bicycling, and transit use the preferred modes of
     travel, and to make driving an option rather than a necessity.
     5.2       BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
     Concord’s Transportation Element incorporates three broad strategies. First, transportation
     programs are based on the integration of transportation system planning and land use planning.
     Second, the City’s transportation planning efforts are integrated with those of the Contra Costa
     Transportation Authority (CCTA) and Caltrans in a cooperative, regional planning effort. Third,
     state of the art traffic engineering and transportation systems management programs are used
                                                                                               5-1

Concord 2030 General Plan
         to manage traffic, reduce per capita vehicle miles traveled, and bring planned improvements to
         reality. Through the development and implementation of all these strategies the City can
         achieve its commitment to a balanced, efficient circulation system.
         Roadway Network
         At the core of Concord’s transportation network is the roadway system. Most modes of
         transportation in the City depend to some degree upon it. Concord’s system is based on a
         traditional grid pattern in the downtown surrounded by a radial pattern of major roadways.
         Although the major roadways provide strong connections to the downtown, relatively recently-
         built subdivisions have less local connectivity because of many cul-de-sacs and longer blocks.
         Regional access is provided by Interstate 680 and SR 242, and SR 4 provides access on the
         west and north. Concord’s roadway system is integrated with the systems of Pittsburg on the
         northeast, Martinez and Pleasant Hill on the west, Walnut Creek on the south, and Clayton on
         the east.
         Street System
         This element defines a complete street network designed to serve multi-modal travel demand
         and the land uses and desired future character as expressed in the Land Use Element and
         throughout this plan. The types of streets that together make up the City’s street network are
         described in Table 5-1. Their physical locations are shown in Figure 5-1. Model cross-sections
         of the street types showing desired characteristics for each type are shown in Figure 5-2. Many
         streets are not currently consistent with these sections, which represent the City’s future vision
         for the streets. As improvements are made to the streets, they will be guided by these model
         sections. In some cases, there will not be sufficient room for all of the facilities shown in the
         model sections. In those cases, the City will apply land use policies and policy guidance in this
         element to prioritize among the features shown in the model sections that will best
         accommodate all users. That prioritization will take place when new facilities are created, and
         when existing facilities are improved. Complete streets modifications to transportation
         improvement projects can often be accomplished without significant increases to the project
         cost, as long as they are considered early on in the process.
         The following features are common to all complete streets:
                                                            1
                    Travel lane width ranging from 10’ on low-traffic volume streets to 12’ on high-traffic
                     volume streets.
                  Continuous sidewalks on both sides of the street, with a minimum clear width of 5’.
                  Bicycle lanes with minimum width of 5’.
                  Where street trees are provided, 5’ diameter minimum tree wells.
         These features will be achieved over time, using the policies established in this element to guide
         their implementation.
     1
       In some situations, 9’ travel lanes may be appropriate where traffic volumes are very low, right-of-way is
limited or other conditions warrant.
                                                                                                         5-2

                                     traffic.
         As streets are updated, right-of-way may limit the City’s ability to provide all of the features
         described in Table 1. In cases where there is not enough space for all features, the following
         priorities (combined with proper safety review) will guide the City in determining which features
         to include in new or improved streets. The focus on pedestrian facilities and safety is due, in
         part, to the City’s ongoing commitment to compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
                       1. Pedestrian facilities prioritized above dedicated bicycle facilities
                       2. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities prioritized above street trees.
                       3. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities over street parking except on residential
                             streets.
                       4. Travel lanes over street parking, except on Downtown streets.
                       5. Bicycle facilities in conjunction with 10’ travel lanes on low-traffic volume
                             streets and 11’ to 12’ travel lanes on high-traffic volume streets.
Service Objectives
The adopted Central County Action Plan defines Multi-Modal Transportation Service Objectives
(MTSOs) for Routes of Regional Significance (RRS). RRS are major roadway and freeway corridors
serving regional traffic and are further defined in the Growth Management Element. The routes were
identified in Action Plans adopted by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) as part of the
countywide Measure J Growth Management Program. The regional routes within Concord include the
freeways, the Kirker Pass Road/Ygnacio Valley Road corridor, Treat Boulevard, and Clayton Road
between Treat Boulevard and Kirker Pass Road. The MTSO is used to measure the performance of the
roadway using multiple variables as specified in the adopted Central County Action Plan.
Service objectives for local roadways are defined in the Growth Management Element. On streets that
are not formally designated as Routes of Regional Significance by CCTA, these objectives are to be
used as benchmarks rather than absolute standards. This means the City will determine on a case-by-
case basis how best to use them to determine traffic mitigation measures. In some instances, road
improvements (or impact fees) may be required to maintain or achieve a LOS benchmark. In other
cases, increases in congestion may be acceptable in order to achieve other General Plan goals.

      The Level of Service (LOS) concept is generally used to measure the amount of traffic that a
      roadway or intersection can accommodate, which is based on maneuverability and delay. LOS
      ranges from LOS A (free-flow conditions) to LOS F (jammed conditions). These conditions are
      generally described in Table 5-2. The table also lists the maximum ratio of traffic volumes to the
      capacity for signalized intersections for each level of service. LOS thresholds established in the
      latest Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) for the automobile and non-automobile modes shall be
      used at signalized intersections as applicable. For the automobile mode, LOS designations from
      A to F are based on average delay per vehicle at the intersection. For non-automobile modes,
      LOS designations from A to F are based on quality of service associated with a trip through the
      intersection, as perceived by the traveler. LOS measures and thresholds established in the
      HCM may be refined over time as the HCM is periodically updated.
      The concept of LOS was initially developed to maximize automobile speed and convenience. As
      indicated above, this is not the primary goal in all settings. For example, the goal in Downtown
      Concord is not only to ensure smooth traffic flow, but also to create a safe and welcoming
      pedestrian environment. Similarly, the goal around the Downtown and North Concord - Martinez
      BART Stations is to promote transit ridership and easy multimodal access to the station. On the
      Concord Reuse Project site, the goal is to create a multi-modal system where residents can
      walk, bicycle, or take a shuttle bus as easily as they can use their own vehicle. Thus, the LOS
      benchmarks expressed in the General Plan do not apply equally to all parts of the City.
      Unless otherwise specified, the benchmark for the evaluation of roadway segments is LOS D. In
      the Downtown area, the benchmark is LOS E, recognizing the more urban, pedestrian-oriented
      character of this area. The Downtown is defined as the area served by streets designated
      “Downtown” in this element. The LOS E benchmark also applies in the Concord BART Station
      vicinity, the North Concord - Martinez BART Station vicinity, and along the City’s transit routes.
      Transit routes are generally defined as roads with two or more bus transit lines, such as
      Concord Avenue, Clayton Road, and Treat Boulevard.
      Traffic Conditions (Existing and Forecast Volumes)
      In 2007, most roadways in Concord operated within the levels of service benchmarks. This
      finding reflects existing traffic conditions as of 2007. The following locations are the exceptions
      compared to current HCM roadway capacities based on generalized daily service volumes for
      urban street facilities:
               Ygnacio Valley Road operated at LOS F east of Cowell Road, where the traffic demand
                exceeds the four-lane roadway’s capacity of 31,300 vehicles per day.
               Cowell Road between Monument Boulevard and Babel Lane operated at LOS F due to
                the limited capacity of the two-lane roadway, which is 16,400 vehicles per day.
               Meadow Lane operated at LOS F due to the limited capacity of the two-lane roadway,
                which is 16,400 vehicles per day.
               Willow Pass Road north of Landana Drive operated at LOS F due to the limited capacity
                of the two-lane roadway, which is 16,400 vehicles per day.
                                                                                               5-12

              extremely low speeds.

Concord 2030 General Plan
      Congestion on these roadway segments typically occurs in the peak commute direction during
      peak travel periods. In the non-peak direction during the peak periods and at other times of the
      day, there may be little or no congestion along these routes.
      All of the roadways that failed to operate within the levels of service benchmarks in 2007 are
      proposed to have future improvements in roadway capacity.
       When the City initially adopted the 2030 General Plan in 2007, no development was assumed
      on the former Naval Weapons Station (i.e., the CRP site). As part of the CRP Area Plan and its
      related General Plan Amendment, the City updated its traffic forecasts to test the impacts of
      adding approximately 12,200 homes and 26,300 jobs on the site. As amended, the General Plan
      now reflects the higher forecasts associated with this growth. Numerous design strategies and
      transportation demand management programs are included in the CRP Area Plan to reduce the
      effect of additional development on traffic.
      Planned Improvements to Accommodate Buildout
      Buildout of Concord consistent with the Land Use Element will require improvements in the
      transportation system.
      The following major street improvements planned or programmed for Concord or on the
      adjacent freeway network are shown in Figure 5-3. They were developed to accommodate
      motor vehicle traffic anticipated with buildout of this Plan. In some cases the right-of-way
      needed for the improvements would have to be acquired by the City in order to construct them.
      They should be implemented in conjunction with the Complete Streets concepts included in this
      Element to ensure they are providing the best possible mobility options for residents and visitors
      in Concord.

In addition to the improvements listed above, a new network of “complete” streets is included in
the Community Reuse Project as illustrated and described in the CRP Area Plan. The network
includes a new through-street extending from the North Concord - Martinez BART Station
vicinity southeastward to Bailey Road, providing access to new “village neighborhoods.” Another
major through-street will extend from the BART Station to Willow Pass Road (at Avila Road)
along an alignment that roughly parallels Route 242 and Highway 4. A network of community
streets will link the villages and employment districts to one another, to BART, and to
established Concord neighborhoods. New neighborhood streets will provide access to new
homes, businesses, and other land uses. Alleys may be incorporated into neighborhoods to
provide rear yard garage access, which can create a more pedestrian-friendly street
environment.
Connectivity
The roadway system in Concord has been shaped in part by the presence of creeks running
through the City. Walnut Creek and Pine Creek have created barriers to the connectivity of the
roadway system between I-680 and SR 242.
Traditional grid street designs allow for through movement and good connections between and
within neighborhoods. Short blocks offer a choice of routes and enable more direct connections.
Variations from the traditional grid can allow for diagonal and curvilinear streets as well as larger
or smaller blocks for maximum flexibility and improved connectivity.
Some neighborhoods in Concord have been built using many cul-de-sacs. This type of design
promotes circuitous travel and results in traffic being distributed along fewer streets where
heavy traffic concentrates. More desirable is a grid-based development that balances a sense of
proximity and ease of access with the quieter environments of neighborhoods. In order to
ensure that street layout in all future development incorporates the need for neighborhood
connectivity and the comfort and safety of pedestrians and bicyclists, it is essential that:
              All new development be “connected” to the surroundings with an increased number
               of access points and pedestrian and bicycle connections to the neighborhood
               network;
              Blocks be short to allow for more direct connections;
              Neighborhood streets be designed at a human-scale, without excessively wide
               streets; and
              Traffic controls be incorporated including speed limits, signage and truck routes to
               restrict commercial traffic in neighborhoods.
Careful integration of land use and transportation systems will be especially critical in planning
for infill sites within the urban area because of access limitations and expected future
congestion on the regional highway system. There is tremendous potential within the City to
foster development that supports transit; however, simply requiring higher density development
without regard to use mix, dispersion and connections with the transportation system will not be
enough. Attention to the design and location of pedestrian and bicycle networks, the design of
linkages, the location of parking, and provisions for local transit providing feeder service to
BART will be essential.
The CRP exemplifies the practical application of many of these principles. Standards in the CRP
Area Plan include maximum block sizes to maintain connectivity and create a more walkable
                                                                                          5-17

      community. The Area Plan also includes standards for sidewalks and bicycle lanes, transit-only
      and mixed flow (transit plus auto) lanes, parking lanes, and street trees. As in the rest of
      Concord, roads will be designed to establish a clear hierarchy of through-streets, community,
      and neighborhood streets. Extensions of Salvio Street, West Street, and Denkinger Road will
      maintain continuity with the larger Concord street network.
      Truck Routes
      In addition to moving people, the roadway system in Concord carries a substantial number of
      trucks moving goods. Specific truck routes have been designated throughout the City and are
      shown on Figure 5-4. These routes are designed to allow truck traffic to pass through the City
      with minimal impact on residential neighborhoods as well as local vehicular and pedestrian
      traffic. Additional truck routes could be identified on the CRP site as more detailed planning is
      conducted.
      Public Transit
      An extensive public transit system is an important component of the Transportation Element.
      The transit system is well developed in the City. To accommodate future development in North
      Concord and the Concord Reuse Project area, it will be essential to develop good transit
      linkages to the North Concord - Martinez BART Station, the Downtown Concord BART Station,
      and between employment and housing areas.
      Services and Facilities
      Transit services in Concord include BART trains, County Connection buses, Tri-Delta Transit
      Buses, and BART shuttles.
      BART provides rail service from two locations in Concord. The Concord BART station is located
      on Oakland Avenue near the historic downtown. The North Concord – Martinez BART station is
      located on Port Chicago Highway near the SR 4/SR 242 interchange. Both stations are along
      the line from Pittsburg/Bay Point to Millbrae with direct service to Downtown Oakland,
      Downtown San Francisco, and the San Francisco International Airport. Service to Richmond,
      Fremont, and the Oakland International Airport is available by transfer. Park and Ride facilities,
      bicycle lockers, and County Connection bus feeder services are provided at both stations. The
      Concord station also offers shuttles to California State University, East Bay (CSUEB) and Sleep
      Train Pavilion, as well as Tri-Delta.
      Most bus service in Concord is provided by the County Connection, which is operated by the
      Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (CCCTA). In addition to local service and BART feeder
      service, the County Connection bus lines link Concord with Walnut Creek, Martinez, Lafayette,
      Orinda, Clayton, Alamo, and San Ramon. The network of transit routes is shown in Figure 5-5.
      Tri-Delta Transit primarily serves eastern Contra Costa County including the communities of
      Antioch, Pittsburg, Brentwood, Oakley, Bay Point, and Discovery Bay. Connections to these
      communities are provided via a route serving the Concord BART station.
      Additional transit services are planned for the Concord Reuse Project site. Buses will provide
      access from the BART station to neighborhoods and employment centers on the site. These
      additional planned transit services will connect the site to Downtown Concord and other
      Concord neighborhoods including a high-frequency bus that will travel in a dedicated bus lane
      along the new east-west road and will extend across the site. In addition to conventional transit
      vehicles, shuttle buses may also serve the site.
                                                                                             5-18

                                                                                       Transportation
Bicycles, Trails, and Pedestrian Circulation
Given the topography of Concord, bicycling and walking are viable alternatives to auto use for
both recreational and non-recreational trips. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities are an important
component of the transportation network in Concord. As illustrated on the Bikeways map (Figure
5-6), opportunities exist to improve the convenience and safety of existing facilities and to
increase the extent of bicycle and pedestrian facilities throughout developed areas.
Improvements to existing facilities and new development accompanied by attractive, well-
connected facilities will be conducive to increased walking and biking.
The Concord Reuse Project site presents a particularly important opportunity for bicycle and
pedestrian travel because of the size of the site and the planned internal circulation system
comprising on- and off-street facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists. The bicycle network will
connect shopping, school, recreational, and visitor trips on a combination of off-road bike trails
and routes that are within street rights-of-way. Support facilities such as bike racks will be an
integral part of streetscape design. Likewise, the pedestrian system will be designed to ensure
safe travel for persons of all ages and physical capabilities by providing sidewalks, cross-walks,
and off-road trails with easy access to village centers, schools, workplaces, and the North
Concord / Martinez BART Station.
A quality environment for pedestrian travel is essential for mobility overall and for the
independence of children and many seniors. Furthermore, walking is a basic part of a healthy
lifestyle. Most transit trips and many passenger car trips are linked to walking trips on one end
or the other, so adequate pedestrian facilities are in the interest of the whole community. High
quality pedestrian environments include attractive and well-maintained facilities that are
interconnected and linked to other modes of transportation and to high use destinations.
The City of Concord employs three bicycle facility designations created by the California
Department of Transportation, with some modifications. These designations consist of the Class
I bike path, Class II bike lane, and Class III bike route.
In Concord, Class 1 bicycle trails, like Caltrans Class I bike paths, are physically separate from
streets except at crossings. Concord’s Class 3A bicycle facilities, like Caltrans Class III bike
routes, consist of signed routes on residential streets where bicycles share the road with motor
vehicles. Concord’s Class 3B bike routes consist of signed routes with edge lines along
community and arterial streets. The edge lines employed on Class 3B routes demark a variable
width from 3 to 4 feet for travel by bicycles. This provides more space for bicycle travel than
Class 3A but allows less than the Class II designation employed by Caltrans, which requires a
minimum bicycle lane width of 5 feet. Because of the typical width of streets in Concord, as well
as a historical emphasis on automobile transportation, there are a limited number of Caltrans
Class II bike lanes in the City. Additional lanes are planned as part of the bike network to be
constructed on the Concord Reuse Project site.
The Concord Trails Master Plan designates the location of existing and proposed trails and
bicycle routes as well as existing and proposed grade separated over/undercrossings and trail
staging areas.
Existing and proposed bicycle paths are also shown for Concord and the surrounding area in
the “Contra Costa Countywide Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan.” The Concord Transportation
Element accommodates the Countywide Plan within the City limits to the extent feasible and
shows how the City’s bike system links to the countywide system. Future amendments or
updates to the Countywide Plan and the City’s Trails Plan may be needed to reflect proposals
for the Concord Reuse Project site throughout Concord.

Concord 2030 General Plan
      Port and Rail Facilities
      The tidal area within Concord north of SR 4 borders Suisun Bay and includes a deep water port.
      The Army uses the port for weapons shipment operations under an agreement with the Navy.
      In April 1996, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission and the
      Metropolitan Transportation Commission adopted the San Francisco Bay Area Seaport Plan.
      The Seaport Plan identifies which ports will be necessary in the future to meet California’s cargo
      shipping needs. It identifies Concord’s tidal area and its deep water port as a “port priority use
      area” in the event the military facilities become available for private use. If this occurs, the land
      would continue to be used as a port with supporting industrial uses.
      Regional Coordination
      Coordination of regional transportation issues involves several agencies, including the Contra
      Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA), the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans),
      the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), and other agencies.
      In 1988, Contra Costa County voters passed Measure C, which raised the sales tax by one-half
      cent to provide funding for regional transportation improvements. Measure C required local
      jurisdictions to adopt and implement a growth control program in order to receive their share of
      funds for transportation projects. Measure C established a cooperative, multi-jurisdictional
      planning process requiring participation of all cities and towns and the County in managing the
      impacts of growth in Contra Costa County. In 2004, Contra Costa County voters approved
      Measure J, which replaced Measure C and extended the half cent sales tax until 2034. As noted
      in the Growth Management Element of this Plan, some of the provisions of Measure C were
      removed, but the requirements for sub-regional transportation planning remain in effect.
      CCTA was established in part to implement Measure C and its overall goals. Local jurisdictions
      work through their respective Regional Transportation Planning Committees (RTPCs) to fulfill
      CCTA’s mandate. As part of central Contra Costa County, the City of Concord works with other
      central County jurisdictions through the Transportation Partnership and Cooperation Committee
      (TRANSPAC), their RTPC, and assists in the development of the Central Contra Costa Action
      Plans for Routes of Regional Significance.
      Caltrans is responsible for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of all State
      highways. Three State highways pass through Concord: I-680, SR 4 and SR 242. Caltrans’
      jurisdictional interest extends to the interchange ramps serving area freeways as well as the
      freeways themselves. Any Federally funded transportation improvements are subject to review
      by Caltrans staff and the California Transportation Commission.
      MTC is the regional organization responsible for prioritizing transportation projects. They
      prepare a Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) identifying projects for federal
      and state funding. The process is based on evaluating each project for need, feasibility, and
      adherence to federal policies and the local Congestion Management Program (CMP). The CMP
      requires each jurisdiction to identify existing and future transportation facilities that would
      operate below an acceptable service level based on projected growth and provide mitigation
      where appropriate.

                          intersections and roadway segments is LOS D. In the Downtown area, the
                          benchmark is LOS E, recognizing the more urban, pedestrian-oriented
                          character of this area. The Downtown is defined as the area served by
                          streets designated Downtown in this element. The LOS E benchmark also
                          applies in the Concord BART Station vicinity, the North Concord - Martinez
                          BART Station vicinity, and along the City’s transit routes. Transit routes are
                          generally defined as roads with two or more bus transit lines, such as
                          Concord Avenue, Clayton Road, and Treat Boulevard.
      Policy T-1.1.4:     Require all new development to locate structures to accommodate ultimate
                          street widths and required setbacks.
      Policy T-1.1.5:     Require all new development to provide adequate right-of-way and to
                          construct ultimate on and off-site improvements.
                          This policy ensures that land is set aside for needed roadway widening as
                          proposed in this General Plan, for example, for Ygnacio Valley Road, and
                          that traffic signals and other improvements are designed to serve a project
                          at buildout, not just the first phase.
      Policy T-1.1.6:     Develop and operate a transportation system that directs the flow of vehicle
                          traffic on Residential streets to Community streets and other streets serving
                          a larger geographic area.
      Policy T-1.1.7:     Provide a high level of multimodal connectivity in the design of the citywide
                          transportation system, particularly in the Concord Reuse Project area.
                                                                                           5-24

                                                                                 Transportation
                 The roadway, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit network to be developed on
                 the Reuse Project site should provide convenient multimodal access from
                 this area to adjoining neighborhoods, the City, and the region.
Policy T-1.1.8:  Designate and periodically review truck routes to provide for movement of
                 goods throughout the City. Review of truck routes should consider current
                 destinations for trucks, system connectivity, miles of travel, emissions, ease
                 of access to adjacent freeways, level of traffic, presence of nearby schools,
                 the relationship of truck routes to residential neighborhoods, and future
                 connectivity to the Concord Reuse Project site.
Policy T-1.1.9:  Limit new land uses with significant reliance on trucks to parcels fronting
                 designated truck routes, in industrial areas, or within ¼ mile driving distance
                 of freeways.
Policy T-1.1.10: Discourage new parks, schools, day care centers, and major pedestrian
                 uses from being sited on designated truck routes, or provide additional
                 safety measures.
Policy T-1.1.11: Consider transferring responsibility for the maintenance of private streets to
                 the City in cases where ownership can also be transferred to the City, and
                 streets can be improved so they meet City standards.
Policy T-1.1.12: Establish efficient linkages to the regional transportation system for all
                 modes of travel.
Policy T-1.1.13: Coordinate traffic signal systems with abutting jurisdictions.
Policy T-1.1.14: Develop a plan for the City’s gateways that incorporates mutually
                 complementary design, signs, and themes.
                 Such a plan shall identify an overall design theme that can be applied at
                 each gateway (See Policy LU-10.1.6).
Policy T-1.1.15: Enhance the visual quality of public space through the design and
                 landscaping of streets, and the control of visual and functional aspects of
                 abutting improvements.
                 The City desires to ensure that streets provide an aesthetic driving, walking,
                 and bicycling experience through the review of abutting improvements such
                 as sidewalks, sound walls, and signs.
Policy T-1.1.16: Continue to provide and enhance landscaped medians and street edges
                 that are visually pleasing and provide shade and buffers for pedestrians and
                 cyclists; landscaping should use native or low-water plants and reduce
                 stormwater runoff to the greatest extent possible.
                                                                                    5-25

Concord 2030 General Plan
                         Concord recognizes that well maintained roads with landscaped medians
                         and edges enhance the City’s image as well as adjoining property values.
                         The City will continue its street maintenance and landscaping programs,
                         and complete street upgrades as funding becomes available.
      Policy T-1.1.17:   Protect views toward hillsides and other regional open spaces along key
                         roadways in Concord.
                         Treat Boulevard, Ygnacio Valley Road, Kirker Pass Road, and Willow Pass
                         Road are examples of roadways that have views to regional open space
                         areas that the City seeks to preserve.
      Policy T-1.1.18:   Monitor transportation facility performance as a part of development review
                         and CEQA compliance as development occurs; include bicycle and
                         pedestrian performance, in addition to vehicle performance in this
                         monitoring.
                         Bicycle and pedestrian performance can be monitored using Multimodal
                         Level of Service calculations or other appropriate methods such as walk or
                         bike audits, surveys, and review of bicycle and pedestrian facility design.
      Policy T-1.1.19:   Support car sharing programs as a way to reduce the necessity of auto
                         ownership, especially in transit-oriented development areas.
      Policy T-1.1.20:   Peak hour turn restrictions may be used to prevent cut-through traffic in
                         certain areas.
      Principle T-1.2:   Ensure that Transportation Improvement Projects are Adequately
                         Funded.
      Policy T-1.2.1:    Schedule transportation improvement projects in the Capital Improvement
                         Program and Transportation Improvement Program.
                         The City will continue to fund improvements through a combination of
                         Capital Improvement Program funds, contributions from private land
                         developments, and other funds, as available.
      Policy T-1.2.2:    Continue to use Off-Site Street Improvement Program (OSIP) monies to
                         fund transportation improvements serving all transportation users and traffic
                         control system upgrades.
      Policy T-1.2.3:    Use impact fees, development agreements, and other funding mechanisms
                         to construct the transportation system and support Transportation Demand
                         Management programs on the Concord Reuse Project site, including transit
                         services and facilities.
                                                                                           5-26

                                                                                    Transportation
Trip Reduction
Principle T-1.3  Minimize single occupancy vehicle travel in Concord.
Policy T-1.3.1   Work with employers to develop Transportation Demand Management
                 plans to increase carpooling and encourage the use of public
                 transportation, bicycling, and walking; consider other trip-reduction
                 approaches such as telecommuting, shuttles, and transit passes.
Policy T-1.3.2:  Continue to promote a wide variety of transportation alternatives and modes
                 to serve all residents and businesses to enhance the quality of life.
Policy T-1.3.3:  Ensure that streets are designed to balance the needs of multiple travel
                 modes, including vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, and transit.
Policy T-1.3.4:  Ensure that development in nearby communities incorporates measures to
                 mitigate traffic impacts on Concord’s transportation system. As appropriate,
                 the level of service benchmarks established in this chapter may be used to
                 determine mitigation measures and/ or fees for such development.
Policy T-1.3.5   Consider developing one or several Transportation Demand Management
                 programs for downtown and other areas with concentrations of employees
                 in which employers with 50 or more employees can participate by paying a
                 fee; identify ways for employers with fewer employees to participate where
                 appropriate.
Complete Streets
Principle T-1.4: Provide Complete Streets that Serve Residents and Visitors Using All
                 Modes of Transportation.
Policy T-1.4.1   Create a complete street network that provides facilities for all users to
                 travel throughout Concord.
Policy T-1.4.2   When prioritizing limited funds among potential complete                   street
                 improvements, focus on the following types of improvements first:
                 1.    Safety: Regardless of location, improvements including sidewalk
                       connectivity projects, that enhance the safety of all roadway users,
                       including drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, and transit users.
                 2.    Sidewalk and Bicycle Access to schools, parks, and transit stops:
                       locations often accessed by children and other non-drivers.
                 3.    Downtown streets: Visited by the majority of Concord residents;
                       common places for people to walk to access businesses.
                 4.    Reuse Area Access: Tie the Concord Community Reuse Area into the
                       rest of the City.
                                                                                      5-27

Concord 2030 General Plan
      Policy T-1.4.3     Develop and apply a streamlined complete streets checklist for review of
                         proposed transportation improvement projects.
                         The checklist should clearly define what changes are to be considered in
                         project development and what considerations will determine whether they
                         are appropriate. It should also define which types of projects are and are
                         not subject to its use, requiring documentation and approval of the Director
                         of Community and Economic Development, or similar position, for projects
                         exempted from complete streets requirements.
      Policy T-1.4.4     Review street reconstruction, development projects, and utility projects to
                         identify opportunities to implement complete streets principles, including the
                         concepts identified in this Element and the priorities of any adopted trails,
                         bicycle, or pedestrian plans.
      Policy T-1.4.5     When planning for complete streets, include groups and individuals
                         representing the many populations who use the City’s streets when
                         planning for Concord’s street network; use their input in collecting data to
                         prioritize and track implementation of complete streets upgrades.
      Policy T-1.4.6     Where right-of-way and adjacent land uses limit the space available for
                         complete street infrastructure, consider ‘road diets’ to reduce the number of
                         vehicle travel lanes or narrow lane widths; such ‘road diets’ should be
                         subject to study to understand the potential for impacts on all modes of
                         transportation.
                         A road diet reduces the number of vehicle travel lanes. The chief initial
                         consideration is the number of vehicles using the roadway before such a
                         project is implemented. For example, caution is warranted when
                         considering reducing the number of through lanes on a roadway that does
                         not provide excess capacity based on average daily or peak hour traffic
                         volumes. The analysis should weigh a potential change in traffic operations,
                         safety and diversions to other streets against the potential benefits to
                         pedestrian and bicycle travel.
      Policy T-1.4.7     Incorporate neighborhood traffic management techniques, such as traffic
                         circles, narrow lanes, and bulbouts in appropriate residential areas; such
                         techniques should be evaluated to ensure they improve bicycle and
                         pedestrian travel without compromising the overall connectivity of the auto
                         network.
      Policy T-1.4.8     Develop street design guidelines; include typical standard sections and
                         design details, consistent with the guidance in this Element. As part of this
                         process, determine the narrowest lane widths and tightest corner radii that
                         can balance the needs of public safety providers with the needs of cyclists
                         and pedestrians and typical vehicle types.
                                                                                           5-28

                                                                                 Transportation
Policy T-1.4.9:  Design and improve streets to facilitate safe crossings, including accessible
                 curb ramps, crosswalks, refuge islands, and pedestrian signals; design and
                 operate this infrastructure to meet the needs of people with different
                 disabilities and of people of different ages.
Policy T-1.4.10  Coordinate internally and with other agencies to plan for and prioritize the
                 provision of a complete streets network.
Policy T-1.4.11  Train City staff involved in street design in the application and integration of
                 multi-modal infrastructure and techniques.
Policy T-1.4.12  Consider expanding the mandate of the Parks, Recreation and Open Space
                 Commission to include bicycle and pedestrian transportation to ensure that
                 cyclists and pedestrians have an advocate and commission focus within the
                 City.
Principle T-1.5: Foster Practical Parking Solutions.
Policy T-1.5.1:  Ensure adequate parking facilities are provided for public convenience and
                 to promote economic development, where consistent with other objectives
                 such as promoting public transit use, walking and bicycling.
                 As noted in Policy T-1.3.2 below, the definition of “adequate” parking
                 facilities may vary depending on context, and the availability of alternative
                 travel modes.
Policy T-1.5.2:  Allow flexible parking standards for developments within one-half mile of a
                 BART station, one-quarter mile of a public parking facility, affordable
                 housing developments, and in other locations where alternative modes of
                 travel are available or where shared parking is provided.
Policy T-1.5.3:  Promote shared parking solutions.
                 Where peak parking demands do not overlap, as with an office building and
                 a dinner restaurant, then shared parking allows for more efficient use of
                 space. The total amount of land or building area needed for parking also
                 can be reduced.
Policy T-1.5.4:  Coordinate with Caltrans and transit providers to develop Park and Ride
                 sites.
Policy T-1.5.5:  Locate and design off-street parking lots in a way which makes them less
                 visually prominent.
                 Parking in higher density and mixed use areas should be located beneath
                 or behind buildings rather than between buildings and the street.
                                                                                    5-29

Concord 2030 General Plan
      Transit
      Principle T-1.6:   Promote a Well-Integrated and Coordinated Transit Network.
      Policy T-1.6.1:    Coordinate with public transportation agencies to facilitate safe, efficient,
                         and convenient pedestrian access to transit stops; work with agencies to
                         relocate stops when necessary.
      Policy T-1.6.2:    Explore the establishment of a local shuttle service to supplement CCCTA
                         and BART service within Concord.
                         The City’s “Redevelopment Strategy and Implementation Action Plan”
                         adopted in December 2000, identifies shuttle services to enable easy,
                         convenient access to regional shopping areas, such as The Willows and
                         Sun Valley Mall. Although the Redevelopment Agency has been dissolved,
                         the City can continue to work with local transit providers to encourage
                         “small-scale” transportation alternatives, such as a jitney, that can provide
                         connections between BART stations, bus stops, parking structures, and
                         nodes of commerce throughout Concord, including the North Concord
                         business area and the Concord Reuse Project area.
      Policy T-1.6.3:    Work with public transportation agencies to provide high-quality, efficient,
                         coordinated transit service that encourages the use of multiple modes of
                         travel, such as cycling to transit stops, and reaches destinations important
                         to transportation-dependent populations such as youth, seniors, and
                         persons with disabilities.
                         The City works with CCCTA, Tri-Delta Transit and BART to ensure
                         equitable transit service is provided to residents and businesses. Bicycle
                         access to transit can be supported through the provision of secure bicycle
                         racks at transit stops, provision for bicycles on transit, and connections to
                         local and regional bicycle trails.
      Policy T-1.6.4:    Explore innovative approaches to providing bus and shuttle transit on the
                         Concord Reuse Project site which achieve the service goals established by
                         the CRP Area Plan.
      Pedestrian Circulation
      Principle T-1.7:   Provide Safe and Convenient Pedestrian Circulation.
      Policy T-1.7.1:    Develop off-street pedestrian linkages, including approaches such as
                         connections allowing pedestrians to travel through the ends of cul-de-sacs,
                         pedestrian paths, bridges over creeks and roadways, and pedestrian
                         underpasses, to minimize walking distance and enhance pedestrian
                         circulation throughout the City; consider planned development on the CRP
                         site when establishing such linkages.
                                                                                          5-30

                                                                                 Transportation
Policy T-1.7.2: Use innovative and effective walkway features to enhance the pedestrian
                experience, including buffers between pedestrians and vehicle traffic, wide
                sidewalks, illuminated crosswalks, signalized crossings, bulb-outs,
                pedestrian-scale lighting, benches, and other street furniture; include trees
                wherever possible, selecting species that do not negatively impact
                sidewalks as they grow.
Policy T-1.7.3: Facilitate pedestrian circulation near high activity centers.
Policy T-1.7.4: Prioritize pedestrian connections from new development to nearby open
                spaces and trails.

                system to a network of off-road walkways and regional park trails.
Policy T-1.7.5  Continue to prioritize compliance with the ADA in providing sidewalk,
                crosswalk, and transit stop improvements.
Policy T-1.7.6: Develop a pedestrian transportation plan that focuses on and identifies
                current deficiencies in the City’s pedestrian circulation system for commute,
                non-commute and school related trips and prioritizes implementation of the
                resulting strategies by either specific location or by area of the city; the plan
                should also identify where implementation can be completed in conjunction
                with routine street projects and funding opportunities for implementation.
                Develop the plan in coordination with local community organizations and
                consider utilizing their support to collect data for the plan. Establish an
                approach to ongoing data collection in support of the plan.
                This will be done in concert with the Safe Routes to Schools program, the
                Capital Improvement Program and the Transportation Improvement
                Program, with priority given to pedestrian circulation improvements that will
                enhance pedestrian safety and promote walkability.
Policy T-1.7.7: Incorporate urban design measures in commercial and mixed use districts
                which accommodate pedestrians and support walking.
                Examples of such measures include ample shade trees, buildings
                constructed to the front setback line, ground floor storefronts with window
                displays, frequent building entrances, benches and other street furniture,
                and parking lots and loading areas located behind buildings rather than
                along the street.
                                                                                   5-31

                         throughout the City.
      Policy T-1.8.2     Provide bicycle parking at libraries, schools, community centers, and other
                         community facilities and work with property owners to provide easily
                         accessible parking at their buildings.
      Policy T-1.8.3     Develop a Bicycle Master Plan to fully plan for bicycle transportation
                         throughout the City, using public input to ensure a variety of current and
                         potential cyclists participate. The project should include ongoing data
                         collection during implementation. Consider the following issues:
                         •    Connectivity between current or expected origins and destinations,
                              including shopping, planned development on the CRP site, schools,
                              parks, medical care, and places of employment.
                         •    Locations that may have pent up demand for bicycle transportation but
                              do not currently have high bicycle traffic because they are currently
                              difficult to access by bicycle.
                         •    Locations with a history of collisions between cyclists and vehicles.

                         •    Use of parallel routes, canal trails, and other creative routing
                              techniques that allow cyclists to avoid streets with heavy, higher-speed
                              vehicle traffic.
                         •    Connectivity with regional trails as envisioned in the Contra Costa
                              Countywide Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan and trails plans from
                              neighboring jurisdictions.
                         •    Funding strategies to construct bicycle facilities identified in the plan
                              and identification of facilities that can be provided in conjunction with
                              street maintenance and improvement projects.
      Policy T-1.8.4:    Require provision of bicycle facilities in new developments, where
                         appropriate.
                         Examples include weather protected bicycle parking and direct and safe
                         access for pedestrians and bicyclists to adjacent routes.
                                                                                           5-32

                                                                                 Transportation
Policy T-1.8.5:   Encourage, and where appropriate require, new development to provide

  PARKS, OPEN SPACE
6 AND CONSERVATION
    The purpose of the Parks, Open Space, and Conservation Element is
    to provide guidance for preservation of the City’s open spaces and
    other natural resources, as well as identify the parks and recreation
    facilities available to local residents. It addresses parks and
    recreation, open space, biological resources, and conservation.
    6.1       PARKS AND RECREATION
    This General Plan chapter serves as a guiding document for any
    implementation documents prepared by the City Community and
    Recreation Services Department that plan for and develop parks in
    Concord. Under this Plan, Concord is committed to creating
    parkland and maintaining a park system that meets citizens’
    recreational needs and contributes to the City’s positive image. The
    presence of well-designed parks and community facilities is
    essential to the health and well-being of City residents.
    Existing Parks and Recreation Facilities
    The existing Concord parks and recreation system comprises 22
    neighborhood and community parks and various specialized
    recreation facilities. These parks range in size from the 0.2-acre Iron
    Horse Park to the 126-acre Newhall Community Park. All provide
    valuable recreation opportunities to Concord’s residents. In addition
    to the parks, seven community centers are distributed throughout
    the City. These offer recreational and educational services, as well
    as foster a sense of community identity and pride. The City also
    operates a Senior Center on the grounds of the John F. Baldwin
    Park and public swimming pools at Concord Community Park and
    Meadow Homes Park. In addition, specialized recreation facilities
    such as the Diablo Creek Golf Course and the Galindo House and
    Gardens provide unique opportunities for recreation within the City.
    In total, the City’s parks and recreation facilities offer a diverse
    range of outdoor, indoor, and cultural experiences to meet the needs
    of the community. Table 6-1 details existing public parks and
    recreation facilities by acreage.

                                  Park Demand
                                  The process for determining demand of parkland in Concord is
                                  based on the following components:
                                  •    Implementing the parkland standards for neighborhood and
                                       community parks;
                                  •    Making up the existing deficiency in parkland for current
                                       residents in Concord with new parkland; and
                                  •    Providing parkland to meet demand by new residents in
                                       Concord.
                                  The City’s current citywide goal for public parkland is 6 acres per
                                  1,000 residents. This goal will be reached through a combination of
                                  land dedication within new development, in-lieu fees, bond
                                  measures, land donations, Regional Park District acquisitions, and
                                  other methods. Consistent with the Quimby Act, the City requires
                                                                                               6-5

Concord 2030 General Plan
                                           new development to dedicate 5 acres of public parkland per 1,000
                                           new residents or to pay an in lieu fee equivalent to the value of such
                                           parkland. These funds are used to acquire parkland as opportunities
                                           arise. The park impact fee is an important tool for reaching the 6
                                           acre per 1,000 goal.
                                           In 2006, 636 acres of neighborhood and community parks and
                                           specialized recreation facilities served a population of
                                           approximately 124,440 residents, resulting in 5.2 acres of parkland
                                           per 1,000 residents. This is 87 percent of the 6 acre per 1,000 goal.
                                           Although Lime Ridge is not a typical community park, many of the
                                           staging areas, trails and parking areas located within the park do
                                           serve residents’ open space needs and are included in the
                                           calculations.
                                           As discussed in the Land Use Element, the buildout of the General
                                           Plan Diagram would result in approximately 14,120 new residents
                                           in Concord outside of the Concord Reuse Project (CRP) Area and
                                           another 28,800 persons within the CRP area, for a total population
                                           of about 167,360. According to the parkland performance standard
                                           requiring 5 acres of parkland per 1,000 new residents, new
                                           development would require 215 acres of parkland. Using the City’s
                                           functional parkland goal of 6 acres per 1,000 residents, the total
                                           population at buildout would require a total of 1,004 acres of
                                           parkland or an additional 368 acres above the current parkland
                                           supply. Table 6-3 summarizes this parkland need.

                           Parks, Open Space, and Conservation
In 2011, the citywide park inventory is not sufficient to
accommodate the projected population at buildout. In addition,
many of the City’s residents are not within a reasonable walking
distance to a park, and many of the parks in the City’s inventory
contain specialized recreational facilities, such as hiking trails, that
may not appeal equally to all residents. New community and
neighborhood park facilities will be needed to augment the supply
of parkland in areas that are not currently in close proximity to a
neighborhood park and to serve developing areas.
Proposed Parks
The Area Plan for the Concord Reuse Project includes a sufficient
quantity of parkland to attain the citywide goal of 6 acres per 1,000
residents. A new City park is proposed on about 100 acres on the
east side of Willow Pass Road within the project site. A 75-acre
tournament sports facility is planned on an adjoining site. The Area
Plan also calls for an expansion of Willow Pass Park on the east
side of Olivera Road. In addition, over 2,500 acres on the site are
designated “Conservation Open Space,” with a majority of this
acreage to be contained in a new regional park. Because most of the
regional park will be passive open space, it will not all count toward
the City’s parkland acreage standard. However, staging areas,
picnic areas, nature observation areas, and other improved facilities
may be included. The Reuse Project site also includes a network of
greenways, portions of which may serve as parks for adjacent
neighborhoods.
Neighborhood and pocket parks are also included in the Concord
Reuse Project Area Plan. The precise location of these parks will be
determined through future planning studies and development
approvals. Each of the village neighborhoods is likely to have at
least one neighborhood park ranging from 2 to 10 acres in size.
Smaller facilities such as plazas and pocket parks will be developed,
providing space not only for recreation but also for public
gatherings, markets, outdoor performances, and other activities.
Outside of the Reuse Project site, the City will continue to strive to
locate neighborhood and community parks in areas that are
currently not located within reasonable walking distance to a park.
Joint use agreements with schools can provide an effective way to
increase park acreage in underserved areas.

                          Policy POS-1.1.1:   Acquire and develop additional neighborhood
                                              and community parks to serve existing and
                                              future needs, working toward a goal of 6 acres
                                              of park land per 1,000 residents.
                                              Conservation open space would generally not
                                              be counted when calculating this standard.
                                              However, portions of conservation areas and
                                              regional parks may be included if they include
                                              staging areas, recreational facilities, lawns,
                                              nature centers, picnic areas, and similar
                                              improvements.
                          Policy POS-1.1.2    Ensure that new residential development
                                              provides for a substantial share of the 6 acre
                                              per 1,000 resident goal cited above. New
                                              residential development shall be required to
                                              dedicate on-site parkland or pay an in-lieu fee
                                              for park acquisition. The dedication and/or fee
                                              requirement shall be based on a standard of 5
                                              acres per 1,000 residents, consistent with the
                                              Quimby Act.
                          Policy POS-1.1.3:   Provide a variety of recreation spaces and
                                              facilities to serve the needs of the community.
                                              Examples of this include play fields, parks,
                                              open spaces, trails, recreation centers, special
                                              recreation areas, golf courses, outdoor
                                              entertainment facilities such as bandstands,
                                              and commercial recreational uses.
                          Policy POS-1.1.4:   Continue to acquire and/or improve new
                                              parklands as needs or opportunities arise.
                          Policy POS-1.1.5:   Secure and maintain parks and open space
                                              facilities consistent with the ability of the City,
                                              East Bay Regional Park District, or an
6-8
                       Parks, Open Space, and Conservation
                  equivalent entity to finance acquisition and
                  operation.
Policy POS-1.1.6: Pursue the development of park and recreation
                  facilities within reasonable walking distance of
                  all residences.
                  For planning purposes, reasonable walking
                  distance is defined as one-quarter to one-half
                  mile.
Policy POS-1.1.7: Review infrastructure needs for existing and
                  new recreational facilities, and where
                  appropriate, identify required improvements in
                  the City’s Capital Improvement Program.
                  The City will assess its recreational facilities
                  to ensure that related infrastructure,
                  including parking lots, pathways, buildings,
                  and service facilities are functional and well
                  maintained. Attention will also focus on
                  providing on-site parking, bicycle storage
                  facilities, and transit access for park facilities
                  that will meet the needs of park users and
                  adjacent neighbors.
POS-1.1.8:        Identify new park sites within the City limits
                  to ensure that sufficient park and recreation
                  facilities are set aside for Concord residents
                  through the parkland dedication process, in
                  lieu fees paid by subdividers, or other methods
                  appropriate for increasing the City’s parkland
                  inventory.
                  This would include park sites within the
                  already urbanized portion of the City as well
                  as parks on the Concord Reuse Project site.
                  While the Reuse Project site will enable
                  Concord to meet its 6 acre per 1,000 goal on
                  a citywide basis, there will continue to be a
                  need for new parks in other parts of the City
                  where development takes place.
Principle POS-1.2:Provide a Citywide, Interconnected,
                  Multi-Use Trails System.

                                              The Trails Master Plan provides the
                                              framework for the future planning of an
                                              integrated and easily-accessible system of
                                              routes and trails. Amendments to the Trails
                                              Master Plan may be made periodically to
                                              reflect new opportunities, such as those on the
                                              Concord Reuse Project site.
                          Policy POS-1.2.2:   Work with proposed development projects to
                                              provide new linkages to existing trails and
                                              create new trails where feasible.
                                              This is particularly important on the Reuse
                                              Project site, given the scale of the development
                                              and the importance of integrating the site with
                                              the balance of Concord.
                          Principle POS-1.3:Facilitate Community Recreational
                                              Opportunities at Public School Sites.
                                              Policy POS-1.3.1: Utilize closed or under-
                                              used public school sites for community
                                              recreation when feasible.
                          Policy POS-1.3.2:   Work with the Mt. Diablo Unified School
                                              District to provide use of school facilities after
                                              school and during summer months for
                                              community recreation uses.
                          See also Policy PF-2.1.5.
                          Principle POS-1.4:        Facilitate Private Recreation.
                          Policy POS-1.4.1:   Encourage developers to provide for-profit
                                              regional recreation facilities.
                                              While the City’s first and foremost objective is
                                              to ensure that new neighborhoods provide
                                              recreational amenities for the enjoyment of
                                              future residents, the City also encourages new
                                              development to contribute recreational
                                              facilities to the greater community, when
                                              feasible. These may include new golf courses,
                                              equestrian centers, water-related facilities,
                                              and tournament sports facilities, all of which
                                              can help meet recreational needs.

6.3       OPEN SPACE
Concord’s setting—within a valley surrounded by gently sloping
foothills and laced with creeks—includes natural resources that are
important, not only for aesthetic value, but also for environmental
quality, habitat protection, and water resources. In addition,
preserving the general configuration of the hills, creeks, and natural
topographic features fosters a sense of place for the community, and
this affords current and future residents an understanding of the
City’s natural setting and native topography. These many functions
of open space underscore the importance of careful land use
planning.
Classification of Open Space
State planning law provides a structure for the preservation of open
space by identifying four open space categories:
•    Open space for the preservation of natural resources including,
     but not limited to, areas required for the preservation of plant
     and animal life, such as: habitat for fish and wildlife species;
     areas required for ecologic and other scientific study purposes;
     rivers, streams, bays and estuaries; coastal beaches, lakeshores,
     banks of rivers and streams; and watershed lands.
•    Open space for outdoor recreation including, but not limited to,
     areas of outstanding scenic, historic and cultural value; areas
     particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, such as
     access to lakeshores, beaches, rivers and streams; and areas that
     serve as links between major recreation and open space
     reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and
     streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors.
•    Open space for public health and safety including, but not
     limited to, areas that require special management or regulation
     due to hazardous or special conditions. This type of open space
     might include: earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas,
     floodplains, watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks, areas
     required for the protection of water quality and water reservoirs,
     and areas required for the protection and enhancement of air
     quality.
•    Open space used for the managed production of resources
     including, but not limited to, forest lands, rangeland,
     agricultural lands and areas of economic importance for the
     production of food or fiber; areas required for recharge of
     ground water basins; bays, estuaries, marshes, rivers and
                                                               6-11

Concord 2030 General Plan
                                                         streams that are important for the management of commercial
                                                         fisheries; and areas containing major mineral deposits.
                                                   Existing Open Space
                                                   Figure 6-2 illustrates a composite of open space within Concord. The
                                                   land use classifications that fall under one or more of these open
                                                   space categories are: Active Parks, Open Space, Wetlands/Resource
                                                   Conservation, and Rural Conservation. Open water (e.g., Suisun
                                                   Bay) is excluded.            In total, open space lands constitute
                                                   approximately 12,743 acres or 38.4 percent of the total Planning
                                                   Area. Significant open spaces within the Planning Area include:
                                                   Lime Ridge Open Space, the Mt. Diablo Foothills, and the area
                                                   north of Mallard Reservoir that is designated Wetlands/Resource
                                                   Conservation. More than half of the Concord Reuse Project Area
                                                   will be conserved as open space, including the Los Medanos Hills
                                                   and the Mount Diablo Creek corridor. The distribution of land use

  Chart 6-1 is based on conditions as of 2012, using the acreages from General Plan Table 3-2 (Land Use Element). The portion of
the Reuse Project Area planned as permanent open space is included in the chart; the portion planned for future development is not
included.

                           Parks, Open Space, and Conservation
The open space resources illustrated in Figure 6-2 are not intended
to imply that the public interest would be best served by prohibiting
development on all such lands. Rather, these open space resources
likely signify one of three possible scenarios, depending upon the
ecosystem fragility, location, hazard potential, regulatory
constraints, and other pertinent factors. General Plan policies and
Development Code requirements should be consulted to decide
which scenario to apply to specific areas of open space. The
scenarios are:
•    All development should be prohibited;
•    Development should be permitted on part of the land and the
     balance preserved as open space—a clustering concept; or
 •   Development should be permitted subject to site plan and
     architectural review and the imposition of specific conditions to
     protect against hazards and preserve the integrity of the land
     and the environment.
Determination of how these open space resources are to be
protected will be made on a case-by-case basis following standards
and review procedures established in the Development Code and
subdivision regulations consistent with General Plan policies.
Those areas meeting the first of the three criteria listed above will
generally remain permanent open space and will be used for
recreation or resource conservation.
Open Space Action Plan
Concord’s Open Space Action Plan consists of the goals, directions
for specific actions and programs which the City Council intends to
pursue to implement the ideas for open space systems contained in
this element. Additional detail on how the Action Plan will be
implemented is in Volume III, Implementation Program, Table 5,
“Implementation Actions for Parks, Open Space and Conservation
Element”. Taken together, these initiatives specifically respond to
and are consistent with the Government Code’s requirements for an
Open Space Action Plan that is to include “specific programs which
the legislative body intends to pursue in implementing its open
space                plan”             (Section               65564).

Policy POS-2.1.3:   Utilize the Trails Master Plan and Map to
                    develop connections between open space
                    areas.
                    As noted above, the Trails Master Plan should
                    be updated to reflect plans for the Concord
                    Reuse Project site.
Policy POS-2.1.4:   Incorporate portions of the Concord Reuse
                    Project site into the regional open space
                    network, and provide trail and greenway
                    connections between this area and developed
                    Concord neighborhoods.
Principle POS-2.2:Preserve Natural Resources within
                    Designated Open Space.
Policy POS-2.2.1:   Design structures and facilities located within
                    parks and open space areas to complement the
                    natural setting and values of each site and
                    adjacent lands.
Policy POS-2.2.2:   Strive to preserve open space in southeast
                    Concord in order to expand the Lime Ridge
                    Open Space area.
                    The City will coordinate with the East Bay
                    Regional Park District on how best to obtain
                    additional open space in this area. A

Concord 2030 General Plan
                                            connection from Concord’s open space system
                                            to the Mt. Diablo State Park is of high
                                            importance.
                          Policy POS-2.2.3: Strive to preserve open space in northeast
                                            Concord in order to maintain the visual profile
                                            of the Los Medanos Hills.
                                            The City will coordinate with the East Bay
                                            Regional Park District in the dedication of a
                                            new regional park on the Concord Reuse
                                            Project site. The park will encompass the
                                            most environmentally sensitive portions of the
                                            site, including the Los Medanos Hills.
                          Policy POS-2.2.4: Use open space where feasible to delineate an
                                            urban edge.
                          Policy POS-2.2.5: Require degraded open space areas to be
                                            restored to an environmentally sustainable
                                            condition as part of development approval
                                            where these lands are proposed as permanent
                                            open space in new development.
                                            This can be done with use of native plants
                                            during revegetation and through creek and
                                            habitat restoration programs on larger sites.
                          Policy POS-2.2.6: Restore degraded open space owned by the
                                            City, including but not limited to habitat

                          Principle POS-2.3:Expand Open Space Systems as
                                            Opportunities are Identified.
                          Policy POS-2.3.1: Increase the regional trail, ridgeline, and
                                            hillside open space system in the City’s
                                            Planning Area through joint efforts with East
                                            Bay Regional Park District, Contra Costa
                                            County, the U.S. Government, and nonprofit
                                            trustee agencies.
                          Policy POS-2.3.2: Establish priorities for open space preservation
                                            in the City’s Planning Area based on an
                                            evaluation of natural resources, viewsheds,
                                            wildlife      habitats,     and     recreational
                                            opportunities.

                                                     Examples of establishing priorities include the following:
                                                     •    Significant natural areas that are historically, ecologically,
                                                          scientifically, locally unique, important or threatened;
                                                     •    Ridgelines and viewsheds above 300 feet elevation, as well as
                                                          scenic vistas;
                                                     •    Wildlife and plant habitats and fragile ecosystems with
                                                          sensitive species in need of protection;
                                                     •    Creek environments; and
                                                     •    Lands suitable for recreation such as hiking, photography,
                                                          nature study, bicycling, horseback riding, and fishing.
                                                     6.5       CONSERVATION
                                                     Natural Resources
                                                     Although Concord is the largest city in Contra Costa County, and
                                                     urbanized to a great extent, valuable natural resources still exist
                                                     within the Planning Boundary. These are sometimes located in
                                                     pockets of open space within the City limits, but more commonly
                                                     found in large swaths of open space such as the former CNWS or
                                                     Lime Ridge Open Space. Identified biological resources are
                                                     illustrated in Figures 6-3 and 6-4, and discussed below. There are
                                                     some mineral resources in the Planning Area, east of Lime Ridge
                                                     Open Space outside the City limits, but no mining occurs within the
                                                     City.
                                                     Vegetation and Habitat
                                                     The City of Concord is located in the Bay Area-Delta Bioregion, as
                                                     defined by the State’s Natural Communities Conservation Program.
                                                     This Bioregion is comprised of a variety of natural communities,
                                                     which range from Salt Marshes to Chaparral to Oak Woodlands.
                                                     The high diversity of vegetation found in Contra Costa County is a
                                                     result of topographic and micro-climate diversity and, combined
                                                     with the rapid pace of development in the region, has resulted in a
                                                     high degree of endangerment for local flora and fauna.
                                                     Figure 6-3 shows the distribution of vegetation and habitat within
                                                     the Planning Area. 3 The primary habitat types include Urban,
                                                     Annual Grassland, Estuarine, Coastal Brackish Marsh, Riverine,

                                                     prevalent habitat type is Urban, which covers the majority of the
                                                     area within the City limits and is generally continuous to the west

                          Creek, respectively. To the east, urban habitat continues into the

                          Uplands (Annual grassland, Chaparral, Foothill Pine-Oak)
                          Annual grassland habitat is found primarily along Concord’s eastern
                          edge, occurring in the CNWS and extending further east into Los
                          Medanos Hills. Grassland habitat is also found in the southern
                          extremity of the City limits in the area of Lime Ridge Open Space.
                          The Lime Ridge area also includes, to a lesser extent, chaparral
                          habitat. The slopes of Mt. Diablo in the southern portion of the
                          Planning Area contain a mix of habitat types. The western portion is
                          occupied by the extension of grassland and chaparral habitats
                          occurring in Lime Ridge Open Space. Chaparral is the prevalent
                          habitat type in the central portion, which also contains some areas
                          of Foothill Pine-Oak Woodland habitat.
                          The eastern portion of the area is primarily urban habitat, with an
                          area of annual grassland habitat in its southeast corner.
                          Marshes
                          The Concord Planning Area is bordered to the north—and includes
                          a small part of—the estuarine habitat of Suisun Bay. Bordering the
                          Bay is the Avon-Port Chicago Marsh, a relatively extensive area of
                          Coastal Brackish Marsh. This area extends up to two miles south
                          toward the developed areas of Concord and is bordered to the west
                          by Pacheco Creek and to the east by Clyde and the Tidal portion of
                          the former CNWS. Most of this marsh area is considered to be high
                          quality habitat. More patchy brackish marsh habitat is also found
                          beyond these boundaries, both east and west of the Planning Area
                          along Suisun Bay.
                          Wetlands and Riparian Corridors
                          Laced within the habitats discussed above are a number of creeks,
                          principally Walnut, Pine, Galindo, and Mount Diablo, and
                          tributaries to these creeks. Although much of the extent of these
                          creeks has been disturbed, the waterways provide important aquatic
                          and riparian habitat, providing resources and movement corridors
                          for flora and fauna. The southern portion of the Planning Area in
                          the Mount Diablo Foothills contains a number of drainages,
                          including tributaries to Galindo Creek. In addition, intermittent
                          streams and seasonal wetland ponds also occur in the area.
                          Although unmapped, they provide seasonal habitats for local
                          wildlife including species such as the Tiger salamander, which is
                          listed as a special status species by the California Natural Diversity

                           Parks, Open Space, and Conservation
Database (CNDDB). The grassland habitat in the eastern
portion of the Planning Area contains a number of such
seasonal wetlands.
Special Status Species
The locations of potential and known special status species within
the Planning Area are shown in Figure 6-4. The non-urban areas at
the south, east and north portions of the Planning Area are both
known and potential habitat for a number of special status animal
and plant species. Lime Ridge supports known populations of
Mount Diablo manzanita (Arctostaphylos auriculata, endemic to the
Mount Diablo area), Mount Diablo fairy lantern (Calochortus
pulchellus), Diablo helianthella (Helianthella castanea), and Hall’s
bush mallow (Malocothamnus hallii). This ridge provides important
habitat for these special status plant species and is considered a
Significant Ecological Area by Contra Costa County.
The ridge, and the grassland and chaparral habitat extending east
through the slopes of Mt. Diablo to Clayton, also provide potential
habitat for Alameda whipsnake (Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus).
Mount Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum) has been
historically recorded near this area as well. Despite being
considered potentially extinct, a number of recorded locations,
including this one, are still considered potential habitat for this
species. Southeast of the border of the Planning Area lies Mitchell
Creek, beyond which is the ecological area associated with Mt.
Diablo State Park. This area contains a concentration of special
status species. Recorded populations of Mount Diablo fairy lantern,
Mount Diablo Brewer’s western flax (Hesperolinon breweri), and
Diablo helianthella occur in the vicinity. Mt. Diablo is considered a
Significant Ecological Area by Contra Costa County, and this
Significant Ecological Area extends into Concord’s Planning Area.
Portions of the hills within the eastern boundary of the Planning
Area provide habitat for California tiger salamanders, which have
been observed along intermittent streams and seasonal wetland
ponds in this area (CNDDB, 2006). Given that this species can
range up to slightly over one-mile upland from these sources, much
of the grassland area is considered habitat. Intermittent streams and
ponds also provide habitat for California red-legged frog (Rana
aurora draytonii), which has been observed on the southeastern
portion of the Concord Reuse Project site.
The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) has been recorded on the
Concord Reuse Project site. This species has the potential to occur
in all grassland habitats in the Concord Planning Area. The eastern
border of the Planning Area parallels and slightly overlaps the edge
                                                               6-21

                          of known San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) habitat
                          (CNDDB, 2006).
                          Roundleaved filaree (Erodium macrophyllum) has been historically
                          recorded in the grasslands at the southeast portion of the Planning
                          Area. Although most Contra Costa County records for this species
                          are historic, fieldwork is lacking and its status in the county is
                          uncertain. Grassland and woodland habitats of the Concord
                          Planning Area provide potential habitat for this species. The Avon-
                          Port Chicago Marsh provides habitat for a host of special status
                          wildlife and plant species including California black rail (Laterallus
                          jamaicensis coturniculus), California clapper rail (Rallus
                          longirostris obsoletus), Salt-marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys
                          raviventris), Suisun song sparrow (Melospiza melodia maxillaries),
                          Delta tule pea (Lathyrus jepsonii var. jepsonii), Mason’s lilaeopsis
                          (Lilaeopsis masonii), and Soft bird’s beak (Cordylanthus mollis ssp.
                          mollis). All of these species have been recorded from this area and
                          are presumed to be extant there. The marsh is considered to be a
                          Significant Natural Area by the California Department of Fish and
                          Game (CDFG) and Contra Costa County considers it a Significant
                          Ecological Area. The CDFG also has mapped a considerable
                          portion of this marsh as Coastal Brackish Marsh, a sensitive
                          community.
                          Planning for the reuse of the former Concord Naval Weapons
                          Station has required extensive documentation of special status
                          species on the project site. In addition to the California red-legged
                          frog, California tiger salamander, and Burrowing Owl habitat noted
                          above, a number of protected birds have been observed, including
                          Golden eagles, Bald eagles, Loggerhead shrikes, and Peregrine
                          falcons. The site also contains potential habitat for the Western
                          Pond turtle and Coast horned lizard, although neither species has
                          been observed. The Concord Reuse Project (CRP) Area Plan
                          conserves the most sensitive habitat areas on the site as open space.
                          A few historical records of special status species exist within the
                          urbanized area of Concord, particularly California tiger salamander
                          (Ambystoma californiense), Contra Costa goldfields (Lasthenia
                          conjugens),      Caper-fruited    tropidocarpum       (Tropidocarpum
                          capparideum), and Congdon’s tarplant (Centromadia parryi ssp.
                          congdonii). These are located in central Concord and along the
                          urban border to the west with Pleasant Hill, the southwest with
                          Walnut Creek, and the southeast with Clayton. These populations
                          are presumed extirpated due to urban growth. All, except for the
                          Tiger salamander, probably no longer occur in the area. Mount
                          Diablo buckwheat (Eriogonum truncatum) has been historically
                          recorded from the west slope of Mount Zion, near the southeast

                            Parks, Open Space, and Conservation
corner of the City limits, just west of Clayton. This species is
potentially extinct but a number of recorded locations, including
this one, are still considered to provide potential for occurrence.
Wildlife Corridors
While the habitats found in the City supply resources for local plant
and animal populations, on a larger scale open spaces in the area
serve the crucial function of providing movement corridors for
regional wildlife. Lime Ridge and the annual grasslands of Los
Medanos Hills and the Mount Diablo Foothills represent the
northern extent of continuous natural habitat extending south
through Mount Diablo, the Black Hills, Briones Valley, and beyond.
Thus, Planning Area open spaces are part of larger systems of
regional wildlife movement corridors, as exhibited by the species
that are observed in them. Also, creeks and waterways within the
Planning Area may provide rainy season migration routes for
California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs, in
addition to more common amphibians. Areas of riparian vegetation
associated with these waterways may provide cover for migrating or
non-migrating birds and mammals.
Water Resources
Surface water bodies within Concord include Mallard Reservoir,
Walnut Creek, Pacheco Creek, Mount Diablo Creek, Galindo
Creek, Pine Creek, Contra Costa Canal, and sloughs and wetlands
located along Suisun Bay. Some stock ponds, watering holes, and
seepage ponds are found on the Concord Reuse Project site. These
ponds and watering holes are mainly located in the hills where
natural water sources are scarce.
Watersheds
Watersheds within the region are defined by creeks, streams, and
other surface water drainages that originate in the upland areas near
Mt. Diablo and flow downslope towards the Bay. As illustrated in
Figure 6-5, much of the Planning Area lies within the Mount Diablo
Creek watershed, which drains into Pacheco Slough and the Suisun
Bay. Additionally, five other watersheds are at least partially
located within the Planning Area including Concord, Grayson
Creek/Murderers Creek, Kirker Creek, Pine Creek/Galindo Creek,
and Willow Creek/ Coastal Drainages. These watersheds drain into
creek systems in adjacent jurisdictions. Boundaries between these
watersheds are created by the topographic features such as ridges
and valleys that shape surface water drainage patterns. Acreage
information for each watershed is summarized in Table 6-4.

                                                   south. The Clayton Valley is underlain by thick alluvial deposits
                                                   which cover faulted and folded older rocks. The water bearing units
                                                   are Quaternary-age and older alluvial deposits, which exceed 700
                                                   feet in depth. These units are hydraulically connected with Suisun
                                                   Bay.
                                                   The Ygnacio Valley groundwater basin is bounded by Suisun Bay
                                                   to the north, Highway 680 to the west, the Concord Fault to the east,
                                                   and the City of Walnut Creek to the south. Walnut and Grayson
                                                   Creeks flow through the basin before draining into Pacheco Creek
                                                   and then into Suisun Bay. The Ygnacio Valley groundwater basin is
                                                   formed in a depression between the Berkeley Hills and the Mt.
                                                   Diablo Range. Thick alluvial deposits cover folded and faulted
                                                   older rocks. The water bearing units in the basin are from
                                                   Quaternary deposits. As in the Clayton Valley basin, water bearing
                                                   deposits are over 700 feet in depth. Aquifers in this basin are
                                                   hydraulically connected to the Sacramento River 4.
                                                   Information from DWR indicates that groundwater levels in both of
                                                   the basins have declined gradually. Groundwater levels are
                                                   generally lowest during the summer months and highest during the

Principle POS-3.1: Preserve and Protect Water Quality.
Policy POS-3.1.1:     Enhance and maintain the natural values of
                      creeks and major drainage ways.
                      This could include restoration measures along
                      Galindo, Mount Diablo, and Pine Creeks to
                      improve ecological systems, slow peak storm
                      runoff, and increase infiltration.
Policy POS-3.1.2:     Preserve and restore native riparian vegetation
                      and wildlife, and establish riparian corridors
                      along all creeks.
Policy POS-3.1.3:     Require adequate building setbacks for
                      development adjacent to creek banks and
                      major drainage ways to protect neighboring
                      properties from erosion and flooding.
                      The Development Code will include standards
                      for development near creeks.
Policy POS-3.1.4:     Support improvements along creeks in
                      consultation and cooperation with creek
                      restoration and design professionals.
Policy POS-3.1.5:     Provide access easements for creek
                      maintenance purposes and public access to
                      creekside amenities, where consistent with
                      habitat protection objectives and resource
                      agency regulations.

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Policy POS-3.1.6: To the extent practical, preserve creeks in a
                                            natural condition while providing for the need
                                            to convey storm water.
                          Policy POS-3.1.7: Improve the quality of underground and
                                            surface waters in Concord through
                                            coordination with outside agencies.
                                            The State Department of Fish and Game,
                                            Contra Costa County Flood Control, the
                                            Water Conservation District, the Soil
                                            Conservation District, the Contra Costa
                                            Water District, and the Regional Water
                                            Quality Control Board, are all agencies that
                                            the City can partner with to maintain and
                                            improve water quality.
                          Principle POS-3.2:     Preserve and Protect Wetlands.
                          Policy POS-3.2.1: Preserve bay marshes, wetlands, and tidal
                                            areas adjacent to Suisun Bay as open space.
                                            This policy is consistent with state and federal
                                            “no net loss” policies for wetlands.
                                            Preservation mechanisms include the
                                            following:
                                            •    Avoidance of sensitive habitat areas
                                                 (some of the tidal area from Pt. Edith
                                                 west along the tidal marsh to the

                                                 refuge priority use area);
                                            •    Clustering of development away from
                                                 wetlands;
                                            •    Transfer of development rights for
                                                 preservation of existing sensitive lands;
                                                 and/or
                                            •    Compensatory in-kind mitigation, such as
                                                 restoration or creation.
                          Policy POS-3.2.2: Provide visual, and where practical, physical
                                            access to wetland areas in a manner consistent
                                            with protection of these fragile ecological
                                            systems.

                       Parks, Open Space, and Conservation
Policy POS-3.2.3: For wetlands that are not adjacent to Suisun
                  Bay, follow management and protection
                  measures that are consistent with state and
                  federal requirements.
                  A number of small wetland areas exist on the
                  Concord Reuse Project (CRP) site. The CRP
                  Area Plan generally conserves these areas as
                  open space, although conservation may not be
                  feasible in all instances. In such cases,
                  mitigation measures have been prescribed to
                  establish replacement wetlands elsewhere.
Principle POS-3.3:Facilitate Water Conservation.
Policy POS-3.3.1: Cooperate with the Contra Costa Water
                  District to implement water saving programs.
Policy POS-3.3.2: Implement water-conserving practices in City
                  operations and projects.
                  Such practices may include use of low-flow
                  plumbing, water-conserving appliances, and
                  xeriscape (e.g., drought-tolerant planting and
                  landscaping with low-water needs).
Principle POS-3.4: Preserve and Protect Wildlife and
                  Vegetation Resources.
Policy POS-3.4.1: Conserve wildlife habitat and wildlife
                  corridors, including seasonal migration routes,
                  and require appropriate mitigation in the event
                  such areas are impacted by development,
Policy POS-3.4.2: Protect rare, threatened, or endangered species
                  and their habitats through the environmental
                  review process and in accordance with State
                  and Federal law.
                  Project-level environmental review will assess
                  the potential impact of proposed development
                  on special-status species and sensitive natural
                  communities and could require mitigation
                  measures and monitoring to ensure protection
                  of sensitive biological resources.

                                            appropriate for mitigation.
                                            The Development Code will include standards
                                            and review criteria to implement this policy.
                          Policy POS-3.4.4: Plant vegetation to increase benefits to
                                            wildlife.
                          Policy POS-3.4.5: Coordinate with appropriate regulatory and
                                            trustee agencies to enhance protection of
                                            special status species and sensitive natural
                                            communities.
                                            Coordination with regulatory and trustee
                                            agencies will include, but not be limited to,
                                            the California Department of Fish and Game,
                                            U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the
                                            Regional Water Quality Control Board.
                          Policy POS-3.4.6: Avoid construction-related activities during
                                            breeding and nesting seasons for special status
                                            species.
                                            Construction-related activities within
                                            sensitive habitat of special status species will
                                            generally not be allowed during the breeding
                                            season or season of greatest effect on their
                                            survival. If project activities cannot avoid
                                            these seasons, the project applicant will have
                                            to arrange for surveys of any special status
                                            species in accordance with state and federal
                                            standards and follow applicable trustee
                                            agency protocol for species protection.
                          Policy POS-3.4.7: Promote habitat restoration in areas of special
                                            status species.
                                            The City will coordinate with appropriate
                                            agencies and the community to improve
                                            habitat restoration efforts throughout the
                                            Planning Area, and will include special status
                                            species habitat restoration requirements in
                                            the Development Code. Plans for the
                                            Community Reuse Project include restoration
                                            of habitat along Mount Diablo Creek and in
                                            the Los Medanos Hills.

                       Parks, Open Space, and Conservation
Principle POS-3.5:     Conserve Mineral Resources.
Policy POS-3.5.1: Encourage conservation of valuable mineral
                  resources and provide substantial protection of
                  significant mineral deposits, consistent with
                  the City’s other land use goals.
Policy POS-3.5.2: Regulate extraction and consumption of
                  mineral resources in accordance with
                  applicable State law.
Policy POS-3.5.3: Prohibit residential land uses within mineral
                  resource impact areas containing mineral
                  deposits of state-wide or regional significance
                  as determined by the California State Mining
                  and Geology Board.
                  Residential land uses are inherently
                  incompatible with mining. Mining activities
                  typically require a high public or private
                  investment in structures, land improvements,
                  and landscaping that can be adversely
                  affected if incompatible uses are allowed in
                  the vicinity of these operations.
Policy POS-3.5.4: Preserve significant mineral resource areas in
                  open space areas.
Policy POS-3.5.5: Require future development in the vicinity of
                  significant mineral resources to be planned
                  and designed to minimize conflict between
                  mineral extraction activities and neighboring
                  land uses.
Principle POS-3.6:     Conserve Natural Resources.
Policy POS-3.6.1: Encourage, and where appropriate require,
                  sustainable building practices for new
                  development and the remodeling of existing
                  buildings.
                  Sustainable building practices employ a wide
                  variety of construction techniques and
                  methods that allow new development and
                  building remodels to last longer, cost less to
                  operate, and protect the health of workers and

Concord 2030 General Plan
                                                 residents. Examples of sustainable building
                                                 practices include the use of advanced framing
                                                 techniques that reduce lumber requirements,
                                                 incorporating recycled building materials,
                                                 designing with solar heating and cooling
                                                 systems, and using energy efficient
                                                 appliances, water heaters, and insulation.
                          Policy POS-3.6.2: Require that future design and construction on
                                                 the Concord Reuse Project Site incorporates
                                                 sustainable development principles, including
                                                 green building, green infrastructure, site
                                                 planning which maximizes solar access
                                                 opportunities, and a land use and
                                                 transportation    plan    which      maximizes
                                                 opportunities for non-automobile travel.
                                                 Reuse of the Concord Naval Weapons Station
                                                 offers a particularly important opportunity to
                                                 apply sustainable building practices on a
                                                 community-wide scale. The Concord Reuse
                                                 Project Area Plan includes policies,
                                                 standards, and other measures to conserve
                                                 water and fossil fuels.
                          6.7       CULTURAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES
                          The lands encompassed by the Planning Area have a long and rich
                          history of human habitation. The earliest known occupation of the
                          area dates to 200 B.C., and sites with evidence of those cultures still
                          remain. Far more salient to modern residents in Concord is the large
                          inventory of historic homes and buildings, which provide a visual
                          history of the development of the City from its first modern
                          settlement to today. The existence of both archaeologically sensitive
                          areas and historic buildings in Concord underscores the need for
                          policies that preserve such aspects of the City’s heritage.
                          In addition to a desire by the local community to protect historic
                          resources, several State laws, most notably the California
                          Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines §15064.5(f) and
                          Public Resources Code §5020-5029 and 21083.2, protect
                          archaeological and historical resources. To preserve historic
                          resources, the State has formed the State Historical Resources
                          Commission that conducts the State Historic Resource Inventory
                          and maintains the California Register of Historic Resources, which
                          identifies historic landmarks and points of interest. The Commission

                                                   also provides recommendations for the National Register of Historic
                                                   Places.
                                                   Archaeological Resources
                                                   A review of the Planning Area conducted by the Northwest
                                                   Information Center found 12 recorded American Indian
                                                   archaeological resources listed with the State Historical Resources
                                                   Information System. These sites range from sparse lithic scatters to
                                                   ethnographic village sites. Additional assessments were conducted
                                                   as part of the reuse planning process for the former Concord Naval
                                                   Weapons Station. These assessments found 10 archaeological sites
                                                   that were potentially eligible for National Register listing, including
                                                   three prehistoric (Native American) sites and seven historic sites.
                                                   Six of these sites are outside of the development area proposed by
                                                   the Concord Reuse Project and will be conserved as parkland or
                                                   open space. The other four sites (one pre-historic and three historic)
                                                   are within proposed development areas. Data documentation,
                                                   recovery, and curation measures will be required before any earth
                                                   disturbing activities are permitted in these areas. 5
                                                   Two additional prehistoric sites were identified approximately one
                                                   quarter-mile west of the Willow Pass Road Corridor along Walnut
                                                   Creek and within the Monument Boulevard Corridor. Although the
                                                   latter was leveled in 1937 for agricultural purposes, a salvage crew
                                                   from U.C. Berkeley recorded the site prior to its demolition, which
                                                   yielded numerous burials and artifactual remains. 6 The site was
                                                   capped in the mid-1960s. 7 It is possible these two sites are
                                                   components of a single village site that may qualify for the National
                                                   Register of Historic Places.
                                                   Additionally, the Planning Area contains many topographical
                                                   features near which archaeological sites in this portion of Contra
                                                   Costa County tend to be located, such as ridgelines, midslope
                                                   terraces, alluvial flats, ecotones, and near sources of water. Given
                                                   the environmental setting and the archaeologically sensitive nature
                                                   of the general area, the review concluded that there is a high
                                                   potential for additional Native American sites within the Planning

Historic Resources
Many of the historic resources in Concord date back to the days
of its founding, and are located near Todos Santos Plaza.
Additionally, the City’s historic buildings reflect its changing role
through time as a center of agriculture, military activities, and
commercial activities. The City contains three National Register
Sites or Structures, and 32 additional sites and structures within
its City limits are considered by the Concord Historical Society to
be important local historic resources. The City of Concord
designated historic sites and structures are mapped in Figure 6-6
and listed in Table 6-5.

                       maximum extent feasible.
                       As part of Plan implementation, the City
                       will undertake appropriate review and
                       consultation as required by applicable State
                       and Federal laws pertaining to historic and
                       archaeological resource protection, and
                       may consider relocation of certain historic

7 SAFETY AND NOISE
     The purpose of the Safety and Noise Element is to identify the
     natural and man-made hazards that exist within the City, and to
     mitigate their potential impacts through both preventative and
     responsive measures. This Element addresses air quality, noise
     sources, geology and seismicity, wildfire hazards, hazardous
     materials, and health and safety services. It also includes policies on
     natural hazards mitigation planning, which respond to the Federal
     Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 and the Federal Emergency
     Management Agency’s Final Interim Rule, published in October
     2002. Hazards related to drainage and flooding are addressed in the
     Public Facilities Element.
     7.1      AIR QUALITY
     Two types of air pollutants affect air quality in Concord – criteria
     air pollutants and toxic air contaminants. The city also faces air
     quality issues relating to odors and nuisances such as dust and
     smoke. Urban activities in the city also generate greenhouse gases,
     which contribute to global climate change.
     The major source of air pollutants in Concord is motor vehicle
     emissions. Heavy commute patterns throughout the San Francisco
     Bay Area have resulted in poor regional air quality levels. Newer
     model vehicles are producing “cleaner” auto emissions, and will
     help to counteract the negative air quality impacts associated with
     increased vehicle use. Nonetheless, the region is still gaining
     population and jobs, resulting in longer commutes and more
     vehicles on the road. Continued efforts must be made to reduce
     emissions through land use and transportation planning.
     Criteria and toxic air contaminants (as described below) are
     controlled by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
     (BAAQMD). The City has a more direct role in regulating odors
     and nuisances, and the release of particulate matter at construction
     sites.
                                                                        7-1

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Criteria Air Pollutants
                          Criteria air pollutants—carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate
                          matter, including nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, PM10, and lead—
                          are most pervasive in urban environments, and State and national
                          ambient air quality standards have been established for them. The
                          Bay Area’s topographical and wind factors reduce local
                          concentrations of criteria air pollutants in Concord. Motor vehicles
                          are expected to continue to be a major source for regional
                          emissions.
                          Residential, industrial, and commercial development in Concord
                          contributes to regional emissions. Emissions are also generated
                          through industrial and commercial operations and building energy
                          use. Residents and workers may experience occasional violations of
                          PM10 (particulates) standards due to construction activities and
                          other local dust sources, and may experience elevated
                          concentrations of carbon monoxide along congested freeway
                          segments and at congested intersections.
                          The primary role of cities in achieving and maintaining regional air
                          quality is through land use decision-making, which can affect
                          vehicle miles traveled, and through other measures to manage the
                          emission of pollutants. BAAQMD identifies specific Transportation
                          Control Measures (TCMs) that, together with other approaches,
                          may help reduce emissions in Concord, contributing to regional
                          pollution control and greenhouse gas reduction efforts.
                          Toxic Air Contaminants
                          Toxic air contaminants are those pollutants that occur at relatively
                          low concentrations and are associated with carcinogenic or other
                          adverse health effects, but for which no ambient air quality
                          standards have been established. These pollutants are typically
                          carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxins. Diesel particulate
                          matter has been identified as a toxic air contaminant and represents
                          70 percent of the known potential cancer risk from air toxics in
                          California. Regulation of toxic air contaminants is achieved through
                          Federal and State controls on individual sources. The preferred
                          technique for reducing toxic air emissions is source reduction, and
                          as part of a local control strategy in the Bay Area, all applications
                          for new stationary sources are reviewed to ensure compliance with
                          required emission controls and limits.
                          The ambient background of toxic air contaminants is the combined
                          result of many diverse human activities, including gasoline stations,
                          automobiles, dry cleaners, industrial operations, hospital sterilizers,
                          and painting operations. In general, mobile sources contribute more
                          significantly to health risks than do stationary sources. The
7-2

                                                  Safety and Noise
BAAQMD notes a particular need to reduce exposure to particulates
and air toxics related to freeways and major arterials, especially
those with high volumes of truck traffic, as well as exposure related
to goods movement and distribution centers. Generally, ambient
concentrations of toxic air contaminants are similar throughout the
urbanized area of the Bay Area. BAAQMD regulates toxic air
contaminants from stationary sources through their permit process;
mobile sources of toxic air contaminants are regulated indirectly
through vehicle emissions standards and though fuel specifications.
Cities have a role in reducing public exposure to toxic air
contaminants through ensuring sufficient buffer zones around
stationary sources and by reducing vehicle trips.
Odors and Nuisances
Odors and nuisances include those emissions which occur
infrequently but which have the potential to generate citizen
complaints. BAAQMD records indicate certain industrial facilities
in Concord occasionally generate citizen complaints. Increased
buffering of incompatible uses and control of dust from construction
are potential local approaches to controlling odors and nuisances.
Air Quality Monitoring Stations
BAAQMD operates a regional network of air pollution monitoring
stations that provide information on ambient concentrations of
criteria air pollutants and toxic air contaminants. Two stations are
operated within the City limits: number 2018, located at 2975 Treat
Boulevard, and number 2032, located at 2477 Arnold Industrial
Way. Table 7-1 summarizes air quality data collected from the
monitoring station on Treat Blvd.
Sensitive Receptors
Some people are more sensitive than others to air pollutants.
Heightened sensitivity may be caused by health problems,
proximity to the emissions source, and duration of exposure to air
pollutants. Sensitive receptors are facilities that house or attract
children, the elderly, people with illnesses, or others who are
especially sensitive to the effects of air pollution. Hospitals,
schools, convalescent facilities, and residential areas are examples
of sensitive receptors which should not be located near sources of
noise, such as an airport.

                                               On a global level, activities such as motor vehicle use, manufacturing, and
                                               power plant operations are generating carbon dioxide, methane, and other
                                               “greenhouse” gases faster than the earth’s atmosphere can absorb them.
                                               These emissions are expected to lead to global temperature increases in the
                                               next century, potentially affecting Concord’s flora and fauna, water supply,
                                               and climate. Assembly Bill (AB) 32, approved by the State legislature in
                                               2006, required the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations
                                               and programs to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels
                                               by 2020. Subsequently, Senate Bill (SB) 375 was adopted to reduce
                                               statewide motor vehicle emissions, in part by improving coordination
                                               between land use, transportation and housing decisions.
                                               Like other cities in California, the City of Concord is taking action to
                                               address climate change through its land use and transportation policies. This
                                               is particularly important on the Concord Reuse Project (CRP) site. The CRP
                                               Area Plan presents an unprecedented opportunity to develop a new kind of
                                               community—one that is less reliant on automobiles and which yields far
                                               lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions per capita than conventional
                                               development. The Area Plan for the CRP includes a “Climate Action Plan”
                                               which outlines the strategies for achieving this objective. The most basic

elements of this Plan are to concentrate new development around BART;
build at densities that support transit use; develop a well-connected bicycle
and pedestrian system; provide a balanced mix of employment, services, and
housing to minimize trip lengths; and incorporate advanced energy
conservation and efficiency measures in the design of new buildings and
infrastructure. A separate Climate Action Plan for the City as a whole also is
planned.
7.2       NOISE
Noise Characteristics and Measurement
Noises vary widely in their scope, source, and volume, ranging from
individual occurrences such as leaf blowers, to the intermittent disturbances
of overhead aircraft, to the fairly constant noise generated by traffic on
freeways. Noise is primarily a concern with regard to noise–sensitive uses
such as residences, schools, churches, and hospitals.
Noise Measurement
Noise is commonly defined as undesirable or unwanted sound. Three aspects
of community noise are used in assessing the noise environment:
•    Level (e.g., magnitude or loudness) of sound. Sound levels are measured
     and expressed in decibels (dB) with 10 dB roughly equal to the
     threshold of hearing. Figure 7-1 shows the decibel levels associated with
     different common sounds.
•    Frequency composition or spectrum of the sound. Frequency is a
     measure of the pressure fluctuations per second, measured in units of
     hertz (Hz). The characterization of sound level magnitude with respect
     to frequency is the sound spectrum, often described in octave bands,
     which divide the audible human frequency range (e.g., from 20 to
     20,000 Hz) into ten segments.
•    Variation in sound level with time, measured as noise exposure. Most
     community noise is produced by many distant noise sources that change
     gradually throughout the day and produce a relatively steady
     background noise having no identifiable source. Identifiable events of
     brief duration, such as aircraft flyovers, cause the community noise level
     to vary from instant to instant. A single number called the equivalent
     sound level or Leq describes the average noise exposure level over a
     period of time.
                                                                         7-5

Concord 2030 General Plan

                          Transient noise events may be described by their maximum A weighted
                          noise level (dBA). Hourly Noise Levels are mentioned in Leq values.
                          Reporting Noise Levels
                          Measuring and reporting noise levels involves accounting for variations in
                          sensitivity to noise during the daytime versus nighttime hours. Noise
                          descriptors used for analysis need to factor for human sensitivity to
                          nighttime noise when background noise levels are generally lower than in
                          the daytime and outside noise intrusions are more noticeable. Common
                          descriptors include the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the
                          Day-Night Average Level (DNL, symbol (Ldn)). Both reflect noise exposure
                          over an average day with weighting to reflect the increased sensitivity to
                          noise during the evening and night. The two descriptors are roughly
                          equivalent. The CNEL descriptor is used in relation to major continuous
                          noise sources, such as aircraft or traffic, and is the reference level for the
                          Noise Element.

                                                   Safety and Noise
Knowledge of the following relationships is helpful in
understanding how changes in noise and noise exposure are
perceived:
•    Except under special conditions, a change in sound level of 1
     dB cannot be perceived;
•    A 3 dB change is considered a just noticeable difference;
•    A 5 dB change is required before any noticeable change in
     community response would be expected. A 5 dB increase is
     often considered a significant impact; and
•    A 10 dB increase is subjectively heard as an approximate doubling
     in loudness and almost always causes an adverse community
     response.
Noise Generation in Concord
The major noise source in Concord is related to vehicle traffic.
Other noise sources include aircraft and rail transportation. Noise
produced by industry has a negligible effect on the City’s residential
noise environment.
Traffic Noise
Traffic noise depends primarily on the speed of traffic and the
percentage of truck traffic. The primary source of noise from
automobiles is high frequency tire noise, which increases with
speed. In addition, trucks and older automobiles produce engine and
exhaust noise, and trucks also generate wind noise. While tire noise
from autos is generally located at ground level, truck noise sources
can be located as high as ten to fifteen feet above the roadbed due to
tall exhaust stacks and higher engines; sound walls are not effective
for mitigating such noise unless they are very tall.
According to common practice, maximum noise levels of 60 dB are
considered “normally acceptable” for unshielded residential
development. Noise levels from 60 dB to 70 dB fall within the
“conditionally unacceptable” range, and those in the 70 dB to 75 dB
range are considered “normally unacceptable.”
Noise exposure contours for Concord were modeled by Charles
Salter Associates by applying the Federal Highway
Administration’s noise modeling procedure. These noise contours
are conservative, meaning that the contours are modeled with
minimal noise attenuation by natural barriers, buildings, etc. The
noise level measured at a specific location may be lower than what
is shown on the noise contour map.
                                                                7-7

                          Projected Conditions under General Plan Buildout
                          Future development within the City’s Planning Area will result in
                          increased auto and truck traffic volumes and planned helicopter
                          flights, thus increasing noise levels somewhat in some areas. Future
                          noise contours are illustrated in Figure 7-2. The Figure does not
                          include future noise contours along new through-streets within the
                          Concord Reuse Project Area, nor does it include changes to noise
                          contours outside the CRP Area resulting from traffic generated by
                          CRP development. The environmental review for the CRP included
                          an analysis of future noise conditions and mitigation measures.
                          Noise contours for future through-streets will be mapped as more
                          detailed plans for the Reuse Project are developed.
                          Noise caused by increases in traffic levels can be counteracted by
                          the implementation of alternate forms of transportation and land use
                          design that factor in noise concerns. Locating noise-sensitive uses
                          away from high-noise areas (e.g., major transportation routes) and
                          buffering noise levels through design and landscaping features will
                          help minimize future noise-related land use conflicts. Policies in
                          this chapter establish review criteria for certain land uses to ensure
                          that future noise levels will not exceed acceptable levels near noise-
                          sensitive land uses.
                          Helicopter Noise
                          The John Muir Health, Concord Campus is planning to provide
                          helicopter service for medical emergencies. Two potential sites have
                          been identified on the Center’s campus; ultimately, one site will be
                          selected for development by the John Muir Health, Concord
                          Campus. The anticipated flight paths would generally follow Port
                          Chicago Highway and major freeways, although Salvio Street and
                          Clayton Road also may be used for approaches from Highway 242
                          from the south. Final flight paths would be approved by the
                          California Department of Aeronautics, based on construction
                          clearance considerations, wind directions and minimizing impacts
                          on nearby land use. Helicopter noise contours associated with these
                          two sites are shown in Figure 7-3.

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Buchanan Field Airport Noise
                          The City recognizes the importance of Buchanan Field Airport to
                          the community and region, and aims to achieve compatibility
                          between the Airport and neighboring land uses. Contra Costa
                          County, the agency that has jurisdictional authority over the airport,
                          has developed projected noise contours for several different
                          scenarios. Figure 7-3 maps projected noise contours and lists the
                          associated activity assumptions.
                          7.3      GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
                          The San Francisco Bay Area contains both active and potentially
                          active faults. Earthquakes pose especially high risks to Concord
                          because of the City’s close proximity to active faults with relatively
                          frequent past movements. The Concord Fault is located within the
                          City limits, and the Hayward Fault is located approximately 15
                          miles west. The Hayward and San Andreas Faults are the two
                          principally active faults in the Bay Area. The San Andreas Fault,
                          located approximately 32 miles west of Concord, is a major
                          structural feature in the region, and forms a boundary between the
                          North American and Pacific Tectonic plates. Other principally
                          active faults in the region include the Green Valley, Rodger’s
                          Creek, Calaveras, Clayton, Diablo, and Marsh Creek-Greenville
                          Faults. However, of these, only the Concord Fault is within an
                          identified Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone (see below).
                           Fault Rupture Hazard Zones
                          Fault rupture is displacement at the earth’s surface resulting from
                          fault movement associated with an earthquake. Surface fault
                          rupture is typically observed close to or on the trace of an active
                          fault. The City of Concord is bisected by the active Concord Fault.
                          Areas within Concord that are most likely to experience fault
                          rupture from movement on the Concord Fault are incorporated
                          within the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone. Extending
                          approximately 1,000 to 2,500 feet wide, the Alquist-Priolo
                          Earthquake Fault Zone is established by the California Geological
                          Survey under the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones Act of 1972.
                          Development within this zone is strictly regulated, and requires
                          detailed geologic and seismic evaluations to assess the potential for
                          fault rupture hazard before a construction permit can be issued for
                          most projects. Fault rupture hazards may severely limit potential
                          future development within this zone.

                           Ground Shaking Susceptibility
                          Ground movement during an earthquake can vary depending on the
                          overall magnitude, distance to the fault, focus of earthquake energy,
                          and type of geologic material. Based on proximity to active faults,
                          certain areas may experience shaking on a more frequent basis.
                          Figure 7-4 displays the potential for earthquake intensity based on a
                          combination of geologic materials, proximity to active faults, and
                          frequency of shaking. The areas with the highest anticipated
                          intensity are those underlain by estuarine deposits near the mouth of
                          Pacheco Creek and along the shoreline of Suisun Bay, in close
                          proximity to the active Concord Fault.
                          The composition of underlying soils, even those relatively distant
                          from faults, can intensify ground shaking. Areas that are underlain
                          by bedrock and areas farther away from the active faults tend to
                          experience less ground shaking or ground shaking on a less frequent
                          basis than those underlain by unconsolidated sediments such as
                          artificial fill or unconsolidated alluvial fill. The strongest ground
                          shaking is anticipated to occur as a result of an earthquake on the
                          Concord Fault, due to immediate proximity. Damage in areas
                          immediately bordering the fault and those underlain by estuarine
                          deposits near the mouth of Pacheco Creek and along the shoreline
                          of Suisun Bay could be significant.
                          Liquefaction Potential
                          Liquefaction is a phenomenon whereby unconsolidated and/or near-
                          saturated soils lose cohesion and are converted to a fluid state as a
                          result of severe vibratory motion. The relatively rapid loss of soil
                          shear strength during strong earthquake shaking results in
                          temporary, fluid-like behavior of the soil. Soil liquefaction causes
                          ground failure that can damage roads, pipelines, underground
                          cables, and buildings with shallow foundations. Liquefaction more
                          commonly occurs in looser, saturated materials. Areas susceptible
                          to liquefaction are typically underlain by water-saturated,
                          unconsolidated, loose, granular materials, and in unconsolidated or
                          artificial fill sediments located in reclaimed areas along the margin
                          of Suisun Bay. Regions within Concord that have high to very high
                          levels of liquefaction susceptibility include Clayton Valley and
                          areas along Suisun Bay, Pacheco Creek, and the Hastings and
                          Belloma Sloughs, as depicted on Figure 7-4.

7.4      WILDFIRE HAZARDS
Wildland fire hazard potential is largely dependent on the extent
and type of vegetation, known as surface fuels, that exists within a
region. Fire hazards are typically highest in heavily wooded,
undeveloped areas as trees are a greater source of fuel than low-
lying brush or grasslands. Suburban or urban areas or rocky barren
areas have minimal surface fuels and therefore typically have the
lowest fire hazard. In Concord, the majority of the surface fuels are
classified as grassy, urban, or barren areas. These areas would be
considered a low to moderate fire hazard, as depicted on Figure 7-5.
Almost the entire Concord Reuse Project site is considered to have a
moderate hazard. The grassy and relatively undeveloped hills in Los
Medanos Hills and the Mt. Diablo Foothills are generally
considered a moderate fire hazard. On the other hand, urban settings
have a higher fire risk than rural areas because of structure density,
according to the Association of Bay Area Governments’ Natural
Hazard Mitigation Plan. As a consequence, the net result may be an
increase in overall fire risk.
7.5      HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Areas where historic or on-going activities have resulted in the
known or suspected release of hazardous materials to soil and
groundwater, as identified by the San Francisco Bay Regional
Water Quality Control Board, Environmental Conditions Report for
the CNWS, and California Department of Toxic Substances, are
depicted on Figure 7-6. Sites with contamination are largely
clustered around prior or existing industrial areas of Clayton Road,
Concord Avenue, Detroit Avenue, Monument Boulevard, and
Willow Pass Road. This potential contamination may be the result
of underground storage tank (UST) releases, spills, accidental
releases or other activities involving the use of hazardous materials.
In general, the areas highlighted are industrial and manufacturing
areas, although some represent gas stations, dry cleaners, or other
small businesses.
Military activities at the former CNWS are known to have impacted
soil and groundwater. Numerous solid waste management units and
storage tanks are located in the CNWS, many of which have been
recommended for “No Further Action” by the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC). A 2005 draft
Preliminary Assessment for the CNWS identified nine areas of
concern, six of which potentially contain Munitions and Explosives
of Concern or Munitions Constituents. Subsequent evaluations of
hazardous materials were conducted as

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          part of the base reuse planning process. Provisions for remediating
                          hazards prior to development approval were established through this
                          process and will be implemented during the time period covered by
                          the General Plan.
                          Releases, leaks, or disposal of chemical compounds, such as
                          petroleum hydrocarbons, on or below the ground surface can lead to
                          contamination of underlying soil and groundwater. Disturbance of a
                          previously contaminated area through grading or excavation
                          operations could expose the public to health hazards from physical
                          contact with contaminated materials or hazardous vapors. Improper
                          handling or storage of contaminated soil and groundwater can
                          further expose the public to these hazards, or potentially spread
                          contamination through surface water runoff or air-borne dust. In
                          addition, contaminated groundwater can spread down gradient,
                          potentially contaminating subsurface areas of surrounding
                          properties.
                          7.6       HEALTH AND SAFETY SERVICES
                          The Concord Police Department and Contra Costa County Fire
                          Protection District provide police fire, and life safety services in
                          Concord.
                          Police Services
                          In 2006, the Concord Police Department had a staff of 161 sworn
                          police officers, which equaled approximately 1.3 officers per 1,000
                          residents. This service ratio is between the nationally-accepted
                          standard service ratio of 1.25 officers per 1,000 residents and the
                          California standard, which ranges from 1.4 –1.7 per 1,000 residents.
                          In addition to sworn staff, the Police Department operated with an
                          authorized non-sworn strength of 65 full-time employees. The
                          department also provides significant services through employment
                          of non-sworn, part-time employees, whose number fluctuates
                          throughout the year.
                          The Police Department headquarters building is located at 1350
                          Galindo Way. The Department provides services based on three
                          community policing districts (the Northern, Southern, and Valley
                          districts). The boundaries of these districts are illustrated on Figure
                          7-7.
                          Fire & Life Safety Services
                          The Contra Costa County Fire Protection District (CCCFPD)
                          provides fire and life safety services within the City of Concord. In
                          addition to services provided by CCCFPD personnel, the District
                          also maintains mutual-aid agreements with the East

                                    located within its jurisdiction. These agreements provide the
                                    CCCFPD with emergency response assistance on an as-needed
                                    basis.
                                    The dispatch time goal for the CCCFPD is to relay a dispatch within
                                    90 seconds of receiving a call for service. Currently, the average
                                    time from call to dispatch is 103 seconds. The Insurance Service
                                    Office (ISO)—a private organization that surveys fire departments
                                    in cities and towns across the United States—awarded the CCCFPD
                                    a Class 3 rating (1 being highest and 10 being lowest). This rating
                                    considers a community’s fire defense capacity versus fire potential,
                                    and then uses the score to set property insurance premiums for
                                    homeowners and commercial property owners.

                                    Eight CCCFPD fire stations currently serve the City of Concord.
                                    The location and number of 24-hour personnel at each station as of
                                    2006 are displayed in Table 7-2. The CCCFPD operates a
                                    countywide early warning system for industrial fires. Called the
                                    Community Warning System (CWS), sirens installed at industrial
                                    facilities automatically sound when an incident occurs. The system
                                    alerts residents via television and radio announcements
                                    .

7.7 NATURAL                      HAZARD           MITIGATION
PLANNING
Mitigation planning is an effective method of reducing risk to life
and property from natural disasters such as earthquakes or wildfires.
The City of Concord undertook a policy initiative to adopt and
implement a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP), which was
adopted by the City Council in July 2005, and updated in March
2012. The Plan ensures that emergency services providers are
adequately prepared to respond to a major seismic event on the
Concord Fault or other Bay Area earthquake fault.
The LHMP was prepared in coordination with the Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) with funding and oversight from
FEMA. As part of the LHMP, the City identified critical health care
facilities, schools, City buildings, and roadways located in areas
anticipated to be subjected to high levels of ground shaking,
liquefaction, flooding or wildland fires. In order to address these
hazards, the City also identified mitigation strategies such as
replacement of aging utility lines, seismic retrofitting of facilities
critical to providing emergency services, and ensuring coordination
among City, County and State agencies that provide emergency
service response, as well as private sector organizations such as
local hospitals (City of Concord, 2012). The City has adopted the
list of mitigation strategies from the LHMP as the Implementation
Appendix for this Safety Element in the areas of infrastructure,
health, housing, economy, government, environment and land use.
The LHMP initiative was undertaken in accordance with the federal
Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA), which requires local
agencies to adopt an approved Hazard Mitigation Plan to be eligible
for pre-disaster hazard mitigation funding. The DMA establishes a
national hazard mitigation program to reduce the loss of life and
property, human suffering, economic disruption and disaster
assistance costs resulting from natural disasters. The DMA also
provides a source of pre-disaster hazard mitigation funding to assist
local governments in implementing effective hazard mitigation
measures to ensure the continued functionality of critical services
and facilities after a natural disaster.
This first part of the City of Concord’s two-part LHMP is a Multi-
jurisdictional Regional Hazard Mitigation Plan entitled, “Taming
Natural Disasters,” which was developed in cooperation with other
local agencies and the Association of Bay Area Governments. The
second part is a Local Annex to the regional plan, with priorities
and strategies specific to the City of Concord. The Annex also
describes the City’s efforts during the development of the LHMP,
                                                             7-21

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          including participation in workshops, staff training and public input;
                          the Hazard and Risk assessment process and the result of the hazard
                          assessment; the process for identifying mitigation activities and
                          setting priorities; as well as the process for maintaining and
                          updating the Plan.
                          A critical component to a successful mitigation planning project,
                          and a requirement of the federal law, is to have a well-defined
                          planning process with opportunities for public involvement. The
                          multi-jurisdictional approach the City undertook emphasizes a
                          thorough and well-documented planning process, using the City’s
                          Internet web page and public outreach process to maximize public
                          access to project information. This process was also used to solicit
                          input during the five-year update in 2009-2011.
                          Both sections of the LHMP have been reviewed and approved by
                          the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA
                          requires the completion and adoption of LHMPs as a continuing
                          condition for eligibility to receive FEMA grant assistance,
                          particularly for pre-disaster planning and projects that prevent
                          disasters.
                          The 2009-2011 update of the LHMP was adopted by the Concord
                          City Council in March 2012. The updated plan continues to include
                          an “Umbrella” Plan which applies to numerous participating
                          agencies, and an “Annex” which is Concord-specific. The 2012
                          Annex provides a status update on the City’s ongoing mitigation
                          projects, including identifying a back-up Emergency Operations
                          Center, funding of road and bridge retrofits, setting up memoranda
                          of understanding for the use of schools as emergency shelters,
                          training of City staff and school district personnel, and translation of
                          outreach material into multiple languages. The Annex also
                          identifies new mitigation projects, such as inventory of soft-story
                          buildings and installation of alert and warning systems.

Policy S-1.1.3:   Require project applicants to implement all
                  feasible control measures to reduce
                  combustion emissions from construction
                  equipment.
Policy S-1.1.4:   Require developers on a case-by-case basis to
                  comply with the Bay Area Air Quality
                  Management District regulations in effect at
                  the time of project approval, including
                  regulations relating to dust, toxic air
                  contaminants (TACs), odors, and other air
                  pollutants or air quality issues.
Policy S-1.1.5:   Coordinate with the Bay Area Air Quality
                  Management District (BAAQMD) when

                  land use proposals.
                  Examples of these issues include control of
                  windblown particulates, mechanical
                  equipment exhaust, and ventilation of parking
                  garages. Micro-scale impacts can often be
                  mitigated by changes in design, hours of
                  operation, or use of filters or other control
                  devices, and the District may have
                  information available on “Best Practices”
                  that can help project applicants.

                          Policy S-1.3.6:  Promote the planting and maintenance of trees
                                           and other landscaping to absorb carbon
                                           dioxide and help reduce air pollution levels.

                                           devices. Seek grant funding for a wood-
                                           burning stove “changeout” program to
                                           encourage owners of wood-burning stoves in
                                           existing residences to replace them with EPA-
                                           certified devices, and prepare homeowner
                                           information handouts describing low-emission
                                           alternatives to wood-burning fireplaces.
                                           Many homes are equipped with fireplaces,
                                           which are a growing source of localized air
                                           pollution. Smoke released from fireplaces and
                                           wood stoves contains carbon monoxide,
                                           nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds,
                                           and inhalable particulate matter (PM10). The
                                           changeout programs have been successful in
                                           areas of the State where emissions from
                                           wood-burning fireplaces cause significant air
                                           pollution. PG&E and the Hearth Products
                                           Association have offered incentives in the past
                                           in the form of cash rebates to encourage
                                           replacement of old wood-burning appliances

Principle S-2.1: Encourage Land Use Compatibility for
                 Community Noise Environments.
Policy S-2.1.1:  Use the community noise level exposure
                 standards, shown in Figure 7-8, as review
                 criteria for new land uses.
                 These standards show noise levels that are
                 “normally acceptable”, “conditionally
                 acceptable”, “normally unacceptable” and
                 “clearly unacceptable” for different types of
                 land use.

                                            Safety and Noise
Policy S-2.1.2: Require a noise study and mitigation measures
                for all projects that have noise exposure
                greater than “normally acceptable” levels.
                The need for mitigation of exterior noise
                exposure for development shall be evaluated
                on a case-by-case basis. Within
                neighborhoods where medium and high
                density residential development and mixed use
                development is planned, the City will balance
                the need for noise mitigation with urban
                design considerations, and may not require
                exterior walls along streets where an
                attractive pedestrian-oriented environment
                with porches and front stoops is desired.
Policy S-2.1.3: Consider an increase of four or more dBA to
                be “significant” if the resulting noise level
                would exceed that described as “normally
                acceptable” in Figure 7-8.
                When an increase in noise would result in a
                “significant” impact to residents or
                businesses, then mitigation will be required to
                reduce noise exposure. If the increase is four
                dBA or more, the change in noise is
                perceptible and discretionary review is
                required. If the increase in noise is three dBA
                or less, then the noise impact is considered
                insignificant and no mitigation is needed.
                By setting a specific threshold of significance
                in the General Plan, this policy will facilitate
                making a determination of environmental
                impact, as required by the California
                Environmental Quality Act. It will help the
                City judge whether (1) the potential impact of
                a development project on the noise
                environment warrants mitigation, or (2) a
                statement of overriding considerations will be
                required.
Policy S-2.1.4: Promote the use of noise attenuation measures
                to improve the acoustic environment inside
                residences      where     existing    residential
                development is located on an arterial street.

                                           order to develop noise contour diagrams.
                                           Such diagrams should show probable future
                                           noise levels in the city (see Figure 7-2) and
                                           should be used to evaluate the compatibility of
                                           various land uses in different locations as well
                                           as the need for mitigation measures to reduce
                                           noise levels to acceptable levels.
                                           In addition to Figure 7-2, which is highly
                                           generalized, the City will develop and
                                           maintain a digital GIS shape file which can be
                                           used for more detailed analysis of projected
                                           noise conditions. In addition, noise analysis
                                           will continue to be required on a project by
                                           project basis as future development is
                                           proposed and as future planning is conducted
                                           on the Concord Reuse Project site.

                          Policy S-2.2.1:  Provide for the mitigation of noise exposure in
                                           areas of the City exposed to noise levels in
                                           excess of the “normally acceptable” standards
                                           to the extent feasible (see Figure 7-8).
                          Policy S-2.2.2:  Reduce noise intrusion generated by
                                           miscellaneous      noise     sources     through

                          Policy S-2.2.3:  Use the Buchanan Field Airport—Noise
                                           Contour Map (see Figure 7-3) for evaluation
                                           of noise impacts around Buchanan Field
                                           Airport.
                                           The Buchanan Field Airport Noise Contours
                                           will be used in conjunction with the noise
                                           contours for car and truck noise during the
                                           development review process.
                          Policy S-2.2.4:  Require new noise sources to use best
                                           available control technology (BACT) to
                                           minimize noise emissions.

                   Noise from mechanical equipment can be
                   reduced with soundproofing materials and
                   sound-deadening insulation; controlling
                   hours of operation also will reduce noise
                   impacts during the morning or evening.
Policy S-2.2.5:    Require developers to reduce the noise
                   impacts of new development on adjacent
                   properties through appropriate means.
                   Increasing setbacks, screening, use of
                   soundproofing materials and double-glazing
                   windows, as well as fences and walls,
                   building orientation and design, and

                                           ensure that buildings, streets, and drives can be
                                           accommodated safely with a minimum amount
                                           of grading.
                          Policy S-3.2.2:  Restrict development on hillsides with slopes
                                           over 30 percent. Where slopes over 30 percent
                                           occur within areas shown for development on
                                           the General Plan Diagram, they should be set
                                           aside as open space where feasible.
                                           With steeper slopes there is a greater risk of a
                                           loss of slope stability and resulting landslides,
                                           which may cause loss of life and property.
                          Policy S-3.2.3:  Require soils and geologic hazards analysis
                                           and mitigation as part of development project
                                           review.
                          Policy S-3.2.4:  Regulate       all    development,      including
                                           remodeling or structural rehabilitation, to
                                           assure adequate mitigation of safety hazards
                                           on sites having a history or threat of slope
                                           instability, erosion, subsidence, ground failure,
                                           ground rupture, and/or liquefaction.
                          Policy S-3.2.5:  Control erosion of graded areas with
                                           revegetation or other acceptable methods.
                          Policy S-3.2.6:  Ensure that comparable levels of hazard
                                           mitigation are required for projects affecting
                                           low-income or minority populations, so that
                                           these populations are not disproportionately
                                           affected by new development.

Principle S-4.1:    Protect the community from risks to lives
                    and property posed by flooding and
                    stormwater runoff.
                    Assembly Bill (AB) 162, approved in 2007,
                    requires local governments to provide specific
                    flood hazard information in their general
                    plans. Concord has complied with AB 162 by
                    including flood hazard maps in Chapter 8 of
                    this Plan, and by adopting a Flood Plain
                    Management Ordinance that has been
                    approved by FEMA. The City has also
                    documented flood hazards in its Local Hazard
                    Mitigation Plan. Additional flood hazard data
                    is being collected for the Community Reuse
                    Project site.
Policy S-4.1.1:     Manage development to ensure compliance
                    with the City’s Flood Management Ordinance
                    and the City’s Stormwater Management and
                    Discharge Control Ordinance.
                    This includes construction and site design
                    methods to minimize flood damage in the event
                    of construction within flood hazard areas.
Policy S-4.1.2:     Establish engineering design standards for
                    constructing a storm drainage system to
                    protect against loss of life and property and
                    minimize risks of flooding. This system
                    should include a combination of constructed
                    facilities and natural creeks which are
                    managed to reduce flood hazards.
                    All constructed drainage facilities must have
                    adequate capacity to contain, with sufficient
                    freeboard, projected runoff from the “design
                    flood”, a 50-year flood for major facilities, a
                    25-year flood for secondary facilities, and a
                    10-year flood for minor facilities.
Policy S-4.1.3:     Coordinate storm drainage management with
                    appropriate agencies, including the County
                    Flood Control and Water Conservation

                    of emerging, new high-technology solutions.
Policy S-8.1.2:     Coordinate disaster response planning with
                    surrounding cities, agencies, and Contra Costa
                    County.
Policy S-8.1.3:     Work with critical use facilities (i.e., hospitals,
                    schools,      public      assembly       facilities,
                    transportation services) to assure that they can
                    provide alternate sources of electricity, water,
                    and sewerage in the event that regular utilities
                    are interrupted in a disaster.
Policy S-8.1.4:     Implement the City’s Local Hazard Mitigation
                    Plan, consistent with the guidelines of the
                    Federal Emergency Management Agency
                    (FEMA) and the Disaster Act of 2000, and
                    seek funding under FEMA’s Hazard
                    Mitigation Grant Program.

8 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND UTILITIES
     The purpose of the Public Facilities and Utilities Element is to
     address service and infrastructure needs for development under the
     General Plan. This Element focuses on specific functional needs of
     the City’s public services and facilities, and clearly distinguishes
     issues related to City services from those related to other service
     providers over which the City has no control. It addresses schools,
     libraries, and cultural facilities; drainage and flood control; and
     water, sewer, and solid waste services.
     State law now requires General Plans to include consideration of
     environmental justice in preparing policies and implementation
     programs, and in creating the physical framework for development.
     The problems of environmental justice that the General Plan can
     address include procedural and geographic inequities.
     •    Procedural inequities might include “stacking” commissions or
          committees with individuals who ignore the interests of
          minority and low-income residents, holding meetings at times
          and places that minimize the ability of low-income residents to
          participate, using English-only communications when non-
          English speaking populations may be affected by land use
          decisions, and requiring lower levels of mitigation for projects
          affecting low-income and minority populations.
     •    Geographic inequities might include providing fewer public
          services, transit services, and parks for minority and low-
          income residents than for white, middle- and upper-income
          residents.
     Several new policy initiatives, distributed throughout the General
     Plan, are included to address environmental justice.
     The effects of the Concord Reuse Project (CRP) on Concord’s
     public facilities and utilities are particularly important. The CRP
     will add thousands of new homes and jobs in an area that lacks most
     urban services today. New water and sewer lines will be needed,
     and new schools, fire stations, and other public facilities will be
     required. Policies in the General Plan and the CRP Area Plan
     ensure that these services are planned and committed before
                                                                      8-1

Concord 2030 General Plan
                           development is approved. The CRP also provides opportunities for
                          new facilities which serve all Concord residents, addressing existing
                          deficiencies while meeting the needs of a growing population.
                          8.1 SCHOOLS                        AND            COMMUNITY
                          FACILITIES
                          Schools
                          The Mt. Diablo Unified School District covers the Concord
                          Planning Area as well as a large portion of Contra Costa County
                          that serves Clayton, Bay Point, and portions of Walnut Creek and
                          Pleasant Hill. Within the Planning Area, the District currently
                          operates 14 elementary schools, 4 middle schools, and 8 high
                          schools. These schools are presented in Table 8-1, along with
                          enrollment and capacity counts from the 2006-2007 school year and
                          the year 2004, respectively. In total, one elementary school and four
                          high schools are over capacity, but the percentages are not large—
                          two to six percent.
                          The City of Concord also is home to a variety of private elementary
                          and middle schools, two private high schools, one university, a
                          number of trade and vocational schools, and several adult and
                          special education schools. The school sites are mapped on Figure 8-
                          1. Around each school site, a ½-mile radius has been applied to
                          indicate areas that are within walking distance. Neighborhoods that
                          fall outside of these areas are considered beyond reasonable walking
                          distance to a local school site.
                          Projected Enrollment
                          Projecting future school enrollment requires consideration of many
                          factors, including the number of homes that may be added in future
                          years, expected birth rates, the age distribution of the population,
                          and private school enrollment trends. The Mt. Diablo Unified
                          School District periodically prepares enrollment projections as part
                          of its facility planning program.
                          The District has calculated the average number of students
                          associated with different types of housing units and applies these
                          statistics (called “student generation rates”) to estimate the number
                          of students likely to reside in new housing developments.
                          Student generation rates are currently 0.6213 students per household
                          for single family homes and 0.1896 students per household for
                          multi-family homes. Of this total, the breakdown by grade is:
                          •    K – 5: 47 percent of students
                          •    6 – 8: 27 percent of students
                          •    9 – 12: 26 percent of students

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Over the next 20 years, citywide enrollment is expected to increase
                          as a result of new housing within the established urban area of
                          Concord and new housing on the Concord Reuse Project (CRP) site.
                          Schools in older parts of Concord generally have capacity to absorb
                          expected growth, although there may be localized space shortages.
                          On the CRP site, new schools will be needed to accommodate
                          projected student growth and to meet the Area Plan’s objectives for
                          conveniently located public facilities.
                          An analysis conducted as part of the General Plan update indicated
                          the capacity for 5,510 additional housing units in the urbanized area
                          (excluding the CRP Area). Assuming these units mirror the existing
                          housing mix in Concord (which is 60% single family and 40%
                          multi-family and other), this development would generate about
                          2,472 students. Adding in the 12,200 units expected at the CRP site
                          (which will include a larger percentage of multi-family units) would
                          generate an additional 4,360 students. Thus, the total increase in
                          citywide school enrollment would be approximately 6,831 students.
                          School age population and school needs are detailed in Table 8-2
                          and Table 8-3.
                          Planned Facilities
                          Given the limited amount of suitable vacant land available within
                          the built City and the fact that most schools have sufficient capacity
                          to absorb projected growth, no new sites for school facilities are
                          proposed within the existing urbanized area. Up to six new schools
                          are planned for the Concord Reuse Project (CRP) site, including
                          four elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school. Sites
                          for these campuses are not shown on the General Plan Diagram or
                          the Area Plan, but will be identified as part of the more detailed
                          planning to be undertaken for the CRP site. The number of new
                          schools may be refined in the future depending on actual student
                          generation and on the available capacity at existing schools near the
                          CRP Area.

(*) Although there is no shortage of school space within the existing urbanized area on a citywide level, it is possible that
individual schools could require additional capacity as a result of localized growth in the next 20 years. This is particularly true
at the elementary school level, where some schools are already over capacity. The table assumes students on the CRP site
will only attend new schools to be constructed on the site. These students could also attend existing schools within the
urbanized area, particularly those nearby with excess capacity, thereby lowering the number of new CRP schools.

                           Community Facilities
                          Community facilities are the network of public and private
                          institutions that support the civic and social needs of the population.
                          They offer a variety of recreational, artistic, and educational
                          programs and special events. New community facilities are not
                          specifically sited on the General Plan Urban Area Land Use
                          Diagram. Small-scale facilities are appropriately sited as integral
                          parts of neighborhoods and communities, while existing larger-scale
                          facilities are generally depicted as public/semi-public land use, as
                          appropriate. These facilities in Concord can be grouped into the
                          following categories:
                          •    Community Centers. Facilities designed to meet the needs of
                               the population for civic meetings, recreational activities, social
                               gatherings, and cultural enrichment.
                          •    Museums and Galleries. These facilities house scientific, cultural
                               and historical exhibits or offer space for artistic performances and
                               presentations.
                          •    Civic Buildings. Includes City and County administrative and
                               public buildings.
                          •    Libraries. Facilities in which literary, artistic, and reference
                               materials are kept for public use and circulation. The library in
                               Concord is located at 2900 Salvio St., in Central Concord.
                          •    Private Schools. Facilities that offer instruction to children or
                               adults in exchange for compensation.
                          •    Religious Facilities. Includes houses of worship and other
                               related uses.

8.2      DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL
Drainage
The existing drainage system in Concord is comprised of a network
of storm drains, man-made lakes and detention ponds, improved
channelized creeks and natural creeks.          The City generally
maintains drainage facilities within the public right of way, on
public easements and on property owned in fee by the City.
Components of the drainage system on private property, or within
private drainage easements, are maintained by the underlying
property owner or other private party. In unincorporated areas,
responsibility for storm drain maintenance lies with the Contra
Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District.
Developments have the potential to cause erosion and increase in
sediment and surface water run-off entering the City’s storm
drainage system. In order to minimize these impacts, General Plan
policies focus on requiring future development projects to minimize
runoff into the City’s drainage system, and requiring additional
drainage facilities during the development review process.
Flood Zones
Flood zone mapping by the Federal Emergency Management
Authority (FEMA) indicates that portions of Concord are located
within 100 or 500-year flood zones, which are depicted in Figure 8-
2. Generally, flood-prone areas are located in topographic lows and
in close proximity to shorelines, streams and creeks such as north of
Mallard Reservoir to Suisun Bay, along Pacheco Creek, and near
the Buchanan Field Airport. Flood zone data for the Concord Reuse
Project site is being compiled in 2011. Flood hazards on the site are
generally located along Mount Diablo Creek, which is to be set
aside as an open space corridor as part of the Area Plan. Other
flood hazards on the site will generally be mitigated through
drainage improvements and site planning.
Policies on flooding may be found in the Safety and Noise Element
of the General Plan.

8.3 WATER, WASTEWATER, AND SOLID
WASTE
Water Supply
Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) supplies the City’s water;
CCWD is almost entirely dependent on the Sacramento/San Joaquin
Delta and the United States Bureau of Reclamation’s Central Valley
Project (CVP) for its raw water supply. The City of Concord is
supplied from the Bollman Water Treatment Plant (WTP), located
in North Concord. CCWD does not envision any constraints to
providing water to new developments in the built-out parts of the
City, as long as such developments are not anomalies in terms of
typical water use. The CCWD was consulted in the planning of the
Concord Reuse Project, and has indicated it has sufficient capacity
to serve the development. The future need for water to serve the
CRP Area will be reduced through conservation measures and the
extensive use of reclaimed water for landscape irrigation.
Wastewater Systems
The City is responsible for most of the wastewater collection
system, while treatment service is provided by the Central Contra
Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD). CCCSD has sufficient existing
infrastructure capacity to provide wastewater treatment service to
additional, planned development that could be served by the City of
Concord’s system. CCCSD’s effluent discharge limit should be
sufficient to accommodate wastewater expected to be
generated from currently planned growth within the Central
service area. However, the addition of the Concord Reuse Project
could eventually require an amendment to the National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to reflect higher
effluent volumes. New wastewater collection lines will be needed
to serve the Reuse Project, and improvements to transmission mains
and pumping stations in North Concord may also be needed.
A growing percentage of the wastewater received at the CCCSD
treatment plant is treated to a level high enough to enable its reuse
for irrigation and other non-potable purposes within the service
area. In 2009, about 200 million gallons a year were treated at the
plant and then recycled via a network of transmission facilities
serving golf courses, parks, and other landscaped areas. A
reclaimed water system is planned for the Concord Reuse Project
site, substantially reducing its per capita potable water needs.
CCCSD is exploring other ways to expand the use of reclaimed
                                                                8-11

                                   Franchised solid waste collection and disposal services in Concord
                                   are provided by Concord Disposal Service (CDS). CDS also
                                   provides recycling services to the City. Working with CDS, the City
                                   has developed several programs to encourage recycling and reuse in
                                   Concord. In addition to curbside recycling, the City provides
                                   options for recycling additional materials such as construction
                                   debris, household hazardous waste, electronic devices, and motor
                                   oil. Programs such as these have led to an increase in the amount of
                                   the City’s solid waste that is diverted from landfills (see Table 8-4).

8.4     GOALS, PRINCIPLES, AND POLICIES
G O AL P F - 1 : AV AI L AB IL IT Y O F AD E Q U AT E PU BL IC
                 UT IL IT I E S
Principle PF-1.1:    Provide a Safe and Reliable Water Supply.
Policy PF-1.1.1:     Coordinate with the Contra Costa Water
                     District (CCWD) to provide an adequate and
                     safe water supply.
                     The City will work with CCWD to ensure that
                     adequate water supply, quality, and
                     distribution infrastructure will be available
                     before permitting new development, and to
                     ensure that new development participates in
                     the improvement of water systems.
Policy PF-1.1.2:     Encourage water conservation through City
                     programs and cooperation with the CCWD.
                     Conservation measures include the use of
                     water-efficient plumbing fixtures, drought-
                     tolerant landscaping, and the use of rain
                     barrels to collect water for gardening and
                     landscaping. Many of these measures are
                     being incorporated into the Concord Reuse
                     Project to reduce its impact on the city’s water
                     needs.
Policy PF-1.1.3:     Coordinate with the San Francisco Bay
                     Regional Water Quality Control Board to
                     provide for the implementation of Storm
                     Water Management Programs intended to
                     protect receiving water sources from
                     pollutants.
Principle PF-1.2:    Ensure Public Health and Safety by
                     Providing         Effective        Wastewater
                     Collection and Treatment.
Policy PF-1.2.1:     Operate and maintain the City-owned
                     wastewater collection system, including the
                     transfer of wastewater to Central Contra Costa
                     Sanitary District for treatment and disposal.
                                                                 8-13

Concord 2030 General Plan
                                            The City will work with CCCSD and other
                                            appropriate agencies to ensure that adequate
                                            and permanent sewer collection, transfer, and
                                            treatment facilities will be adequate to serve
                                            existing and future residents, and to ensure
                                            that new development participates in the
                                            improvement of wastewater systems.
                          Policy PF-1.2.2:  Reduce the need for sewer system
                                            improvements by requiring new development
                                            to incorporate water conservation measures.
                          Policy PF-1.2.3:  Cooperate with Central Contra Costa Sanitary
                                            District and other service providers to develop
                                            a wastewater reclamation program as a
                                            supplement to potable water supplies.
                          Principle PF-1.3: Protect the Community from Adverse
                                            Impacts of Water Runoff.
                          Policy PF-1.3.1:  Require new development to provide any
                                            needed storm drains that are not part of the
                                            City’s master storm drain system and to
                                            incorporate features into site improvement
                                            plans to minimize surface runoff.
                                            Such features may include additional
                                            landscaped areas and/or swales, permeable
                                            paving, parking area design that minimizes
                                            runoff, and stormwater detention basins. The
                                            City complies with a number of Regional
                                            Water Quality Control Board programs to
                                            reduce runoff from these sources, and protect
                                            surface waters from runoff-related pollution.
                          Policy PF-1.3.2:  Schedule master drainage improvement
                                            projects in the Capital Improvement Program.
                          Policy PF-1.3.3:  Maintain master storm drain system maps that
                                            identify locations where easements should be
                                            reserved for the eventual installation of pipes
                                            and structures to ensure appropriate storm
                                            drainage management.
                                            By providing clear guidelines to developers,
                                            the City can minimize costs of storm drainage
                                            improvements and ensure the system works

                     efficiently. This is particularly important on
                     large new development sites such as the
                     Concord Reuse Project.
Policy PF-1.3.4:     Continue the Drainage Area Fee Program to
                     fund master storm drainage improvements.
Policy PF-1.3.5:     Ensure that new development contributes
                     needed drainage improvements in proportion
                     to a project’s impacts, to assure an equitable
                     distribution of costs to construct and maintain
                     the City’s master storm drainage system.
Additional policies dealing with flood hazards, including AB 162
compliance, can be found in the Safety and Noise Element.
Principle PF-1.4:    Ensure Access to Utility Systems.
Policy PF-1.4.1:     Require new development to coordinate with
                     all utility providers to assure quality services
                     to all residents and businesses throughout the
                     community.
Policy PF-1.4.2:     Conduct infrastructure planning for the
                     Concord Reuse Project as part of subsequent
                     planning activities for the site, including the
                     preparation of specific plans or equivalent
                     documents.
Principle PF-1.5:    Continue Solid Waste Reduction                and
                     Recycling Efforts.
Policy PF-1.5.1:     Expand reduction and recycling efforts within
                     the City to divert increasingly larger portions
                     of the waste stream from local landfills.
                     The City diverts approximately 60 percent of
                     potential landfill material by utilizing a
                     variety of programs, such as curbside
                     recycling, recycling of debris from
                     construction sites, back yard composting, and
                     recycling of green waste and tires. The
                     Concord Reuse Project provides an
                     opportunity to increase the diversion rate
                     even more by incorporating best practices in
                     community design and construction.
                                                                 8-15

Concord 2030 General Plan
                          Policy PF-1.5.2:     Promote the importance of recycling industrial
                                               and construction wastes.
                                               Industrial and commercial uses create
                                               significantly higher waste streams than do
                                               residential uses. The diversion of recyclable
                                               materials from commercial and industrial
                                               uses would greatly reduce the waste tonnage
                                               sent to local landfills each day. Recycling of
                                               construction and demolition debris can also
                                               reduce landfill needs.
                          Policy PF-1.5.3:     Prepare informational handouts and web-based
                                               materials      for    the    public    regarding
                                               opportunities to reduce waste at homes and
                                               businesses, as well as methods for safe
                                               disposal of hazardous materials.
                          Policy PF-1.5.4:     Require builders to incorporate adequate
                                               storage areas appropriately screened from the
                                               street for recyclables into new multifamily,
                                               commercial, and industrial structures.

                          Principle PF-2.1:    Facilitate Educational Programs and
                                               Development of Facilities that Meet the
                                               Needs of the Community.
                          Policy PF-2.1.1:     Maintain        and     improve      educational
                                               opportunities in Concord through cooperation
                                               with the Mt. Diablo Unified School District
                                               (MDUSD), private schools, California State
                                               University, community organizations, and the
                                               Contra Costa County library system.
                          Policy PF-2.1.2:     Work cooperatively with the MDUSD to
                                               ensure that sufficient land is identified and
                                               reserved to accommodate projected growth in
                                               the community.
                                               The City is committed to facilitate school
                                               district planning and ensure that adequate
                                               facilities are available and conveniently
                                               located to serve existing and future residents.
                                               New development will be required to provide

                 necessary funding and/or capital facilities, as
                 determined by the MDUSD.
Policy PF-2.1.3: Cooperate with the MDUSD in planning for
                 new school sites and facilities and coordinate
                 infrastructure improvements to ensure
                 compatibility with City plans.
Policy PF-2.1.4: Work with the MDUSD to explore solutions to
                 capacity problems at those schools where
                 capacity is currently exceeded, and at schools
                 where capacity may be exceeded in the future
                 due to nearby growth.
                 These solutions could include expansion of
                 existing school buildings (using school impact
                 fees), the use of portable classrooms,
                 adjustment of school service area boundaries,
                 reassignment of grades to different schools,
                 and other measures intended to distribute
                 enrollment more evenly and reduce
                 overcrowding.
Policy PF-2.1.4: Continue to partner with the MDUSD to
                 optimize the joint use of school facilities for
                 community use.
                 School playgrounds and grass fields offer
                 excellent opportunities for use by the City
                 during off-school hours to accommodate City-
                 sponsored athletic clubs and the needs of
                 after-school programs. Other school facilities
                 that could be used by the City include
                 auditoriums or cafeterias to host community
                 meetings.
Policy PF-2.1.5: Encourage the establishment of vocational
                 school and other training programs to prepare
                 Concord’s citizens for employment, in
                 addition      to      traditional     educational
                 opportunities.
Policy PF-2.1.6: Develop additional schools, community
                 centers, and other community facilities on the
                 Concord Reuse Project (CRP) site.

Concord 2030 General Plan
                                            New community facilities are planned on the
                                            CRP site to serve those who will live and work
                                            there. The site also offers opportunities for
                                            new facilities which serve residents from other
                                            parts of Concord. Some community facilities
                                            may be publicly owned while others may be
                                            privately owned but open to the public.
                          Principle PF-2.2: Support the provision of library and
                                            childcare services.
                          Policy PF-2.2.1:  Pursue planning and development for new
                                            library facilities and services.
                                            The City will coordinate planning for library
                                            facilities and services with key stakeholders.
                                            Adequate funding for construction and
                                            operations will need to be assured to avoid
                                            any adverse impacts on library operations.
                          Policy PF-2.2.2:  Support the provision of internet service and
                                            other technology through public/private
                                            partnerships to supplement the traditional
                                            library reference and lending services that are
                                            available to the community.
                                            Many high technology companies have grant
                                            programs or special equipment or software
                                            pricing for libraries, and foundations also
                                            have grant programs for libraries.
                          Policy PF-2.2.3:  Continue to respond to the growing need for
                                            child care facilities and programs as a result of
                                            new residential, office, commercial, and
                                            industrial development, and allow child care
                                            facilities in all zoning districts, except for
                                            Downtown Pedestrian and Heavy Industrial
                                            areas.
                          Policy PF-2.2.4:  Encourage the use of public and private
                                            facilities, schools, churches, community
                                            centers, and spaces within other facilities for
                                            child and adult care services.
                          Policy PF-2.2.5:  Participate in efforts to coordinate child care
                                            programs to meet child care needs throughout
                                            the City.

Principle PF-2.3: Foster arts and entertainment.
Policy PF-2.3.1:  Expand Concord’s role as a regional
                  entertainment center and encourage the
                  creation and expansion of visual and
                  performing arts programs.
Principle PF-2.4: Ensure environmental justice in providing
                  public facilities and services.
Policy PF-2.4.1:  Plan for the equitable distribution of new
                  public facilities while avoiding over
                  concentration of such facilities in one area.
                  The City will work with other public agencies
                  and non-profit organizations to create and
                  expand opportunities, programs, and services
                  for persons with special needs in a manner
                  that enhances the community’s quality of life.
                                                              8-19
