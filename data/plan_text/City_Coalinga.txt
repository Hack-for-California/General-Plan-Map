       GENERAL PLAN
              OVERVIEW
This section sets the stage for the 2025 General Plan Update, providing a brief overview of
Coalinga’s history, the General Plan Update and discussing the legal framework and requirements
of a General Plan.
COALINGA’S HISTORY
For many centuries numerous tribes of Indians, all belonging to the Yokut, inhabited the San
Joaquin Valley. Although it is not clear when the first people made their way to Coalinga, it is
known that the Tache (Tachi) one of the largest of all the Yukot tribes, found a permanent water
supply at a place called Posa Chanet near the City’s present site. From this encampment, they
scoured the hills for trade goods. They discovered oil seeps and thick tar. Oil was to be an
important item to early inhabitants of the Pleasant Valley. Seepages in the area provided asphalt
used to line baskets and was a good traded among other tribes. Eventually, Spaniards and Basques
who wanted the land for its cattle and sheep grazing potential displaced the Indians.
As new settlers came to the west seeking a new life and greater opportunities, interest in oil
seepages inspired an “oil rush” to the area in 1865. In 1867 a specialized oil-drilling rig, shipped
from the east coast, began drilling for oil north of the present site of Coalinga. However, shipping
problems caused early interest to die down; the world had not yet discovered the full potential of
petroleum.
In the late 1800’s, stories of sheepherders who burned rocks at night to keep warm drew the
attention of Messer’s Robins and Rollins, English second sons. Excited by the promise of coal in
the area, they established a mine in a slash of hillside where the Coalinga Rifle Range now exists.
From the first, it wasn’t profitable. The coal was actually an oil soaked rock called shale,
producing two scoops of ash for every one burned. However, the potential of coal from the mine
and more in nearby Priest Valley was enough to induce the Southern Pacific (SP) Railroad to
extend its frost-free southern route. It crossed Huron and stretched slightly beyond the Coalinga
area to a place called Alcalde.

Chapter 1- General Plan Overview
There is debate about how Coalinga got its name. The usual version is that while deposits of oil
saturated shale or "coal" in the hills nearby were being mined “Coaling Station A” “Coaling
Station B” and “Coaling Station C” were situated along the rail line for loading purposes. “Coaling
Station A” was eventually shortened to “Coalinga.” This story does not stand close scrutiny and a
more likely explanation is that Coalinga was given the final “a” for musical effect. The truth may
never be known, since the great quake and fire in San Francisco in 1906 destroyed the SP
Railroads office and all its records. Whatever the origin, it is known that the name “Coalinga” was
in use fairly quickly after the rail line opened in July 1988. On October 5, 1888 The Railroad
Gazette announced: "The extension west from Huron in Fresno County, Cal., has been completed
for about 21 miles. A new town called "Coalinga" has been laid out at the end of the track.”
The extension of the railroad coincided with a significant worldwide interest in oil production; the
second oil rush of 1890. By 1910, Coalinga was the third largest shipping point for the railroad in
California with nearly all tonnage connected to oil production.
The town grew quickly during these years. In 1889 the Coalinga post office was established. In
1891 Southern Pacific Railroad purchased the 160-acre homestead of M. L. Curtis for the sum of
$900 and laid out the town site of Coalinga as a square cut diagonally by the railroad tracks.
Street numbers from one to eight went north to south, and letters A to H from west to east. The
Coalinga Women’s Improvement Society later changed the alphabetical names to botanical ones.
A succession of historically important wells, starting from the discovery well called “Blue Goose”
in 1897, was developed. This and subsequent discoveries brought “boomers” into Coalinga by
the thousands.
With over 15 years of continuous prosperity behind them, a handful of local citizens began the
process of incorporation, which was completed in April 1906. In 1909, the Coalinga Chamber of
Commerce was organized and in its first report dated April 16, 1910, they excitedly spoke about
the promise of the City. The Coalinga oil field was the largest in California. In September 1909,
the Silver Tip well, locate just one-half mile from the City limits, blew with the greatest gusher
known in California at that time. This discovery caused enough excitement among the financiers
of California that the Los Angeles Stock Exchange was closed on a Friday in November and a
special excursion train traveled to Coalinga so that potential investors could marvel at the sight.
During the early years of production, several important developments happened in Coalinga. In
1904 a six-inch oil pipeline was laid from Coalinga all the way to Monterey on the coast (104
miles) for the purposes of providing tanker oil to be sold to overseas buyers. The pipeline was
built in 90 days, and crossed two mountain ranges with a maximum elevation of over 2,000 feet.
In 1916, Coalinga oilfield workers fought for and won the industry’s first 8-hour workday. In
1919 A&W Root Beer was formulated in downtown Coalinga. During World War II, Signal Hill
oil in Long Beach was brought in. The supply was so great that the existing pipeline flow from
Coalinga to the Los Angeles refineries was reversed and the excess Signal Hill oil was stored in a
massive tank farm called Caliola about 10 miles east of Coalinga. Coalinga’s oil field was to
produce men and companies who were to become some of the giants of the industry including R.

C. Baker, founder of Baker Oil Tools. His original buildings in Coalinga are now home of the R.
C. Baker Memorial Museum. It focuses not only on oil, but all phases of pioneer life in the
Coalinga area.
In those early days, there was no one to provide natural gas to customers in Coalinga. The City
simply contracted with nearby oil companies to supply natural gas from their wells, which was
then re-sold to City residents. To this day, Coalinga is one of just a handful of cities to operate this
utility. Natural gas is currently purchased from major suppliers for residents.
From the outset, it was said that whiskey was easier to get than water in Coalinga. The natural
well water supplies had high amounts of dissolved minerals in it, making it suitable for only the
most basic uses of washing and irrigating. To meet this challenge, Coalinga’s drinking water was
imported. Until 1960, the major source of drinking water was water wells in Armona owned by
Southern Pacific. This water was shipped, 44 miles, to Coalinga in tank cars for distribution. “A
dime a bucket, and carry it yourself” was the cry. In time, a municipal water service was provided
for the central area of town, leading to Coalinga’s famous third faucet (hot, cold and drinking).
In 1960 Coalinga was the site selected for experimental systems to soften hard water to a point
where it was palatable for human consumption. The first of these was an ionic system that was
later replaced by the reverse osmosis method. The third faucet was utilized until April 1972 when
Coalinga received its first delivery of San Luis Canal water from the state water system.
While oil was the staple of the local economy, agriculture always played an important part. Before
1972 agriculture was limited to cotton and other salt water resistant crops. With the arrival of
canal water, the area has become a region of specialty crops including lettuce, tomatoes,
asparagus and a variety of nut and fruit trees.
On May 2, 1983 a magnitude 6.7 earthquake hit Coalinga. Buildings constructed from bricks
from the 1906 San Francisco quake, toppled. Houses slipped off their raised foundations,
chimneys fell and a significant portion of the business district was leveled. The quake caused over
$31 million in damage and the City was left with numerous vacant parcels and city-owned lots.
Miraculously, there was not a single fatality from the quake, marking it for all time as “the miracle
of Coalinga.”
While there was open speculation Coalinga would not survive the disaster, the earthquake
became the catalyst that inspired revitalization. In 1988, to replace the one destroyed in the
earthquake, the residents approved a bond issue for a new $14 million community hospital
facility. Coalinga completed an 800-acre annexation to include Pleasant Valley State Prison and
the new airport in the City Limits in 1991. In 1994, the Department of Corrections located a
major prison facility in Pleasant Valley. With this as an economic base, the City developed a 40-
acre industrial park. To address concerns about proximity to schools and associated noise
hazards, the airport was relocated four miles to the east. A brand new $8 million airport facility,
with a 100’ by 5,000’ runway, was built in 1996. In 2001 the College Farms, a 180-acre site

site has since been optioned to be sold to a developer. The Coalinga Regional Medical Center
was completed in 2002 and construction of a new mental health facility, the Coalinga State
Hospital, was completed in the Spring of 2005. Both the Unified School District and West Hills
College have passed bond measures. In the oilfields, a process of steam injection promises to
produce 2.3 billion more barrels of oil, perhaps as much as has already been mined.
Since the 1983 earthquake, significant efforts have been made to rebuild and revitalize this City.
These efforts, combined with Coalinga’s central geographic location and proximity to the busy I-5
corridor, approximately 12 miles to the east, are expected to diversify the City’s economy as state
growth continues. As the City celebrates its centennial, it is clear that Coalinga is more than “the
boom town that lived” it is “the boom town that thrives.”
                                                  2025 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
                                                  The Coalinga General Plan underwent a thorough
                                                  update in 1994.        The 2025 update has been
                                                  prompted by growth pressure outside the City’s
                                                  northern corporate limits and Sphere of Influence and
                                                  the problematic format of the existing 1994 General
                                                  Plan. The update is necessary to ensure the General
                                                  Plan accurately portrays growth patterns, population
                                                  figures and land uses in the City.
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The General Plan is predicated on a number of principles adopted by a Joint Planning
Commission/City Council Committee at the start of the General Plan Update process, in May
2002. These principles, intended to help guide the City’s future, include the following:
        Protect City Center: Protect and enhance the Downtown as the City’s commercial, civic,
         cultural and recreational center while acknowledging its historical qualities.
        Encourage Job Growth: Encourage the expansion of existing businesses and actively seek to
         attract industries and businesses that create jobs and generate revenue for the City.
        Support Redevelopment: Support new residential and commercial infill development on
         vacant land within the established City core and encourage re-use or redevelopment of
         underutilized parcels.
        Maintain City Control: Maintain City control of land within, and adjacent to, the City’s
         Sphere of Influence (SOI) through long range planning efforts to expand the SOI and oppose
         urban scale development outside the City limits.

        Support Educational, Medical and Airport Facilities: Encourage, support and expand high
         quality educational, medical and airport facilities needed to meet the needs of the City’s
         expanding resident and tourist population.
        Provide Housing Type Diversity: Provide a diversity of housing types and lot sizes within
         the City to enable citizens from a wide range of economic levels and age groups to live
         within its boundaries.
        Accommodate Growth: Provide an adequate land supply within the Sphere of Influence to
         accommodate a build-out population of by the year 2020.
        Protect Future Urbanization Areas: Identify Future Urban Areas outside the SOI that are
         anticipated for urbanization beyond the 2020 time frame of the current General Plan.
        Promote Smart Growth Objectives: Establish sustainable development guidelines that
         encourage compact neighborhood design which offers a mix of uses within close proximity.
The guiding principles are used as a foundation to establish goals to guide the City’s decision-
making and manage future growth. The goals are accompanied by specific policies, which are
supported by implementation measures incorporated into the City’s annual work programs and
Capital Improvement Program. Based on the adopted Guiding Principles described above, a
number of Community Vision Statements (listed below) defining the values and vision for the
community were developed. The Statements were adopted as part of the City’s Annual Budget
goals for fiscal year 2005-2006 and will be adopted again through 2006-2007.
Coalinga aspires to be a city that:
        Maintains the spectacular view of the valley and surrounding hills that forms the backdrop
         to the community. It preserves its natural beauty, environmental quality, and vital natural
         resources through appropriate stewardship of the land ensuring visual and physical
         harmony between the natural and man-made environment.
        Preserves its general open, rural, low profile, uncrowded character punctuated with ample
         open space, large setbacks, panoramic views and pristine vistas of the surrounding hills.
        Promotes urban design features that provide artful integration of building sites with the
         environment emphasizing earth-tone colors, desert architecture, exterior building materials,
         monument signs, large building setbacks, appropriate landscaping, berms and other
         features that hide or reduce the visibility of negative urban features such as parking lots.
        Includes a variety of residents varied in age, family makeup, income levels, and interests
         who can commonly enjoy the beauty, economic opportunities, recreational activities and
         cultural amenities of the City and surrounding regions.
        Provides choices in housing types and densities in a variety of neighborhoods seamlessly
         integrated and well insulated from high volume roadways, noise, and nonresidential land
         uses. Neighborhoods harmonize and compliment one another through good urban design,

Chapter 1- General Plan Overview
         architectural standards, and landscaping where residents can fulfill their varied individual
         housing needs and dreams of home ownership. Housing fosters a sense of neighborhood
         among residents and a sense of community through landscaped linkages with surrounding
         neighborhoods, parks and pristine areas.
        Provides a practical, landscaped, aesthetically pleasing, and environmentally sensitive
         transportation circulation network that includes roads, bike paths, walkways, and trails that
         are easily accessible and efficiently and safely transport residents and visitors throughout
         the City and surrounding region. The circulation system, especially major corridors, will
         provide panoramic views of the community’s surrounding environment and will avoid
         blocking these views with walls, fences, overhead power lines or other visually negative
         features. The circulation system will be landscaped and will link neighborhoods, parks,
         schools, libraries, shopping areas, topographic features, pristine primitive areas and wildlife
         habitat.
        Views economic development as the sustained creation of community wealth and the
         generation of tax revenues through the retention, expansion, and development of
         diversified business opportunities that are compatible with the environment, community
         values and community vision. Quaint shops, neighborhood commercial developments,
         office developments, light industrial enterprises, restaurants, motels and walking malls are
         in harmony with Coalinga’s small town character, scenic beauty and natural resources
         which are the foundation of its economic strength and quality of life.
        Interacts and works with other governmental entities for the mutual benefit of the City,
         county, region, state and nation.
        Provides creative, orderly, and efficient community facilities and municipal services that
         meet the needs of residents and visitors. Community facilities are sensitively and
         successfully integrated into the natural environment with necessary municipal and public
         utility services including police, fire, emergency medical, water, wastewater, storm water,
         electrical power, natural gas, cable television, communications, library, cemetery, building,
         community development, solid waste and public education services implemented at the
         lowest possible cost.
        Develops a convenient and comprehensive system of neighborhood parks, community
         parks, athletic parks, primitive natural areas, green belts, open space, bike paths, trails,
         scenic vistas and other recreational opportunities that meets the needs of the citizens and
         enriches the lives of residents and visitors. Indoor and outdoor parks and recreation
         facilities that will be adaptable to changes in the population, and provide beauty and
         functional efficiency to complement the City’s natural environment and the needs of its
         citizens.
        Collects, restores, preserves its natural, cultural, and geologic heritage and displays,
         artifacts, histories, maps and structures relating to the early Native American inhabitants,
         pioneer settlers, railroad workers, coal miners and oil workers of Coalinga.

        Provides outstanding cultural activities that serve the entire region and that will touch and
         enrich the lives of citizens and visitors. The arts and the environment play equal and
         complementary roles in realizing a culturally animated future. They act as a stimulus to
         civic pride and involvement and provide vigor and zest to the community’s quality of life.
NATURAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN
In addition to the Guiding Principles described above, the City of Coalinga and the Coalinga-
Huron Unified School District Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan (Ralph Anderson & Associates
2005) identifies a number of goals intended to reduce the impact of natural disasters should they
occur in the future. These goals include:
        Protect Life and Property;
        Public Awareness;
        Partnership and Implementation; and
        Provision of Adequate Emergency Services.
The Plan also outlines action items to implement the goals. The action items are listed as activities
that the City and District can use to reduce risk and include an estimate of the timeline for
implementation.
In November 2005 the City adopted the Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan and authorized the City
to submit the Plan to the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) and Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). The goals and action items put forward in the Natural Hazard
Mitigation Plan have been incorporated into this General Plan update.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
As part of the strategic planning, implementation and evaluation criteria adopted in the City’s
Annual Budget, the City emphasizes the importance of community input in the design-making
process. Community values are an integral component of the planning process. Per the Annual
Budget Plan, community values must be acknowledged, honored and constantly defended to
ensure that change and development occur in accordance with the community vision. The
community values held by the residents, community leaders and elected officials determine the
City’s character, urban design features and ultimately shape the development of the City.
Citizen participation played an important role in preparing the Coalinga 2025 General Plan
Update. Throughout the preparation stage, numerous residents, business owners and various
civic and professional organizations were consulted. Citizens were involved with issue
identification and goal formulation through attendance at the General Plan Update Community
workshops and public hearings.

Chapter 1- General Plan Overview
The Coalinga Planning Commission and City Council played a key role in providing direction
regarding the content of the General Plan. Discussions at public workshops assisted in
identification and refinement of planning issues and development of a preferred land use map.
GENERAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS
A General Plan expresses the community’s goals for the future distribution and character of land
uses and development, both public and private. California planning law requires the City to
prepare and adopt a “comprehensive, long-term General Plan for [its] physical development”
(Government Code §65300). The General Plan is required to be comprehensive in terms of issues
addressed and must include the City’s entire physical planning area. It is required to be long-term
and internally consistent. Toward this end planning activities including zoning approvals and
amendments, subdivision approvals, capital improvements, and redevelopment activities need to
conform to the City’s General Plan. Preparing, adopting, implementing and maintaining a
General Plan serves to:
        Identify the community’s land use, circulation, environmental, and economic goals and
         policies as they relate to land use and development.
        Provide a basis for local government decision-making including decisions on development
         approvals and exactions.
        Provide citizens with opportunities to participate in the planning and decision making
         processes of their community.
        Inform citizens, developers, decision makers, and other cities and counties of the ground
         rules that guide development within the community.
The General Plan bridges the gap between community values, policies, and goals and physical
decisions such as subdivisions, land development and public works. California law (Government
Code §65302) requires the General Plan include a statement of policies for each of the following
elements: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space and Noise and Safety.
The typical content of the required elements are described below:
        Land Use: Designates the general distribution and intensity of land uses, including the
         general location, extent of use, and type of housing, businesses, industry, open space,
         education, public buildings and parks.
        Circulation: Identifies the general location and nature of existing and proposed circulation,
         including roadways (e.g. arterial, collector, and local streets), highways, transit, and other
         transportation facilities and modes.
        Housing: Assesses the current and projected housing needs of all segments of the
         community and identifies land and programs to provide adequate housing to meet those
         needs. The City of Coalinga’s Housing Element was updated separately in 2003 and

         certified by the State in 2004 therefore, has not been included in the 2025 General Plan
         Update process.
        Open Space: Identifies open space resources and provides action programs and techniques
         for preserving open space areas for natural resources, outdoor recreation, public health and
         safety and agricultural activities.
        Conservation: Identifies conservation resources and issues and provides measures for
         conservation, development, and use of natural and cultural resources including creeks,
         sensitive habitat, archaeological resources and historic structures.
        Noise: Identifies and evaluates noise sources in the community and develops methods to
         mitigate existing and foreseeable noise problems.
        Safety: Establishes policies to protect the community from risks associated with seismic,
         geologic, flood and fire hazards.
In addition topics outlined above, recent legislation in the form of Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), the
California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, has prompted the California Attorney General
to send comment letters to local lead agencies regarding the need for analysis of greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG) in General Plans.
Government Code §65301(a) provides that a General Plan may be adopted in any format deemed
appropriate by the legislative body as long as all seven topics are covered. The exception is the
Housing Element, which is required by State guidelines to contain extensive mandatory data and
analysis as well as a five-year plan for meeting housing goals and objectives. In order to minimize
redundancies in the General Plan, combining elements or organizing the plan by issue often
makes sense. General Plans may also include additional, optional topics as necessary to address
local issues relevant to the physical development of the community.
The General Plan is the foundation in the hierarchy of local government law regulating land use.
Subordinate to the General Plan are Specific Plans, Master Plans, and Special Planning Area
projects as well as zoning amendments, subdivision maps, development permits, and other
approvals relating to development of specific properties. These planning and development efforts
must conform to the City’s adopted General Plan.
ORGANIZATION OF THE 2025 COALINGA GENERAL PLAN
The Coalinga General Plan is primarily a policy document. The document addresses the state-
mandated requirements and local issues through inclusion of the following elements: Land Use;
Open Space and Conservation; Circulation; Safety, Air Quality and Noise; and Public Facilities
and Services.
Table 1-1, on the following page, outlines the organization of the General Plan.

provided for each of the elements. The goals represent the ultimate end towards which an effort is
directed and are general in nature with the intention of providing policy direction. The policies
represent an official statement providing more specific direction to guide actions. The
implementation measures are the actions to be fulfilled to achieve the goals and policies.
General Plan Amendments
Recognizing the dynamic nature of the General Plan, state law provides for periodic review of the
document to ensure it is consistent with the conditions, values, expectations and needs of the
community. The General Plan Guidelines state:
         The General Plan is a dynamic document because it is based on community values
         and an understanding of existing and projected conditions and needs, all of which
         continually change. Local governments should plan for change by establishing
         formal procedures for regularly monitoring, reviewing and amending the General
         Plan.
The General Plan will be amended from time to time as City goals become more defined, as they
shift, or as state law dictates. In addition, periodic revision of the Housing Element will reflect

revisions in state requirements. A comprehensive update of the Housing Element is scheduled to
occur every five years. The following process must be followed in reviewing and approving any
proposed General Plan Amendments.
Amendment Applications
Applications to amend the General Plan shall be accompanied by detailed information to
document the scope and impact of the amendment request. This information must include
revised text, tables, and diagrams for all affected elements. For example, a change to the Land
Use Element must include an analysis of impacts to the Housing and Circulation Elements.
Pursuant to the requirements of CEQA, all amendment applications shall include an
environmental initial study and analysis for consistency with the certified General Plan
Environmental Impact Report (GPEIR) and mitigation monitoring program.
Since a significant amount of public resources have been invested in the preparation of the
General Plan and EIR, any proposals to amend the General Plan must document the need for such
changes. The application shall include a discussion of the environmental, economic, or technical
issues that justify the need to amend the General Plan.
Any application to amend the General Plan must be accompanied by studies analyzing the
amendment’s effects, relative to the adopted General Plan and EIR. At a minimum the following
issues must be addressed and supported by studies and/or other factual information in the
application:
     1) The proposed amendment is in the public interest.
     2) The proposed amendment is in conformance with the adopted General Plan goals, policies
         and implementation measures as well as the overall intent of the General Plan.
     3) The proposed amendment is compatible with existing development, neighborhoods, and
         the environment.
     4) The proposed amendment complies with current CEQA requirements.
     5) The proposed amendment is consistent with the adopted EIR and mitigation-monitoring
         program.
Staff Analysis
City staff will review the materials and provide a staff report to the Planning Commission. Staff
may request additional information beyond the studies mentioned above. The staff report will
analyze whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the General Plan and whether the
need to amend the General Plan can be supported by the conclusions and supplemental studies, if
required.

Chapter 1- General Plan Overview
Amendment Cycles
Consistent with California Government Code §65358(b) and Public Resources Code § 30514) no
element of the General Plan shall be amended more than four (4) times per calendar year. Two
cycles of amendments shall be reserved for City use and the remaining two cycles shall be
available for other amendment applications. More than one amendment application may be
considered during a cycle provided it is heard on the same public hearing date. As potentially
applicable to the Coalinga General Plan, this amendment limitation does not apply to:
        Amendments requested and necessary for affordable housing (§ 65358(c))
        Any amendment necessary to comply with a court decision in a case involving the legal
         adequacy of the general plan (§ 65358(d)(1))
        Amendments after January 1, 1984, to bring a general plan into compliance with an airport
         land use plan (§ 65302.3).
        Amendments needed in connection with the adoption of a comprehensive development
         plan under the Urban Development Incentive Act (Health and Safety Code §56032(d)).
Exceptions
Minor adjustments to General Plan boundaries and diagrams may be approved with a simplified
process that does not require additional studies. Minor adjustments include changes that modify
boundaries to follow more logical locations without increasing density or changing entitlements.
For example, a minor adjustment might include moving a land use boundary from one side of the
street to the other or an interpretation of where a land use boundary bisects a property. The City
Council, by resolution, will establish the procedures and rules for this simplified process.
Severability Clause
In the event any goal, policy, or implementation measure or portion of any element of the General
Plan is held invalid or unconstitutional by a California or Federal Court of competent jurisdiction,
such portions shall be deemed separate, distinct, and independent provisions, and the invalidity of
such provisions shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions.

Chapter 1- General Plan Overview
Transportation Control Measures (Transportation Control): As an outgrowth of the Fresno
County Air Quality Attainment Plan, the City of Coalinga is obligated to implement various
transportation control measures which serve to alleviate traffic congestion and reduce
photochemical smog. A number of these measures such as jobs/housing balance
recommendations influence policy direction for the distribution of land uses within the City and
have been included in this General Plan.
Fresno County Congestion Management Plan (Congestion Management): State law requires
Fresno County create a Congestion Management Program (CMP) prior to the County receiving gas
tax monies, made available through Proposition 111. The CMP represents an effort to manage
traffic congestion by coordinating transportation, land use, and air quality programs in Fresno
County. As part of this program, the City of Coalinga is required to adopt their own land use
impact program and establish policies to maintain Level of Service (LOS) standards.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (Seismic Hazards): The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990
calls for the delineation of seismic hazard zones including areas of high potential for liquefaction,
earthquake induced landslides, and other ground failures. The principal role of the State is to
identify seismic hazard study zones. Based on State prepared maps, the local government is
charged with adopting policies to reduce the extent of earthquake damage.
City of Coalinga Emergency Management Plan (Emergency Management): The Emergency
Management Plan provides the basis for disaster response planning in Coalinga. The Plan is
continually updated to address the jurisdiction’s planned response to extraordinary emergency
situations associated with natural disasters, technological incidents, and nuclear defense
operations. Operational data including a listing of resources, key personnel, essential facilities,
contacts, and other data needed for conducting emergency operations are also provided.
Fresno County Hazardous Waste Management Plan (Hazardous Waste): The Hazardous Waste
Management Plan is designed to ensure safe, effective, and economical facilities for the
management of hazardous wastes are available when they are needed. To attain this goal the Plan
establishes goals, policies, and programs to encourage the safe handling, storage, and
transportation of hazardous materials.
Coalinga Regional Plan (Land Use): The Coalinga Regional Plan identifies expectations regarding
development in the southwestern portion of Fresno County, excluding land within the City of
Coalinga.
Coalinga-Huron Parks and Recreation Master Plan (Parks and Recreation): The Parks and
Recreation District Master Plan forms a framework for the future provision and operation of active
and passive parks, pedestrian and bicycle paths, recreation and leisure programs, and community
service facilities which physically relate to parks provisions. This Plan includes two parts: an
inventory of existing recreation facilities in Coalinga and a plan that specifies improvements for
the future operation of each facility. In addition, the Plan includes a summary of proposed
expenditures and available funding sources.

                                                            Chapter 1- General Plan Overview
Community Redevelopment Law (Redevelopment):                 California, through the Community
Redevelopment Law (Health and Safety Code §33000 et. seq.) authorizes a City to form a
redevelopment agency to undertake redevelopment projects to revitalize blighted areas. An
adopted Redevelopment Plan provides additional tools to a City and its agency to effectuate
productive change in blighted areas of the community. These include the use of tax increment,
property acquisition, consolidation of small parcels, joint public-private partnerships, clearance of
land and resale to developers, and relocation of tenants. A minimum of twenty percent of the tax
increment, in most cases, is used for the development of low and moderate-income housing.
The Coalinga Redevelopment Plan was initially developed to help the City rebuild after the 1983
earthquake. The Redevelopment Plan includes a five-year implementation plan; the most recent
update occurred on May 5, 2005. The Redevelopment Plan Area is shown on Figure 1-1.
City/County Tax Sharing Agreement (Annexation and Tax Sharing Agreement)
In 2008, the City of Coalinga, County of Fresno, and Coalinga Redevelopment Agency executed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly share tax revenues resulting from development
annexed into the City after the date of the MOU. The agreement applies to areas identified within
the City’s SOI adopted at the time of execution of the MOU (see Figure 1-1).
The intent of the MOU is to distribute equitably the increased revenues from new development.
The MOU also states the County will: (1) not approve any discretionary development permits for
new urban development within the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) unless that development has
first been referred to the City for annexation, and (2) oppose the creation of new governmental
entities within the City’s SOI. Provisions are made for development in the SOI that are not
annexed to the City; however, development standards comparable to the City’s must be applied to
such development.
The MOU also addresses development for an extensive area outside of the City’s corporate and
adopted SOI boundaries. The City and County agree to consult on any policy changes that may
impact land use or public services in this area. In addition, the City must be given the opportunity
to respond to any land use/service related document before such a document is presented to the
County Planning Commission. The County agrees to solicit comments from the City in the
preparation of any environmental Initial Study undertaken within the area.
Any change in the City’s SOI requires the mutual consent of both the City and the County prior to
submission to LAFCO. The agreement applies only to the areas identified in Map 3 (the City’s
adopted SOI at the time of execution of the MOU) unless and until the parties agree to amend the
MOU.

Chapter 1- General Plan Overview
Environmental Review
Adoption of a General Plan is considered a “project” under CEQA. As such, the potential impacts
of adoption of the General Plan must be identified and analyzed. In conjunction with the
preparation of the General Plan, a GPEIR has been prepared consistent with all CEQA
requirements.
Recent legislation in the form of AB 32 established a requirement for analysis of greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG) in CEQA documents. The California Attorney General in comments to local
agencies has indicated that CEQA documents prepared for General Plans must address climate
change and include mitigation that to offset GHG emissions from the Plan. The City’s intent has
been to create a self-mitigating General Plan. As such, to the greatest extent possible, policies and
programs are incorporated into the General Plan that would reduce potential impacts identified in
the GPEIR to a less than significant level.
Consistent with Section 15152 of the CEQA Guidelines, the Coalinga GPEIR may be used for
“tiering.” Projects determined to be consistent with the General Plan and EIR may incorporate the
relevant analysis, mitigation, and overriding considerations into subsequent EIRs or Negative
Declarations.
Subsequent Actions
Immediately following the adoption of the General Plan, the City will begin the process of
amending the Zoning Ordinance and Map to achieve consistency with the General Plan. The City
will be preparing Downtown Design Guidelines for the Downtown Commercial Overlay District
that will encourage the preservation and re-use of historic buildings in to various commercial and
professional office uses, as well as, the enhanced standards for commercial development along
Coalinga Plaza and Elm Street.

              LAND USE
                 ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Land Use Element is to designate the general distribution, location and
intensity of land use including housing, commercial, business, industry, open space, conservation
areas, recreation areas and public facilities within the City of Coalinga and its future growth area.
The Land Use Diagram, presented in this Element, illustrates this pattern of development
envisioned by the City. Together, the text and land use diagram of this Element provide the
foundation for land use decision making through the year 2025.
The Land Use Element is the broadest of the elements and is the basis for coherent land use policy
development. Goals and policies set forth in the Land Use Element simultaneously shape and
reflect the policies and implementation measures contained in the other General Plan Elements
found in Chapter 3: Open Space and Conservation; Chapter 4: Circulation; Chapter 5: Safety,
Air Quality, and Noise; 6: Public Facilities and Services; and the separate Housing Element.
Although all elements in the General Plan carry equal weight, the Land Use Element is typically
the most referenced and is often perceived as most representative of the “General Plan.” The
Land Use Element provides planners, the general public and decision makers with a long-term
context to help guide short-term actions such as zoning, development proposals and infrastructure
planning. It also outlines strategies for achieving the type of community envisioned by the
community.
ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
This Element is organized into eight main sections described below:
        Introduction. This section includes an overview of the contents of the Land Use Element,
         as discussion of state law requirements and a description of Coalinga’s planning
         boundaries.

         this General Plan Update are summarized within this section.
        Future Growth Under the 2025 General Plan. This section describes the potential growth
         of the community and projects the maximum buildout potential under the proposed land
         use designations.
        Land Use Goals, Policies and Implementation Measures. This section outlines Coalinga’s
         overall land use goals, and the policies and implementation measures designed to attain
         these goals.
REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that a Land Use element be included in a
General Plan and outlines the issues that must be addressed. Consistent with Section 65302(a),
the Land Use Element should address each of the following issues as relevant:
        The distribution of housing, business, and industry;
        The distribution of open space areas, including agriculture;
        The distribution of natural resources;
        The distribution of recreation areas and places of scenic beauty;
        The distribution of educational facilities;
        The distribution of public buildings and grounds;
        The distribution of solid and liquid waste disposal facilities;
        Areas subject to flooding; and
        Other categories of public and private uses of land.
The land use element, as each of the elements in the General Plan, is also required to be fully
integrated and must be consistent with each of the other elements. This Element has been
prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of state law.

PLANNING BOUNDARIES
Land use boundaries have been established with regard to both physical/environmental
constraints and growth projections for the community. Anticipated growth areas are located
primarily between the historic core of the City and the prison and airport sites to the east, as well
as to the northeast along Highway 198, where access to utilities and services is linked directly to
the City. Land west of Coalinga should not be considered a growth area due to a number of
constraints. These growth constraints include: contaminated soils and numerous other
environmental constraints due to oil production; uneven topography which would require
substantial grading; and, limited existing infrastructure.
Boundaries considered in this General Plan Update include: (1) City Limits; (2) Sphere of
Influence (SOI); and, (3) Area of Interest (AOI). Only the land within the existing City Limits
combined with the SOI constitutes Coalinga’s Planning Area for the purposes of this 2025 General
Plan Update. The AOI is identified in the land use maps, but is not anticipated for development
in the 2005-2025 General Plan timeframe. The geographic areas and planning boundaries
considered in the General Plan are described below in Table 2-1 and are illustrated on Figure 2-1,
Planning Boundaries.

City Limits
The City Limits is that area over which the City has direct land use planning and zoning control,
as well as service responsibilities. Approximately 3,848 acres of land lie within the existing
Coalinga City Limits.
Sphere of Influence
The Sphere of Influence (SOI) is a legally defined area established by the Fresno County Local
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) used to designate the future incorporated boundary and
service area for a city or special district within a specific period of time. The City of Coalinga’s

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
General Plan Planning Area includes land within the incorporated City Limits and unincorporated
land within the Sphere of Influence (SOI) surrounding the City. Within the SOI, the municipality is
empowered to plan and annex land for future uses, services and facility improvements. The City
can make recommendations to the County on land use policy within the SOI area; however, the
County has final jurisdiction.
The 1994 SOI encompassed approximately 2,288 acres (3.6 square miles) outside the City Limits.
The City’s currently proposed SOI has been expanded to include an additional 6,301 acres of land
for a total proposed SOI of 8,589 acres (13.4 square miles). This SOI boundary reflects the City’s
calculation of the amount of land needed to accommodate projected growth through the General
Plan’s 2005-2025 timeframe consistent with the goals, policies and implementation measures
presented in this Element. The City expects property and new development within the SOI will
be annexed prior to 2025.
Area of Interest
The Area of Interest (AOI) is an informal designation established by LAFCO, with the assistance of
the City and Fresno County. The AOI is a general area of concern within which planning
decisions and other governmental actions of the County may have an impact on the City of
Coalinga. The AOI provides a linkage among the new airport, prison, Interstate 5 and other areas
in the SOI.
The AOI is much larger than the SOI and is beyond the Planning Area evaluated in this General
Plan. The 1994 AOI encompassed 11,581 acres of land (approximately 18 square miles) that
extended beyond the 1994 SOI. The AOI has been enlarged as part of this Update to include
41,146 acres of land (approximately 64 square miles) that extends beyond the proposed SOI. The
City provides water service to a small portion of the AOI north of the City Limits along Highway
33/198. The County currently has land use and zoning jurisdiction within the AOI. The City
however, may ask Fresno County to provide notification of any land use considerations in this
area.
Future Study Area
The Future Study Area is territory within the AOI that may warrant inclusion in the SOI in future
years. This area has been identified as the probable direction and location of growth beyond the
2005-2025 General Plan timeframe, but prior to 2045. The City does not plan to annex these
properties during the 2005-2025 timeframe; however, these areas should be prioritized for
development during the next General Plan Update Future study would need to be completed
prior to inclusion of these areas in the SOI.

BACKGROUND AND SETTING
The Coalinga General Plan underwent a thorough update in 1994. Currently, the City is
experiencing significant growth pressure within the City Limits as well as outside the City’s
northern cooperate limits and Sphere of Influence. This growth has caused the City to reexamine
the land use patterns and assumptions put forward in the 1994 General Plan. The 2025 Update is
necessary to ensure that the General Plan accurately portrays growth patterns, population figures
and land uses in the City. This section describes the existing land use as put forward in the 1994
General Plan, current growth projections, including proposed development, and the community’s
vision for the future.
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING LAND USE – THE 1994 GENERAL PLAN
The City of Coalinga’s City Limits currently contains approximately 3,812 acres. The City’s land
use designations are illustrated on Figure 2-2 Existing Land Use (1994 General Plan) and are
described below in Table 2-2.

POPULATION AND GROWTH
According to the US Census Bureau, 6,593 persons resided in Coalinga in 1980. By 1990, this
number had risen to 8,212. This represents an average annual growth rate of approximately 2.2%
from 1980 to 1990. Between 1990 and 2000, the annual growth rate was significantly higher,
averaging 3.6% annually, with the population increasing to 11,668 persons in 2000.
The City’s population in 2000 included 805 persons living in group quarters (persons not living in
households). Group quarters include institutions such as correctional facilities, nursing homes

and juvenile institutions. In 2000, the Pleasant Valley State Prison was annexed by the City,
which dramatically increased the population living in group quarters in Coalinga. According to
the State Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, this facility houses approximately 5,188
inmates (2004-2005 fiscal year).
The City of Coalinga continues to grow. It is now estimated that 17,081 people reside in the City,
with 11,217 persons (65.7% of the population) in households and 5,864 persons (34.3%) living in
group quarters. Approximately 3,527 (91%) of the 3,874 households in the City are occupied, for
an average household size of 3.18 persons per unit (Department of Finance 2005). Should the
growth rate continue at a 3 to 4% rate over the next twenty years, as many as 22,188 residents (an
additional 10,971) may be living in the City (not including group quarters) by the year 2025. The
2005-2025 estimated annual growth rate is presented in Table 2-3, below, and graphically
illustrated in Figure 2-3.

There is good reason to believe that Coalinga’s future growth will exceed historic growth rates.
Several development proposals featuring residential components are currently proposed in the
City. Should these developments go forward, 38,858 persons could be added to the City’s
population by 2025 (excluding group quarters). This would increase the current population of
11,217 persons in households (Department of Finance 2005) to 50,075 over a 20-year period.
The City’s population would grow at an average annual rate of approximately 7.8%. These
proposals are shown on Figure 2-4 and described below in Table 2-4.

Population and Growth Assumptions
Certain basic assumptions can be made concerning future growth expectations by utilizing past
development trends, estimated growth rates and current development proposals facing the City.
These basic assumptions include:
        Development projects currently proposed to the City will be completed by 2025. The
         population increase due to currently proposed development would be approximately
         38,858 persons (38,670 persons excluding group quarters) over the next 20 years.

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
        Although much of Coalinga’s projected growth during the 2005-2025 General Plan
         timeframe will be accommodated by current proposals, it is reasonable to assume that
         some additional growth will occur both independent of, and in support of, these
         developments. This General Plan assumes that this growth would be approximately half of
         the historic 3 to 4% growth rate (see Table 2-3 presented earlier), or an increase of 5,486
         persons over 20 years.
        Based on the two assumptions above, growth in Coalinga will result in approximately
         44,156 additional residents (38,670 + 5,486), excluding group quarters, by the year 2025.
        The population per household will continue at approximately 3.0 persons per unit.
        To accommodate the anticipated growth of 44,156 additional residents over 20 years,
         14,719 dwelling units would be required.
        Buildout of reasonably foreseeable development projects (Table 2-4, presented earlier) will
         result in the construction of 12,890 new dwelling units accommodating 38,670 persons
         (excluding group quarters).
        Even with the development of reasonably foreseeable projects, estimated growth would
         require an additional 1,829 dwelling units (14,719 – 12,890) for approximately 5,486
         residents be built in Coalinga over the next twenty years (assuming 3.0 persons per
         household).
        Based on the assumptions above, the population of Coalinga could reach 55,373 residents
         by the year 2025 (11,217 currently living in households + 44,156 additional residents).
        Based on the assumptions above, buildout of reasonably foreseeable development projects
         plus estimated additional annual growth will result in the construction of more than 14,719
         dwelling units (12,890 proposed + 1,829) by the year 2025.
Therefore, the 2025 General Plan Update assumes that the population of Coalinga could reach
55,373 residents (excluding group quarters) by the year 2025. This population growth may be
accompanied by the development of 14,719 additional dwelling units. The 2025 General Plan
Update anticipates the City’s projected level of growth, while avoiding harm to the environment
and improving the overall quality of life in Coalinga, through the following guiding principals:
        Confining growth to areas that create a logical extension of the City and do not result in
         haphazard or scattered leap-frog style development is important to encourage infill type
         development and to establish an effective connection between existing development;
        Planning growth around the City’s established core, enabling the efficient use of existing
         roadway patterns, utility infrastructure, commercial areas, and recreational space; and,
        Accommodating increases in population within a relatively small area as compared to the
         area encompassed in Coalinga’s entire Area of Interest (AOI).
Effects of the anticipated growth are described and have been planned for within each of the
Elements of the General Plan and the General Plan Environmental Impact Report.

COMMUNITY VISION
Citizen participation played an important role in preparing the Coalinga 2025 General Plan
Update. Throughout the preparation stage, numerous residents, business owners and various
civic and professional organizations were involved with issue identification and goal formulation
through attendance at the General Plan Update community workshops and public hearings.
As described in Chapter 1 of this General Plan, a number of Community Vision Statements
defining the values and vision for the community were developed based on the City’s adopted
Guiding Principles. Core values as described in the Community Vision Statements that pertain
most directly to the Land Use Element are summarized below:
        Coalinga preserves its general open, rural, low profile, uncrowded character punctuated
         with ample open space, large setbacks, panoramic views and pristine vistas of the
         surrounding hill ensuring visual and physical harmony between the natural and man-made
         environment.
        Coalinga promotes urban design features that provide artful integration of building sites
         with the environment.
        Coalinga includes a variety of residents varied in age, family makeup, income levels, and
         interests who can commonly enjoy the beauty, economic opportunities, recreational
         activities and cultural amenities of the City and surrounding regions.
        Coalinga provides choices in housing types and densities in a variety of neighborhoods
         seamlessly integrated and well-insulated from high-volume roadways, noise and
         nonresidential land uses.
        Coalinga neighborhoods harmonize and compliment one another through good urban
         design, architectural standards and landscaping.
        Coalinga is a place where residents can fulfill their varied individual housing needs and
         dreams of home ownership.
        Housing in Coalinga fosters a sense of neighborhood among residents and a sense of
         community through landscaped linkages with surrounding neighborhoods, parks and
         pristine areas.
        Economic development in Coalinga is viewed as the sustained creation of community
         wealth and the generation of tax revenues through the retention, expansion and
         development of diversified business opportunities that are compatible with the
         environment, community values and community vision.
        Quaint shops, neighborhood commercial developments, office developments, light
         industrial enterprises, restaurants, motels and walking malls are in harmony with Coalinga’s
         small town character, scenic beauty and natural resources which are the foundation of its
         economic strength and quality of life.

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
        Coalinga interacts and works with other governmental entities for the mutual benefit of the
         City, county, region, state and nation.
Community Vision Statements that are not related to land use are discussed in the appropriate
element of this Update. The values put forward in the Community Vision Statements are
incorporated into the goals, policies and implementation measures of this General Plan.
LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
This section of the Land Use Element describes land use designations used throughout the City of
Coalinga. By defining the various land uses, this portion of the Element provides clear direction
for the various types of potential development that will fulfill Coalinga’s vision for community
growth through 2025.
The designations have also been applied to those lands outside the City Limits, but within the
Area of Interest as a statement of the City’s preferred policy. The geographic distribution of the
various land use designations are shown on Figures 2-5A, Land Use Diagram and 2-5B, Land Use
Diagram – SOI and summarized at the end of this subsection. The classifications of land are
adopted as General Plan policy and are intentionally broad to allow flexibility in project planning.
This also allows more than one zoning district to be consistent within a single designation.
RESIDENTIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
This section provides a description of each of the land use designations that provide for residential
uses including: Residential Ranchette, Residential Estate, Residential Single Family, Residential
Medium Density, Residential High Density and Mixed Use Density ranges have been included for
each designation. Density is calculated on a gross acreage basis unless subject to a Master Plan.
Gross acreage includes all properties designated residential and excludes existing right-of-way and
all non-residential designations. Where a park, trails, common area landscaping, or other facility
of community benefit is provided within a residential designation, the City may approve the
transfer of density to contiguous lands proposed for concurrent development.
Residential Ranchette (RR) – 0 to 0.1 DU/Acre
This designation applies to large-lot developments, with a minimum parcel size of ten (10) acres
and one single-family residence per lot, located north of the developed portions of the community
along Highway 198/33. Equestrian-oriented developments with public linkages to trail systems are
strongly encouraged in this designation. Upon annexation into the City Limits, these areas will be
served by City water; however, in all likelihood they will not be serviced by City sewer.

Residential Estate (RE) – 0.2 to 2.0 DU/Acre
This designation applies to large-lot developments containing one single-family residence per lot.
This designation applies largely to areas to the east and south of developed portions of the City
and is intended to serve as a buffer between higher density urban areas and agricultural lands.
Equestrian-oriented developments with public linkages to trail systems and Urban Ranches, (2.5 -
acre to 5.0-acre lots for one single-family dwellings and out buildings that allow for the
recreational use and keeping of large animals (horses)) are strongly encouraged in this designation.
Clustering development is encouraged in this land use designation to preserve natural features
and/or provide community amenities (including parks and trails).
Residential Single Family (RSF) – 2.1 to 5.0 DU/Acre
This designation applies to traditional single-family detached housing units. Development requires
a full range of urban services and public improvements. Development on large parcels should be
located in areas with minimal environmental constraints. The use of clustering techniques is
encouraged.
Residential Medium Density (RMD) – 5.1 to 15 DU/Acre
This designation applies to higher-density, single-family small-lot subdivisions and a variety of
attached homes intended to meet the needs of “workforce housing.” Homes may be individually
owned or rented. Low and moderate-income housing can be developed at this density with
density bonuses to reduce housing costs. Common amenities such as pools, landscaping, tot lots,
trails and open space should be included.
Residential High Density (RHD) – 15.1 to 25.0 DU/Acre
Higher density multi-family structures, including condominiums and apartments, are allowed in
this designation. Low and moderate-income housing can be developed at this density with
density bonuses to reduce housing costs. Common amenities such as pools, landscaping, tot lots,
trails and open space should be included.
Mixed Use (MX) – 0.0 to 15.0 DU/Acre
This designation encourages a mix of residential and commercial uses. Commercial uses should
be primarily retail or office in nature. This designation typically applies to urbanized portions of
the community as well as infill and redevelopment projects.
All uses allowed in the Commercial General (CG) and Commercial Service (CS) designations are
allowed in the MX designation. Exclusive residential development and mixed-use
residential/commercial development are subject to the Planned Development Combining
Designation (P-D) zoning requirements. Residential uses on a given parcel must not exceed 15
dwelling units/gross acre as described under the RMD General Plan designation.

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
COMMERCIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
This section provides a description of each of the official commercial land use designations.
Commercial General (CG)
The Commercial General land use designation indicates areas of concentrated retail, generally
located adjacent to major streets, such as Elm Avenue at Polk Street. The CG designation permits
food, drug, clothing and other retail uses and services including small restaurants, laundry outlets
among other services. Hotels, motels, and medical and professional offices are permitted in CG
areas, subject to zoning regulations.
Commercial Service (CS)
The Commercial Service land use designation allows a full range of retail and service uses that
usually require a single-purpose trip to visit one commercial establishment. Repair facilities,
building       materials,        industrial suppliers,  auto   and     accessory     dealers,      light
manufacturing/distributing, and wholesale and/or retail outlets are permitted in this designation.
OTHER DESIGNATIONS
This section provides a description of each of the official non-residential and non-commercial land
use designations. These designations are intended to concentrate businesses, industries and
services in appropriate locations that serve the community, rely on existing infrastructure, and
protect residential neighborhoods. Site-specific zoning requirements are often required to mitigate
impacts associated with these high intensity uses.
Manufacturing/Business (MB)
Large and small-scale businesses involved in manufacturing, distribution or services fall within this
designation. City zoning regulations establish light and heavy manufacturing uses covered in this
designation. Office/manufacturing “condominiums” and wholesale-to-the-public outlets are
allowed in the MB designation.
Public Facilities (PF)
The Public Facilities land use designation includes City, County and other government agency
properties including the post office, Civic Center, public schools, public playgrounds and fire
stations. Public utility right-of-ways are also included.
Recreation (REC)
The Recreation land use designation applies to public and private recreational facilities including
public parks, golf courses and equestrian centers.

Open Space/Conservation (OS)
Properties with significant wildlife or habitat value or areas that have considerable physical
constraints included in this designation are: Floodway or floodplains; fault rupture hazard areas;
unstable geologic or soils conditions; hazardous materials; and wildlife corridors or habitat areas.
Residential uses are generally not allowed in the Open Space/Conservation land use designation.
However, if all other economic uses are infeasible then one single-family residence may be
allowed, subject to City Council approval. No commercial uses, except equestrian boarding,
equestrian training and limited agricultural uses, are allowed within this designation. Passive
recreational uses, including bicycle and hiking trails, are highly encouraged.
Agriculture (AG)
This designation is designed for intensive agricultural and related uses. Development density is
one (1) home per twenty (20) gross acres.

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS
In addition to the land use designations described above, Coalinga recognizes that certain
geographic areas within and around the City merit special consideration. The establishment of
Special Planning Areas provides additional direction for the development of these lands. Most of
the Special Planning Areas described below are identified as “overlay” designations on the Land
Use Map to acknowledge the need for additional land use regulation over and beyond what is
provided for by the underlying land use designation. Lands within the overlay designation would
adhere to the regulations of both the underlying designation as well as the overlay designation.
Special Planning Areas subject to overlay designations are described in this subsection.
Additional Special Planning Areas, which warrant special consideration but are not subject to a
Land Use Overlay designation, are also described.
Areas with overlay designations, and additional planning areas that are not subject to overlay
designations are illustrates and summarized at the end of this subsection.
MIXED-USE PLANNING AREAS
Master Plan Growth Overlay
New large-scale development (twenty acres or more) located outside the historical core and
within a Master Plan Growth Area, is required to be master planned through the Specific Plan or
Planned Development Combining Designation (P-D) process. Master planning these areas will
ensure the provision of utilities, parks, roadways and other public facilities. The master planning
of these areas is addressed in a comprehensive fashion in this General Plan. Two Master Plan
Growth Areas have been identified thus far. Land use designations have been approximated for
these areas. Urban development is expected to occur in these areas during the 20-year planning
period.
Downtown Mixed Use Overlay
Coalinga’s Downtown Area generally includes the square shaped area between Van Ness Street to
the north, Polk Street to the south, Sunset Street to the west and Hayes Street to the east. This area
is bisected by Highway 33 and is considered to be the historic commercial core of the city. A mix
of retail, service, office and government uses have grown along the Highway forming a
commercial spine through the Downtown. The concentrated mix of services has allowed this
portion of the Downtown to evolve into a pedestrian-orientated focal point of the City.
This area has its own unique characteristics that require individualized development parameters.
The specialized development procedures will serve to preserve the integrity of Coalinga’s central
Downtown, while encouraging its continued vitality and economic strength.
The underlying General Plan designations include Public Facility, Commercial and Residential.
The City supports an intensification of both commercial and residential uses within the Downtown

Mixed-Use Area. Projects that combine residential and commercial uses have the advantage of
presenting street level shopping and services, while increasing the general activity in the
Downtown through upstairs residences. Design guidelines for the Downtown area currently
being drafted by the City and area anticipated for completion in early 2007. Other mixed-use
development requirements will be adopted when the zoning ordinance is updated.
Airport Master Plan Area
The Airport Master Plan (2005) for the Coalinga Municipal Airport (herein; referred to as the
“Airport”) was initiated in order to determine the type and extent of aviation facilities needed at
the Airport through the year 2025 and to accommodate the required development. The Airport is
located four miles east-northeast from the center of the City of Coalinga in the southwest portion
of Fresno County, and is located on about 1,002 acres of land at an elevation of 622 feet above
mean sea level.
GATEWAY PLANNING AREAS
Gateway Overlay
Areas that serve as the northern and southern entrances to the City serve as “gateways” to the
community. These areas should be aesthetically attractive and designed to provide welcoming
entrances to the City. Prior to adoption of the General Plan, the City shall apply the Gateway
Overlay designation to the easternmost portions of Phelps Avenue adjacent to the Airport and
proposed residential zone, and Jayne Avenue from Calaveras Avenue to San Joaquin Avenue. The
Gateway Overlay is intended to require the provision of pleasing signage or monumentation,
attractive landscaping and greater attention to building design. Gateway design should reflect and
reinforce Coalinga’s history and community character. Agricultural Areas
AGRICULTURAL AREAS
Agricultural Conservation Overlay
The Agricultural Conservation Overlay Designation applies to the area north of the proposed
wastewater treatment site. Urban development in this area discouraged.
NATURAL RESOURCE PLANNING AREAS
Flood Hazard Overlay
The Flood Hazard Overlay Designation applies to land within the 100-year floodplain of Los
Gatos Creek and Warthan Creek. Land within the floodplain is typically designated Open Space
and is subject to the City Floodplain Management Ordinance. Development within the Flood
Hazard Overlay should be limited to multi-use trails and passive recreation uses. A limited
amount of development may be allowed in the Flood Hazard Overlay, subject to the Floodplain
Management Ordinance.

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
Resource Extraction Overlay
The Resource Extraction Overlay designation applies to land involved in natural resource
extraction including oil production and quarrying. Urban development in these areas should be
limited to compatible industrial uses. Residential uses are highly discouraged in these areas.
Summary
Table 2-6, below, summarizes the acreages of the various land uses in combination with the

OTHER SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS (NOT SUBJECT TO OVERLAY DESIGNATION)
Special Planning areas subject to overlay designations are described previously in this Element.
Additional Special Planning Areas, which warrant special consideration but are not subject to a
Land Use Overlay designation, are described below.
Future Industrial Planning Areas (North and South areas)
Industrially designated areas are an essential part of a growing community. As reflected in several
goals and policies included in this Chapter, industrial areas are needed in order to provide a stable
economy including the provision of job opportunities without compromising community
character.
Draft Coalinga Habitat Conservation Plan (CHCP)
Certain areas within the existing City limits and proposed SOI provide habitat for various federally
and state listed species. These areas were identified the in the Draft Coalinga Habitat
Conservation Plan, prepared in 2005. The intent of the CHCP is to provide strategies for species
and habitat conservation, while allowing for continued development.
Under Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act, a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) accompanies
an incidental take permit for non-Federal activities that will result in “take” of federally threatened
or endangered wildlife. An adopted HCP would allow for streamlined permitting at the local level,
sharing of costs among participants, and conservation and stewardship of sensitive biotic
resources.
The proposed General Plan includes policies requiring the City to coordinate with appropriate
agencies to complete the CHCP process once the General Plan has been approved. As approval
of the CHCP may be many years off, the General Plan includes some strategies put forward in the
Draft CHCP, as appropriate and consistent with community and City direction, to provide
guidance to the City in the interim.
Redevelopment Project Area
The Redevelopment Project Area is that area over which the City’s Redevelopment Agency has
the authority to undertake redevelopment projects to revitalize blighted areas.
Tax Sharing Agreement Area
The Tax Sharing Agreement Area is addressed in the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between the City of Coalinga, County of Fresno and Coalinga Redevelopment Agency.
The Tax Sharing Agreement Area is that area over which the entities have agreed to jointly share
tax revenues resulting from development in areas annexed into the City after the date of the MOU.
This area is consistent with the 1994 SOI adopted at the time of execution of the MOU.

ZONING CLASSIFICATIONS
Table 2-7 establishes the corresponding Zoning Classifications consistent with the General Plan
land use designations. As described above, the General Plan designations are intentionally broad
which allows for more than one zoning district to be consistent within a single land use
designation.

SUMMARY OF LAND USE CHANGES
A number of land use designation changes have been incorporated into the 2025 General Plan
Update. Land use designations and abbreviations have been modified for ease of use. A new
Residential High Density designation has been added. Acreages of most land use categories
increased although Residential Family and Agricultural areas decreased significantly. Land uses
changes within the planning area are summarized in Table 2-8 below. A summary of specific
land use changes follows the table.

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
Specific land use changes as depicted in Table 2-8, above, include the following:
        A new Residential Ranchette (RR) land use designation has been applied to lots south of
         Phelps toward the eastern edge of the proposed SOI. This area was not previously
         considered in the General Plan.
        The Residential Multi-Family - Low Density RML (RMD) category has been eliminated and
         much of this has been redesignated as Residential Multi-Family- Medium Density RML
         (RMD).
        Residential Single Family (RSF) lands have increased slightly as the SOI has been expanded
         with residential uses. Within the previous Planning Area, some areas south of Jayne
         Avenue previously identified as RSF have been designated to Open Space (OS) and Public
         Facilities (PF).
        Commercial Services (CS) have increased five-fold primarily as a result of re-designating
         Commercial General (CG) land within and south of the Downtown core. In addition, 22
         acres of residential land along Jayne Avenue towards the eastern extents of the City and 22
         acres of agricultural land along Highway 33 in the northern extent of the City was also re-
         designated.
        Manufacturing/Business areas have nearly increased ten times primarily due to the growth
         of the SOI and the designation as MB within this area particularly to the north and east of
         the City.
        Agricultural (AG) lands have decreased as a result of converting the sports complex on the
         north side of Cambridge to Recreation (REC), land north of the City Limits along the
         Highway 198/33 Corridor to Manufacturing/Business.
FUTURE GROWTH
The General Plan establishes general uses and densities of land within the City. From the Land
Use Diagram, presented earlier as Figures 2-5A and B, and the acreages as presented earlier in
Tables 2-5 and 2-6, it is possible to estimate the maximum population, number of new homes,
and acreages of non-residential uses that could result from the General Plan buildout within the
City and within the Planning Area. This section describes the maximum growth that would be
possible in the City under the 2025 Land Use Diagram.
MAXIMUM GROWTH UNDER THE GENERAL PLAN
The maximum development potential of the City at total buildout was determined by summing the
maximum number of possible residential dwelling units, then multiplying that total by an average
3.0 persons per household, using estimates based on the 2005 Department of Finance estimate of
3.18 persons per household. The maximum buildout potential described herein assumes all
undeveloped lands within the future growth area would be developed at maximum allowable
intensities as described in the Land Use Designation discussion of this Element.

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
As described in Table 2-9 above, if Coalinga’s residential land were built to its maximum
potential, with the density of each dwelling unit matching the persons per household as stated
above, the total population within the 2005 incorporated City Limits could exceed 32,000
persons, while the population within the SOI could exceed 48,000 persons.
The calculated maximum buildout potential for the entire Planning Area under this General Plan
is approximately 81,256 persons. The following factors, however, may reduce the potential
buildout to a level below the theoretical calculations: site-specific constraints, design requirements
and market factors.
 Table 2-10, Non Residential Maximum Build- out Potential, shows the potential buildout for non-
  residential uses such as commercial, manufacturing, public facilities, recreation, open space and
 agriculture. The table identifies total acres of land designated for the various non-residential uses.

VI.      AGRICULTURE
Goal LU7
The viability of the agricultural lands surrounding the City are preserved and protected while
allowing for the planned growth within the City’s Planning Area.
    Policy LU7-1
    New Development on the fringes of the City shall recognize the right of agriculture to exist
    and continue to operate in proximity to the development. Residential deed restrictions may be
    required which inform future residents of the right of agriculture to continue within the limits
    of the law without interference or protest from nearby property owners.
         Implementation Measure LU7-1.1
         Development proposals located adjacent to any land zoned for agricultural use or with
         prime soil, or under Williamson Act contract shall be required to address the potential
         conflict with neighboring agricultural uses, and the City shall determine whether there is
         sufficient cause to require Deed restrictions to protect the right of agriculture to continue.
         Implementation Measure LU7-1.2
         Within one (1) year, the City has a "Right to Farm" Ordinance.
         Implementation Measure LU7-1.3
         Prior to annexation of any new lands, the City shall coordinate with the Department of
         Conservation and local Resource Conservation Districts to develop a Farmland in lieu Fee
         Program to offset impacts associated with conversion of agricultural lands. The in lieu Fee
         Program shall set up guidelines for fee establishment, collection, tracking of use, and status
         of fees and net use of properties obtained/farmed under this program.
    Policy LU7-2
    The City recognizes the loss of farmland as a result of urbanization of the City of Coalinga as a
    significant and unavoidable impact and shall require development projects to mitigate for the
    loss of farmland.
         Implementation Measure LU7-.2.1
         Development projects shall be required to mitigate for loss of farmland by either (1)
         granting a farmland conservation easement to or for the benefit of the City and/or a
         qualifying entity approved by the City, at a 1:1 ratio for each acre developed or an
         equivalent as specified in a development agreement between the project applicant and the
         City, or (2) by payment of an in lieu fee as established by the City, which shall be
         reviewed and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fee is adequate to offset the cost of
         purchasing farmland conservation easements at a 1:1 ratio or a proportionate share of an
         agricultural buffer zone around the City’s planned growth area or, (3) as negotiated by
         LAFCO and/or the Department of Conservation, and the City during the annexation
         process.

                                                                  Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
         The City shall prepare Agricultural Conservation Guidelines identifying requirements for
         conservation easements, including timing of conservation easements, location of land to
         be preserved, including consideration of an agricultural buffer zone around the City’s
         planned growth area, land mitigation ratio and quality and minimum standards for
         conservation easements.
The Agricultural Conservation Guidelines would include the following elements:
A.       Timing of conservation easements
Direct acquisition of conservation easements by a project applicant shall occur on or before the
issuance of certificates of occupancy for the project or as specified in a development agreement
between the project applicant and the City. These conservation easements shall be acquired for
the benefit of the City. Preservation of off-site farmland may be done for the entire project at one
time, or alternatively, may be done in increments with the build-out of the project as specified in a
development agreement with the City.
B.       Location of Land to be Preserved
The farmland to be preserved through this program shall be located in Pleasant Valley, in
proximity to the land being impacted, and on similar soil types, to the extent feasible. Those
lands directly north and south of the City’s SOI, identified as Prime in Figure 3-2 (presented in the
Open Space and Conservation Element of this General Plan), would meet this requirement and
should be considered ideal candidates for farmland mitigation sites.
C.       Land Mitigation Ratio and Quality
The ratio of farmland to be preserved to farmland developed at the project site shall be a 1:1 ratio
or an equivalent as specified in a development agreement between the project applicant and the
City. Easements obtained by the Project Applicant must preserve either Farmland of Statewide
Importance or Prime Farmland or be within an agricultural buffer zone around the City’s planned
growth area.
D.       Minimum Standards for Conservation Easements
While the specific terms of each individual conservation easement necessarily vary, the following
standards must be met before the City will accept any easement as mitigation:
     a) If the land to be developed is designated as Farmland of Statewide Importance, so the
         conservation easement(s) acquired shall preserve either Farmland of Statewide Importance
         or Prime Farmland, or be within an agricultural buffer zone around the City’s planned
         growth area.
     b) All owners of the agricultural mitigation land shall execute the document encumbering the
         land.

Chapter 2 - Land Use Element
     c) The document shall be recordable and contain an accurate legal description of the
         agricultural mitigation land.
     d) The document shall prohibit any activity which substantially impairs or diminishes the
         agricultural productivity of the land.
     e) The document shall protect any existing water rights necessary to maintain agricultural uses
         on the land covered by the document, and retain such water rights for ongoing use on the
         agricultural mitigation land.
     f) The Applicant shall pay to the City an agricultural mitigation monitoring fee to cover the
         costs of administering, monitoring and enforcing the document in an amount determined
         by the receiving entity, not to exceed 10% of the easement price paid by the applicant, or a
         different amount approved by the City Council not to exceed 15% of the easement price
         paid by the applicant.
     g) The City shall be named a beneficiary under any document conveying the interest in the
         agricultural mitigation land to an entity acceptable to the City.
     h) Interests in agricultural mitigation land shall be held in trust by an entity acceptable to the
         City and/or the City in perpetuity. The entity shall not sell, lease, or convey any interest in
         agricultural mitigation land which it shall acquire without the prior written approval of the
         City.
     i) If any qualifying entity owning an interest in agricultural mitigation land ceases to exist, the
         duty to hold, administer, monitor and enforce the interest shall be transferred to another
         entity acceptable to the City or to the City.
E.       In Lieu Fees
In lieu fees for the conservation of farmland shall be paid to the City and/or qualifying entity
approved by the City prior to or upon close of escrow of development (for each residential
structure and each commercial, office, and industrial building) within the project approval of
grading permits. The City’s continuing consultations with conservation agencies and
organizations, as well as an assessment of the geographic area will suggest a reasonable current
market value for any agricultural land conservation easement. Fees will be collected on or before
the issuance of grading permits. The applicant may also pay the entire in lieu fees as specified in a
development agreement with the City amount prior to issuance of the first grading permit.

  OPEN SPACE AND
     CONSERVATION
                 ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Open Space and Conservation Element focuses on the identification, protection and
management of open space and provides direction regarding the conservation, development and
utilization of natural resources. Valuable resources in the City of Coalinga include, agricultural
and rangeland, Gatos and Warthan Creek, minerals and fossil fuels, a variety of biological species,
scenic areas and archaeological, cultural and historic resources.
Related issues that are not included in this element include parks, recreational trails, water supply
and hazards. These issues are addressed in other Elements of this General Plan.
ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
        Introduction. This section includes an overview of the contents of the Element and a
         discussion of state law requirements.
        Background and Setting. This section provides a description of the current setting.
        Special Planning Areas and Resources. This section identifies specific geographic areas
         within the Coalinga area that significant resource value and/or are strategic to conservation
         planning of the City.
        Open Space and Conservation Goals, Policies and Implementation Measures. This
         section outlines Coalinga’s overall land use goals and the policies and implementation
         measures designed to attain these goals.
REQUIREMENTS OF THE OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENTS
California Government Code requires that General Plans include an Open Space Element and a
Conservation Element either as separate or combined elements. The requirements for the Open
Space Element as outlined in Government Code Sections 65302[e] and 65560 et seq. are similar
City of Coalinga                                                                            General Plan

Chapter 3 - Open Space and Conservation Element
to those in the Conservation Element (Government Code Section 65302(d)). Because the two
Elements overlap in content and function, they have been combined in this General Plan.
Generally, “open space” refers to any land or water area that remains in a predominantly natural
or undeveloped state and is generally free of structures. The Land Use Element of this General
Plan more specifically defines open space and conservation lands as properties with significant
wildlife or habitat value or areas that have considerable physical constraints, including floodways
or floodplains, fault rupture hazard areas, unstable geologic or soils conditions, hazardous
materials and wildlife corridors or habitat areas
Government Code specifies that a General Plan must address four categories of open space
including:
        Open space for the preservation of natural resources
        Open space used for the managed production of resources,
        Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas of outstanding
         scenic, historic and cultural value; and
        Open space for public health and safety.
The Conservation Element, according to State requirements, must contain goals and policies to
protect and maintain natural resources such as soils, wildlife and minerals and prevent wasteful
resource exploitation, degradation and destruction.
In adopting these requirements, the Legislature found that the preservation of open space land is
necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the State but also for the continued
availability of land for the production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of scenic beauty, for
recreation and for the use of natural resources. The Legislature further found that it is in the public
interest to discourage unnecessary or premature conversion of open space.
In accordance with State requirements, this Element addresses the management, protection and
preservation of open space. Related issues such as parks, recreational trails, water supply and
hazards are addressed in other Elements within this General Plan. Parks and parkland dedication
requirements are discussed in the Public Facilities and Services Element. A discussion of trail-
oriented recreational uses and trail routes is included in the Circulation Element. A discussion of
water, water bodies, hydraulic forces and hazardous or special conditions is included in the Safety
Element.
The Open Space and Conservation Element, as each of the Elements in the General Plan, is
required to be fully integrated and consistent with each of the other elements. This Element has
been prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of state law.

                                            Chapter 3 - Open Space and Conservation Element
BACKGROUND AND SETTING
Coalinga is located in Pleasant Valley, at the base of the coast mountain ranges, on the western
side of California’s Central Valley. The City is located approximately 100 miles north-northwest
of Bakersfield and encompasses approximately 3,165 acres at the confluence of Los Gatos and
Warthan Creeks. These stream channels run along the northeast and southeast edges of town,
partially defining the boundaries of the urban area. Vegetation along the stream channels from
their headwaters to Pleasant Valley varies considerably: from no obvious obligate riparian
vegetation; to occasional stands of large cottonwoods, marsh-like reaches with rushes and other
small plants but no trees; to sparse to dense stands of small and large tamarisks. Cottonwoods and
mesquite are native to the area. Another common species, tamarisk, is an invasive, introduced
plant that is an aggressive competitor with native vegetation, and provides little value as habitat
for native wildlife.1
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 18th century, perennial grasslands characterized the
vegetation of the area with scattered oaks near the foothills. With the introduction of cattle and
farming activities, much of the native grassland has either been destroyed by conversion to
croplands or replaced by non-native annual grasslands better able to withstand intense grazing
pressures.
Pleasant Valley originally supported large herds of pronghorn antelope and tule elk; however,
these species are no longer present. Mule deer, kit fox, wild boars, coyotes, bobcat and badgers
inhabit the surrounding hills. California ground squirrels, black-tailed jackrabbits and desert
cottontails are abundant. Turtles, small fish, frogs and aquatic insects are observable in stream
reaches with surface water in the canyons above town. The area also has the potential for several
sensitive plant and wildlife species including California jewelflower, Palmate bird’s beak, San
Joaquin kit foxes and blunt-nosed leopard lizards.
Soils
The soils found in the foothills and mountain areas are thin and highly susceptible to erosion from
wind and water. The vegetative cover is generally sparse, limiting the carrying capacity of the land
for grazing. Topsoils in the northeastern portion of Pleasant Valley are very fertile and underlain
with by extremely deep alluvial silt. The fertility of the soils in other areas of the Pleasant Valley is
threatened by the application of poor quality ground water, which progressively increases salt
concentrations. Soils within the City of Coalinga, Sphere of Influence (SOI) and Area of Interest
(AOI) are generally characterized as having limitations for development. Limitations include
expansive, collapsible and corrosive soils. The degrees of erodibility vary throughout the Coalinga
area.

Chapter 3 - Open Space and Conservation Element
The safety element contains a further discussion of the potential soils-related hazards and
applicable goals, policies and implementation measures.
Agricultural and Rangeland Resources
Most of the land within the Pleasant Valley is considered prime agricultural land, while that
outside is considered rangeland. Agricultural land includes land that has been plowed, disked, or
irrigated for crop production. Rangeland generally includes land with natural vegetation,
dominated by valley saltbush scrub and annual grasslands.
Minerals and Other Natural Resources
Coalinga’s history is deeply rooted in the minerals and other natural resources known to occur in
the area. Extracted resources include fossil fuels such as oil and coal, aggregate products such as
sand and gravel and other metals and minerals.
Oil development in the Coalinga area began as early as 1864, when efforts were made to produce
oil from hand-dug oil wells. Today, extensive oil recovery operations are located mostly to the
north of the City. Oil companies such as Chevron USA, Union Oil Company, Shell Production
and Santa Fe Energy have substantial land holdings in the area. Coal, in the form of lignite, occurs
northwest and southwest of Coalinga but has not been commercially mined for 100 years.
Asbestos is surface-mined in large quantities approximately 20 miles northwest of Coalinga. The
serpentine host rock in which it is found covers approximately 2,000 square miles, and as much
as 50% of this rock could be asbestos. Total reserves are not known, but the deposit has been
estimated to contain more than 100 million tons of ore. This area is one of the nation’s principal
producers of asbestos and contains one of the world’s largest deposits of short-fiber asbestos.
Scenic Resources
The City of Coalinga is located in a broad valley on the eastern side of the coast mountain range,
along the western edge of California’s Central Valley. The visual setting of the area is
characterized by the wide, flat valley floor bounded by rolling foothills primarily to the west and
south. The City is generally surrounded by rural open space, with agriculture, oil production,
scattered ranches and residences making up the visual landscape. The vegetation of the landscape
surrounding the city is generally that of tilled or grazed grassland, agricultural crops, sparse trees
and scattered riparian corridors. As viewed from most parts of the city, the low hills to the west
are a visual backdrop and offer a degree of scenic and topographic interest. The Los Gatos and
Warthan Creeks create vegetated riparian corridors visible through town and the adjacent
countryside. The visual fabric of the City is largely defined by a balanced mix of low multi-story
structures in the downtown and commercial area, with single and multi-family residential
surrounding the downtown center.

Archaeological Resources
The City of Coalinga and surrounding areas are located within the ethnographic territory of the
Southern Yokuts people. The Southern Yokuts homeland was centered near water sources
including the Tulare, Buena Vista, and Kern Lakes and connecting sloughs and rivers. Population
density was very low in areas removed from main water courses and lakes (Wallace 1978).
Earliest evidence of human occupation of the region consists of spear points, including fluted
points found on the shores of Tulare Lake. These points potentially date back to 12,000 to 10,000
before present (BP). The earliest radiocarbon date in the region is 8,000 BP and was obtained
from a buried site on the shores of Buena Vista Lake. Three archaeological components have been
defined for the Coalinga area: 1) Early Horizon (8,000 to 4,500 BP), 2) Middle Horizon (4,500 to
3,000 BP) and 3) Late Horizon (3,000 BP to 1,500 BP). The Late Horizon may represent peoples
who are a precursor to the Yokuts culture (Morratto; 1984).
Cultural and Historic Resources
The 1983 earthquake caused more than $30 million in damages and destroyed most of the
historically significant buildings in the area. Of 139 buildings in the 8-block downtown
commercial district, 59 collapsed or were heavily damaged. The most severe damage occurred to
the old (usually pre-1930) 1- and 2-story buildings of unreinforced brick masonry wall
construction, with floors and roofs of wood. More than 800 single-family houses were destroyed
or incurred major damage. Most of these domestic buildings were of unreinforced adobe
construction.
SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS AND RESOURCES
Coalinga recognizes that certain geographic areas within and around the City merit special
consideration due to the potential presence, or potential to support special status species and
or/habitat. These areas are described below.
COALINGA HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN (CHCP)
On March 20, 1997, the Coalinga City Council authorized preparation of the CHCP, in
recognition of the many federally and state-listed species, as well as other sensitive species within
the Coalinga vicinity. The maximum CHCP Permit Area consists of approximately 10,429 acres
(16.3 square miles) which encompass all land within the City limits and the land designated in the
City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI). A draft of the CHCP was released for public and agency review
in 2005. As of yet, 2008, the CHCP has not yet been adopted, and little more has been done in
Coalinga’s HCP process.
Adoption of the CHCP would benefit the City as the adopted CHCP, upon local, state and federal
agency approval, would provide a streamlined, predictable permit process; consistent, defined

June 2009                                                                                      Page 3-5

Chapter 3 - Open Space and Conservation Element
compensation obligations and mitigation measures; cost-sharing among the participants; and
careful stewardship of biological resources, and compliance with Endangered Species Act (ESA)
and California Endangered Species Act (CESA). The purpose of the CHCP is to meet the
requirements of the ESA by avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating impacts on listed species and
their habitats, ensuring protection of other sensitive species and reducing potential conflicts
between sensitive species and development. The CHCP will include mitigation measures
designed to avoid and minimize take of sensitive species and their habitat and to mitigate for
unavoidable incidental take.
Within the CHCP Area there is potential for several sensitive plant and wildlife species to occur.
Plant communities may be regarded as sensitive for one or more of the following reasons:
        They may provide habitat for rare plants or wildlife,
        There may have been extensive historic and ongoing losses of acreage throughout the
         region, or
        They may be considered important elements of local aesthetic value and natural heritage.
The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) classify sensitive species into the following
groups:
        Candidate Species. One that the Fish and Game Commission (CFGC) formally has noticed
         as being under review by the CDFG to determine whether listing it as threatened or
         endangered is warranted, or when it is the subject of a proposed rulemaking by the
         Commission to list as threatened or endangered.
        Rare Species. One that is in such small numbers throughout all or a significant portion of
         its range that it may become endangered if its present environment worsens.
        Threatened Species. One that is not presently facing extinction but is likely to become an
         endangered species in the foreseeable future, in the absence of special protection and
         management efforts. Any wildlife listed as “rare” by the Commission on or before January
         1, 1985 is considered a “threatened” species.
        Endangered Species. One that is in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all, or a
         significant portion of, its range due to one or more causes including loss or change of
         habitat, overexploitation, predation, competition or disease.
A list of sensitive plants and wildlife from the Pleasant Valley Area, that have the potential to
occur within the Habitat Conservation Plan Area, are listed in Tables 3-1 and 3-2 presented on the
following pages. .

OPEN SPACE
The rural setting and geographic location of Coalinga offers extensive passive open space beyond
the City. Although much of the land surrounding the City is in private ownership, the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) manages substantial acreage, which provides limited passive and active
open space opportunities.
The stream corridors and watersheds of the Los Gatos and Warthan Creeks offer open space
opportunities for residents and have been designated as such. Properties with fault rupture
hazards, unstable geologic or soils conditions, hazardous materials and wildlife corridors or
habitat areas have also been designated open space.

Conservation Bank
The City of Coalinga developed the Conservation Bank as a way to streamline the acquisition of
compensation land. The City can use the Conservation Bank to buy land in large parcels from
willing sellers, resulting in a per acre cost for the conservation land that may be less than the
impact fee collected by the City. The City plans to continue acquisition of land for inclusion in
the Coalinga Conservation Bank to meet future needs for projects permitted under an adopted
CHCP and possibly for projects outside of the CHCP scope. The Coalinga Conservation Bank is
described in a separate Conservation Bank Agreement between the City of Coalinga, CDFG and
USFWS.
Area of Critical Environmental Concern
Federal land within the Pleasant Valley area, including all Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
land in the CHCP Conservation Area and south into the Kettleman Hills, is part of the
Panoche/Coalinga Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), which consists of about 43,000
acres in western Fresno County. Identification of ACECs was authorized in Section 202 (c)(3) of
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. ACECs are areas on BLM lands where
special management is needed to protect and prevent irreparable damage to important historic,
cultural, and scenic values, fish or wildlife resources or other natural systems or processes; or to
protect human life and safety from natural hazards. ACECs are managed for the long-term
conservation of the plants and animals and the natural communities on which they depend, but
may allow for a variety of land uses managed in a compatible manner.
Near the CHCP Permit Area, BLM manages approximately 6,180 acres of public land and
approximately 7,640 acres of mineral split estate land (where the minerals are federally owned
and a private party or state or local government owns the surface). The Management Plan for the
Panoche/Coalinga Area of Critical Environmental Concern (BLM 1987) recognizes significant
habitat areas for sensitive plants and animals and recommends measures for the management of
them, including guidelines for surface disturbing activities, limitations on grazing, policies for land
acquisition and monitoring requirements.
Recovery Plan Area
A Recovery Plan for Upland Species of the San Joaquin Valley (USFWS 1998) has been prepared
for upland species in the San Joaquin Valley. Criteria were developed to guide mitigation and
compensation efforts for many relevant species covered in the Draft CHCP (2005). Table 11 and
Figure 72 in the Recovery Plan identify the Kettleman Hills to Anticline Ridge, as an area of
“private farmland/links with Coalinga and Guijarral Hills and the rest of natural lands on the west
edge of the Valley” and an area “where connectivity and linkages should be promoted” between
the Kettleman Hills to the south and the Ciervo/Panoche area to the north (Figure 73 in the
Recovery Plan). Under the proposed CHCP, conservation would support the goals of the
Recovery Plan.

Pleasant Valley Ecological Reserve
CDFG owns and manages approximately 1,000 acres in the Guijarral Hills as habitat for San
Joaquin kit foxes, blunt-nosed leopard lizards and other listed species in the area. At this time, a
management plan for the area is in preparation.
Warthan Creek and Los Gatos Creek
A management plan for Warthan Creek and Los Gatos Creek was prepared in 1990 at the request
of the City of Coalinga by Redwood Community Action Agency (1990). The plan covers only the
parts of the creeks located in the City of Coalinga's SOI in 1990. The plan identifies methods to
protect and enhance the natural resource values of the creeks and recommends a multi-use
approach allowing: recreation, floodways, natural habitat and open space activities. The
recommendations address the protection of wildlife habitat and suggest approaches to use the
streams as potential wildlife movement corridors and foraging areas.
Implementation of the plan would also reduce potential hazards associated with flooding, erosion
and sedimentation. The policy related to vegetation management encourages the reproduction
and growth of native plants and discourages the establishment and growth of non-native plants
within the stream zones. The wildlife habitat policy calls for restoration and management of
stream zones as habitat for native wildlife species, integrated with other allowable uses. As of
November 1994, the plan had been implemented over about half the length of Los Gatos Creek
and Warthan Creek within the City of Coalinga.
Coalinga Airport Kit Fox Habitat Management Area
In compliance with the Biological Opinion issued by the USFWS (1992) for construction of the
Coalinga Airport, 360 acres were dedicated as a Kit Fox Management Area (KFMA) and buffer
areas were established between the KFMA and adjacent land uses. There is a 500-foot wide buffer
along the west side of Calaveras Avenue beginning at Phelps Avenue and extending one mile
northward to include the length of airport lands bound by Calaveras Avenue. There also is a 300-
foot wide buffer between the KFMA and the planned and potential future airport facilities. The
land required for this potential expansion plus 300 feet around it is treated as buffer so that the
360 acres of KFMA lands will not be diminished or impacted by potential future expansion.
Prime Farmland
Most of the land within the Pleasant Valley is considered prime agricultural land, while that
outside is considered rangeland. Uses on rangeland include livestock grazing and oil and gas
extraction. Important Farmland within the Planning Area is illustrated on Figure 3-1.
Williamson Act Land
It is anticipated that all of the agricultural land under Williamson Act contracts within the
proposed SOI, 6,061 acres, will eventually be converted to urban use and be removed from the
City of Coalinga                                                                          General Plan

Update. Williamson Act Lands within the Planning Area are illustrated on Figure 3-2.
Resources Extraction Areas
Resources that have been historically extracted in the region include fossil fuels such as oil and
coal, aggregate products such as sand and gravel and other metals and minerals. Today resource
extraction is limited primarily to oil and asbestos. However, extensive oil recovery operations are
located mostly to the north of the City. Asbestos is surface-mined in large quantities approximately
20 miles northwest of Coalinga.
Viewing Corridors
The City’s principal travel corridors including Highway 198/33, Highway 33/Jayne Avenue and
Phelps Avenue act as key vantage points for viewing the City’s scenic resources:
        Highway 198/33 is the major public viewing corridor traversing the City in a north-
         northeast/south-southwest direction. Northeast and southwest of the City, the highway
         offers views of rolling hills, natural landscape and agricultural areas. The California
         Department of Transportation lists Highway 198 between Interstate 5 and the western
         Fresno County Line as an Eligible State Scenic Highway.
        Highway 33/Jayne Avenue is the major public viewing corridor traversing the City in an
         east/west direction. West of the City, the highway offers views of rolling hills, natural
         landscape and agricultural areas.
        Phelps Avenue is the major public viewing corridor traversing the northern portion of the
         City in an east/west direction. West of the City, Phelps Avenue offers views of rolling hills,
         natural landscape and agricultural areas.
Archaeological Sites
Archaeological investigations and surveys in the immediate Coalinga area have identified
archaeological sites to the west and southwest along Los Gatos and Warthan Creeks. An
additional site, FRE-49, exists east of the junction of Los Gatos and Jacalitos Creeks, approximately
three (3) miles outside the City. Undiscovered archaeological remains may be present in
undeveloped or undisturbed areas. In areas where extensive agriculture has occurred, the
potential for finding significant archaeological resources is considered very remote.
Historic Sites
The National Register of Historic Places lists two sites of historical significance in the Coalinga
area, the Birdwell Rock Petroglyph Site and Coalinga Polk Street School. Resources considered to
be of local significance include the RC Baker Memorial Museum and the Wooden Walking Beam.

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
The following Community Vision Statements define the values and vision for the community and
along with the guiding principles in Chapter 1 of this General Plan, provide the foundation for
open space and conservation goals, policies and implementation measures.
        Maintains the spectacular view of the valley and surrounding hills that forms the backdrop
         to the community. It preserves its natural beauty, environmental quality and vital natural
         resources through appropriate stewardship of the land ensuring visual and physical
         harmony between the natural and man-made environment.
        Preserves its general open, rural, low profile, uncrowded character punctuated with ample
         open space, large setbacks, panoramic views and pristine vistas of the surrounding hills.
        Collects, restores, preserves its natural, cultural and geologic heritage and displays,
         artifacts, histories, maps and structures relating to the early Native American inhabitants,
         pioneer settlers, railroad workers, coal miners and oil workers of Coalinga.
        Provides outstanding cultural activities that serve the entire region and that will touch and
         enrich the lives of citizens and visitors. The arts and the environment play equal and
         complementary roles in realizing a culturally animated future. They act as a stimulus to
         civic pride and involvement and provide vigor and zest to the community’s quality of life.
The following goals, policies and implementation measures have been established to guide short
and long-range decision making by the community.
Goal OSC1
Preservation of Coalinga’s sensitive wildlife habitats and open space lands to the greatest extent
possible.
     Policy OSC1-1
     Secure a diverse network of open land encompassing valuable natural and agricultural
     resources within and around the Coalinga urban area. Valuable resources include creek
     corridors, wetlands, native grassland communities and woodlands, wildlife habitat and
     corridors, groundwater resources, hills and ridgelines, open-space settings for cultural
     resources and prime agricultural soils and economically viable farmland.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-1.1
         Pursue opportunities for additional open space land in the form of parkland dedication,
         public open space easements, leaseholds, land donations/dedications and gift annuities.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-2.2
         Create an Open Space Ordinance that includes open space development criteria for
         private and public projects.
City of Coalinga                                                                              General Plan

Chapter 3 - Open Space and Conservation Element
    Policy OSC1-2
    Encourage the protection of streams, riparian corridors and unique or sensitive habitats.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-2.1
         Designate streams, riparian corridors and unique or sensitive habitats as Open Space.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-2.2
         Adopt a stream setback ordinance and development standards that minimize impacts to
         streams and riparian corridors.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-2.3
         Continue to develop and expand the Coalinga Conservation Bank in an effort to protect
         sensitive environments.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-2.4
         Continue to acquire land for inclusion in the Coalinga Reserve.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-2.5
         The City shall support “no-net-loss” wetlands policies of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
         the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the California Department of Fish and Game. The
         City shall require new development to fully mitigate wetland loss for function and value in
         regulated wetlands through any combination of avoidance, minimization, or
         compensation. The City shall also support mitigation banking programs that can provide
         the opportunity to mitigate impacts to rare, threatened, and endangered species and/or the
         habitat which supports these species in wetland and riparian areas. Coordination with
         agencies at all levels of project review shall continue to ensure that appropriate mitigation
         measures and the concerns of these agencies are adequately addressed.
    Policy OSC1-3
    Protect special-status plant and animal species and their habitat in accordance with local, state,
    and federal regulations.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-3.1
         As part of the environmental review process for future development projects, the City shall
         require applicants to provide an evaluation of biological resources for those projects
         located within or directly adjacent to known sensitive habitats. These habitats include
         those documented or recognized by the City, CDFG, and/or the USFWS (e.g., wetlands,
         riparian zones, special-status species habitat, rare plants).
         This biological resources evaluation shall be conducted by a qualified biologist. Such an
         evaluation will consider the potential for significant impacts on biological resources and
         will identify feasible mitigation measures or indicate why mitigation is not feasible.
General Plan                                                                               City of Coalinga

         database shall also include locations of known kit fox dens.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-3.3
         Develop an environmental education program for the general public and development
         community that provides information, materials and resources (i.e., brochures, websites,
         displays and presentations) about local special-status species, their habitat requirements,
         and measures that landowners can take to protect these species. The materials prepared
         for this program shall be developed in conjunction with and reviewed by USFWS and
         CDFG for accuracy and consistency. The materials shall be reviewed every five years,
         updated as necessary, and redistributed. The materials shall also be updated and
         redistributed when the status of any of these species changes, or if guidelines for their
         protection change substantially.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-3.4
         A worker education and training program shall be conducted prior to construction for
         those projects which have the potential to disturb natural resources. The program shall be
         conducted by a qualified biologist for all construction personnel and would discuss
         sensitive species and habitats which have the potential to occur in the construction area,
         as well. The program shall explain the importance of minimizing disturbance and adhering
         to other disturbance minimizing measures.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-3.5
         Until such time as a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) is adopted, the City shall require
         applicants to coordinate with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department
         of Fish and Game to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures and the concerns of
         these agencies are adequately addressed.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-3.6
         Coordinate with the USFWS and other applicable agencies to complete the CHCP process,
         including environmental review. Begin the process within one (1) year of General Plan
         approval.
     Policy OSC1-4
     Preserve and enhance habitat linkages recognized by regulatory agencies and/or identified
     during the development review process.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-4.1
         The City shall work with willing landowners to acquire land in fee title or conservation
         easements in order to expand the Coalinga Reserve in the Kettleman Hills/ Guijarral Hills/
         Anticline Ridge habitat linkage.
City of Coalinga                                                                           General Plan

         The City shall require a minimum 100-foot setback from those natural watercourses such
         as Los Gatos, Zapato Chino, Jacalitos and Warthan creeks.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-4.3
         The City shall retain a qualified biologist to conduct annual surveys within the Coalinga
         Reserve to identify areas of habitat (other than annual grassland) where invasive non-
         native vegetation exceeds 20% coverage. These areas with more than 20% coverage by
         invasive species shall be treated using methods that do not cause surface disturbance and
         are in accordance with State and Federal laws and regulations.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-4.4
         The City shall require developers to use native and compatible non-native plant species,
         especially drought-resistant species, to the extent possible in fulfilling landscaping
         requirements imposed as conditions of discretionary permit approval or for project
         mitigation.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-4.5
         The City shall require developers to preserve and enhance existing native riparian habitat
         unless public safety concerns require removal of habitat for flood control or other
         purposes. In cases where new private or public development results in modification or
         destruction of riparian habitat, the developers shall be responsible for creating new
         riparian habitats within or near the project area. Appropriate mitigation shall be developed
         in coordination with regulatory agencies.
    Policy OSC1-5
    Encourage the protection of threatened and endangered species and their habitat addressed in
    the adopted Coalinga Habitat Conservation Plan (CHCP), while allowing for continued
    development. Until such time as the CHCP is adopted, the City shall look to the Draft CHCP
    (2005) for guidance.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-5.1
         Modify existing or create new development standards that incorporate the mitigation
         measures included in the adopted CHCP to ensure that all new development under
         jurisdiction of the City of Coalinga within the CHCP Overlay to complies with the terms
         and conditions of the Coalinga HCP.
         Implementation Measure OSC1-5.2

         CIRCULATION
                 ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element provides a long-range plan for the transportation of goods and people
within the City using a structured network of highways, streets and trails. This includes the
following modes of transportation:
        Transit
        Bicycles
        Pedestrians
        Motorized vehicles
The Circulation Element accommodates the projected traffic generation that will result from future
land use activities identified in the Land Use Element. A discussion of adequacy and availability
of local public utilities and facilities has been included in the Public Facilities and Services
Element. Air pollution and air quality impacts are discussed in the Air Quality Element.
This Element balances the need to provide efficient and reliable ways to move people in a
practical and landscaped transportation circulation network that includes roads, bike paths,
walkways and trails that are easily accessible, efficient and safe. The circulation system, especially
major corridors, will provide panoramic views of the community’s surrounding environment and
will avoid blocking these views with walls, fences, overhead power lines other visually negative
features. The circulation system will link neighborhoods, parks, schools, libraries, shopping areas,

         alternative transportation including the use of public transit, as well as bicycling, walking
         and equestrian trails.
        Circulation Goals, Policies and Implementation Measures.              This section outlines
         Coalinga’s overall circulation goals, and the policies and implementation measures
         designed to attain these goals.
REQUIREMENTS OF THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The Circulation Element is one of the seven mandated general plan elements identified in State
planning and zoning law. Section 65302(b) of the California Government Code specifies that
each General Plan must include “a circulation element consisting of the general location and
extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other
local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.” The
Coalinga Circulation Element meets these requirements.
California Government Code Section 65401 specifies that all public works projects must be in
conformity with the General Plan. In practice, this will require that the City, during adoption of
the Capital Improvement Program (CIP), as recommended by this Update, make findings that the
proposed CIP is in conformance with the General Plan, including the Circulation Element.
The land use element, as each of the elements in the General Plan, is also required to be fully
integrated and must be consistent with each of the other elements. This Element has been
prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of state law.

BACKGROUND AND SETTING
Coalinga’s street system is composed of arterials, collectors, and local streets. The system consists
of a general pattern of arterial streets located at approximately one-mile intervals with collectors at
one-half mile intervals. The existing street network is illustrated on Figure 4-1. As shown, several
unique features characterize the existing street system in Coalinga:
        Off-Set Intersections: The original grid in the City’s commercial core runs diagonal to a
         surrounding north-south grid, resulting in multiple off-set intersections on Washington,
         Sunset, Polk and Hayes Streets. This type of intersection represents a constraint in that it
         has a lower traffic capacity than aligned intersections; it impacts the capacity of the
         intersecting streets; and it represents a safety concern and a source of confusion for visitors
         to Coalinga.
        Valley Gutters: Many streets in Coalinga are extremely wide with “valley” gutters at
         intersections. Valley gutters represent a constraint because they require vehicles to slow
         considerably, regardless of stop signage. While this is probably a benefit on residential
         streets because it slows traffic, on collector or arterial streets it can act as an impediment to
         smooth traffic flow.
        Through Traffic Patterns: Two State highways, State Route (SR) 33 and 198, traverse the
         City providing regional access. The state highways increase external bypass or through
         traffic and consume capacity for Coalinga’s growth. Furthermore, increased through traffic
         may impact the quality and character of some neighborhoods. Additional through traffic
         may also be viewed as an important economic stimulus for the City’s retail business.
STREET CLASSIFICATIONS
The Circulation Plan classifies roadways based on their intended function and projected traffic
levels, which determine the appropriate type of design and number of lanes for the route.
Specific existing and future roadway classifications are depicted on Figure 4-2. Table 4-1,
presented on the following page, describes the different classes of roads recognized by the
General Plan.

                       Arterials provide for circulation between major activity centers and
           Arterial    residential areas in the City and beyond; they also provide access to
                       freeways. They are further subdivided into two categories:
                       Usually carry the highest volumes and/or longest trip in the City. Major
                       arterials are high-capacity, moderately high-speed routes, typically two or
                       four lanes wide (with up to six lanes where warranted by traffic volumes).
                       Arterials also include regional highways. For high capacity, major arterials in
       Major Arterial
                       the urban areas should have medians between intersections and additional
                       lanes at intersections. Service to abutting properties may be provided but
                       should be subordinate to through-travel needs; access points should be
                       consolidated where possible.
                       Typically interconnect with and augment the major arterial system, and serve
                       trips of moderate length. Minor arterials permit access to abutting properties,
                       but traffic capacity needs are equally important. Minor arterials are typically
                       two lanes wide and their design is similar to that of collectors except for
       Minor Arterial  additional space for separating bicycles from other traffic. To minimize
                       roadway width and right-of-way, minor arterials are usually undivided (no
                       median). Left-turn lanes should be provided at intersections, and a
                       continuous two-way left turn lane may be provided mid-block to improve
                       traffic flow.
                       Collectors channel traffic from residential or commercial areas to arterials.
                       Residences, commercial or public activities, typically front on to them. They
                       are usually two-lane streets, and maximum acceptable volumes are often
          Collector
                       dictated by resident concerns about intrusion rather than traffic capacity
                       considerations. Collector lanes typically measure 12 feet in width, with
                       sidewalks measuring 5 feet.
                       Local streets have the sole function of providing access to adjoining land
                       uses. All streets not otherwise depicted on the circulation plan are local
             Local
                       streets. Local roadways are typically two-lane streets, with each lane
                       measuring 20 feet wide. Typical sidewalk widths for local streets are five feet.

LEVEL OF SERVICE
Traffic operations are evaluated by determining Level of Service (LOS), a qualitative measure of
traffic operating conditions, whereby a grade of “A” through “F” is assigned to an intersection or
roadway segment representing progressively worsening traffic conditions. The City of Coalinga
General Plan indicates that LOS “D” is the applicable minimum design standard. Currently, all
streets and roads within the City of Coalinga operate at LOS C or better. 5th Avenue to Hayes
Street and Hayes Street to Garfield Street operates as LOS C. All other streets operate at LOS A or
B. The study completed by KD Anderson (August, 2008) developed information regarding Levels
of Services using the procedures contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).
Level of Service can be calculated for different types of traffic facilities including segments of city
streets and highways and for specific street intersections. Table 4-2, below, presents the general
characteristics of each Level of Service grade at intersections and on roadway segments. Published
methodologies for determining Level of Service are predicated on hourly traffic volumes on these
facilities. For this study, information regarding intersection Levels of Service has been developed
using the procedures contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).

Overall Level of Service for unsignalized intersections is “worst case” of delay experienced by all motorists
While assessment of peak hour conditions is standard, for planning level traffic studies it is also
beneficial to describe Levels of Service based on the average daily traffic volumes occurring on
major city streets and state highways. Use of daily volumes is common for General Plan analysis
as it permits relatively quick assessment of circulation system needs.
Level of Service thresholds for streets and highways in Coalinga were developed based on review of
several sources. Because there is no uniform national standard to equate daily traffic volumes on
urban streets to specific Levels of Service, the existing City of Coalinga General Plan EIR and its
background references and Caltrans guidelines were considered. While Caltrans has no
recommendations in this area, general thresholds originally developed by the Florida Department of
Transportation (FDOT) are most applicable. The daily Level of Service thresholds developed by
FDOT have been used by many California agencies.
Level of Service thresholds are based on daily volume where developed in a manner that accounts
for the presence of features that affect urban traffic flow. These thresholds are employed to identify
the number of through travel lanes that would typically be expected on each street.
Resulting LOS thresholds are shown in Table 4-3, presented on the following page.

GENERAL PLAN BUILDOUT CONDITIONS
There are currently eight foreseeable developments proposals within existing City limits and two
possible future developments outside of existing City Limits as part of this Update. These include
a possible 1,786 dwelling units (excluding group quarters) within the existing city limits and an
additional 11,104, outside of existing city limits, for a total buildout of reasonably foreseeable
development projects of 12,890 new dwelling units (excluding group quarters). Based on the
future growth assumptions outlined in the Land Use Element of this Update, buildout of
reasonably foreseeable development projects plus estimated additional annual growth will result
in the construction of more than 14,719 dwelling units (12,890 proposed +1,829 needed to
accommodate anticipated additional growth) by the year 2025.
Using employment density factors and trip generation rates provided by the Fresno Council of
Governments, build out of the Plan could generate as many as 389,854 daily automobile trips.
FUTURE LOCAL TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
Based on a 2008 Traffic/Transportation Study conducted by K.D. Anderson, future growth
anticipated in this General Plan would result in a substantial increase in vehicle trips, and cause
several local intersections and roadways to operate at a Level of Service (LOS) below standards
established by the City of Coalinga. Street segments most heavily affected include Van Ness
Street, and State Route 33 east of Hayes Street.
The Study identifies specific roadway improvement needs at General Plan buildout including
development of Access Management Plans, lane widening (two -lane to four-lane), construction of
passing lanes and incorporation of signalization. The actual development of these improvements
would be dependent on several factors including the timing specific development proposals,
development intensity, and Caltrans funding and coordination.
FUTURE REGIONAL TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
The Traffic Study identified that there would be a substantial increase in the number of daily
automobile trips with buildout of the General Plan, and that much of this traffic will be external to
Coalinga. This suggests that the increase in commercial development and employment centers
will attract drivers from out of the city limits, impacting the regional road system. The report notes
that ultimately “four-lane roadways will be needed to link Coalinga with the balance of Fresno
County.” Because these impacts would occur in areas that do not fall under the City’s jurisdiction,
it would be necessary to coordinate any necessary improvements with other agencies, including
the County of Fresno, the Fresno Council of Governments and Caltrans.

Chapter 4 - Circulation Element
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION
Providing an adequate means of alternative transportation can greatly reduce peak hour traffic
congestion and support regional air quality mandates. Alternative transportation measures include
the use of public transit, as well as bicycling, walking, and equestrian trails.
PUBLIC TRANSIT
Coalinga Transit provides demand responsive weekday service in the City of Coalinga. Scheduled
round-trip intercity service to the Fresno-Clovis Metropolitan Area is available Monday through
Saturday.
Fresno County Rural Transit Agency (FCRTA) provides transit service in and between the rural
incorporated and unincorporated communities of Fresno County, including Coalinga. Passenger
fares are subsidized in order to encourage frequent trips. Dial-a-ride is available within the city for
the fare of $1.00 each way. Intercity service fares range from $2.00 to $11.00 per one-way trip.
Services within a rural city are offered on a demand responsive and/or scheduled fixed route basis.
Service between rural cities and the Fresno-Clovis Metropolitan area are provided on a scheduled
fixed route basis. Each of Fresno County Rural Transit Agency’s intercity buses are equipped with
parcel and bicycle racks and are alternatively fueled by propane, compressed natural gas, or
electric batteries for cleaner air.
BICYCLING, WALKING AND EQUESTRIAN TRAILS
Bikeways are classified by one of three categories:
        Class I Bikeways (bike path) provide for bicycle travel on a right-of-way completely
         separated from any street or highway.
        Class II Bikeways (bike lane) provide a restricted right-of-way for the exclusive use of
         bicycles with vehicle parking and cross flow by pedestrians and motorists permitted. Bike
         lanes are normally striped within paved areas of highways.
        Class III Bikeways (bike route by sign) provide for shared use with pedestrian and auto-
         traffic.
The rural setting of Coalinga provides a variety of formal and informal trails for walking, bicycling,
and equestrian use. Both Warthan and Los Gatos Creeks provide trails through the City and to
outlying areas. Equestrian users utilize Warthan and Los Gatos Creek trails. The gravel road
along the west side and paved road along the east side of Warthan Creek are used extensively by
bicyclists, as is Los Gatos Creek. These creekways have been designated as local bikeway routes.
General Plan                                                                             City of Coalinga

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has proposed the Los Gatos Creek Recreation Corridor Trail on the
top of the levee at Warthan Creek Bridge north and west to Los Gatos Creek Bridge. This trail will be
constructed in conjunction with a flood control project in Coalinga.
Other local bikeway routes include Highway 33 from Highway 198 east to Warthan Creek and
Van Ness Avenue west of Highway 198.
Regional bikeways serving areas beyond the City of Coalinga have also been designated by the
Fresno County Rural Bikeways Plan. These regional bikeway routes include Highway 33/198
north of the City; the Southern Pacific right-of-way along Phelps Avenue east to Huron; and Jayne
Avenue east of the City. The railroad right-of-way could provide bikeway linkage between
Coalinga, Huron, Lemoore, Hanford and Visalia prior to bikeway implementation.

Chapter 4 - Circulation Element
CIRCULATION GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
The following Circulation goals, policies and implementation measures have been established to
guide short and long-range decision making by the community.
Goal C1
A balanced, safe and efficient circulation system that includes cars, public transportation,
bicycles and pedestrians while accommodating future growth, maintaining acceptable Levels of
Service.
    Policy C1-1
    The City shall require that new development provide the necessary infrastructure to serve itself
    consistent with the city-wide circulation system, as shown in Figure 4-2, presented earlier.
         Implementation Measure C1-1.1
         Prepare a five-year capital improvement plan prioritizing new circulation facilities.
         Implementation Measure C1-1.2
         Establish a funding mechanism to provide on-going funding for the five-year capital
         improvement program. Applicable implementation studies will need to be conducted in
         order to confirm the feasibility and cost of improvements to determine eligibility for
         funding.
         Implementation Measure C1-1.3
         Establish development standards that require traffic studies for developments.
    Policy C1-2
    New development projects shall be required to mitigate their impacts and to pay their fair
    share of countywide traffic improvements they contribute to the need for.
         Implementation Measure C1-2.1
         Consider a countywide traffic impact fee to address cumulative (i.e. not project-specific)
         impacts associated with new development. Fees shall be used to pay for the cost of
         network improvements as well as other transportation improvements such as transit within
         the Coalinga AOI.
         Implementation Measure C1-2.2
         Establish development standards that require payment of traffic impact fees for all new
         development and periodically update.
General Plan                                                                              City of Coalinga
Page 4-16                                                                                       June 2009
                                                                 Chapter 4 – Circulation Element
         Implementation Measure C1-2.3
         The traffic impact fee program fee should be updated as required to include the cost of
         regionally beneficial street improvements that are installed as development proceeds and
         should include the cost of future traffic signals as outlined in the General Plan EIR, which
         cost may also have Caltrans participation.
     Policy C1-3
     The City recognizes that Level of Service D may not always be achieved on some roadway
     segments, and may also not be achieved at some intersections. Roadways on which LOS D is
     projected to be exceeded are shown in the General Plan or the General Plan EIR, based on the
     study conducted by KD Anderson (August, 2008). On these roadways, the City shall ensure
     that improvements to construct the ultimate roadway system as shown in this Circulation
     Element are completed, with the recognition that maintenance of the desired level of service
     may not be achievable.
         Implementation Measure C1-3.1
         Develop criteria to determine which roadway segments and intersections will not achieve
         the desired level of service standard.
         Implementation Measure C1-3.2
         Pursue all feasible circulation system alternatives that reduce the potential for street
         segments in the Downtown commercial core to operate below LOS D as a result of
         competing commercial developments in other areas of the City.
         Implementation Measure C1-3.3
         Develop an additional east-west collector road, or restrict the intensity of commercial and
         industrial uses north of State Route 33 (Polk Street/Jayne Avenue) from Merced Avenue to
         Juniper Ridge Boulevard, to ensure that cumulative development in that area does not
         result in the need to widen State Route 33 to six lanes or lower LOS below D on that
         section.
     Policy C1-4
     Maintain and improve existing circulation and transportation facilities.
         Implementation Measure C1-4.1
         Coordinate with Coalinga Transit and Fresno County Rural Transit Agency to provide safe
         and efficient transit system for local and regional travel, particularly for youth, elderly,
         low-income or disabled persons.
         Implementation Measure C1-4.2
         Establish and implement a street and sidewalk repair program.
         Implementation Measure C1-4.3
         Realign offset intersections where they create traffic problems.
City of Coalinga                                                                            General Plan

Chapter 4 - Circulation Element
         Implementation Measure C1-4.4
         Establish a funding mechanism to ensure construction of the proposed circulation system
         consistent with the findings of the 2025 General Plan Update.
         Implementation Measure C1-4.5
         Establish a funding mechanism to ensure construction of the proposed circulation system
         consistent with the findings of the 2025 General Plan Update.
         Implementation Measure C1-4.6
         The City shall require new development proposals, including Public Works projects, to
         include an evaluation of whether or not roundabouts could be used as an alternative to
         stop sign or traffic signal controlled intersections.
    Policy C1-5
    The City shall identify necessary improvements for all roads and streets in its planning area and
    implement measures and development plans to implement those improvements.
         Implementation Measure C1-5.1
         Prepare a Feasibility Study and develop a bridge impact fee to fund a bridge and roadway
         improvements for a north/south connector from Phelps Avenue to Jayne Avenue.
         Implementation Measure C1-5.2
         Develop and implement with Caltrans a SR 33 Access Management Plan which would
         identify the location of future access.
         Implementation Measure C1-5.3
         Update the traffic mitigation fee to include the cost of constructing SR 33 improvement in
         those locations where fronting development is unlikely and roadway widening will likely
         be necessary at the General Plan built out.
         Implementation Measure C1-5.4
         The City and Caltrans should complete a plan line study for SR 33 from Cambridge
         Avenue to Fifth Street to identify the configuration and limits of ultimate improvements to
         SR 33 through the developed areas of Coalinga.
         Implementation Measure C1-5.5
         Conduct a plan line study for the area to define the limits of future construction. The study
         should confirm a strategy that would close off the westbound Van Ness street approach
         and reconstruct First Street to extend easterly from SR 33 to the Coalinga School farms
         project area. Signalizing the SR 33/Van Ness Street/ First Street intersection should be

INTRODUCTION
The Public Safety Element helps guide land use decisions by identifying potential safety hazards
and establishing appropriate policies to protect life and property in the Coalinga area. The most
common hazards known to occur in Coalinga are associated with fire, geology and seismicity,
flooding and hazardous materials. The Public Safety Element stresses preventive action, but for
unpredictable circumstances such as an earthquake or hazardous materials spill, an organized and
timely emergency response will also be guided by the Element.
Emergency preparedness is necessary to avoid or minimize loss of life and property due to natural
and technological disasters; to reduce social, cultural, environmental and economic costs of
disasters; and to assist and encourage the rapid recovery from catastrophic events. An important
part of preparedness is careful assessment of risks before an emergency occurs. Response
activities focus on saving lives, preventing injury and reducing property damage. Critical facilities,
which provide emergency assistance after a major disaster, include police and fire stations,
schools, hospitals and roadways designated as evacuation routes. A discussion of fire flow and
water storage capacity is included in the Public Facilities and Services Element.
ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
This Element is organized into three main sections described below:
        Introduction. This section includes an overview of the contents of the Safety, Air Quality

REQUIREMENTS OF THE SAFETY, AIR QUALITY AND NOISE ELEMENT
Safety Element
The Safety Element covers issues mandated by State Government Code §65302(g) specifically:
    "...the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of
    seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, tsunami, seiches, and dam failure; slope
    instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic
    hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with § 2690) of the Public Resources
    Code, and other geologic hazards knows to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and
    urban fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic
    hazards. It shall also address evacuation routes, peakload water supply requirements, and
    minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified
    geologic and fire hazards.... "
This Element has been prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of State law.
Specific topics addressed include:
        Seismic hazards, including surface faulting, seismic shaking, ground failure, and
         liquefaction
        Flooding and flood hazards
        Wildland and urban fire hazards
        Manmade hazards
        Disaster Planning
The Safety Element is expected to affect land use policies and hence is coordinated with the Land
Use Element. Considerations included in this Element may also be applicable to Open Space and
Conservation, Public Facilities and Services, Housing and Circulation Elements in that it discusses
hazards that may affect decision-making in these issue areas.

                                          Chapter 5 - Safety, Air Quality and Noise Element
Air Quality Element
The State of California does not require an Air Quality Element as part of a General Plan.
However, due to the continuing air pollution problem in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (Basin),
the State Legislature added Section 65302.1 to the California Government Code in 2003. This
section requires cities and counties in the San Joaquin Valley to amend appropriate elements of
general plans to include data, analysis, comprehensive goals, policies and feasible implementation
strategies to improve air quality no later than one year after the first revision of their housing
elements that occurs after January 1, 2004. Cities and counties are required to submit these air
quality amendments to the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) at
least 45 days prior to the adoption of those amendments, and the District then has 30 days to
return comments and advice. Additionally, recent legislation has prompted the California
Attorney General to direct agencies to address the issue of climate change in their General Plans.
Climate change is presently thought to be both naturally occurring and induced by increases in
the amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the earth’s
atmosphere attributable to the burning of fossil fuels. Greenhouse gases are not currently (200)
regulated as pollutants, although the State of California has adopted legislation seeking to roll back
emissions to 1990 levels for some major contributors (such as industry). The Air Quality Element
is intended to help the City, as well as the Basin, improve its air quality to meet State and Federal
air quality requirements and growing climate change concerns.
Noise Element
The Noise Element provides a policy framework for addressing potential noise impacts in the
planning process. Its purpose is to minimize future noise conflicts. The Noise Element is related
to the Land Use, Housing, Circulation and Open Space Elements. Recognition of the
interrelationship between noise and these four mandated elements is necessary to prepare an
internally consistent General Plan and to initiate changes that will reduce noise exposure to
acceptable levels.
SAFETY - BACKGROUND AND SETTING
Safety concerns for the City of Coalinga fall into two main categories: natural hazards, which
includes seismic, flooding and wildfires; and manmade hazardous materials and urban fire.
NATURAL HAZARDS
The City of Coalinga is located within Pleasant Valley, a northwest to southeast trending alluvial
basin. Pleasant Valley is bounded on the west by the central Coast Ranges (Diablo Range) and on
the east by a series of hills associated with anticlinal folding. An anticline is an arch of stratified
rock in which the layers bend downward in opposite directions from the crest, with the oldest
strata at the center producing mountain peaks. These hills (Anticline Ridge, Guijarrel Hills,
City of Coalinga                                                                            General Plan
June 2009                                                                                       Page 5-3

Chapter 5 - Safety, Air Quality and Noise Element
Kettleman Hills, and Lost Hills) separate Pleasant Valley from the San Joaquin Valley to the east.
These anticlinal structures act as traps for petroleum.
The western and southern margins of the San Joaquin Basin consist of folded and faulted
Mesozoic basement rocks and upper Jurassic through Quaternary sedimentary rocks. Structural
geology of the Coalinga area is dominated by a large synclinal structure (folded rock structure in
which the sides dip or incline down toward a common line or plane) and several large anticlines
that trend in a northwest to southeast direction. The alluvial basin known as Pleasant Valley is
formed within this synclinal structure.
Sediments exposed in the Coalinga area include Holocene alluvial deposits, comprised of layers
of sand, clay and silt. Sedimentary rocks exposed in the hills on the west and east sides of
Pleasant Valley consist of the Pleistocene (two million to 11,000 years old) Tulare Formation; and
Pliocene (two to 13 million years old) Etchegion and San Joaquin Formations; and Miocene (13 to
25 million years old) Temblor, Monterey, Big Blue, Santa Margarita and Reef Ridge Formations.
Seismic Hazards
The planning area is located within a seismically active region of California. Numerous mapped
faults including the San Andreas, Pond-Poso Creek, and White Wolf faults, located west and south
of the City, could produce significant ground shaking. Active faults surrounding the San Andreas
Fault have produced large earthquakes in the last century and are expected to produce similar
large earthquakes in the future. The hills near Coalinga contain evidence of deep faulting in the
Anticline Ridge area. Regional faults are depicted on Figure 5-1.
The 1983 Coalinga earthquake, centered eight miles northeast of the City, measured 6.7 on the
Richter scale and caused widespread damage to structures. The earthquake is thought to be
associated with a geologic feature often referred to as the “Coast Ranges-Sierran block boundary
zone.” This feature generally consists of a family of faults that appear to border the east side of the
Coast Ranges. Many of these faults are likely to be active “blind-thrust” faults similar to the
structure that produced the 1983 earthquake. Two similar type earthquakes are thought to have
occurred in 1892 near the Winters-Vacaville area adjacent to the Sacramento Valley. In addition,
the 1985 Avenal earthquake indicates similar-type faulting in the Kettleman Hills region just
southeast of Coalinga. A review of historic earthquake activity from 1850 to 1995 indicates that
seven earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater have occurred within a 70-mile radius of the City
of Coalinga. There have also been 15 earthquakes with magnitudes between 5.5 and 6.0 within
the 70-mile radius.
The two principal seismic hazards to property in the Coalinga area are damage to structures and
foundations due to strong ground shaking, and surface rupture of earth materials along fault traces.
To protect structures from the hazards of surface ground rupture, the California Geological Survey
under the State-mandated Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act of 1994 (formerly the
Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act of 1972), has delineated “Earthquake Fault Zones” along
the surface traces of active faults.

The zones vary in width, but average about one-quarter mile wide. An active fault, as defined by
State law, is a fault that has been proven by direct geologic evidence to indicate movement within
the last 11,000 years. A fault that has been proven by direct geologic methods to have not moved in
the last 11,000 years is not active. The potentially active designation includes those faults that were
active within the last two million years (Quaternary Period), but have not been studied in sufficient
detail to be classified as either active or inactive.
Portions of Fresno County near the Coalinga area have been zoned for special studies as outlined
in the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act. These areas are located along the Nunez Fault,
located approximately six miles northwest of Coalinga. Several secondary phenomena are
associated generally with strong seismic shaking, especially in areas characterized by a relatively
shallow ground water table, and underlain by loose, cohesionless soil deposits. These secondary
seismic hazards include liquefaction, seismically induced settlement and ground lurching.
         Ground shaking - The intensity of ground shaking at a given location depends primarily on
          the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter to the site, and the response
          characteristics of the soils or bedrock units underlying the site. The San Andreas Fault is
          potentially capable of producing the most intense ground accelerations at the site. A
          maximum credible earthquake of Richter magnitude 7.8 on the San Andreas Fault would
          produce seismic shaking capable of significantly damaging structures and infrastructure in
          the area.
         Liquefaction - Liquefaction is the sudden loss of strength that occurs when loose,
          cohesionless, water saturated soils are subjected to strong seismic ground motion.
          Structures built on these soils tilt or sink when the soils liquefy. Liquefaction occurs in an
          earthquake-prone area underlain by alluvium and where the ground water table is less than
          50 feet below the surface. Given the depth of the ground water table in the Coalinga area
          (300 to 400 feet) the potential for liquefaction is considered very low.
         Seismically Induced Settlement - Strong ground shaking can cause settlement by allowing
          sediment particles to become more tightly packed, thereby reducing pore space.
          Unconsolidated, poorly packed alluvial deposits are especially susceptible to this
          phenomenon. Inadequately compacted artificial fills may also experience seismically-
          induced settlement. Following the 1983 Coalinga earthquake, several damage assessment
          studies were initiated. Based on the settlement values reported after the 1983 event, the
          potential for seismic settlement and/or differential compaction within the planning area is
          considered minimal.1

Flooding
The City of Coalinga is located within Pleasant Valley, a northwest to southeast trending alluvial
basin. Drainage in the Pleasant Valley is characterized by ephemeral lakes and streambed basins
that are generally dry in the summer and fall.
Los Gatos and Warthan Creeks flow easterly out of the southern hills of the Diablo Range and
converge at the eastern edge of the Coalinga City limits. In the upper reaches of the watershed
the stream channels are typically wide, shallow, and meandering. Near the City, both Warthan
and Los Gatos Creeks have been altered to increase capacity and reduce the risk of flooding. East
of the City, the Los Gatos Creek channel has been scraped and shaped. Warthan Creek is
channelized within the Sphere of Influence (SOI) and bordered on both sides by levees. Farmers
completed most of the channelization and levee work in the early 1900s. After the 1983
earthquake, tons of concrete rubble and debris were dumped along both banks of Warthan Creek
for bank stabilization.
Jacalitos Creek converges with Los Gatos Creek approximately five miles east of the City limits. In
the far southeast corner of the proposed Area of Interest (AOI), Zapato Chino Creek flows through
the Palvarado Gap into the San Joaquin Valley. These creeks all flow northeast within the Arroyo
Pasajero watershed. The Arroyo Pasajero watershed has a long history of flooding including
major events in 1958, 1969 and 1995. Intense and infrequent winter storms have resulted in
significant amounts of surface water runoff. Flood-producing rainfall typically occurs when
preceding rains have saturated the Pleasant Valley, resulting in surging flood flows lasting for
several days.
Portions of the City of Coalinga, the proposed SOI, and the proposed AOI are within the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain
is indicated in the Flood Hazard Overlay, identified on Figure 5-2, and subject to the provisions of
the Flood Hazard Overlay as described in the Land Use Element and the Floodplain Management
Ordinance. Any structures constructed within the designated flood zone would be subject to the
potential risk of flood damage, including inundation or foundation damage during severe storms.
Storm Drainage
The storm drain system in Coalinga consists of several independent networks of storm drain inlets
and pipes that either discharge into four permanent storm drain basins or the Warthan or Los
Gatos Creeks. Storm drainage in Coalinga is a gravity flow system, where flows through the pipes
do not require the use of pump stations or lift stations. The existing storm drain system consists of
pipes up to 48-inches in diameter and twelve drainage zones. Several portions of the storm drain
system are severely undersized and the system relies on aboveground surface flow through street
curbs and gutters as a means of stormwater conveyance.

At the West Hills College school farm located in the northeast portion of the City, open drainage
swales have been created as a means to convey stormwater from the City to a pond adjacent to
Warthan Creek. The pipe networks in the downtown area discharge at these drainage swales and
the runoff is directed out to the pond. The runoff from the older residential development east of
downtown and south of the West Hills College school farm also discharges into the open drainage
swales via street overflow through gutters and some pipes.
Storm Drain System Master Plan
In 2002, the City authorized Boyle Engineering to prepare a Storm Drainage Master Plan to
identify existing storm drain system deficiencies and recommend necessary improvements.
Proposed improvements to the existing storm drain system include the construction of new
facilities that parallel existing facilities or new facilities in those areas that currently do not have
any storm drain service. In general, the proposed improvements aim towards providing storm
drainage in those portions of the City currently without any storm drain facilities. The proposed
improvements will be designed to convey stormwater to the east towards the existing West Hills
Basin, which will ultimately provide storage capacity for the majority of Coalinga. The storm
drain pipes will be designed to have capacity for the 10-year storm event. To be consistent with
the Fresno Metropolitan Flood Control District (FMFCD) basin design criteria, which is commonly
used in Fresno County, the basins will be sized for a 100-year, 10-day storm event.
Because the City is located near the downstream portion of the general watershed, Coalinga must
also manage the off-site watershed that passes through the City. The surrounding mountains to the
north and west slope towards the City, therefore, the City currently experiences tremendous
amounts of flow from the west. However, the magnitude of the off-site flows does not reasonably
permit the use of standard storm drain pipes. The magnitude of the off-site runoff entering the City
is in the hundreds of cubic feet per second during a 100-year storm event, and such large flows
compounded with the runoff generated from within the City will require unreasonable pipe sizes.
According to the Storm Drainage Master Plan, the most practical method to manage the off-site
runoff is to prevent it from entering the storm drain system within the City. The off-site runoff
from the mountains to the west will be intercepted by means of an open-channel and berm to be
located west of Monterey Avenue. The channel is intended to interrupt the existing flow pattern
by redirecting the flow that currently passes through the City to the south, into Warthan Creek.
Wildfire
Wildland fires also pose potential hazards in the hilly areas where chaparral and other vegetation
are present. Wildland fires can destroy large tracts of land as well as structures. The Irish Hills,
located adjacent to the planning area, are considered a “Wildland Area that May Contain
Substantial Forest Fire Risks and Hazards” by the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection. The Coalinga Fire Department has adopted a weed abatement program to reduce
property damage from wildland fires. The wildland fire map is presented as Figure 5-3.

MANMADE HAZARDS
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials are present throughout the City, but are widely varied in terms of quantity
and type. Businesses using hazardous materials may include dry cleaners or automotive service
shops that routinely utilize solvents and other potentially hazardous substances. Households also
utilize and store materials that could be considered hazardous, although usually not of the same
type and quantity as commercial and agricultural uses. There is no major manufacturing or other
heavy industrial uses within the City Limits. The absence of a heavy industrial base significantly
reduces the amount of hazardous materials present within the City, thereby reducing the risk of
exposure in the event of upset conditions. Oil production activities and operations in the outlying
areas may transport hazardous materials through the City.
Agricultural operations in the area surrounding the City regularly store and use a variety of
pesticides and herbicides. Historical pest control data for cotton and hardy row crops, as well as
data provided by the Fresno County Agricultural Commissioner’s office, indicate a variety of
pesticides have been used on surrounding cropland. In general, the pesticides used were
defoliants and insecticides. None of the pesticides reportedly used are persistent in soil, and if
they were applied according to manufacturer’s directions, should be at residual levels below that
which is harmful to human dermal contact. It should be noted that pesticide mixing or storage
areas can have much higher residual concentrations and, although undocumented, such areas
may exist.
Urban Fire
The City of Coalinga is susceptible to both urban and wildland fire hazards. Fires occurring in the
urban area have the potential to destroy property and structures, and cause injury or loss of life.
Urban land uses with inappropriate or outdated building materials and the native landscape are
potential fire hazards. Housing units constructed with wood shake roofs or wood siding present
potential fire hazards. Many of the City’s older buildings have been rebuilt to newer fire codes,
thus improving the City’s fire safety.

A   IR QUALITY   -B  ACKGROUND AND SETTING
Air pollution in the Basin results from human activities that cause emissions, coupled with natural
phenomenon that stimulates the formation of unhealthy air. Mountains on the east, west and
south surround the San Joaquin Valley. In addition, the San Joaquin Valley experiences long,
sunny summers and relatively short, foggy winters. These features contribute to local climate
episodes such as frequent temperature inversions (i.e., temperature increases associated with
higher altitudes).
The primary human causes of air pollution in the San Joaquin Valley are mobile sources (cars and
trucks), oil production and agricultural activities. Rapid population growth and the associated
increases in traffic, urbanization and industrial activity is the most significant factor in declining air
quality in the Basin. Overall, oil production has been declining since 1985, resulting in decreased
emissions associated with the oil industry.
GEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY
The California Air Resources Board (ARB) has divided the state into regional air basins according
to topographic air drainage features. The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (herein referred to as Basin)
is the second largest air basin in the state. The Basin is defined by the Sierra Nevada Range to the
east (8,000 to 14,000 feet in elevation) and the Coastal Ranges to the west (4,500 feet in
elevation). The San Joaquin Valley could be considered a “bowl” open only to the north.
Although marine air generally flows into the basin from the San Joaquin River Delta, the region’s
topographic features restrict air movement through and out of the Basin. The Coastal Ranges
hinder wind access into the San Joaquin Valley from the west, the Tehachapi’s prevent southerly
passage of airflow, and the high Sierra Nevada range is a significant barrier to the east. Most of
the surrounding mountains are above the normal height of summer inversion layers (1,500 to
3,000 feet). These topographic features result in weak airflow, which becomes blocked vertically
by high barometric pressure over the San Joaquin Valley. For this reason, the Basin is highly
susceptible to air pollution accumulation.
CLIMATE
Local climate conditions can exacerbate the air quality problem. Wind speed and direction play
an important role in dispersion and transport of air pollutants. Wind can help create or break up
air pollution. For example, ozone is classified as a “regional” pollutant in part due to the time
required for ozone formation. Ozone precursors can be transported well away from the source
area before ozone concentrations peak. Other primary pollutants (e.g. carbon monoxide) may
form high concentrations when wind speed is low.
During the summer, wind usually originates at the northern end of the San Joaquin Valley and
flows in a south-southeasterly direction through the valley, through Tehachapi pass, and into the

Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County. During the winter, wind occasionally
originates from the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley and flows in a north-northwesterly
direction. During the winter the valley also experiences light, variable winds of less than 10 miles
per hour. Low wind speeds, combined with low inversion layers in winter, create a climate
conducive to high carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations.
Wind speed and direction change throughout the day. During the day, north-northwesterly winds
prevail. However, in the late evening through early morning, wind flow is affected by cooler
drainage winds from the surrounding mountains and the wind flow reverses direction. This
interruption of northwesterly wind, including the evening and morning transition between the two
wind flow patterns, is known as an eddy. This phenomenon adds to the complexity of regional
wind flow and pollutant transport within the Basin.
The Basin has an “inland Mediterranean” climate averaging over 260 sunny days per year. The
valley floor is characterized by warm, dry summers and cooler winters. The average mean
temperature over a 30-year period is 65 degrees. High daily temperatures in summer average 95
degrees in the valley. The winter average daily low temperature is 45 degrees. Since 1960, the
San Joaquin Valley has averaged 106 days a year of 90 degrees or hotter, and 40 days a year of
100 degrees or hotter. The daily summer temperature variation can be as high as 30 degrees.
Temperature and solar radiation are important in the chemistry of ozone formation (a major
component of smog). Ozone is formed in a photochemical reaction requiring sunlight.
Generally, the higher the temperature, the more ozone formed. However, extremely hot
temperatures can “lift” or “break” the inversion layer, dispersing the ozone.
INVERSION LAYERS AND AIR POLLUTION
Inversion layers are formed in the atmosphere when temperature increases with elevation, or
when a mass of warm dry air settles over a mass of cooler air near the ground. Inversion layers
are significant in determining both ozone formation and CO concentrations. Ozone and its
precursors will mix and react to produce higher concentrations under an inversion, and inversions
trap and hold directly emitted pollutants such as CO. In short, inversions and air pollution
literally do not mix.
Meteorological data are used to assess the potential for air pollution accumulation. For example,
weather factors that may restrict horizontal and vertical air movement are important. Vertical
movement lifts the pollutants through a thicker layer of air, while horizontal movement spreads
the pollutants over a wider geographic area. Temperature inversions, which occur in a stable
atmosphere of warm air over cooler air, hinder the upward dispersion of pollutants. The Basin
experiences two common types of inversions: radiation inversion and subsidence inversion.
Radiation inversions are caused by nighttime cooling of an air layer near the valley surface. It
extends upward several hundred feet and occurs during the nighttime and early morning. During
a radiation inversion, little vertical mixing occurs. The inversion is destroyed when the sun heats
the ground, which in turn heats the lower layers of air. The ground-level air then floats up

through the inversion layer. The inversions are more persistent during the winter, when they
occur nearer to the valley floor.
Subsidence inversions are caused by downward vertical motion. As air descends, it warms and as
a result, becomes warmer than the air beneath it. This limits vertical mixing, which can only
occur when the air below is warmer than the air above.
AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Federal Standards
The Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA, 1970, amended 1977 and 1990) required the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for several air
pollutants, based on human heath and welfare criteria. Two types of standards have been
established: primary standards, which protect public heath, and secondary standards, which
protect the public welfare from non-health-related adverse effects such as visibility reduction.
Primary standards have been established for the following “criteria” air pollutants, so called
because they were established on the basis of health criteria:
        Carbon Monoxide (CO)
        Ozone (O3)
        Respirable particulate matter (less than 10 microns in diameter) (PM10)
        Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
        Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
        Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
        Lead (Pb)
The primary standards are intended to protect, with an adequate margin of safety, those persons
most susceptible to respiratory distress, such as people suffering from asthma or other illness, the
elderly, very young children, or people engaged in strenuous work or exercise. All of the above
standards, except carbon monoxide, also have some form of secondary standard. Generally, the
secondary standard is the same as the primary standard. Air pollutants negatively affect human
health, plants, animals, and building materials. Some of these effects are temporary, and others
are permanent.

State Standards
The FCAA requires areas with air quality violating the NAAQS to prepare an air quality control
plan referred to as the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The SIP contains the strategies and control
measures that states will use to attain the NAAQS. The FCAA amendments of 1990 require states
containing areas that violate the NAAQS (such as the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin) to revise their
SIPs to incorporate additional control measures to reduce air pollution. The SIP is a living
document that is periodically modified to reflect the latest emissions inventories, planning
documents, rules, and regulations of Air Basins as reported by the agencies with jurisdiction over
them. The EPA reviews SIPs to determine if they conform to the mandates of the FCAA
amendments and will achieve air quality goals when implemented. If the EPA determines a SIP to
be inadequate, it may prepare a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the nonattainment area and
impose additional control measures.
States are required to develop and implement air pollution control plans designed to achieve and
maintain the standards established by EPA. States may also develop their own standards, provided
the state standards are at least as stringent as the EPA standards. California has established its own
standards known as the California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS). The California
standards are more stringent than the Federal standards, especially for PM10 and sulfur dioxide.
California has also set individual standards for visibility, sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl
chloride.
Table 5-2, presented below, lists California and Federal ambient air quality standards. Note that
California has more standards and also stricter standards for some air pollutants.

                                             Chapter 5 - Safety, Air Quality and Noise Element
Climate Change
Below is a description of recent (as of 2007) state regulations that specifically address greenhouse
gas emissions and global climate change. At the time this General Plan Update, there are no
regulations setting ambient air quality emissions standards for greenhouse gases.
        ASSEMBLY BILL 1493 – In 2002, then-Governor Gray Davis signed Assembly Bill (AB)
         1493. AB 1493 requires that the California Air Resources Board (ARB) develop and adopt,
         by January 1, 2005, regulations that achieve “the maximum feasible reduction of
         greenhouse gases emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty truck and other vehicles
         determined by the ARB to be vehicles whose primary use is noncommercial personal
         transportation in the state.”
        EXECUTIVE ORDER S-3-05 – Executive Order S-3-05, which was signed by Governor
         Schwarzenegger in 2005, proclaims that California is vulnerable to the impacts of climate
         change. It declares that increased temperatures could reduce the Sierra’s snowpack, further
         exacerbate California’s air quality problems, and potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To
         combat those concerns, the Executive Order established total greenhouse gas emission
         targets. Specifically, emissions are to be reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, the 1990 level
         by 2020, and to 80% below the 1990 level by 2050. The Executive Order directed the
         Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) to coordinate a
         multi-agency effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the target levels. The Secretary
         will also submit biannual reports to the governor and state legislature describing: (1)
         progress made toward reaching the emission targets; (2) impacts of global warming on
         California’s resources; and (3) mitigation and adaptation plans to combat these impacts. To
         comply with the Executive Order, the Secretary of the CalEPA created a Climate Action
         Team (CAT) made up of members from various state agencies and commission. CAT
         released its first report in March 2006. The report proposed to achieve the targets by
         building on voluntary actions of California businesses, local government and community
         actions, as well as through state incentive and regulatory programs.
        ASSEMBLY BILL 32, THE CALIFORNIA GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT OF 2006
         – In September 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, the California
         Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be
         reduced to 1990 levels by the year 2020. This reduction will be accomplished through an
         enforceable statewide cap on GHG emissions that will be phased in starting in 2012. To
         effectively implement the cap, AB 32 directs ARB to develop and implement regulations to
         reduce statewide GHG emissions from stationary sources. AB 32 specifies that regulations
         adopted in response to AB 1493 should be used to address GHG emissions from vehicles.
         However, AB 32 also includes language stating that if the AB 1493 regulations cannot be
         implemented, then ARB should develop new regulations to control vehicle GHG emissions
         under the authorization of AB 32.

June 2009                                                                                     Page 5-21

Chapter 5 - Safety, Air Quality and Noise Element
         AB 32 requires that ARB adopt a quantified cap on GHG emissions representing 1990
         emissions levels and disclose how it arrives at the cap; institute a schedule to meet the
         emissions cap; and develop tracking, reporting, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure
         that the state achieves reductions in GHG emissions necessary to meet the cap. AB 32 also
         includes guidance to institute emissions reductions in an economically efficient manner
         and conditions to ensure that businesses and consumers are not unfairly affected by the
         reductions.
        SENATE BILL 1368 – SB 1368 is the companion bill of AB 32 and was signed by Governor
         Schwarzenegger in September 2006. SB 1368 requires the California Public Utilities
         Commission (PUC) to establish a greenhouse gas emission performance standard for
         baseload generation from investor owned utilities by February 1, 2007. The California
         Energy Commission (CEC) must establish a similar standard for local publicly owned
         utilities by June 30, 2007. These standards cannot exceed the greenhouse gas emission rate
         from a baseload combined-cycle natural gas fired plant. The legislation further requires that
         all electricity provided to California, including imported electricity, must be generated from
         plants that meet the standards set by the PUC and CEC.
Regional – San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) Standards
Each Air Pollution Control District in California is designated by the California Air Resources
Board (ARB) as “attainment”, “nonattainment,” or “unclassified” for each of the ten pollutants for
which CAAQS have been established: PM10, PM2.5, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, CO,
sulfates, lead, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, and visibility reducing particles. Attainment of the
State standard is determined by a district’s highest air monitor reading.
        Nonattainment Designation – Nonattainment Designation means the pollutant
         concentration in the district exceeded the State standard established for that pollutant at
         least once in the last three years. A district with a nonattainment status is required to
         develop plans for attaining and maintaining the standards for each nonattainment pollutant
         or its precursor. These plans are discussed in the next section, “Air Quality Plans.”
        Attainment Designation – Attainment Designation means that the State standard for that
         pollutant has not been violated in the designated district. However, this does not mean
         that the district is exempt from air quality programs. To maintain the State standards, the
         district must adopt all rules and regulations necessary to protect ambient air quality.
        Unclassified Designation – Unclassified Designation means not enough data exists on
         which to base a decision on attainment or nonattainment. An unclassified status signals the
         need for additional data collection and analysis.
State and Federal attainment status designations for the SJVAPCD are summarized in Table 5-3,
presented on the following page.

In December 2004, the EPA took final action to designate attainment and nonattainment areas for
fine particles, PM2.5. On July 6, 2006 the EPA proposed to find the Basin in attainment with
Federal PM10 standards. The proposed action is based on three years (2003-2005) of clean air
monitoring data for this pollutant. The final decision will be made following submission of public
comments.
As a severe nonattainment area for ozone, the San Joaquin Valley is subject to the most stringent
requirements in the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) and must apply all feasible measures to
reduce emissions. The Air Resources Board (ARB) has determined that the San Joaquin Valley is
both a receptor and contributor of transported air pollutants. The Basin has been identified by the
ARB as a receptor of air pollution from the San Francisco Bay Area and Broader Sacramento air
basins, and as a contributor of air pollution to the Broader Sacramento, Southeast Desert, and
Great Basin Valley air basins. Since the Basin has been identified as a source of air pollution to
other areas, additional mitigation requirements are mandated by the CCAA. The key CCAA
requirements for the SJVAPCD include:
        Provide for five percent per year reductions in nonattainment emissions, or include “every
         feasible measure” in the SJBAPCD Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP);
        Establish a permitting program that achieves no net increase in stationary source emissions;
        Develop a strategy to reduce vehicle trips, use and miles traveled;
        Increase average vehicle ridership to 1.5 persons per vehicle during commute hours by
         January 1, 1999;
        Reduce population exposure to nonattainment pollutants by 25 percent by December 31,
         1994;

                                          Chapter 5 - Safety, Air Quality and Noise Element
        Establish Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BARCT) requirements for all
         permitted sources, with BARCT rules adopted for at least 75 percent of the permitted
         inventory by December 31, 1993; and
        Develop indirect and area source programs.
Air Quality Plans
The SJVAPCD has recently completed the following air quality attainment plans: Extreme Ozone
(1-hour) Attainment Demonstration Plan (2004) and PM10 Attainment Demonstration Plan (2006).
In coordination with the California Air Resources Board (ARB) and other north/central California
air districts, the SJVAPCD has begun development of the 8-hour Ozone Attainment
Demonstration Plan. Submittal of the 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration plan to the EPA is
anticipated to occur prior to June 15, 2007. In December 2004, the EPA took final action to
designate attainment and nonattainment areas for fine particles, PM2.5. The Basin was designated
as nonattainment and the SJVAPCD will submit a plan to meet PM2.5 standards by April, 2008.
Air districts continuously monitor their progress in implementing attainment plans and must
periodically report to the ARB and EPA. The districts also periodically report to the ARB and EPA
and revise the attainment plans to reflect new conditions and requirements in accordance with
schedules mandated by the CCAA and the FCAA. The goals and policies of the Coalinga Air
Quality Element are designed to maintain consistency with potential revisions to State and Federal
mandates.
The SJVAPCD implements air quality plans primarily by adopting rules and regulations. The
California Health and Safety Code authorize districts to adopt rules and regulations to pursue civil
and criminal penalties for violations. The law allows for fines and civil penalties of up to $50,000
per day and imprisonment in the County jail for up to one year. The SJVAPCD has adopted rules
on sources ranging from architectural coatings (Rule 4601) to orchard heaters (Rule 4303) to
rubber tire manufacturing (Rule 4681). The SJVAPCD rulebook contains more than 130 rules, and
more are scheduled for development over the next few years.
The SJVAPCD has adopted several rules applying to sources never before regulated in the San
Joaquin Valley. Rule 4901 (Residential Wood Burning Fireplaces and Wood Heaters), calls for
voluntary curtailment of wood burning on “No Burn Days” and the prohibition of sale of non-EPA-
certified wood heaters within the SJVAPCD jurisdiction. Rule 4902 (Residential Water Heaters),
requires new residential water heaters sold in the San Joaquin Valley to meet lower NOx emission
standards.
The SJVAPCD has identified three strategies for reducing emissions generated by indirect sources.
These strategies include enhanced SJVAPCD CEQA participation; implementation of a new and
modified indirect source review program; and encouragement of all cities and counties in the San
Joaquin Valley to adopt an Air Quality Element or air quality policies as part of their General
City of Coalinga                                                                            General Plan
June 2009                                                                                     Page 5-25

Chapter 5 - Safety, Air Quality and Noise Element
Plans. The SJVAPCD now actively reviews and comments on CEQA documents prepared by lead
agencies and suggests mitigation measures to reduce air quality impacts.
The SJVAPCD has undertaken steps to comply with Assembly Bill (AB) 2061 (Polanco). This bill
requires assessment of socioeconomic impacts of certain new and modified rules put forth by the
SJVAPCD, plus a good faith effort to minimize adverse effects on industry and the public. Where
appropriate, the SJVAPCD now examines its proposed activities for socioeconomic effects.
Legislation such as AB 1807 (Tanner, Air Toxics Act), AB 2588 (Air Toxics “Hot Spots”
Information and Assessment Act), AB 3205 (Toxic Emissions Near Schools), SB 1731 (“Hot Spots”
Risk Reduction Mandates), and the FCAA Amendments (Title III) mandate the SJVAPCD to
implement a comprehensive toxic air emission program. AB 2588 requires the SJVAPCD to
develop a uniform approach to catalogue the emissions of 729 toxic substances in the valley.
The SJVAPCD has also adopted a number of voluntary air quality programs. Examples include a
Smoking Vehicles Program and the Air Quality Education Program. Although these programs are
voluntary, they provide an important link to local government and the public. The Smoking
Vehicles Program started as a pilot program in San Joaquin County in 1992 and has been
expanded to cover the entire San Joaquin Valley.
City Standards
The SJVAPCD includes eight counties and 59 incorporated cities. Most strategies for reducing air
pollution emissions are most effectively implemented through local jurisdictions. For example,
local government’s responsibility for air quality increased significantly with the passage of the
CCAA and the FCAA. Both of these pieces of legislation emphasize the need to reduce motor
vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled at the local level. The City of Coalinga’s responsibilities
for air quality cover four areas:
        Land use planning;
        Reviewing and mitigating the environmental impacts of development projects;
        Developing and maintaining the transportation infrastructure in the community; and
        Implementing local air quality program such as commute-based trip reduction and
         coordinated transit routes.
Each of these responsibilities is discussed below:
        Land Use Planning - The City of Coalinga has the authority and responsibility to approve or
         not approve development projects. As part of its duties, the City implements the General
         Plan. The Air Quality Element is not a mandatory element; however, Section 65302.1 of
         the State Government Code (adopted in 2003) requires cities and counties in the San
         Joaquin Valley to amend appropriate elements of general plans to include data, analysis,
         comprehensive goals, policies, and feasible implementation strategies to improve air

         quality. The Coalinga Air Quality Element must be consistent with the other Coalinga
         General Plan Elements.
        To implement the General Plan, the City adopts standards for all facets of development.
         Most well-known of these standards is the Zoning Ordinance, which designates the type,
         location, and mix of uses; and controls features such as building height, setbacks from
         streets and lot lines, landscaping requirements, parking requirements, and more. The
         Subdivision Ordinance sets standards for street and lot designs, dedication requirements,
         and financing of public improvements. The Building Code provides standards for
         construction, including energy efficiency requirements, structural standards, electrical
         standards, plumbing standards, and related requirements. These ordinances and standards
         provide an effective means for implementing design and facility-based air quality control
         measures.
        CEQA Review - The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was enacted by the State
         legislature in 1970 and has been amended many times. CEQA applies to local government
         initiated plans, projects and regulations, and to private projects requiring discretionary
         approval from a State or local agency. For example, for this Coalinga General Plan Update,
         an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared. An EIR must inform governmental
         decision makers and the public about the potential significant environmental effects of
         proposed activities.
         CEQA allows the City to not approve a project if necessary to avoid one or more significant
         effects on the environment. This authority compels developers to include measures in their
         projects to mitigate potentially significant environmental impacts. The City is required to
         consult with, and request comments from, agencies that exercise authority over resources
         that may be affected by a project. The SJVAPCD has authority over most air quality issues
         and has assigned staff to review the air quality impacts of development projects. The
         SJVAPCD analyzes the project and recommends mitigation measures to reduce air quality
         impacts. The City may choose to require or not require the measures suggested by the
         SJVAPCD. However, for EIRs, when the City does not agree with recommendations and
         objections raised by the SJVAPCD, the City must prepare a written response that provides
         detailed reasons why specific comments were not accepted.
        Transportation Infrastructure - Planning and construction of transportation infrastructure is
         a highly cooperative effort involving local government, regional transportation planning
         agencies, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the Federal Department of
         Transportation, and others. The FCAA requires transportation plans to conform to the air
         quality goals of the State Implementation Plan (SIP). A SIP consists of the emissions
         standards for vehicular sources set by the ARB as well as attainment plans adopted by the
         air district and approved by the ARB. States must assure that transportation programs do
         not undermine the attainment of air quality standards.
        Local Air Quality Programs - The CCAA allows air districts to delegate the implementation
         of transportation control measures to any local agency as long as the following conditions
City of Coalinga                                                                           General Plan
June 2009                                                                                     Page 5-27

Chapter 5 - Safety, Air Quality and Noise Element
         are met: (1) the agency must submit an implementation plan to the district for approval; (2)
         the agency must adopt and implement measures at least as stringent as those in the
         district’s plan; and (3) the district must adopt procedures for reviewing the local agency’s
         performance in implementing the measures.
         One area where the City of Coalinga (and all other local governments) has an important
         role is in low-emission vehicle programs. Programs to convert City vehicle fleets, including
         buses, to cleaner burning fuels have significant air quality benefits and can provide a
         model to private industry.
The Air Quality Element goals, policies and implementation measures define how Coalinga will
work to reduce air pollution.
NOISE - BACKGROUND AND SETTING
Noise sources in Coalinga fall into three basic categories: motor vehicle and farm equipment,
aircraft, and stationary sources. Motor vehicle and farm equipment noise sources include
automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles. Motor vehicle noise is of concern due to the high number
of individual events which often create a sustained noise level and proximity to areas sensitive to
noise exposure. Historically, due to the relatively small amount of traffic in Coalinga, traffic-
related noise has not generally been significant problem. However, the traffic mix includes an
unusually high percentage of large trucks on the City’s major roadways, including Polk Street east
of Elm Avenue, Elm Avenue and Phelps Avenue. It is possible that residences near the right-of-
way of these streets may be exposed to excessive noise levels.
A comprehensive assessment of aircraft noise was undertaken as part of planning for the new
Coalinga Municipal Airport. The future 60 and 65 Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
contours (a measurement of the cumulative noise exposure in a community) do not extend past
the airport boundaries. No significant adverse noise impacts are anticipated from operation of the
new airport.
Stationary noise sources are generally larger facilities such as power plants, sewage treatment
plants, oil production facilities, agricultural operations and heavy industrial uses. No major heavy
industrial uses are located within the City; however, agricultural operations occurring in the area
generate noise from tractors, irrigation and crop-dusting. The existing sewage treatment plant is
located just east of the City; however, the treatment plant is planned to be relocated further east of
the City, near the Pleasant Valley State Prison. According to the Environmental Impact Report
(EIR) prepared for the relocation of the plant (City of Coalinga WWTP EIR prepared by Morro
Group April 2006), the nearest sensitive noise receptor (residence) is located approximately 2,100
feet from the plant site. Based on comparative noise readings, the new treatment plant is not
expected to produce significant noise impacts at the nearest sensitive receptor. Due to the
uncertainties of the final treatment plant design, the EIR recommends as mitigation that a qualified
acoustical engineer verify that the plant can maintain a maximum noise level of 60 dBA or lower

Page 5-28                                                                                      June 2009

at the nearest sensitive receptor. Gravel mining operations are to remain more than ½-mile from
any current or potential residential development.
The most common noise sensitive land uses include residential uses, schools, hospitals, nursing
and personal care facilities, churches, places of public assembly and entertainment, libraries,
museums, hotels, motels, bed and breakfast facilities, outdoor sports and recreation facilities and
offices. Table 5-6, presented below, specifies noise levels acceptable within each land use. The
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and Day-Night Noise Level (Ldn) are measures of the
24-hour noise environment.          They represent the constant A-weighted noise level (an
approximation of human sensitivity to sound) that would be measured if all the sound energy
received over the day were averaged. In order to account for the greater sensitivity of people to
noise at night, the CNEL weighting includes a five-decibel penalty on noise generated between
7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and a 10-decibel penalty between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the
following day. The Ldn includes only the 10-decibel weighting for late-night noise events. For
practical purposes, the two measures are equivalent for typical urban noise environments.
The most noise sensitive land uses in Coalinga are residential areas. Residential development is
considered especially noise sensitive because, 1) considerable time is spent by individuals at
home, 2) significant activities occur outdoors, and 3) sleep disturbance is most likely to occur in a
residential neighborhood. The Coalinga Regional Medical Center, located in the northeast part of
town, is also considered a sensitive receptor.

SAFETY, AIR QUALITY AND NOISE GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
The following goals put forward in the Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan (2005) define the values
and vision for the community and along with the guiding principles in Chapter 1 of this General
Plan, provide the foundation for safety, air quality and noise goals, policies and implementation
measures
        Protect Life and Property
        Public Awareness
        Partnerships and Implementation
        Emergency Services
The following goals, policies and implementation measures have been established to guide short
and long-range decision making by the community.
Goal S1
A safe community that ensures the protection and well-being of its residents.
     Policy S1-1
     The City shall maintain its emergency preparedness, including evacuation procedures, to
     address potential manmade and natural disasters in order to guarantee the safety of, and
     accessibility to, all its residents. Procedures shall be developed in coordination with local,
     State, and Federal emergency operations and Plans.
         Implementation Measure S1-1.1
         The City shall update and review, per State and Federal Guidelines, the City’s adopted
         Emergency Preparedness Plan and Network that outlines evacuation measures, identifies
         emergency public shelters, addresses animals in disaster, and provides information specific
         to people with disabilities.
         Implementation Measure S1-1.2
         Following the completion of the Emergency Preparedness Plan and Network, prepare
         public information notices in English and Spanish to disseminate information to the

  PUBLIC FACILITIES
        AND SERVICES
                 ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Public Facilities and Services Element describes public facilities and utility services provided
by the City and public agencies within the City and surrounding area. Public services generally
include fire and police protection, public schools, hospitals, libraries, park and recreation services,
as well as social and cultural services. The utilities described in this section include major
infrastructure systems such as the water supply and distribution network, the sewage collection
and treatment system, and the natural gas network. Drainage facilities are discussed in the Safety,
Air Quality and Noise Element.
ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
This Element is organized into three main sections described below:
        Introduction. This section includes an overview of the contents of the Public Facilities and
         Services Element and a discussion of state law requirements.
        Background and Setting. This section provides a profile of the existing conditions and
         provides an assessment of what measures will be required to accommodate the level of
         development anticipated with the Land Use Diagram.
        Public Facilities and Services Goals, Policies and Implementation Programs. This section
         outlines Coalinga’s overall Public Facilities and Services goals, and the policies and
         implementation programs designed to attain these goals.
REQUIREMENTS OF THE PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65302 does not require a Public Services and Facilities
Element to be included in a General Plan. However, Section 65303 states: “The general plan
City of Coalinga                                                                             General Plan
June 2009                                                                                       Page 6-1

Chapter 6 - Public Facilities and Services Element
may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the judgment of the
legislative body, relate to the physical development of the City.”
The Public Services and Facilities Element is closely related to the Land Use and Circulation
Elements. The Element is also related to the Safety, Air Quality, and Noise Element and the Open
Space and Conservation Element.
Consistency with the Safety, Air Quality and Noise Element is achieved through goals and polices
which afford protection related to police and fire service, threats from flooding, avoidance of
health hazards associated with inadequate provisions of potable water and sanitary sewer
facilities, and the management of hazardous materials.
BACKGROUND AND SETTING
FIRE
Fire protection is available from the City of Coalinga Fire Department located at 300 West Elm
Avenue. The Fire Department provides fire and life safety services to the residents and businesses
of the City of Coalinga. The department responds to fire, vehicle accidents, hazardous materials
releases, medical emergencies and other incidents requiring immediate action to reduce loss of
life and property.
The department consists of twelve full-time personnel and is supplemented by a paid-call
(volunteer) force of approximately eleven. The Fire Department currently has three engines and
an 80-foot ladder truck. The department also operates and maintains three ambulances, which
have a service area of over 1,000 square miles. The primary ambulance is staffed full time by an
Advanced Life Support (ALS) crew and the second ambulance can be staffed at either an ALS or
Basic Life Support (BLS) level. The City’s general fund supports all services of the department.
The City receives monthly revenue for the ambulance service from the Fresno County Health
Department and the Coalinga Hospital District.
All portions of the City are within three miles of the fire station; however, due to the expansion of
the City, response times of over five minutes are not uncommon. The City has “mutual aid” and
“instant aid” agreements with the Fresno County Fire Protection District (FCFPD). Under the
instant aid agreement, FCFPD automatically responds to critical facility fires in Coalinga. Critical
facilities (i.e., those facilities which are occupied) in the City include schools, convalescent homes,
prisons and the hospital. In return, the Coalinga Fire Department responds to any fire within one-half
mile of the City’s incorporated boundary. Under the mutual aid agreement, FCFPD and Pleasant
Valley State Prison (PVSP) Fire Department will respond (when available) when requested. The
City will also provide an engine crew to assist the Office of Emergency Services (OES) when
requested.

The Insurance Services Office (ISO) Commercial Risk Services, Inc. provides fire insurance ratings for
communities according to the adequacy of their fire protection services and according to the
presence of particular fire hazards. The rating system is based on the level of service provided to a
community. The City of Coalinga has received (1993) an ISO protection classification rating of 3 on
a scale of 1 (optimal) and 10 (unprotected).
A basic fire flow of 2,500 gallons per minute (gpm) can be maintained for two hours at any time
during a period of three days with consumption at the maximum rate. In a single-family
residential area, a fire flow of 1,500 gpm at a 20-pound per square inch (psi) residual pressure is
commonly applied. Fire flow requirements in nonresidential areas vary at each location
according to construction material, square footage, number of stories and building usage. The
“basic fire flow,” as defined by ISO for Coalinga, is 1,500 gpm with duration of two hours
(300,000 gallons).
Emergency water storage is an important consideration for the provision of fire protection services.
Emergency water storage is the water volume recommended to meet demand during emergency
situations. In Coalinga, the most probable cause of a total loss of supply would be a major
earthquake. In the event this should occur, the only water available would be stored in two steel
or concrete tanks located at Palmer Avenue and Derrick Avenue and at Calaveras Avenue south of
Palmer Avenue. Together these tanks have a capacity of more than five million gallons. Further
discussion of the City’s water storage capacity is provided in the water system section below.
The General plan recommends that the City develop a Fire Measures Department Master Plan that
addresses and provides for future facility, equipment, communication system, and personnel
requirements to accommodate planned growth pursuant the Land Use Diagram.
POLICE
The Coalinga Police Department has the responsibility of preserving the peace, responding to law
enforcement service requests, and protecting life and property within the City Limits. Personnel
are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to prevent and investigate criminal activity,
apprehend suspects and violators, investigate traffic accidents and provide animal control services.
The department is staffed with eighteen sworn officers. In addition, there are six non-sworn
positions and two reserve officers. Officers conduct special investigations, crime analysis, training
as well as records and evidence management and storage. The Police Department also provides
dispatch services to its officers as well as the Coalinga Fire Department. Personnel operate the
Dispatch Center in the Police Department around the clock seven days a week. The Department
station is located in the City Center at 270 N. Sixth Street. The state-of-the-art station was
completed and operational in late 1994.
The City’s Police Department maintains a number of mutual aid/operational agreements, which
include partnerships with the Fresno County Sheriff’s Department and California Highway Patrol
for service in the immediate unincorporated areas. Similar agreements exist with the recently
annexed Pleasant Valley State Prison. The Coalinga Police Department also enjoys numerous

community partnerships with schools, businesses, allied agencies, and citizen organizations
including Senior Citizens on Patrol (SCOP), Neighborhood Watch, Drug Abuse Resistance
Education (DARE), Multi-Agency Gang Enforcement Consortium (MAGEC), and Fresno County
Narcotics Enforcement Team (NET). The department places a high level of importance on traffic
safety with aggressive efforts towards education, DUI enforcement, accident prevention and
investigation and recommendations on traffic control devices and vehicle abatement.
This General Plan update recommends that the City develop a Capital Improvement Plan
addresses that provides for future police facilities, equipment and personnel requirements to
accommodate planned growth pursuant the Land Use Diagram.
SCHOOLS
The City is within the Coalinga-Huron Unified School District (CHUSD); the school district is also
responsible for schools within the City of Huron Sphere of Influence and Fresno County rural
areas. The CHUSD includes five elementary schools, two middle schools, two continuation high
schools, a community day school and one senior high school. All of the CHUSD facilities are
located in Coalinga except for one elementary school, a middle school and a continuation high
school, which are located in Huron. Enrollment levels for school facilities within Coalinga are
shown below in Table 6-1.

The CHUSD has experienced steady growth in enrollments over the past several years. This
growth is expected to increase to a growth rate of approximately 4+percent per year. The growth
is projected to result from:

         the unincorporated areas.
        Proposed annexations to the City of Coalinga.
        Construction of the Coalinga State Hospital in the Pleasant Valley area.
With the addition of fifteen portables, on several campuses, all of the schools are presently
operating within their available capacity (October, 2002).2 According to the CHUSD, continued
residential growth in the Coalinga area would result in student overcrowding and in the need to
construct new school facilities. Implementation of the General Plan will encourage development
and growth in both the residential and non-residential sectors. Residential development will
increase the permanent population of the City while non-residential development will increase the
employment base within the CHUSD boundaries. As set forth in the CHUSD Five-Year Facilities
Plan, to provide school facilities to house projected student enrollments, the CHUSD needs to:
        Construct at least one new elementary facility.
        Consider the expansion of the High School at the existing facilities on Baker Street or
         consider other alternative sites for the construction of new facilities.
        Refurbish existing facilities. Modernization projects planned for the High School and
         Sunset Elementary school sites will provide additional teaching stations.
The City recognizes the pressures on the school district given a burgeoning school population; the
lack of State responsibility to fund schools properly; and the lack of adequate enabling legislation,
which defines the role of local government to meet school funding needs. In an effort to plan for
and address these issues, specific goals, policies and implementation measures relating to the
City’s schools have been included in this General Plan.
PARKS AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
The two developed parks in the City are Keck Park and Olsen Park. Keck Park is a 15-acre
community park that includes the Coalinga Community Center. This park is located on Jayne
Avenue on the western edge of the City. Olsen Park is a 10-acre park located on Jayne Avenue
east of the commercial core area. School district facilities also are available.
The Coalinga-Huron Recreation and Park District provides recreational facilities to the cities of
Coalinga and Huron and the rural areas including the fitness center and senior center. The District
currently provides recreation services and sports for preschoolers through senior citizens. Sports
and athletic programs are offered at the elementary, high school and community college also.
A Youth Sports Complex is proposed on Cambridge Avenue across from the Bishop and Coalinga
Middle School campuses. The proposed sports complex includes both organized and open use
recreation opportunities. Organized recreation includes sports activities such as baseball, softball,
soccer and Bicycle Moto-cross(X) (BMX), intended to be utilized primarily by the various sports

to serve the special needs population, residents and visitors.
AIRPORT
In 1996, the City relocated and constructed the Coalinga Municipal Airport at the corner of Phelps
and Calaveras Avenues approximately four miles east-northeast of the City in the southwest
portion of Fresno County. The airport is located on approximately 1,012 acres of land at an
elevation of 622 feet above mean sea level. The airport is classified as a General Aviation Airport
in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems and as a General Aviation Community Airport
in the California Aviation System Plan. The facility has 5,000 feet of lighted runway. Aircraft
operations include air taxis carrying passengers and cargo, general aviation and military
operations. The ultimate buildout for the new airport includes extending the runway to 7,500 feet
and upgrading the instrument approach to a full Instrument Landing System.
The airport is located within the Airport Master Plan Area as described in the Land Use Element of
this General Plan. New development within the area is required to be master planned through the
provisions outlined in the 2005 Airport Master Plan (Aries Consulting).
WATER
Water Quality
Coalinga’s groundwater is of poor quality due to high concentrations of sodium, sulfates and total
dissolved solids (TDS). This condition occurs at depths between 500 and 1,500 feet; therefore,
groundwater is not considered a viable source of potable water for the Coalinga planning area.
Even for crop irrigation, groundwater is considered only of “marginal acceptability.”
Due to the poor groundwater quality, potable water utilized by the City consists of imported
water. To obtain domestic water, the City entered into contract with the U.S. Department of the
Interior, Bureau of Reclamation for water service. The current contract obligates the Bureau of
Reclamation to furnish Coalinga up to 10,000 acre-feet (AF) of water per year. The contract also
establishes that the minimum quantity of water that the City is obligated to accept and pay for
throughout the life of the contract shall not be less than the average annual use for the previous
five years. Overall water consumption has averaged 5,000 acre-feet per year (AFY).
Water Facilities
Water Treatment Plant
Coalinga’s surface water treatment plant originally came on line in April 1972 with a nominal
capacity of eight million gallons per day (MGD) average daily flow and a hydraulic (maximum

flow) capacity of 12 MGD. In 1992, primarily in anticipation of the increased demands resulting
from construction of the Pleasant Valley State Prison, the treatment plant was expanded to a
nominal treatment capacity of 12 MGD and a hydraulic capacity of 16 MGD. The treatment plant
takes water from the California Aqueduct via the Coalinga Canal.
Filtered Water Pump Station
The filtered water pump station includes two 450 horsepower (HP), 2,300 gallons per minute
(gpm) and 2,400 gpm and three 700 HP, 3,600 gpm vertical turbine pumps. When in good
repair, the pump station has the operational ability to pump the treatment plant capacity of 16.4
MGD (11,400 gpm) with one of the 450 HP pumps out of service. The booster pump station lifts
treated water in a series of 24-, 27- and 30-inch transmission mains leading to Coalinga.
Storage Reservoirs
Coalinga’s existing water system includes the five storage reservoirs listed below. All of the
reservoirs consist of steel tanks resting on reinforced concrete ring wall foundations, none of the
tanks are bolted to the ring wall foundations. The Oil King and Northwest reservoirs’ sole function
is to provide water to oil companies. As such, they are excluded from the evaluation of the City’s
available storage. The existing combined storage capacity of the Palmer, Derrick and Calaveras
reservoirs is 15.4 million gallons (MG).
        Palmer Avenue Reservoir - Located on the south side of Palmer Avenue, the Palmer
         Reservoir has a capacity of 2.8 MG. This reservoir receives the pumped filtered water from
         the water treatment plant.
        Calaveras Avenue Reservoir - Located on the east side of Calaveras Avenue, the Calaveras
         Reservoir has a capacity of 5.0 MG. Water flows from the filtration plant to the Calaveras
         Reservoir and then to the Pleasant Valley State Prison.
        Derrick Avenue Reservoir - The Derrick Reservoir is located west of the City, on the east
         side of Derrick Avenue. This reservoir has a capacity of 7.6 MG. Water from the Palmer
         Reservoir flows to the Derrick Reservoir and then into the City.
        Oil King Reservoir - Located west of Highway 33/198, approximately three miles north of
         Palmer Avenue. The reservoir has a capacity of 0.5 MG. This reservoir serves oil company
         customers exclusively.
        Northwest Reservoir - Located east of Derrick Avenue, approximately three miles north of
         Gale Avenue, the Northwest Reservoir has a capacity of 0.2 MG. Like the Oil King
         Reservoir, this reservoir is for the exclusive use of oil company customers.
Booster Pumping Stations
Coalinga’s water system includes two booster pumping stations, but neither functions as a part of
the City’s main service area. Both booster pumping stations serve oil company customers

exclusively. The Oil King booster pumping station consists of two 200-HP, 1,440 gpm booster
pumps that elevates the Palmer Avenue Reservoir water to the Oil King Reservoir. The Derrick
Avenue booster station consists of two 75-HP, 556 gpm booster pumps to elevate water to the
Northwest Reservoir.
Distribution System
Water destined for Coalinga flows southerly in the Central Valley Project’s California Aqueduct
and then into the Coalinga Canal, approximately fifteen miles northeast of the City. A raw water
pump station lifts the Coalinga Canal water to the City’s surface water treatment plant. After the
water flows through the City’s conventional filtration treatment plant, the treated water is pumped
by a filtered-water pump station into a 27-inch diameter pipeline in Palmer Avenue.
Approximately two miles west of the water treatment plant, the flow tees at Calaveras Avenue.
Water flowing west continues for another mile and a half to the Palmer Avenue Reservoir. Water
going to the Pleasant Valley State Prison travels south in the 12-inch Calaveras Avenue pipeline to
the Calaveras Avenue Reservoir. After flowing through the Calaveras Reservoir, it continues south
in Calaveras Avenue another 3.5 miles to Jayne Avenue and then east to the prison. Water can
potentially travel from the Calaveras Reservoir westerly into the City, but the hydraulic conditions
are such that this seldom occurs.
The water leaving the Palmer Reservoir flows through approximately eight miles of 27-inch and
24-inch transmission mains to the Derrick Avenue Reservoir. Water travels primarily from the
Derrick Avenue Reservoir through 30-, 24- and 18-inch transmission mains into the City’s water
distribution system. The distribution system consists of a network of water mains ranging in size
from 4 to 14 inches in diameter. The system is capable of supplying peak hour needs without
excessive losses and can deliver fire flows to main lines.
System Demand
There were approximately 2,965 service connections inside the City serving the 2002 population
of 12,379. The City also serves about 4,700 persons at the Pleasant Valley State Prison, which
was annexed by the City in 2000, and has approximately sixty connections in rural areas and
miscellaneous small business connections located outside the City. Treated water is also provided
to two oil companies, a co-generation facility and the Coalinga State Hospital, which opened in
late 2005.
In 2000, Coalinga treated and furnished approximately 4,856 AF of potable water to its customers.
Around 235 AF of untreated water was also sold to the Harris Ranch feedlot and the Polvadero Golf
Course. In addition, Coalinga transferred 3,000 AF of excess water in 2000 to another Reclamation
user, bringing Coalinga’s total water provided by Reclamation in the year 2000 to 8,091 AF.

Water System Master Plan
In 2001, the City embarked upon a water main Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for
replacements and upgrades of deteriorating and undersized water and sewer mains in selected
areas throughout the City. The project was anticipated to take approximately three years to
complete. Some of the improvements correspond to the CIP in the City’s 1991 Water System
Master Plan. Other improvements are to remedy known maintenance problems. Although it is
anticipated that the replacements and upgrades will improve system performance, the degree to
which the performance of the water distribution system will be enhanced is not yet known.
The City authorized Boyle Engineering to prepare a Water System Master Plan in 2002 to identify
existing water system deficiencies and recommend necessary system improvements to meet
existing and future water requirements. The recommended projects are based on hydraulic
analyses and incorporate staged expansion improvements for the years 2005, 2010, 2015 and
2020. Most of the expansion improvements are based on a grid expansion of the water
distribution system. To account for anticipated growth within the City limits, a grid of 12-inch
pipelines was added to the system to represent the required pipelines based on staged growth.
The rationale for constructing these grid mains is to provide water service and fire protection to
approximately ¼-mile square areas, with smaller distribution mains as development occurs.
Looping of grid mains and distribution mains is important to increase fire flow capacity and to
prevent water stagnation.
Other improvements include upgrades to the water treatment plant and storage reservoirs. In
addition, the Water System Master Plan recognized that the current 10,000 AF annual water
supply contracted to the City would be insufficient for future growth and the existing water
treatment plant would not have the necessary treatment and pumping capacity. The study noted
that this issue would require further study beyond the scope of the report. Although it may be
possible, depending on groundwater quality, to install new wells near the Derrick or Calaveras
Reservoirs and blend the pumped groundwater with treated surface water, the study included a 4-
MGD reverse osmosis treatment plant in the CIP for 2020.
This General Plan update recommends that the City develop a Capital Improvement Plan that
provides for water facilities to accommodate planned growth pursuant the Land Use Diagram.
WASTEWATER
The City of Coalinga controls and administers the wastewater system for both domestic and
industrial sewerage. The oldest portions of the City’s wastewater collection system were
constructed in the first half of the 20th century to serve what is now the central portion of the City.
As the City has grown, the collection system has been extended to serve new development. The
collection system currently serves all developed areas within the City Limits. Pleasant Valley State
Prison treats and disposes of its wastewater on-site and does not contribute sewer flow to the
City’s collection system or the wastewater treatment plant. Maintenance of the City sewer system

is financed by sewer charges. Extension of sewer mains to new development is paid for by the
developer.
Wastewater Facilities
Collection System
The City’s existing sewer collection system is comprised of a network of over 42 miles of sewer
pipelines with sizes ranging from six to 24 inches in diameter. The system also includes three
sewage pumping stations as well as associated force mains. The backbone of the system consists
of trunk and interceptor sewers. In general, interceptor sewers are considered to be the larger
pipelines, approximately 21 inches and larger, while trunk sewers typically range from 12 to 18
inches. The trunk and interceptor sewers function to convey wastewater collected in the sewer
system to the City’s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) which is currently located east of the City
near the confluence of Warthan Creek and Los Gatos Creek.
Pumping (Lift) Stations
Pumping stations (also known as lift stations) raise wastewater flows to a higher elevation in order
to continue gravity flow at reasonable slopes and depths. Pump capacities should be sufficient to
provide for the pumping of the peak flow rates experienced in the sewer system. Pumping
stations with capacities less than anticipated peak flow rates are considered deficient. The City
currently operates and maintains three pumping stations at Posa Chanet, Creekside Estates and the
Industrial Park.
Wastewater Treatment Plant
The City of Coalinga owns and operates a WWTP under California Regional Water Quality
Control Board (RWQCB) Waste Discharge Requirements Order No. 94-184. There are no
significant industrial users currently discharging into the WWTP. The WWTP is located at the
confluence of Los Gatos Creek and Warthan Creek approximately one mile east of the City.
Wastewater disposal at the WWTP occurs via an aerated facultative lagoon process followed by
stabilization ponds and final disposal on adjacent land for percolation and irrigation of non-food
crops. The quality of the effluent according to 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 22 is
undisinfected secondary.
The WWTP has undergone two major improvements in the last twenty years. In 1982, the
primary clarifier and anaerobic digester were abandoned in favor of additional aerated lagoons,
increasing the permitted treatment capacity to 0.93 MGD. In 1991, modifications to the plant
included rehabilitation of the previously abandoned primary clarifier and conversion of the
previously decommissioned anaerobic digester to an aerobic digester, increasing the plant
capacity to 1.34 MGD. The current (2002) average daily flow is 0.93 MGD, which represents
approximately 70 percent of the current average daily permitted flow. However, biochemical

design of the treatment facilities and the plant is operating at approximately 90 percent of the
plant’s BOD reduction capability. State law requires the City to begin planning for the next plant
expansion once the treatment plant reaches 80 percent of its design capacity. The Sewer System
Master Plan prepared for the City by Boyle Engineering in 2005 evaluated alternatives for the
expansion of wastewater treatment and disposal facilities. The chosen alternative, construction of
an entirely new plant at a different location, is described below.
SEWER SYSTEM MASTER PLAN
The City of Coalinga recognized the importance of planning, developing and financing future
sewer system facilities to provide reliable service for existing customers and for anticipated future
development. In 2002, the City authorized Boyle Engineering to prepare a Sewer System Master
Plan to identify existing collection system and treatment deficiencies and recommend necessary
improvements to meet future sewage requirements.
As part of the Sewer System Master Plan, a Wastewater Treatment Plant Expansion/Relocation
Feasibility Study was prepared by Boyle Engineering and approved by the City. The existing
WWTP is situated east of the City, outside the City limits. However, urban development
occurring east of the City was recognized as problematic due to the expansion of residential areas
in proximity to the plant. Therefore, the City authorized a consideration of its possible relocation.
After review of the various alternatives, the City directed Boyle to finalize the Sewer System
Master Plan under the assumption that a new facility would be constructed at a new location to
accommodate current and projected flows. The proposed new WWTP location lies south of Jane
Avenue, east of Jacalitos Creek and west of Alpine Avenue. A new sewer line from the existing
WWTP would need to be constructed to convey the sewer flow to the new location. Assuming a
daily consumption of 90 gallons per capita per day (GPCD), the average daily design flow
assumed for the proposed expansion will be 2.36 MGD with a peak factor of 1.75 MGD for
maximum hourly flow.
The City’s sewer system is currently undergoing two million dollars in improvements to be done
in four phases that will correspond to the water distribution system improvements. Improvements
under consideration include a new screening device, improved scum handling facilities and a
trickling filter process to replace the existing aerated lagoons. The trickling filter will expand the
plant’s treatment capacity from 1.34 mgd to 2.0 mgd. The existing collection system, treatment plant
deficiencies and system improvements needed to meet sewerage requirements through the year
2020 are described in the City’s Sewer System Master Plan.
The capacity of the new wastewater facility and current improvements to the sewer system
improvements will likely not accommodate full buildout of the General Plan. The design of the
new plant has not been finalized, so there may be opportunity to increase design capacity.
Regardless, this General Plan Update recognizes the potential deficiency in wastewater
infrastructure and has incorporated Policies and Implementation measures to address such a
potential shortfall including development of a Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) that addresses that

NATURAL GAS
The City of Coalinga is one of only three local jurisdictions in California that owns and operates a
natural gas distribution system. The City has over 35 miles of gas lines, which were upgraded
substantially after the 1983 earthquake. Between 200 and 210 million cubic feet of gas per year is
distributed to 3,100 customers.
Beyond the City limits, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides natural gas. Two gas mains are
located within the vicinity of Coalinga. One line runs parallel along the west side of Interstate 5.
The other gas main is located approximately three miles to the north of Jayne Avenue and
terminates at the intersection of Calaveras Avenue and Tornado Avenue.
SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
At the current time, the City of Coalinga subcontracts out its solid waste collection and disposal
services within the City limits. Rural residents outside the City limits in the SOI and AOI are
responsible for their own solid waste services. Currently, the City generates approximately 20
tons per day, excluding solid waste generated by the Pleasant Valley State Prison. The prison
averages five tons per day.
The Coalinga Disposal Site, operated by the County of Fresno, is located one mile south of the
City of Coalinga adjacent to Highway 118. This landfill serves the cities of Coalinga and Huron as
well as the rural areas of southwestern Fresno County. Currently, the Coalinga Disposal Site
averages 50 tons per day with a maximum daily permitted capacity of 100 tons per day (New
Mental Health Treatment Facility DEIR). The landfill is expected to serve the Coalinga region for
the next 35 to 40 years. Once the landfill has reached capacity, local solid waste will be taken to
the regional County landfill on American Avenue, approximately 45 miles east of the City. This
landfill is presently expanding to 440 acres in order to accommodate regional growth.

Glossary
Buffer - A strip of land designated to protect one type of land use from another with which it is
incompatible. Where a commercial district abuts a residential district, for example, additional
use, yard, or height restrictions may be imposed to protect residential properties. The term may
also be used to describe any zone that separates two unlike zones such as a multi-family housing
zone between single-family housing and commercial uses.
Building - Any structure having a roof supported by columns or walls and intended for the shelter,
housing or enclosure of any individual, animal, process, equipment, goods or materials of any
kind or nature.

district. Some elements affecting compatibility include: intensity of occupancy as measured by
dwelling units per acre; pedestrian or vehicular traffic generated; volume of goods handled; and
such environmental effects as noise, vibration, glare, air pollution, or radiation. On the other
hand, many aspects of compatibility are based on personal preference and are much harder to
measure quantitatively, at least for regulatory purposes.
