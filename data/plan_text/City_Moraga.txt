ADOPTED June 4, 2002
2100 Donald Drive / Moraga, CA 94556 / 925-376-2590 / www.ci.moraga.ca.us
Note to the Reader
The Moraga 2002 General Plan culminates nearly three years of planning
analysis and community discussion regarding Moraga’s past, present and
future, including more than a year of review and discussion in joint study
sessions and public hearings with Moraga’s Planning Commission and Town
Council.
The Moraga 2002 General Plan revises and updates the Town’s 1990
General Plan, establishing a framework for development decision making for
the next ten to twenty years. Major changes in the Plan as compared to the
previous plan include:
   New Sections
     New introductory material describing the Plan’s purpose, planning
         area, and background (Chapter 1).
     Summary of the Plan’s ‘Values and Guiding Principles’ (Chapter 2).
     New Community Design Element (Chapter 4).
     An integrated ‘Action Plan’ to consolidate implementing programs,
         identify near-term priorities, and provide a tool for facilitating the
         annual General Plan review process (Chapter 11 and Appendix F).
   Land Use Changes
     Reductions in maximum potential densities in environmentally
         sensitive outlying areas of the Town, resulting in an overall
         reduction of approximately 20 percent in remaining build-out
         capacity.
     A revised General Plan Diagram to help implement the Plan’s goals
         and policies (Appendix A).
     Addition of a table summarizing the Town’s ‘Residential
         Development Potential’ (Appendix C).
   New Policies and Action Programs
     Identification of two Specific Plan areas on the General Plan
         Diagram and implementing actions to undertake the specific
         planning process in both areas in the immediate future.
     A stronger emphasis on open space preservation, with new programs
         to strengthen and implement the Town’s ‘Transfer of Development
         Rights’ policies and to develop a comprehensive Open Space
         Preservation Program.
     A renewed emphasis on providing housing to meet a variety of
         needs, including seniors, ‘empty-nesters’ and people who work in the
         Town, by allowing residential development at higher densities in
         centrally located areas, sited and designed in accordance with Town
         standards and guidelines.
June 2002                                                                       ii

   Format and Style Changes
     Presentation of the Plan in a standard size format.
     Consolidation of the Plan’s goals to eliminate redundancy.
     Consistent numbering and titling of all policies.
     Identification of the implementing programs for each policy.
     Consolidation of the Plan’s implementing action programs.
In addition there have been many minor changes to clarify policy language,
eliminate inconsistencies, reduce redundancy, meet regulatory requirements,
and respond to recent changes in the Town.

1        INTRODUCTION
Purpose of the General Plan
A Statement of Community Values and a Shared Vision
The Moraga 2002 General Plan is a statement of community values and priorities. It describes the
type of community we want to be in the future and sets forth goals, policies and action programs
across a range of issue areas to help us achieve our aims. It also describes how the General Plan
should be managed over time and identifies near-term priorities for putting the General Plan into
action.
A Strategic, Pro-Active Planning Tool
The Moraga 2002 General Plan is a strategic tool for guiding the Town’s physical development. It
is based on a comprehensive understanding of the issues that we face and a clear sense of what we
hope to accomplish. It has been developed with the extensive involvement of community
members who have helped identify key planning issues; evaluate alternative planning strategies;
and define the key policy directions to guide the Town successfully into the new millennium.
A Guide for Land Use and Development Decisions
The General Plan guides the Town’s long-term development by establishing the overall policy
framework for development decision-making. As the Town faces tough development decisions,
the Moraga 2002 General Plan will serve as a guide to ensure that each decision is made in the
best interest of the Town’s long-term future. It provides guidance for the preparation of specific
plans, implementing ordinances, development policy statements, and ongoing planning activities.
The General Plan should be followed as closely as reason and justice make practical and possible.
If a project is proposed that is considered inconsistent with the General Plan, then the project
must be either modified or denied, or the General Plan must be amended.
A Balanced Approach
The goals, policies and action programs contained in the General Plan establish clear community
priorities and development policies to ensure the protection of public health, safety and welfare
and to further community goals while respecting the needs of individual property owners and
businesses in the Town. The Plan does not take any land for public purposes or place a cloud on
the title to any property or require that any property be sold or dedicated to the public.

Introduction                                                                 Moraga 2002 General Plan
The General Plan also recognizes that many factors beyond the Town’s control will have
significant influence over future development activities. These include market forces that drive
private development decisions, as well as the land use and transportation decisions taken by other
jurisdictions. The General Plan acknowledges and responds to these factors in its policies and
action programs.
A Living Document and Action Plan
The Moraga 2002 General Plan has been written and designed to provide a user-friendly resource
for Town staff and officials, property owners, developers, and residents. To ensure the Plan’s
usefulness and relevance over time, the Plan includes policies and programs regarding its ongoing
management and coordination. Also, to ensure a close link between the long-term perspective of
the Plan and near-term actions, the General Plan defines action programs across the full range of
issue areas in a consolidated ‘Action Plan’ (Chapter 11) and identifies implementation priorities
to respond to pressing issues and special planning needs (Appendix F). It is expected that the
Action Plan and implementation priorities will be reviewed on an annual basis to monitor
achievements and identify new implementation priorities.
A State Law Requirement
All local government jurisdictions in California are required to have a General Plan, and to keep it
up to date. The previous Town of Moraga General Plan was adopted in 1990. The current update
brings the Plan into conformance with changes in State law and other legal requirements; reflects
changes in local issues and conditions over the past ten years; incorporates the most recent
projections and assumptions regarding future growth; and responds to the issues, challenges and
opportunities created by recent trends and developments.
Area Covered by the Plan
The Moraga 2002 General Plan provides a comprehensive, integrated and internally consistent
statement of Moraga’s development policies. It covers all lands located within the Town limits as
well as the Town’s Sphere of Influence area.
The Sphere of Influence is ‘the probable ultimate physical boundaries and service area of a city or
district as approved by the Local Agency Formation Commission of the County’ (Government
Code Section 56076). The Town Limits and Sphere of Influence area are illustrated in the General
Plan Diagram (Appendix A).
The General Plan Diagram also identifies the Contra Costa County Urban Limit Line (ULL) in
relation to the Town Boundary. County voters adopted the ULL in 1990 to preserve agricultural
and open space uses in the County. The ULL was established based on a 65/35 Land Preservation
Plan, which seeks to preserve at least 65 percent of all land in the County as agriculture, open
space, wetlands, parks and other non-urban uses. Large-scale development is prohibited on lands
outside the ULL under the County’s General Plan. However, public facilities such as educational
institutions (including Saint Mary’s College, which is located outside the ULL boundary) are
exempt from the ULL restrictions.

Moraga 2002 General Plan                                                               Introduction
Because of Moraga’s geographic location and limited roadway access, the Moraga General Plan
is also concerned with issues that extend beyond its boundaries and Sphere of Influence. This
larger area of interest is generally defined as including those lands that (a) can be seen from
Moraga; (b) provide access to Moraga; (c) have their primary source of access through Moraga;
(d) may contain uses that significantly affect the air, water or other environmental quality of
Moraga; and/or (e) could create demands for public service from Moraga. While the Town does
not have planning authority in the area beyond the Town boundaries, it shall seek to proactively
participate in the planning process for these lands through coordination with other jurisdictions
and agencies, including the cities of Orinda and Lafayette, Contra Costa County, East Bay
Municipal Utilities District, and the East Bay Regional Park District.
Organization of the General Plan
The Moraga 2002 General Plan is written and designed for use by all members of the Moraga
community: residents, businesses, property owners, developers, Town staff, and elected and
appointed officials.
Following is a brief overview of the Plan’s key structural components to help you understand how
the Plan is organized.
Values and Guiding Principles (Chapter 2)
These community values and guiding principles—developed through the public participation
process—serve as overarching goals for the Moraga 2002 General Plan and provide the basic
foundation for its goals, policies and implementing programs.
Goals, Policies, and Implementing Programs (Chapters 3 – 10)
The main body of the General Plan consists of eight ‘elements’:
Chapter 3       Land Use
Chapter 4       Community Design
Chapter 5       Housing
Chapter 6       Circulation
Chapter 7       Open Space and Conservation
Chapter 8       Public Safety
Chapter 9       Community Facilities and Services
Chapter 10 Growth Management
The specific issues addressed in each element are listed in the Table of Contents. A list of how the
Plan’s elements relate to the State’s mandated and optional element is provided in Figure 1 (page
1-6).
Each ‘element’ presents goals, policies, and implementing programs that state the Plan’s intent
across a range of planning and development issues.
June 2002                                                                                      1-3

Introduction                                                                   Moraga 2002 General Plan
¾ A Goal is a general statement of values or aspirations held by the community in relation to
     each issue area. It is the end towards which the Town will direct its efforts.
¾ A Policy is a more precise expression regarding the community’s position on a particular
     issue, or how a particular goal will be interpreted or implemented. Policies may include
     guidelines, standards, objectives, maps, diagrams, or a combination of these components.
¾ An Implementing Program is something that is done by the Town to put the goals and
     policies into practice. This might include ongoing programs sponsored by the Town (e.g.,
     road maintenance); discrete, time-specific actions (e.g., adopt an ordinance); or further
     planning actions (e.g., develop a specific plan).
Action Plan (Chapter 11)
To provide an integrated approach to the Plan’s implementation, the Moraga 2002 General Plan
presents a consolidated ‘Action Plan,’ summarizing all of the implementing programs in the Plan,
organized by type.
Appendixes
The General Plan appendixes include:
¾ General Plan Diagram—a map illustrating the land use designations for all areas within the
     Town and its Sphere of Influence.
¾ Residential Development Potential—a summary of the Plan’s potential ‘build out’ for
     residential units.
¾ Definitions—a glossary of key terms.
¾ Action Plan Summary—identifying the schedule for implementation of each program
     (including near-term priorities), responsibilities and quantified objectives.
Mandated and Optional Elements
Under California law, cities are required to address seven issue areas or ‘elements’ in their
general plans: land use, transportation, housing, safety, open space, conservation, and noise. The
State allows considerable flexibility in how these elements are organized, and encourages the
inclusion of additional elements to ensure that plans are truly comprehensive and effective in
addressing local issues.
The Moraga 2002 General Plan includes the seven State-mandated elements as well as several
optional elements (Community Design, Community Facilities and Services, and Growth
Management), although it organizes them in a modified format. Figure 1 lists both the State-
mandated and optional elements, indicating where they are covered in the General Plan
document.

How the Plan Was Developed
The Moraga 2002 General Plan is the product of a three-year planning effort involving
community residents, staff, and elected and appointed officials in a series of meetings and
workshops to identify key issues; review current plan policies; review data on current conditions
and trends; define values and guiding principles, explore alternative planning strategies, and
establish key policy directions.
The update process was overseen by a General Plan Steering Committee (GPSC) to ensure broad
community representation in the update process and to provide the community with a direct voice
in the Plan’s development. The 15-member GPSC included representatives from the Town
Council, Planning Commission, Parks and Recreation Commission, Design Review Board,
Moraga-Orinda Fire District, Moraga School District, Saint Mary’s College, and Chamber of
Commerce as well as a representative from the Town’s major landowner and four citizens at
large. A complete list of GPSC members and alternates is provided in the acknowledgements at
the beginning of this document. The planning process began with the GPSC’s first meeting in
July 1999 and culminated with adoption of the Plan in June 2002.
GPSC members and Town staff also played key roles in supporting community outreach and
involvement activities, which involved more than 1500 Moraga residents in the update process.
These activities included:
¾ Three Special Issues of the Town Crier Newsletter sent to every Moraga household and
    business address at three points in the update process, providing a summary of key
    information, an overview of the update activities, and an invitation for community
    participation.
June 2002                                                                                   1-5

Introduction                                                                   Moraga 2002 General Plan
¾ Community Questionnaire included in the first special issue of the Town Crier to get
     community input on key planning issues, alternative planning strategies, and community
     priorities. More than 650 Moraga households responded to the questionnaire.
¾ Moraga 2000 Displays and Activities at the Town Festival in October 1999, celebrating
     Moraga’s 25th Anniversary, provided an opportunity to disseminate information on the update
     and the existing conditions analysis, and to foster community discussion on key planning
     issues. More than 500 people visited the Moraga 2000 festival area.
¾ Nineteen (19) Community Workshops in February and March 2000 led by GPSC members
     and Town staff to facilitate community discussion and input on the planning alternatives. The
     community workshops involved more than 300 Moraga residents and business owners in the
     alternatives analysis process.
¾ Town Meeting on March 29, 2000 to culminate the alternatives analysis process and begin to
     outline a preferred alternative for the Draft Plan. The meeting was attended by nearly 60
     Moraga residents, business owners, and other interested parties.
Members of the public were also invited to attend all of the GPSC meetings (nine meetings were
held between July 1999 and April 2000) as well as a special ‘Preferred Alternative Workshop’
with the Town Council and Planning Commission on April 20, 2000. Subsequent ‘study sessions’
and public hearings were held in joint meetings with the Town Council and Planning
Commission. These meetings were also noticed and open to the public.
The public was kept informed on the project’s progress through the Town newsletter, coverage in
the local media, and the Town’s website, where all of the project documents have been posted
(www.ci.moraga.ca.us).
Reviewing, Amending and Managing the Plan
To remain a viable and effective planning tool, the Moraga 2002 General Plan must be reviewed
on an annual basis and modified over time in response to changing conditions, needs, and
priorities. This section of the Plan establishes basic guidelines for reviewing the General Plan and
considering potential amendments to its text and/or diagram.
Annual Review
The General Plan is the Town’s most significant policy document and, therefore, must receive
regular, annual appraisal to ensure that its policies are consistent with social and economic
conditions, the needs and desires of Town residents, and the public welfare in general.
The Planning Commission shall report annually to the Town Council regarding the status of the
General Plan and progress in implementing its action programs. As part of the annual review
process, the Planning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing.
1-6                                                                                      June 2002

Amendments to the General Plan
Each year, the Town may consider amendments to the General Plan in response to findings of the
annual review; changes in the planning context; or requests from property owners. In undertaking
amendments to the General Plan, Town staff, Planning Commission, and Council shall follow the
provisions set forth below:
Types of Amendments
Amendments to the General Plan may take the form of either text changes (revisions to the Plan’s
goals, policies, or actions) or map changes (revisions to the General Plan Diagram).
Consideration of Amendments
The Planning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing in October each year to consider
any amendments to the Plan. An exception may be authorized by the Town Council or the
Planning Commission when a finding is made in the public interest to expedite the processing of
an amendment. However, in accordance with State planning law, General Plan amendments may
be considered no more than three (3) times per year (i.e., in October and at most two other times
per year in response to authorized exceptions).
Application Deadline
Applications for annual General Plan amendments (for October review) shall be filed no later
than the first week in August each year on appropriate forms provided by the Town.
Fees
Fees shall be as prescribed by resolution of the Town Council. The Town Council may waive the
prescribed fees if an application is accompanied by a petition of not less than fifty (50) affected
registered voters of the Town.
Environmental Review
Each application shall be accompanied by statements and data justifying the application,
including an appropriate environmental assessment. Upon receipt of the application by the
Planning Commission, the application shall be reviewed by staff and the Planning Commission,
as necessary, to assure compliance with the Town’s environmental review guidelines and the
California Environmental Quality Act.
Evaluation Criteria
General Plan amendments affect the entire Town and General Plan area and any evaluation must
give primary concern to the community as a whole. Therefore, a fundamental question must be
asked in each case: Will this amendment, if adopted, generally improve the quality of the
environment socially, economically and physically consistent with the life-style of the community
in general?
Additionally, in reviewing General Plan amendments the Town shall consider the relationship of
the proposal to the status quo, the additional costs to the community that might be anticipated

Introduction                                                                  Moraga 2002 General Plan
(social, economic or environmental), and if and how levels of public and private service might be
affected. In each case, in order to take affirmative action regarding the application, it must be
found that:
¾ The General Plan amendment will maintain a balanced and logical land use pattern;
¾ The General Plan amendment will generally improve the quality of the environment socially,
     economically and physically, and is consistent with the lifestyle of the community;
¾ The Town and other affected governmental agencies will be able to maintain levels of service
     consistent with the ability of the governmental agencies to provide a reasonable level of
     service.
California Environmental Quality Act
All development proposals are subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The
purpose of the CEQA process is to assure that major consideration is given to preventing
environmental damage and that impacts are properly identified and can be mitigated to a level
consistent with the Goals and Policies of the General Plan.
Ongoing Public Participation in the Planning Process
The Town shall continue to promote citizen participation in the development, review and
implementation of the General Plan and its goals, policies and programs. This shall include
residents of the community as well as those regularly employed or conducting business in the
community. To support meaningful and effective citizen participation, the Town shall also strive
to provide timely, accurate and adequate information on conditions in the Town and planning
issues, constraints, resources, opportunities, and strategy options.
Relation to Other Documents
There are a number of other planning regulations adopted by the Town and planning activities
that are undertaken on a regular basis that will help implement the General Plan. The General
Plan is the guiding document for all these regulations and activities. Following adoption of the
General Plan, any regulations that are not consistent with the Plan will be amended to ensure
consistency.
Zoning Ordinance
Government Code Section 65860 requires that the Town’s Zoning Ordinance be consistent with
its General Plan. Consistency means that the land uses authorized by the Zoning Ordinance, and
the distribution of these permitted land uses, must serve to implement the goals and policies of the
General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map are parcel-specific regulations pertaining
to how land may be used, and the specific conditions of use that the Town will impose, consistent
with the overall policy framework of the General Plan and General Plan Diagram.

Subdivision Ordinance
Government Code Section 66410 et seq. requires that local jurisdictions regulate and control
subdivision activity through adoption and use of a Subdivision Ordinance. The Town may not
approve a proposed subdivision map unless the subdivision, including its design and proposed
land uses, is consistent with the General Plan. Similar to the consistency requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance, the proposed subdivision must be consistent with the goals, policies, and
implementing actions included in the General Plan. This requirement applies to subdivisions for
which parcel maps (minor subdivisions) are filed, as well as tentative and final maps.
Capital Improvement Programs
Government Code 65401 requires the Town Council to obtain from Town officials and staff, and
from special districts operating within the Town limits, lists of all public works projects
recommended for study, design, or construction during each ensuing year. In Moraga, the Town’s
capital improvement programs are set forth in the annual Town budget. The Town must ensure
that the budget and its components are consistent with the General Plan.
Environmental Impact Review
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (California Administrative Code Section
14100 et seq.) establishes the relationship between environmental review as prescribed by CEQA
and the General Plan. Section 15080 requires that the environmental review process be
“combined with the existing planning, review, and project approval process” used by the Town.
Section 15125(b) requires environmental review to discuss any inconsistencies between a
proposed project and the General Plan. Projects should be found to have a “significant adverse
effect on the environment” if they conflict with “adopted environmental plans and goals of the
community…” (including the General Plan). Future public and private projects, even if they are
consistent with the General Plan, are still subject to environmental review requirements under
CEQA.
Building Codes and Standards
State Housing Law (Health and Safety Code Sections 17910 et seq.) requires the Town to adopt
regulations imposing substantially the same standards as those contained in the various uniform
industry codes. State law also imposes special standards, which may be more stringent than the
uniform industry codes (e.g., the Uniform Building Code), designed to protect against certain
types of hazards (fire, noise, earthquakes, unstable soils) and to achieve certain resource
management goals (such as energy conservation). The Town of Moraga may adopt regulations
and standards that vary from those mandated by State law, if justified by local conditions. If such
variance is appropriate, the General Plan can serve as the vehicle for documenting local
conditions and specifying the necessary regulatory response.

General Plan Background Report and EIR
The Moraga 2002 General Plan is a policy document designed for ease of use and readability. To
achieve this goal, the Plan’s technical documentation and environmental analysis have been
compiled separately in companion documents to the General Plan.
General Plan Background Report
In the process of preparing the Moraga 2002 General Plan, various technical data were collected,
analyzed, and summarized. Much of this information was presented in two key reports prepared
during the planning process: the Existing Conditions and Trends Report (November 1999) and the
Alternatives Analysis Technical Report (April 2000). Additional information was compiled and
presented as needed to support the discussions of the General Plan Steering Committee.
The General Plan Background Report is a compilation of this technical information. It also
provides documentation of the project’s various outreach activities and input received from the
public through those activities. The information it contains serves as the technical appendix of the
General Plan as well as supplemental baseline data for the Draft EIR.
Environmental Impact Report
State law requires preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) if “any aspect of the
general plan element or amendment, either individually or cumulatively, leads to a significant
effect on the environment, regardless of whether or not its total effect is adverse or beneficial….”
(Title 14, California Administrative Code, Section 15080).
The Moraga 2002 General Plan is accompanied by a EIR, under separate cover, analyzing and
documenting the updated General Plan’s potential environmental impacts and, where applicable,
associated mitigation measures (i.e., actions that can be taken to reduce or eliminate adverse
impacts). It also addresses other State-mandated components of a Draft EIR for a General Plan.
Following circulation of the Draft Moraga 2002 General Plan and Draft EIR, responses were
prepared for the comments received. The Final EIR was be certified prior to adoption of the final
Moraga 2002 General Plan.

           When applying the preceding table, apply following
           qualifications, if supported by environmental analysis:
           a) Additional Lots for TDRs and Density Bonuses. Allow
                additional lots of 10,000 square feet or larger (beyond
                the percentages listed) to accommodate Transfer of
                Development Rights or Density Bonus.
           b) Variations in the Mix of Lot Sizes. Allow, subject to
                approval of the Town Council, any percentage category
                listed in the Table to be increased by no more than 20
                percent of the specific percentage listed as long as the
                total allowable lots are not increased in the aggregate.
                Allow the mix of lot sizes to vary by more than 20
                percent for projects incorporating major outdoor
                recreational facilities, subject to the review and
                determination of the Planning Commission.
           c) Clustering on Smaller Lot Sizes. In 2 DUA and 3 DUA
                categories, allow units to be clustered on lots less than
                10,000 square feet, subject to Planning Commission
                review and approval, so long as the clustered units

             units is compatible with the adjacent residential
             neighborhood, and existing single family developments
             are not adversely impacted.
         d) Lot Size and Slope. Generally, locate smaller lots on the
             more level sites and larger lots on the steeper slopes.
             Require larger lot sizes if necessary to mitigate negative
             visual impacts and/or geologic hazards.
         e) Lot Sizes in Open Space Areas. Lot sizes in areas
             designated “Non-MOSO Open Space or MOSO Open
             Space” on the General Plan Diagram may be less than
             40,000 sq. ft., but not less than 15,000 sq. ft., when part
             of the overall project will provide outdoor recreational
             facilities with guaranteed permanent access to the
             general public. This policy may not be used to alter the
             density on lands designated MOSO Open Space.

LU1.7    Residential - 6 DUA Developments. The Residential - 6
         DUA designation provides for developments that are
         primarily single family in character but may include the use
         of zero lot line, attached, or duplex units. Townhouse
         projects with recreational and open space amenities are also
         appropriate in this designation. Planning for these areas

         reasonable common open space and/or recreational areas
         and facilities.
LU1.8    Slope Restrictions. The soil characteristics in Moraga are
         prone to landslide conditions which can cause damage to
         property, injury to persons, public cost and inconvenience;
         therefore, development shall be avoided on slopes of 20
         percent or steeper, but may be permitted if supported by
         site-specific analysis. No new residential structures may be
         placed on after-graded average slopes of 25 percent or
         steeper within the development area, except that this
         provision shall not apply to new residential structures on
         existing lots that were either legally created after March 1,
         1951 or specifically approved by the Town Council after
3-4                                                             June 2002

           with an average predevelopment slope of 25% or more
           within the proposed development area shall be prohibited
           unless formally approved by the Town Council where it
           can be supported by site-specific analysis and shown that a
           minimum amount of grading is proposed in the spirit of and

           Plan Diagram as the ‘Moraga Center Area Specific Plan,’
           coordinated as appropriate with the planning for the Rheem
           Park Area Specific Plan. Address the following issues
           through the specific plan process:
           a) Vision. Define a long-term vision for the area’s
               development and redevelopment as a community focal
               point and activity center, defining specifically the
               area’s role within the larger structure of the Town and
               its relation to the Rheem Park Specific Plan Area.
           b) Mix of Uses. Establish an appropriate mix of residential
               and commercial use areas in addition to community
               facilities and open space areas. Focus in particular on
               those parcels that are undeveloped, under-utilized, or
               subject to potential redevelopment.
           c) Housing. Define appropriate locations and densities to
               achieve the Town’s fair share of ‘Regional Housing
               Need’ in keeping with the goals and policies of the
               Housing Element. Provide a mix of housing types that
               is fitting with Moraga’s community character and
               responds to the needs of lower and moderate income
               households, the local workforce, seniors, and ‘empty-
               nesters.’
           d) Retail and Office Uses. Define appropriate locations
               and densities for new or redeveloped retail and office
               uses. Explore opportunities for new types of specialty
               retail stores and/or flexible small office arrangements
               that may respond to Moraga’s evolving community
               needs.
           e) Town Center Facility. Identify possible sites for a
               potential Town Center facility and define its
               relationship to and connections with other uses within
               the Specific Plan Area as well as with adjacent
               residential neighborhoods.
           f) Design Quality. Establish design guidelines to create an
               attractive pedestrian-friendly environment and reflect
               Moraga’s community character.

               location of building sites so that visual impacts are
               minimized. When grading land with an average slope of
               20% of more, require ‘natural contour’ grading to minimize
               soil displacement and use of retainer walls. Design
               buildings and other improvements in accordance with the
               natural setting, maintaining a low profile and providing

           several smaller buildings; providing variations in rooflines;
           creating a three-dimensional façade rather than a massive,
           flat façade; and using landscaping to soften building edges.

HOUSING
The housing element identifies opportunities, challenges and resources associated with the
                                                                                          5
provision of housing in the Town of Moraga. While it is required by the State, the housing
element is a local document with a local impact. It is a chance for us to think strategically about
housing in Moraga, to consider our changing communities, and to plan how to best meet their
needs. It is an opportunity to evaluate existing policies, and prepare to meet future challenges.
Housing in Moraga is generally working well. The housing stock is in good shape and the Town
is a desirable place to live. Residents are, by and large, happy with current conditions.
Some of the major issues in Moraga today include the aging population, the need for
sustainability and the desire for workforce housing. Many of these issues are addressed through
the Moraga Center Specific Plan, which lays the groundwork for a walkable, mixed use village
center for Moraga.
Because of its length, the first two sections of the housing element are bound with the General
Plan and the remaining sections are bound separately.

B.       Implementation Programs
See table on pages 5-14 for a summary of programs. Note: implementation program numbers
may not be sequential because implementing programs unrelated to housing (from other
elements of the General Plan) share a number system, but are not reprinted below.
General Programs
IP-A1 Continue to Use the General Plan
        Use the General Plan Diagram to guide land use planning activities in the Town and its Sphere of
        Influence area. Use the Circulation System of the General Plan Diagram to guide activities
        related to goods movement, emergency vehicle routes, street closures and other activities that
        affect the transportation system, local businesses and residents. Review and update the General
        Plan Diagram as part of the annual General Plan review process.
Ordinances
IP-B1    Revise the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances
         Revise the Town’s Zoning Map, Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Ordinance, as needed, to
         maintain consistency with the adopted General Plan and, specifically, to achieve the following:
            Incorporate the land use plans of the Moraga Center and Rheem Park Area Specific Plans,
             when completed. Until such time that the new Specific Plans are completed, the previous General Plan
             designations and existing zoning shall apply in the specific plan areas.
            Retain existing residential zoning and discourage non-residential uses in these zones.
            Provide for density bonuses in residential districts, consistent with State law requirements
             (California Govt. Code 65915).
            Continue to allow the renting of rooms/quarters in single family homes as a permitted use in
             single family zones. This will help meet the needs of extremely low income households.
            Permit emergency housing by right in the Institutional Zone.
            Continue to allow manufactured housing on single family lots if placed on permanent
             foundations and subject to compliance with Town Design Guidelines.
            Review the requirements for secondary units and implement changes, including permitting
             detached units under certain circumstances.
            Prohibit the creation of new non-MOSO lots unless the after-graded average slope of the
             proposed development area is less than 25 percent.

C.       Development Review
IP-C1    Undertake Development Review
         Undertake development reviews to ensure compliance with applicable local, regional, State, and
         federal laws and adopted policies. Ensure that developers contribute funding for on-site and off-
         site improvements that mitigate impacts of development.
         Specifically, review development proposals to ensure:
             Neighborhood Quality. Continue to examine site and building plans to ensure that layout and
              design meet Town objectives for neighborhood quality (including minimizing burglary,
              vandalism, and other crimes).
             Performance Standards. Ensure that one or more of the following conditions will be met:
               Performance standards will be maintained consistent with adopted mitigation programs
                   following project occupancy;
               Additional mitigation measures are available and will be required of the project sponsor
                   in order to insure maintenance standards; or
               Capital projects planned by the Town or special districts will result in the maintenance
                   of standards. Improvements should be in place at the time of project implementation.
             Acceptable Noise Levels. Discourage the siting of residences adjacent to major arterials unless
              noise can be reduced to acceptable levels, consistent with State law. Encourage designs that
              orient sensitive portions of buildings away from noise sources; utilize the natural terrain to
              screen structures from major arterials or other noise sources; and use appropriate design
              techniques to reduce adverse noise impacts.
             Solar Access. Discourage the design and siting of buildings in a manner that may reduce solar
              access for adjacent buildings or properties.
             Emergency Response. Appropriate consideration of emergency response planning.
             Fire Prevention. Appropriate fire prevention measures, including fire protection systems and
              fire-retardant roofs in accordance with adopted ordinances and standards.
             Safe Subdivision Design. Subdivision design and platting of each parcel so that there is a safe
              building location.

             Slope Stability. Location of development in the most stable portion of each subdivision
              and/or parcel, with a statement from the project engineering geologist and geotechnical
              engineer to this effect, subject to review of the Town’s consulting geotechnical engineer and
              engineering geologist.
             Seismic Safety. Design and construction according to the seismic standards of the latest edition
              of the Uniform Building Code, with public buildings, multi-story buildings, office and
              commercial buildings, and public infrastructure designed to the highest feasible standards of
              seismic design by a structural engineer according to expected levels of seismic shaking, with
              review by a qualified structural engineer.
IP-C3    Undertake Design Review
         Submit all applicable development proposals to the Design Review Board to ensure consistency
         with the design goals and policies of the General Plan and the Town Design Guidelines.
IP-C9    Study Development Process Simplification
         Study ways to reduce the time needed for subdivision approval, while protecting the character of
         Moraga.
D.       Codes and Enforcement
IP-D2 Conduct Building Inspection, Code Enforcement and Hazard Abatement Activities
         Encourage the County to continue to respond to complaints of substandard property conditions
         by inspecting properties and enforcing applicable building, health and safety codes. Regularly
         inform elected and appointed officials regarding code compliance and enforcement issues.
         For critical structures and development in risk areas, encourage the County to implement a pro-
         active program of building inspection, code enforcement, and hazard and nuisance abatement.
         Specifically:
             Substandard Structures. Inspect and vacate or condemn structures that are damaged or are in
              imminent peril, using public nuisance abatement powers.
             Hazards in Town Buildings. Reduce non-structural hazards in all Town buildings.
             Continuing Education for Seismic Safety. Require inspectors to attend continuing education
              programs to ensure their familiarity with principles of seismic design and with seismic code
              requirements.
             Grading and Foundation Inspections. Establish inspection procedures to ensure that all grading
              and foundation work is observed and documented at specific critical stages. For sensitive
              sites, require periodic grading and foundation inspection by the Town’s engineering geologist
              and/or geotechnical engineer.
             Inspection of Critical Public Buildings. For particularly critical public buildings, require periodic
              inspection by the Town’s structural engineer for seismic safety.
IP-D3 Promote Universal Design
         Encourage new construction and renovations to follow the principles of universal design,
         ensuring that the buildings are usable by people of all ability levels. Provide information to the
         public, the Design Review Board, the Planning Commission, and others.

Chapter 5: Housing
E.       Design Guidelines
Review and update the Town Design Guidelines to implement the goals and policies of the General Plan,
including its Community Design Element. Specific areas to address include:
IP-E2 Review and Update Residential Design Guidelines
         Review and update design standards and guidelines to address residential design issues in existing
         and potential future single family residential developments, including:
      Subdivision Design to encourage lot and street configurations adapted to topography and natural
         features.
      Street Design to discourage closed loop streets.
      Landscape Character to encourage street trees and landscaping and retain significant views, with
         provisions for drought-tolerant species, use of recycled water, and other water conservation
         measures.
      Pedestrian Environment to create interconnected sidewalk/pathway linkages to adjacent
         neighborhoods, commercial centers and community facilities such as parks and schools; provide
         for pedestrian-oriented lighting; and, where feasible, encourage landscape strips between the
         sidewalk and curb to buffer pedestrians from automobiles.
      Home Design to encourage home designs that are consistent with existing residential character,
         with appropriate height, scale and setback requirements; and to discourage the visual dominance
         of garages on streets by limiting the frontage (by percentage and by location) occupied by garage
         doors.
      Energy Efficiency to encourage home designs and retrofitting to conserve energy through use of
         active and/or passive solar energy systems, ceiling insulation, ceiling fans, low-energy appliances,
         and/or other measures.
      Equipment Screening to encourage appropriate screening of mechanical equipment, solar collectors,
         satellite dishes, communication devices and similar devices, with special attention given to
         buildings whose roofs are viewed from higher elevations.
      Infill Development to promote more sensitive building additions and infill projects that preserve the
         scale and character of the existing neighborhood.
      Public Places to provide facilities and amenities appropriate to the neighborhood, such as
         neighborhood parks, childcare centers, schools and churches, ensuring appropriate siting and
         design.
      Clustering to preserve natural features and open spaces and minimize grading.
      Landscaping in Hillside Areas to address issues such as fire resistance, erosion control, drought
         tolerance, and visual buffering for privacy.
      Estate Housing to address issues specific to large-lot developments in outlying areas.
IP-E3 Review and Update Multi-Family Residential Design Guidelines
         Review and update design standards and guidelines to address issues specific to the planning,
         design and management of multi-family residential developments, including:
      Site Design to encourage developments that are oriented towards the public street rather than to
         an internal parking area.
      Density and Housing Type Mix to encourage a variety of housing types and discourage too high a
         concentration of any one unit or building type in a single area.
      Building Design to encourage buildings that reflect the scale and quality of their surroundings and
         which fit the character of existing residential neighborhoods.
      Landscaping to encourage developments that blend with the natural setting, with provisions for
         drought-tolerant and fire resistive plant species, use of recycled water, and other water
         conservation measures.
      Sense of Entry and Individuality to provide a public entry point and a ‘sense of address’ toward the
         street or directly to an open space on the site.

        Outdoor Spaces and Amenities to encourage garden spaces and outdoor play spaces on the site.
        Pedestrian Environment to create a place where it is pleasant and safe to walk, orienting buildings
         towards public sidewalks and providing yards and landscaped setbacks.
IP-E5 Develop Public Safety Guidelines
         Develop planning and design guidelines for implementation of design ideas that can help prevent
         or reduce crime (e.g., through attention to sight-lines to front doors and windows and from front
         windows to the street).
G.       Ongoing Programs

              workforce housing, including housing for extremely low income households..
IP-H5 Adopt Reasonable Accommodations Procedures for People with Disabilities
         Adopt an ordinance to provide individuals with disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules,
         policies, practices and procedures that may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. The
         purpose of this is to provide a process for individuals with disabilities to make requests for
         reasonable accommodation in regard to relief from the various land use, zoning, or building laws,
         rules, policies, practices and/or procedures of the City.
IP-H6 Address Homeless Housing, Services and Referral
         Provide referrals to private and public agencies that offer assistance and shelter to homeless

         construction.
IP-H11 Promote Secondary Units.
         Where appropriate, promote secondary units to meet the needs of seniors, extended families,
         households with domestic help, students and others. In particular, encourage secondary units in
         new subdivisions. Specific policies include:
                   Create a program to encourage owners of secondary units built without appropriate
                    permits to bring their buildings up to code.
                   Identify methods to simplify the secondary unit approval process to encourage new
                    units, while protecting the single family character of neighborhoods.
                   Develop a database to understand trends in secondary units.
IP-H12 Revise the Definition of Family
         Amend the definition of family so it is consistent with State and federal law, ensuring that it does
         not pose a constraint for people with disabilities, large families, etc.

II.         QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
State law requires all jurisdictions to identify specific objectives for new construction,
rehabilitation and conservation/preservation of affordable housing. The following table
summarizes the goals for the Town of Moraga. It assumes the housing market will rebound and
there will be strong demand for residential construction. The goals refer to the beginning of
construction. It may take several years for larger projects, like the Moraga Center Specific Plan,
to be completed.

Rehabilitation is assumed based on the County Rehabilitation Loan Program (Implementation Program IP-H3).
There is no known need for conservation at this point, consequently, it is not listed. Section 8 assumptions are
 based on implementation of IP-H4.

     III.         SUMMARY
 Moraga maintains a small town feel. There are currently nearly 16,200 people and 5,800
     housing units in the Town of Moraga (2009 estimate).
 Housing in Moraga is primarily single family homes. When the Town incorporated in
     1974, 68 percent of the housing units were single family homes. Single family homes
     comprise 86 percent of the housing stock in 2009.
 Slow growth has occurred in recent years. Moraga’s housing stock has increased by about
     30 percent since incorporation, a moderate rate of growth in comparison to the San
     Francisco Bay Area region.
 There is the potential for near-term increases in the number of housing units in
     Moraga. Although development in the past ten years has been limited, several projects
     under construction or in the planning stage will increase the total housing supply by another
     100 to 200 units within the next five years to a little over 6,000 units, assuming healthy
     housing market conditions.
 The Moraga Center Specific Plan will provide more housing choices in the
     community and improve the job / housing balance. While Moraga will always be
     predominantly a single family home community, the types of housing possible under the
     Moraga Center Specific Plan will create more housing choices for seniors, local workers and
     students of Saint Mary’s College. The Specific Plan will increase the number of jobs in the
     community, and provide up to 100 workforce housing units and up to 490 senior housing
     units as well as congregate care and assisted living developments.
 Moraga’s housing stock is generally in good condition. Most of Moraga’s housing was
     constructed after 1960 and is in good condition. It is estimated that less than one percent of
     the Town’s housing stock was in need of repair in 2000.
Housing Cost and Affordability
 Moraga has high land costs. Moraga is a high-cost housing area due to the desirability of
     its location and environment. Land values are substantially higher in Moraga than in many
     other Bay Area communities, and homebuilders tend to focus on the higher end of the
     housing market when constructing homes in the Town.
 Moraga has high housing costs. The 2009 median housing value in Moraga was
     approximately $923,000, nearly double that of the county as a whole. The median rent in
     2000 was $1,084, 30 percent higher than the county. The median sales price for homes in
     Moraga for February 2009 to April 2009 was $567,500, a 31 percent decrease compared to
     the prior year (Trulia). The average listing price however is much higher, just under
     $1,000,000 (Trulia). This median housing price is unaffordable for households earning
     median income.

                                                                                    Chapter 5: Housing
 The vast majority of very low and low income renters in Moraga are overpaying for
    housing. More than 50 percent of lower income residents were overpaying for housing in
    2000 (i.e., paying more than 30 percent of their household income on rent), with over 75
    percent of very low income renters overpaying (HUD CHAS). Students with limited
    incomes and seniors with fixed incomes are two of the groups most affected by high
    housing costs.
 Land costs are one of the greatest impediments to the production of affordable
    housing in Moraga. The cost of a development-ready lot is hard to estimate because so
    little land is available at any given time. Lots on the market today range from $675,000 to
    $1,400,000. Because of the strong local demand for higher-priced homes, even small-lot
    single family developments contain homes selling for $600,000 or more.
 Construction costs are high and homes are large, further increasing housing prices.
    Because Moraga’s housing market is oriented to high-priced homes, builders tend to
    construct larger dwellings containing many upgrades. The cost per square foot of such
    homes is typically $200 to $350. Because the home sizes are 3,000 to 4,500 square feet, the
    construction cost of these homes will be at least $600,000.
 Geologic conditions lower potential densities and increase construction costs.
    Unstable soils, steep slopes, landslide susceptibility, and other hazardous land conditions
    reduce the feasible development density of most residentially designated land, and thereby
    limit the number of new dwelling units that can be accommodated in the Town. These soil
    and slope conditions also increase land development and construction costs due to the
    extensive grading, soils analysis, and construction techniques that must be employed.
 Sites for development of affordable housing are limited. Potential areas for multi-family
    development that could include dwellings affordable to low income households are primarily
    located in or near the Town’s major commercial hubs at Moraga Road / Rheem Boulevard
    and at Moraga Way / Moraga Road. These could potentially be constructed as part of a
    mixed use development project.
 Lower interest rates would have a marginal effect on housing affordability in Moraga.
    Low and moderate income households would not be able to purchase even the least
    expensive homes in Moraga without subsidized interest rates and/or a large down payment
    from the sale of a previous home or other source. In order to bring their monthly payments
    into an affordable range, a lower income household would have to make a down payment of
    approximately $500,000 or more to purchase a relatively inexpensive house in the Town,
    while a moderate income household would have to make a down payment of approximately
    $265,000. This is obviously not feasible for most people.

Chapter 5: Housing
Special Needs Groups
 The senior population is growing quickly and has unique needs. Many older
     households overpay for their housing. Although social security and retirement incomes
     generally guarantee that retirees do not fall below the poverty level, housing costs can still
     outstrip incomes for many. In Moraga in 2000, 22 percent of homeowners 62 years of age or
     more and 51 percent of renters in this age group paid 30 percent or more of their income on
     housing. Outreach to Moraga seniors in May 2009 found a clear preference for housing
     opportunities that supported aging in place.
 Student housing is a special housing need in Moraga. Officials at Saint Mary’s College
     estimate that between 200 and 300 off-campus students live in Moraga, representing
     between 20 and 30 percent of the approximately 955 undergraduate students living off-
     campus (out of a total undergraduate enrollment of approximately 2,515).
Potential Governmental Housing Constraints
 Because Moraga is located in such a high-priced housing market, most of the
     Town’s regulations have little substantive effect on the affordability of market rate
     housing.
 Some of the Town’s zoning and other planning requirements may reduce the
     feasibility of affordable multi-family housing development, including:
        Zoning regulations that allow multi-family housing only with approval of a conditional
         use permit;
        Parking requirements that may increase development costs and reduce the effective
         development density of affordable multi-family housing;
        The design review process that may delay and/or result in expensive modifications to
         housing projects, adversely affecting the financial feasibility of affordable multi-family
         housing; and
        Second unit standards that permit such dwellings in all single family neighborhoods but
         which limit the number that can feasibly be built due to parking requirements, minimum
         lot size limits and other requirements.

IV. EXISTING HOUSING NEED
A.       Introduction
This chapter contains background information on existing conditions and trends in the Town’s
housing stock, housing projections, housing needs, and factors that may constrain the Town’s
ability to meet its housing needs. To analyze housing needs, it evaluates housing availability and
cost in relation to household characteristics and income, the needs of special population groups,
and future housing needs in relation to factors that may affect the ability of the Town to meet
those needs.
B.       Public Outreach and Engagement
In order to ensure that the housing element meets the needs of all segments of the population,
the Town has conducted a broad outreach program. This included talking with realtors,
developers and representatives from Saint Mary’s College, as well as holding outreach events.
The public had the opportunity to comment at two Planning Commission meetings and one
Town Council meeting, before the plan was finalized and sent to HCD for review. In addition,
staff set up an information booth at the Moraga Faire on May 9th, 2009. Staff had many
informal conversations about the goals of residents and collected 14 surveys. The survey focused
on three major areas, the needs of Moraga, second units and sustainability.
The surveys showed a preference for more of the existing pattern of single family development
and a desire for slow or no growth. They showed a mixed feeling on second units, with one
resident expressing an interest in building a second unit and eleven having no interest. Five
residents said they would be strongly opposed if their neighbor wanted to build a second unit,
four would be weakly opposed and three not sure. There was strong support for requiring
buildings to be green, seven people expressed support for mandatory requirements and two
expressed opposition.
Additionally, on May 11th, 2009 staff met with approximately 125 members of the Moraga
Movers, a nonprofit membership organization made up of seniors living in Moraga. At this
meeting staff described the General Plan and asked for feedback about housing issues. The clear
preference of the seniors was for support for aging in place. Additionally, the participants at the
meeting expressed a need for more shopping opportunities that met the needs of seniors. They
felt without these retail options, it is hard for seniors to live in Moraga.
In addition, there were dozens of meetings about the Moraga Center Specific Plan over the last
six years. This included one-on-one conversations with landowners and other stakeholders,
charrettes, community meetings, as well as Planning Commission and Town Council meetings.
Outreach efforts have focused on low and moderate income groups. Conversations with Saint
Mary’s College have been one way of meeting this requirement. Many students at the College are
lower income and many employees are lower or moderate income. Additionally, seniors tend to
be lower income and the Town met with a senior group while preparing the Housing Element.

C.        Demographics
Moraga’s population started to grow when the town was developed in the 1960s. The population
grew quickly through the 1970s, but has stabilized in recent years. In 1974 there were 14,418
people, compared to the current population of 16,204. Moraga’s growth rate from 2000 to 2010
is predicted to be 2.5 percent, which is similar to its neighbors, 2.5 percent for Lafayette and 2.3
percent for Orinda. This is significantly lower than the county growth rate of 12 percent for the
ten year period.

Moraga has fewer youth and more seniors than the county as a whole. Eighteen percent of the
population is under the age of 18 (versus 24 percent in the county) and an additional 18 percent
is over age 65 (versus 12 percent in the county) (Claritas 2009). The median age in Moraga is 43,
compared to 38 in the County as a whole. Additionally, there are many aging babyboomers,
which will nearly double the senior population in the next ten years, based on current migration
rates and life expectancies.

D.        Employment
There were approximately 5,000 jobs in Moraga in 2005. The largest employer is Saint Mary’s
College, followed by the school district. The number is expected to rise to 5,600 by 2020.
Moraga has many more households than jobs, which contributes to traffic as residents commute
elsewhere for work. The median household income in Moraga is $153,617 (Claritas 2009). This
is well above the countywide median income of $103,682. While many Moraga residents have
high skill, high salary occupations, most of the jobs in Moraga are in the health, education or
recreation field, and many have low to moderate pay. In this situation, many Moraga residents
commute out of the town for work, while many Moraga jobs are worked by people who
commute into Moraga.

E.         Housing Inventory and Condition
Housing Growth
Most of Moraga’s growth and development occurred prior to the Town’s incorporation in 1974.
At the time of its incorporation, Moraga contained approximately 4,500 housing units, of which
68 percent were single family homes. By January 1999, the total housing stock had increased to
5,778 (a 28 percent increase), of which 85 percent were single family homes. Figure 5-5 shows
historical growth in the Town’s housing stock and compares the Town’s growth rate with that of
Contra Costa County and the Bay region. Growth has slowed significantly since 1999, with only

Housing Types
Moraga has been predominantly a single family community since its earliest days. Although
townhouses and multi-family dwellings have been constructed since the Town incorporated in
1974, single family homes still comprise 87 percent of the housing stock. The percentage of
single family homes is higher than the county average of 70 percent. Figure 5-6 compares the
composition of the Town’s housing stock in relation to Contra Costa County and the region.
Both the county and the region have a substantially higher percentage of multi-family housing in
buildings of five or more dwellings.
Age and Condition of Housing Stock
Most of Moraga’s housing was constructed since 1960 and is in relatively good condition.
Although the Town has not conducted a comprehensive survey of housing conditions, it rarely
receives complaints from residents regarding substandard, unsightly, or hazardous property or
building conditions. The last estimate prepared for the 1990 Housing Element indicated that just
11 dwelling units, or 0.2 percent of the housing stock, were in need of rehabilitation. Because
residential property values are high in Moraga, owners have an economic incentive to maintain
their properties in good condition.
The percentage of dwelling units needing repairs may be higher now that many homes are more
than 40 years old. Homes occupied by elderly residents on modest incomes are of particular
concern, as these residents may have difficulty meeting maintenance costs. However, there is no
evidence of a pervasive problem with housing conditions in the Town. Figure 5-7 shows the age
of the Town’s housing stock and provides some insight into the possible number of dwellings
that may need rehabilitation.

Tenure
Moraga has a long history of high homeownership levels. In 2009, 84 percent of the Town’s
residents are homeowners (Claritas 2009), which is unchanged since 1990. The homeownership
rate in Moraga is higher than in Contra Costa County (70 percent). Moraga’s relatively high rate
of homeownership compared to the county and the region results from the larger percentage of
single family homes and the higher incomes of its residents. Except for householders under age
35, all age groups in Moraga have homeownership rates of 80 percent or higher (Census 2000).
Among householders under 35, approximately 50 percent are homeowners (Census 2000).
Among the likely reasons that half the households in this age group live in rental housing are
that: 1) they are students at Saint Mary’s College, or 2) their incomes are not yet sufficient to
afford homeownership.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding is not a substantial problem in Moraga. According to the 2000 Census, fewer
than two percent of Moraga households lived in overcrowded conditions, defined as more than
one person per room (excluding bathrooms, kitchens, and hallways). Of the 102 households that
were overcrowded, 80 (78 percent) were owner-occupied.
The small incidence of overcrowding in Moraga is likely due to the low percentage of large
households that require dwellings with three or more bedrooms to avoid overcrowded
conditions. Almost 75 percent of the Town’s households in 2000 consisted of families or
unrelated groups with three or fewer persons per dwelling. Those households living in
overcrowded conditions were likely to be lower income families of six or more persons who
could not afford homes with three or more bedrooms. Some of those living in overcrowded
conditions could also have been students at Saint Mary’s College, but this cannot be confirmed
from a review of Census or other available data.
Moraga Center Specific Plan
For the past seven years, Moraga has been working to develop an attractive, pedestrian-friendly
village environment with retail, office and housing on 187 acres adjacent to the Moraga center
shopping center. This vision will take a step closer to reality when the Town Council adopts the
plan, anticipated in January 2010. In total, the plan calls for up to 630 housing units and 90,000
square feet of new retail and entertainment space, and up to 50,000 square feet of new office
space. The exact number of housing units is limited by the traffic impacts, but could be as many
as 630 dwellings.
In addition to increasing the number of jobs in the community, the Moraga Center Specific Plan
(MCSP) seeks to improve the Town’s job/housing balance by providing up to 100 workforce
housing units. The MCSP also addresses the need for senior housing in Moraga with up to 300
units at a maximum density of 30 dwelling units per acre as well as congregate care and assisted
living developments. A 20,000 square foot community center/gymnasium is also being
considered for the MCSP. To support the existing and proposed retail and office space and to
spur reinvestment in the existing shopping center, the Specific Plan also contemplates up to 180
primarily compact or attached single family residences between Camino Ricardo and the creek.
Lastly, because there are currently no facilities to accommodate overnight guests in Moraga the
MCSP provides for the construction of up to 85 rooms of bed and breakfast or hotel use.

Chapter 5: Housing
Secondary Units
Secondary units can provide an important source of flexible and affordable housing in Moraga
and the Town has chosen to strongly encourage their construction and recognition, particularly
in new housing. However, secondary units must blend with the small town character of Moraga
and developments must be sensitive to concerns of existing residents. See the available land
inventory section for more details.
Because there are not many apartments in Moraga, there is a lack of data about the affordability
of second units. According to a recent Craigslist search, one bedroom second units rent for $895
and $1,100 in the Moraga/Orinda/Lafayette area, and two bedrooms rent for between $1,500
and $1,696. (Based on six unique results found with the keyword search “in-law” conducted on
May 26th, 2009.)
Some secondary units will be made available at no market rent for family members, domestic
help, etc., so these units can be treated as affordable to extremely low income residents.
According to the 2000 Census (adjusted for inflation), approximately one quarter of apartments
rent for under $930, 44 percent rent for $930-$1,239, and 32 percent rent for more than $1,240.
In 2009, an apartment must cost less than $670 to be affordable to an extremely low income
household with one person, less than $1,160 to be affordable to a very low income household,
and less than $1,656 to be affordable to a median income household.
For the purposes of this housing element, we assume the following affordability ranges for
second units:
            Ten percent are affordable to extremely low income households
            Twenty percent are affordable to very low income households
            Twenty percent are affordable to low income households
            Twenty five percent are affordable to moderate income households
            Twenty five percent are affordable to above moderate income households
F.       Housing Cost and Affordability
Since its incorporation, Moraga has been a higher cost housing area due to the desirability of its
location, environment, and schools. Land values are substantially higher in Moraga than in many
other Bay Area communities, and homebuilders have tended to focus on the higher end of the
housing market when constructing homes in the Town. Rental housing commands higher rents
in Moraga than in the region as a whole because most rental units are single family homes and
townhomes, rather than apartment units.

The 2009 median housing value in Moraga was approximately $923,000, nearly double that of
the county as a whole. The median rent in 2000 was $1,084 ($1,112 after utilities), 30 percent
higher than the county.
The median sales price for homes in Moraga for February 2009 to April 2009 was $567,500, a 31
percent decrease compared to the prior year (Trulia). The average listing price however is much
higher, just under $1,000,000 (Trulia).
Because Moraga is a small community, month-to-month, or even annual, changes in prices or
rents may not be indicative of long term trends. A few transactions can greatly skew the median
or average price or rent reported for periods of one year or less.

Housing Price Trends
Although the long term trend since the Town’s incorporation has been for housing prices to
increase more rapidly than area incomes, home prices have not gone up continuously. The dot
com bust of 2001 and the 2008/2009 recession reversed that trend temporarily. The sales price
of homes fell roughly 30 percent in the past year (Feb-Apr 2008 to Feb-Apr 2009, Trulia.com).
However, as the volume of sales is low, sales prices are not totally indicative of value, and the
value of homes likely has not fallen at the same rate.
During 2006 and 2007, median home sale prices were in the range of $800,000 to $1,000,000.
While the current prices are more affordable than in recent years, the long term trend is for
median value of homes to increase faster than the median income.
Long-time residents have benefited from the growth in equity of their homes. But as these
residents sell their dwellings, newcomers purchasing those homes either have substantially higher

Chapter 5: Housing
incomes (on the order of two to three times current residents) or have large down payments
from the recent sale of a comparably-valued house.
Affordability Trends
A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is three times the annual income of
that household, depending on the down payment, the level of other long term obligations (such
a car loan), and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some
households to qualify for homes priced at more than three times their annual income, while
other households may be limited to purchasing homes less than two times their annual income.
In Moraga, and the county as a whole, the ratio of home prices to income is much higher than
three to one (3:1 or 3) . Figure 5-9 shows the ratio of the median Moraga housing price to
median town and median county income. A ratio greater than three to one indicates that the
median housing price is not affordable to a household earning the median income.
This does not mean that any particular home is unaffordable to the current resident of that
home. A high ratio can result, for example, when long-time homeowners experience large
increases in home values while their incomes increase more modestly. A homebuyer will need
substantially higher income than the current resident, however, to purchase the higher-priced
dwelling.
Another way to look at affordability levels is to use the rule of thumb that households should
not pay more than 30 percent of their income to housing. Figure 5-10 shows the maximum
monthly rent and home purchase price which is affordable for lower income families.
Figure 5-9 also shows the percentage of dwelling units that are affordable to low and moderate
income households based on a 3.0 housing price-to-income ratio.

The price of compact single family homes is of particular interest because the Moraga Center
Specific Plan envisions those units as moderately priced workforce housing. An analysis of small
homes (under 1,500 square feet) sold between June 2008 and June 2009 found that 29 percent
were affordable to moderate income residents (Source: Redfin.com). (Figures based on same
assumptions as Figure 5-10, using median income adjusted for family of three or $308,718
purchase price).
Rents
Because Moraga does not have a large apartment market, most rental listings reflect current rates
for single family homes and town homes. This is one of the contributing factors to the Town’s
substantially higher rents in comparison to Contra Costa County and the Bay region. Figure 5-11
shows the median gross rents in relation to income in 2000.

Affordability for Lower Income Households
One method of determining whether a community has a balanced housing market is to compare
the number of dwelling units in cost ranges that are affordable to low and moderate income
households. Figure 5-12 compares housing prices and incomes, and shows the number of
dwelling units affordable to low and moderate income households. Figure 5-12 shows that
Moraga has a deficit of housing affordable to low and moderate income households, and an
especially severe deficit for extremely low and very low income households.

Percentage of Income Devoted to Housing Expenses
Another measure of housing affordability is the percentage of income that households devote to
housing costs. Although some households voluntarily commit large percentages of their income
to live in a particular community or neighborhood, enjoy a certain lifestyle, or purchase/rent a
certain type of dwelling, most governmental agencies, lenders, and housing analysts consider 30
percent of income as the maximum percentage that should be devoted to housing expenses
under normal circumstances, particularly for low and moderate income households. US Census
data indicates 235 of 315 (75 percent) lower income renter and 361 of 605 (63 percent) lower
income owner households paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing. Figure 5-13
shows the number and percentage of households devoting 30 percent or more for housing
expenses in 2000.

Figure 5-12 shows that virtually all very low income renter households, and the majority of low
income renter households, paid 30 percent of more for housing in 1990. Low-income
homeowners also had a high incidence of overpayment. Moderate and above moderate income
homeowners had a somewhat higher incidence of overpayment than renters did. This may have
been a voluntary response to the high home prices in Moraga.
G.        Special Needs Groups
Older Adults
The senior population of Moraga is growing quickly. Figure 5-14 shows estimated changes in
population based on recent trends.
Figure 5-14. Senior Population Growth
Sources: US Census 2000, Claritas Demographic Snapshot 2009, ABAG age specific mortality and migration rates for region.

Chapter 5: Housing
Most seniors in Moraga own their homes, while just over eight percent rent.
Older adults, primarily those 65 years of age or more who are retired, generally have two distinct
housing needs that set them apart from the population at large:
 Financial Assistance: because incomes tend to be lower than the population at large, many
      retirees do not have the financial capacity to maintain or repair their homes. They may be
      “house rich” but “income poor.” Elderly households who rent may not be able to cover rent
      increases.
 Physical Accommodation: as retirees age, their physical abilities and needs change. The home
      that may have served them well for decades may no longer be suited to their physical needs.
Income
Retirees typically have incomes below the average. Most retirees live on a combination of Social
Security, pension, interest, and other forms of income typically associated with retirement.
Although the level of income of Moraga’s retirees is generally higher than that of the region, the
median income is still substantially below that for all households.
The 2000 Census reported that households headed by individuals 65-74 years of age had a
median income of approximately $70,132, 34 percent below the town-wide median of nearly
$98,000. The income of seniors 75 years old and older is approximately $52,500. Figure 5-15
compares the percentage of households who were low and moderate income by age group in
2000. Figure 5-15 shows that households headed by individuals 62 years of age or more had a
greater percentage of low and moderate income households. This is not surprising considering
that the overwhelming majority of households in this age group reported Social Security,
interest, pension payments, and the like as their primary sources of income. Seniors who rent
were especially vulnerable. Three quarters of the extremely low and almost half of the very low
income seniors are spending more than 50 percent of their income on rent. If rents increase,
which they likely will, or senior incomes decrease, which they tend to do as seniors age, these
seniors are at risk for displacement. While not a large population (approximately 60 households),
these seniors are an important component of the community.

Although older adult households are largely low and moderate income, retirement incomes
generally guarantee that retirees do not fall below the poverty level. Older adults typically have

poverty rates by age group. Even the highest poverty rates are well below the double-digit rates
common in many communities for families with children.

However, this does not mean that a substantial percentage of older households do not
experience financial difficulties in properly maintaining their homes, paying customary housing
expenses, or meeting monthly rental expenses. The 2000 Census reported that 22 percent of
homeowners 62 years of age or more and 52 percent of renters in this age group paid 30 percent
or more for housing (as summarized by HUD in the CHAS database). These data on the
incomes and housing expenses of households 62 and older indicate that a substantial number of
these older adults (particularly renters) may need assistance to either:
 repair and maintain their dwellings units,
 relocate to housing without such high maintenance and repair costs,
 afford their current rental housing, or
 relocate to more affordable rental housing specifically designed for seniors.
Capacity for Independent Living
Another need that is typical for older adults is assistance in daily living. As individuals age, their
self-care capacities and mobility decline, although not uniformly. Many of the very old, in
particular those 85 years of age and older, may need assistance in daily living. Outreach to
Moraga seniors in May 2009 found a clear preference for housing opportunities that supported
aging in place. Housing designed for older adults with mobility and self-care limitations would
fill a need among those older adults who want to stay in the community.
The characteristics of households with mobility and/or self-care limitations are explored in
greater detail in the next section.
Individuals with Disabilities
The 2000 Census reported that around 1,500 of the Town’s residents over five years old had
some kind of disability. They made up around 10 percent of the total population. These
individuals have mobility impairments, self-care limitations, or other conditions that may require
special housing accommodations or financial assistance. Individuals with such disabilities can
have a number of special needs that distinguish them from the population at large:
Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010        5-35

Chapter 5: Housing
 Individuals with mobility difficulties (such as those confined to wheelchairs) may require
     special accommodations or modifications to their homes to allow for continued independent
     living. Such modifications are often called “handicapped access.”
 Individuals with self-care limitations (which can include persons with mobility difficulties)
     may require residential environments that include in-home or on-site support services,
     ranging from congregate to convalescent care. Support services can include medical therapy,
     daily living assistance, congregate dining, and related services.
 Individuals with developmental disabilities and other physical and mental conditions that
     prevent them from functioning independently may require assisted care or group home
     environments; and
 Individuals with disabilities may require financial assistance to meet their housing needs
     because a higher percentage are low income than the population at large and their special
     housing needs are often more costly than conventional housing.
Because Moraga is a relatively affluent community, most individuals with disabilities, or their
family members, are able to pay for special accommodations or housing arrangements to meet
these individuals’ needs. However, there is still a segment of the disabled population, particularly
low income, retired individuals, who may not have the financial capacity to pay for needed
accommodations or modifications to their homes. In addition, even those able to pay for special
housing accommodations may find them unavailable in Moraga.
According to the 2000 Census, there were no residential group quarters in Moraga that would
accommodate special needs individuals with disabilities, but there were 44 individuals in nursing
homes. The Town also has two senior assisted care developments, with a total capacity of
approximately 170 units (of which 15 units are set aside for very low income residents).
While individuals with these conditions do not necessarily encompass the full range of persons
with disabilities, most disabilities that may require special housing accommodations could be
considered a mobility or self-care condition. According to the Census, about 556 residents
reported disabilities that prevented them from going out of their home without assistance (359
of these residents were seniors). Figure 5-17 compares the number of people with disabilities by
age group.

Large Families
Large families (families with five or more individuals) typically require housing with three or
more bedrooms. While there is no shortage of homes in Moraga with three or more bedrooms
in relation to the number of large families, low and moderate income large families may
experience difficulty in finding affordable housing of sufficient size to meet their space needs.
According to the 2000 Census, there were 486 large families, representing a little less than ten
percent of family households in Moraga. Approximately ninety percent of large families own
their homes. The Census also reports that 56 percent of large family renters and 26 percent of
large family owners are overpaying for housing. Many of these families are paying more than 50
percent of their income to rent.
Female-headed Households
Most female-headed households are either single elderly women or single parents. Traditionally,
these two groups have been considered special needs groups because their incomes tend to be
lower, making it difficult to obtain affordable housing, or because they have specific physical
needs related to housing (such as child care or assisted living support). Single mothers in
particular tend to have the most difficulty in obtaining suitable, affordable housing.
Because Moraga is a high-income community, the proportion of single elderly women and single
mothers who are low income or below the poverty level is substantially lower than in most
communities. The 2000 Census reported 31 single mothers below the poverty level, and only
two other female householders who were below that level of income. It is unlikely, therefore,
that female-headed households in Moraga have a substantial need for financial assistance to meet
their housing needs.
Those special needs that do exist most likely relate to the support services that elderly women
and single mother need to live independently.
College Students
Saint Mary’s College, a private, parochial college located in Moraga, had an enrollment of just
under 5,000 students in 2009. Enrollment has increased approximately 10 percent during the
1998 and 2009 period. Of the total student body, just over 2,500 are traditional undergraduates
who would most likely require special student housing. About two-thirds of new undergraduate
students come from northern and central California, about 20 percent from southern California,
and the remainder from out of state.
According to College officials, Saint Mary’s accommodates about 1,560 of the undergraduate
students on campus and 955 off campus (2009). In 2002, officials estimated that between 200
and 300 of these students are accommodated in Moraga. The College plans to construct facilities
in the near future for another 200 students to live on campus, thus reducing the housing crunch
for more of the undergraduate students.
Even with the increase in campus housing, many undergraduates will choose, or be forced, to
live off campus. Some, though not most, live in Moraga. The 2000 Census reported 101 renters
Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010 5-37

Chapter 5: Housing
age 24 or less residing in Moraga. It is likely that many of these renters were students at Saint
Mary’s. The Census also reported that the median income for households age 24 or under was
just over $32,000, probably because of low income students. Most of these students likely live in
small apartments, second units, or rented rooms in the Town.
Although the College houses a substantial percentage of its undergraduates, and some students
manage to find housing in Moraga, there is likely an unmet need for additional housing
affordable and suitable to students in the area. The magnitude of this need is difficult to gauge
without better information on student incomes and family location.
People in Need of Emergency Shelter or Transitional Housing
The 2007 Contra Costa County Homeless Census found five unsheltered homeless people in the
Town out of 1,749 homeless people in the county. The count was conducted in the winter, when
seasonal demand is likely at its highest. There were two men, two women and one child. There
are no emergency or transitional housing facilities in Moraga. See Appendix A for a list of all
known agencies providing services as well as emergency, supportive and transitional housing in
Contra Costa County. While Contra Costa County does not have additional demographic or
special needs information about the homeless, it is likely that a significant number of homeless
people are suffering from issues such as depression and substance abuse.
It is not known whether there is a need for an emergency shelter or transitional housing facility
that serves women (and their children) escaping domestic violence in Moraga. In previous years,
the County has provided assistance through its Housing Crisis Loan Fund Program, although a
few individuals may have been assisted from Moraga, the number of clients is too low to justify a
separate emergency shelter or transitional housing facility in the Town.
While full details from the 2009 homeless count are not available at this time, key findings
include:
        Eight unsheltered homeless people were found in Moraga
        Countywide, there was an eight percent decrease in homeless persons in the county.
        Approximately 57 percent of unsheltered homeless persons lived in encampments.
        The number of single adults accessing services has increased by approximately 20
         percent.
        The number of homeless individuals in alcohol and drug treatment programs has
         doubled.
        There was an increase in the number of homeless individuals making use of food
         programs.
The Town of Moraga will allow emergency shelters in the institutional districts zone, currently
made up of Saint Mary’s College. There are over 300 acres in this zone, more than an enough
space to accommodate the eight individuals in the last homeless count Because of the cost of
land, it is unlikely that a shelter will be built on land zoned residential or commercial. The

institutional zone is one of the zones where it is feasible to provide a shelter. The institutional
zone is within easy walking distance to the Moraga and Rheem shopping centers and on bus
lines that go to BART. Much of the institutional zone is flat and level and has infrastructure
ready. Much of Moraga is hilly and therefore inappropriate for more intensive land uses.
Extremely Low Income Households
In 2000, there were approximately 236 extremely low income households (US Census) (making
less than $26,800 in 2009). Seniors made up approximately 63 of these households. Another
large group of these households is made up of those aged 24 and under, though the exact
number is not available. Assuming that half the very low income individuals are extremely low
income, we can assume there will be a demand for 37 units affordable to extremely low income
households between now and 2014.
According to housing experts, in many cases the most appropriate housing choice for extremely
low income households is rental. Many individuals with incomes below $26,800 will have trouble
saving for a down payment or emergency repairs. However, extremely low income individuals
may also have trouble affording market rents in Moraga. For individuals, single room occupancy
units are often an affordable solution.
Single room occupancies are permitted by right in many zones (R1, R2, R3, R6, MOSO) and by
CUP in other zones. The permitting process is the same as for single family residences. SROs
are governed by Moraga Municipal Code, section 8.148.80 It reads:
         The land use restrictions in this title are not intended to prevent a person who owns or
         occupies a residential structure from providing a room or a room and meals to one or more
         unrelated persons so long as the following conditions exist:
         A. The total number of unrelated persons occupying the residence, when added to those
         occupying it who are related, does not exceed the number of occupants for which the
         residence was designed;
         B. The number of vehicles maintained at the residence is comparable to the number
         maintained at other residences in the neighborhood and does not create traffic or parking (on
         street and off street) which is greater than that associated with the strictly residential use of
         the premises;
         C. There is no alteration of the structure which permits it to function as a second living unit
         with separate kitchen facilities. (Prior code § 8-2708)
Moraga has a new program in this housing element to expand awareness about the right to rent
rooms in a house.
Other opportunities for very low and extremely low income residents include second units,
Section 8 vouchers used in rental housing, and transitional and supportive housing.
Assisted Multi-family Development At-Risk of Conversion
A search of federal, State, and local records uncovered no assisted multi-family rental
developments that could convert to market rate housing within the next ten years. One assisted

project, Moraga Royale, a 95-unit assisted senior development, was assisted with a tax-exempt
bonds issued by Contra Costa County. Under a regulatory agreement signed in 1985, the project
owner set aside 20 percent of the units for low income seniors. Once the tax-exempt bonds were
redeemed, the project subsidy terminated and the project owner was under no further obligation
to set aside 20 percent of the units for low income seniors. The regulatory agreement expired
October 1997.
Farmworker Housing
Studies that accurately document farmworker numbers are few. Estimates place the number of
farmworkers in the United States at three to five million, including men, women, teenagers, and
children who are working in the fields and packing houses (Farmworkerhealth.org). The
farmworker population is estimated to be 84 percent male and 16 percent female. Male
farmworkers are typically single or migrating without their families.
There is no significant farming in Moraga. There are a number of recreational produce or wine
growers operating on small lots of less than five acres. The people involved with this scale of
production generally have full time employment and do not hire employees.
There are three ranches in Moraga, but these use family members for all their labor (source: John
Hoover of Hoover ranch). Additionally, there is one small orchard in town.
The 2000 US Census found that there was no farmworker housing in Moraga. However, the
Census estimated there were 17 farmers or farm managers and seven farming/fishing/forestry
workers.
H.       ABAG Housing Needs Determination
In May 2008, Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) adopted a new regional housing
allocation (RHNA) plan for the 2007-2014 planning period based on a regional need of 214,500
units.
The final RHNA calculated by ABAG determined the Town of Moraga’s share of the nine-
county Bay Area new housing construction need at 234 dwelling units between 2007 and 2014.
The Town’s assigned share was based on additional households expected to reside in the Town,
employment trends, access to transportation and other infrastructure, unmet needs among
current residents who did not have affordable housing, and the replacement of older homes
expected to be demolished during the seven-year period, among other factors.
Figure 5-18 summarizes the current allocation used to establish housing need in the Town’s
Housing Element, by income category.

Adjustments to RHNA
A recent State law, AB 1233, required jurisdictions that did not complete programs related to
making sites available for housing to complete those programs in the first year of the new
housing element cycle (June 30, 2010 for Moraga). In shorthand, the RHNA is effectively
increased in some cases if programs were not implemented.
While the Town made significant progress towards completing the Moraga Center Specific Plan
(Implementation program K-1) the necessary rezoning is not expected to happen until January
2010. Figure 5-19 shows the AB 1233 related carryover requirements.

V.          EVALUATION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS
A.          Housing Production
Although housing production has been slow in recent years, Moraga has set the stage for several
new developments. In particular, the Town recently approved a development plan for the 123-
unit Palos Colorados project.
The town has been working steadily since 2003 on the Moraga Center Specific Plan which will
allow approximately 560 housing units in and around a mixed use development. The planning
effort has required considerably more study than was initially anticipated. Additionally, it took
considerable time to do the necessary public outreach and communication with the property
owner to ensure that everyone’s needs were understood and met.
Table 5-21 summarizes housing production in Moraga from 1999 to 2007. The 20 very low
income units from 1999 and 2000 were produced by Saint Mary’s College for faculty/student
housing. These townhouses have kitchens, baths and bedrooms and therefore meet the census
definition of a housing unit. Moraga surveyed the College when they were first constructed and
the college reported renting them out at $400 a month, which was affordable to extremely low
income households. (They currently rent for $7,500 for the nine-month academic year.) The one
unit from 2005 was a secondary unit.

B.       Additional Objectives (1999 – 2006)
The Town of Moraga established quantified objectives in six program areas for the production
of additional housing affordable to low and moderate income households. Several of the
programs established a single objective for low and/or moderate income housing, so it is not
possible to evaluate the Town’s accomplishments with respect to the four income groups
represented in the Town’s regional housing needs allocation (very low income, low income,
moderate income, and above moderate income). Figure 5-22 summarizes the quantified
objectives contained in the 2002 Housing Element in relation to actual accomplishments.
The quantified objectives in Figure 5-22 represent the expectations for new housing that were
identified in the last housing element. The quantified objectives are based on the implementation
programs, the development potential of vacant and underdeveloped sites, and general market
conditions. The quantified objectives were created to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the
Housing Element.
The Town was most successful in attracting new development, see above, but did not succeed in
rehabilitating substandard units, providing homebuyer assistance, or increasing the number of
Section 8 vouchers. The primary obstacle was limited staff time and limited funding.

  IP-A1        General Plan Diagram
  Use the General Plan Diagram to guide land use planning activities in the Town and its Sphere of Influence area. Use the
  Circulation System of the General Plan Diagram to guide activities related to goods movement, emergency vehicle routes, street
  closures and other activities that affect the transportation system, local businesses and residents. Review and update the
  General Plan Diagram as part of the annual General Plan review process.
  Evaluation
  This implementation program is ongoing. No changes in the General Plan Diagram are requested at this time. Emergency
  vehicle routes were reviewed in 2007 as part of the Lamorinda Emergency Preparedness Program. New emergency vehicle
  routes were also approved in the Palos Colorados project in 2007 and are under consideration for the Bollinger Canyon area.
  The updated Emergency Preparedness Plan discusses vehicle and pedestrian routes for escape and shelter in place issues.

 IP-B1       Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances
 Revise the Town’s Zoning Map, Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Ordinance, as needed, to maintain consistency with the
 adopted General Plan and, specifically, to achieve the following:
            Incorporate the land use plans of the Moraga Center Area and Rheem Park Area Specific Plans, when completed.
             Until such time that the new specific plans are completed, the 1990 General Plan designations and existing zoning
             shall apply in the specific plan areas.
            Retain existing residential zoning and discourage non-residential uses in these zones.
            Provide for density bonuses in residential districts, consistent with State law requirements (California Govt. Code
             65915).
            Continue to allow the renting of rooms/quarters in single family homes as a permitted use in single family zones.
            Permit emergency and transitional housing in the Community Commercial Zoning District.
            Continue to allow manufactured housing on single family lots if placed on permanent foundations and subject to
             compliance with Town Design Guidelines.
            Review the requirements for second units and implement changes, including permitting detached units under certain
             circumstances.
            Prohibit the creation of new non-MOSO lots unless the after-graded average slope of the proposed development area
             is less than 25 percent.
 Evaluation
 When the Specific Plan is adopted it will require implementation through the Municipal Code. Land use densities will be changed
 to conform to the approved plan. New development standards will be required for the new zoning districts. Currently, the
 maximum allowable residential density is six dwelling units per acre. In the Specific Plan area, however, the Town is considering
 a maximum density of up to 24 dwelling units per acre. If this higher density is approved by the Town it will need to be
 implemented through the zoning ordinance in the Municipal Code.
 The Moraga Center Specific Plan has taken longer than anticipated to complete because several additional studies were
 needed. Specifically, more extensive traveling modeling was required to ensure that the plan did not exceed peak hour, peak
 direction traffic limits. Additionally, two economically viability studies (one more general and one more specific) and a park and
 recreation study were completed. Finally, the process took longer because the Town wanted to work closely with the property
 owner to understand their goals and needs.

 IP-B3        Condominium Conversions Ordinance
 Revise the Condominium Conversion Ordinance to exempt limited equity residential cooperatives that meet all of the following
 requirements to the extent necessary to comply with State Law:
 Minimum of 20 percent of the units as housing affordable to very low to moderate income households,
 Resale controls to assure long term affordability of the low and moderate income units,
 Right of first refusal of purchase of units by occupants, and
 Relocation assistance to low or moderate income households who are unable to afford the purchase of units that are converted.
 Evaluation
 As noted above, changes in the zoning code will be required to implement the Specific Plan. This program will be implemented at
 the same time as these changes as both the Specific Plan and this program relate to affordable housing.

 IP-C1       Development Review
 Undertake development reviews to ensure compliance with applicable local, regional, State, and federal laws and adopted
 policies. Ensure that developers contribute funding for on-site and off-site improvements that mitigate impacts of development.
 Specifically, review development proposals to ensure:
 Neighborhood Quality. Continue to examine site and building plans to ensure that layout and design meet Town objectives for
 neighborhood quality (including minimizing burglary, vandalism, and other crimes).
 Performance Standards. Ensure that one or more of the following conditions will be met:
 Performance standards will be maintained consistent with adopted mitigation programs following project occupancy;
 Additional mitigation measures are available and will be required of the project sponsor in order to insure maintenance
 standards; or
 Capital projects planned by the Town or special districts will result in the maintenance of standards. Improvements should be in
 place at the time of project implementation.
 Acceptable Noise Levels. Discourage the siting of residences adjacent to major arterials unless noise can be reduced to
 acceptable levels, consistent with State law. Encourage designs that orient sensitive portions of buildings away from noise
 sources, utilize the natural terrain to screen structures from major arterials or other noise sources, and use appropriate design
 techniques to reduce adverse noise impacts.
 Solar Access. Discourage the design and siting of buildings in a manner that may reduce solar access for adjacent buildings or
 properties.
 Emergency Response. Appropriate consideration of emergency response planning.
 Fire Prevention. Appropriate fire prevention measures, including fire protection systems and fire-retardant roofs in accordance
 with adopted ordinances and standards.
 Safe Subdivision Design. Subdivision design and platting of each parcel so that there is a safe building location.
 Slope Stability. Location of development in the most stable portion of each subdivision and/or parcel, with a statement from the
 project engineering geologist and geotechnical engineer to this effect, subject to review of the Town’s consulting geotechnical
 engineer and engineering geologist.
 Seismic Safety. Design and construction according to the seismic standards of the latest edition of the Uniform Building Code,
 with public buildings, multi-story buildings, office and commercial buildings, and public infrastructure designed to the highest
 feasible standards of seismic design by a structural engineer according to expected levels of seismic shaking, with review by a
 qualified structural engineer.

 Evaluation
 This implementation program is ongoing. Implementation examples are provided below:
 Neighborhood Quality. All applications for design review require consideration of neighborhood factors prior to approval. In order
 to approve an application for design review the Town must find:
 1. The proposed improvements conform with good design as set forth in the Town of Moraga Design Guidelines, and in general
 contributes to the character and image of the town as a place of beauty, spaciousness, balance, taste, fitness, broad vistas, and
 high quality.
 The proposed improvement will not have a substantial adverse affect on neighboring properties or the community due to poor
 planning; neglect of proper design standards; or the existence of building and structures unsuitable to and incompatible with the
 character of the neighborhood and the character of the community.
 The proposed improvement will not lower property values; discourage the maintenance and improvement of surrounding
 properties; or preclude the most appropriate development of other properties in the vicinity.
 The proposed improvement will not impair the public health, safety or welfare.
 Performance Standards. In part to improve monitoring of conditions of approval, the Town is now using Town employees as
 inspectors especially with respect to grading and erosion control.
 Acceptable Noise Levels. The Town has conditioned the location of certain noise generating devices such as air conditioning
 condensers and pool equipment to reduce noise impacts on neighbors to an acceptable level.
 Solar Access. Consideration for solar access occurs through the design review process as well as the subdivision process.
 Emergency Response and Fire Prevention. All applications for subdivision or design review are made available to the Fire
 Department. Fire Department conditions of approval are incorporated into the Town approval process.
 Safe Subdivision Design. The Town employs the expertise of consulting engineers in subdivision design.
 Slope Stability. The Town employs the expertise of consulting geologists and geo-technical engineers in applications for slide
 repair or hillside development.
 Seismic Safety. Applications for building permits are reviewed in accordance with the seismic standards of the latest edition of
 the Uniform Building Code.
 IP-C3        Design Review
 Submit all applicable development proposals to the Design Review Board to ensure consistency with the design goals and
 policies of the General Plan and the Town Design Guidelines.
 Evaluation
 This implementation program is ongoing. In 2007, the Town Council adopted new Design Guidelines for the Town which included
 Green Building Guidelines for new residences in new subdivisions. In 2008, staff processed 27 applications for Design Review
 Board approval and 53 applications for administrative design review approval.

Chapter 5: Housing
 IP-D2        Building Inspection, Code Enforcement and Hazard Abatement
 Encourage the County to continue to respond to complaints of substandard property conditions by inspecting properties and
 enforcing applicable building, health and safety codes. Regularly inform elected and appointed officials regarding code
 compliance and enforcement issues.
 For critical structures and development in risk areas, encourage the County to implement a proactive program of building
 inspection, code enforcement, and hazard and nuisance abatement. Specifically:
 Substandard Structures. Inspect and vacate or condemn structures that are damaged or are in imminent peril, using public
 nuisance abatement powers.
 Hazards in Town Buildings. Reduce non-structural hazards in all Town buildings.
 Continuing Education for Seismic Safety. Require inspectors to attend continuing education programs to ensure their familiarity
 with principles of seismic design and with seismic code requirements.
 Grading and Foundation Inspections. Establish inspection procedures to ensure that all grading and foundation work is observed
 and documented at specific critical stages. For sensitive sites, require periodic grading and foundation inspection by the Town’s
 engineering geologist and/or geotechnical engineer.
 Inspection of Critical Public Buildings. For particularly critical public buildings, require periodic inspection by the Town’s structural
 engineer for seismic safety.
 Evaluation
 This implementation program is ongoing. In August 2007, Jeff Keebler, a Building Inspector from Contra Costa County, moved
 his office to the Planning Department and joined Town staff. The objective was to create a ‘one stop shop’ for the community with
 planning, engineering, and building all in one convenient location. Staff work and communicate regularly with Greg Wixom, the
 Town’s Contra Costa County Code Enforcer, in order to keep property conditions standard and code compliant. Town staff also
 continue to respond to complaints of substandard property conditions by making site visits, writing code enforcement letters, and,
 if necessary, employing the hazard and abatement processes.
 IP-E2        Review and Update Residential Design Guidelines
              Review and update design standards and guidelines to address residential design issues in existing and potential
              future single family residential developments, including:
             Subdivision Design to encourage lot and street configurations adapted to topography and natural features.
             Street Design to discourage closed loop streets.
             Landscape Character, to encourage street trees and landscaping and retain significant views, with provisions for
              drought-tolerant species, use of recycled water, and other water conservation measures.
             Pedestrian Environment to create interconnected sidewalk/pathway linkages to adjacent neighborhoods, commercial
              centers and community facilities such as parks and schools; provide for pedestrian-oriented lighting; and, where
              feasible, encourage landscape strips between the sidewalk and curb to buffer pedestrians from automobiles.
             Home Design to encourage home designs that are consistent with existing residential character, with appropriate
              height, scale and setback requirements; and to discourage the visual dominance of garages on streets by limiting the
              frontage (by percentage and by location) occupied by garage doors.
             Energy Efficiency to encourage home designs and retrofitting conserve energy through use of active and/or passive
              solar energy systems, ceiling insulation, ceiling fans, low-energy appliances, and/or other measures.
             Equipment Screening to encourage appropriate screening of mechanical equipment, solar collectors, satellite dishes,
              communication devices and similar devices, with special attention given to buildings whose roofs are viewed from
              higher elevations.
             Infill Development to promote more sensitive building additions and infill projects that preserve the scale and
              character of the existing neighborhood. Public Places to provide facilities and amenities appropriate to the
              neighborhood, such as neighborhood parks, childcare centers, schools and churches, ensuring appropriate siting and
              design.
             Clustering to preserve natural features and open spaces and minimize grading.
             Landscaping in Hillside Areas to address issues such as fire resistance, erosion control, drought tolerance, and visual
              buffering for privacy.
             Estate Housing to address issues specific to large-lot developments in outlying areas.

 Updated July 2007. The residential and multi-family design guidelines were completely revised in 2007 in accordance with the
 Housing Element.
 IP-E3       Review and Update Multi-Family Residential Design Guidelines
             Review and update design standards and guidelines to address issues specific to the planning, design and
             management of multi-family residential developments, including:
            Site Design to encourage developments that are oriented towards the public street rather than to an internal parking
             area.
            Density and Housing Type Mix to encourage a variety of housing types and discourage too high a concentration of
             any one unit or building type in a single area.
            Building Design to encourage buildings that reflect the scale and quality of their surroundings and which fit the
             character of existing residential neighborhoods.
            Landscaping to encourage developments that blend with the natural setting, with provisions for drought-tolerant
             species and fire resistive plan species, use of recycled water, and other water conservation measures.
            Sense of Entry and Individuality to provide a public entry point and a ‘sense of address’ toward the street or directly to
             an open space on the site.
            Outdoor Spaces and Amenities to encourage garden spaces and outdoor play spaces on the site.
            Pedestrian Environment to create a place where it is pleasant and safe to walk, orienting buildings towards public
             sidewalks and providing yards and landscaped setbacks.
 Evaluation
 Updated July 2007. The residential and multi-family design guidelines were completely revised in 2007 in accordance with the
 Housing Element.
 IP-E5       Public Safety Guidelines
 Develop planning and design guidelines for implementation of design ideas that can help prevent or reduce crime (e.g., through
 attention to sight-lines to front doors and windows and from front windows to the street).
 Evaluation
 This is an ongoing program. The Police Department has been involved with current development planning regarding traffic and
 crime prevention issues in developments. The Police Department will provide ongoing POST training to interested officers in this
 field as classes become available.
 IP-G1       Vacant Land Inventory
 Maintain and update an inventory of vacant and under-utilized parcels in the Town, including an assessment of their potential
 development capacity.
 Evaluation
 This implementation program is ongoing. There is paper-based list that is available for the public, which is updated as needed.

 IP-H1        Regional Housing Need
 Continue to zone sufficient sites to meet Moraga’s regional share of housing need as established by the Association of Bay Area
 Governments Regional Housing Needs Determination for the period 1999 through 2006.
 Evaluation
 This implementation program is ongoing. With the completion of the Moraga Center Specific Plan in January 2010 and the
 Housing Element , the Town will have a strong foundation.
 IP-H2        Housing Partnerships
 Work with Saint Mary’s College, the Moraga School District, affordable housing developers, and other groups and organizations
 to define opportunities for collaboration in the development of new affordable housing to meet the needs of local employees and
 special needs populations. Identify potential sites, financial resources and regulatory mechanisms to facilitate the development of
 new units that can help meet the Town’s ‘fair share’ housing requirements.
 Evaluation
 This implementation program is ongoing. One accomplishment is the creation of 20 affordable town houses. There is a council
 subcommittee that meets regularly with college representatives. Also, there is an annual Town/Gown breakfast where town
 council, school district, other local leaders meet with the College. Regular contact occurs with the College’s director of
 community and government affairs. Collaboration will be increased through the completion of the Moraga Center Specific Plan.
 IP-H3        Housing Rehabilitation Program
 Participate in the County Housing Authority’s Housing Rehabilitation Program which provides low interest loans for the
 rehabilitation of homes owned or occupied by very low to moderate income households. Improve citizen awareness of this
 rehabilitation loan program by making pamphlets on this program available at the Planning Department and the public library.
 Evaluation

 IP-H4        Affordable Housing Subsidies
 Seek to increase the availability of State and federal subsidies for affordable housing in Moraga through the following actions:
 Petition the County Housing Authority for additional Section 8 subsidies if rental dwelling units can be located that are within
 federal fair market rent guidelines. If necessary, collect documentation on rent levels and need to substantiate an increase in the
 number of Section 8 certificates or vouchers.
 Assist developers in accessing funding for the construction of senior housing or other low or moderate income housing for which
 State or federal subsidies are available.
 Participate in future issuances of mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage tax credit programs by Contra Costa County to support
 home ownership opportunities for low and moderate income Moraga residents.
 Support a waiver exemption of Lamorinda Fee and Financing Authority (LFFA) Impact Fees for affordable housing development.
 Encourage future development to consider a fair share affordable housing component for workforce housing.
 Evaluation
 The methods most likely to be pursued in Moraga are LFFA fee waivers and workforce affordable housing. The other methods
 require expertise beyond that of the current staff. The required expertise could be provided by consultants should an appropriate
 project be proposed in Moraga.
 IP-H5        Affordable Housing Trust Fund
 Establish an Affordable Housing Trust Fund to which financial contributions can be directed to support affordable housing
 development in Moraga. Establish procedures and criteria for determining how the Fund’s proceeds are to be managed and
 expended to support affordable housing development in the Town.
 Evaluation
 The Town has not made significant progress with this item because of limited staff time and resources.
 IP-H6        Homeless Services and Referral
 Provide referrals to private and public agencies that offer assistance and shelter to homeless individuals and families, and
 participate with designated inter-agency organizations to address homeless needs.
 Evaluation
 This implementation program is ongoing. Demand for services has been very low.
 IP-H7        Equal Housing Opportunities Coordinator and Information
 Facilitate fair and equal housing opportunity by designating the Planning Director as the Town's Equal Opportunity Coordinator
 with responsibility to refer complaints to a district office of the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Provide
 information to the public regarding equal housing opportunity laws and the Town's Equal Housing Opportunities Coordinator.
 Prepare and distribute a pamphlet on equal housing opportunity to the public at Town Administration offices.

 IP-K1        Moraga Center and Rheem Park Area Specific Plans
 Undertake a coordinated specific plan process to address planning issues in the Town’s two centrally located mixed use areas
 (the Moraga Center Area and Rheem Park Area, as shown on the General Plan Diagram) in accordance with the goals and
 policies of the General Plan.
 Evaluation
 This implementation program has been underway since fall 2002 for the Moraga Center Specific Plan. Since that time the Town
 has conducted numerous community outreach events and detailed traffic and economic studies. In June 2007, the Town Council
 approved a project description for the draft environmental impact report for the Moraga Center Specific Plan (MCSP) and help a
 hearing on the EIR in May, 2009. The plan will be ready for adoption in January 2010 . The project description can be found on
 page 5-25.
  The Rheem Park Area Specific Plan is still in the early stages and will move forward once the Moraga Center Specific Plan is
 adopted.

 Work collaboratively with Saint Mary’s College to:
 Coordinate calendars of events.
 Regularly communicate on plans in progress and upcoming opportunities.
 Encourage Saint Mary’s employees residing in Moraga to serve on local boards and committees.
 Create a process to address proposals and issues of mutual concern in an expeditious manner.
 Meet annually to review the progress of the approved Master Plan’s implementation.
 Discuss student housing needs and solutions, as needed…
 The relationship between the Parks and Recreation Department and Saint Mary’s College is improving as we work closer
 together. We continue to coordinate recreation endeavors that benefit both entities.
 Evaluation
 This implementation program is ongoing. Communication is increasing with Saint Mary’s College regarding issues related to
 affordable housing and transit. The Town and the College have ongoing discussion regarding student safety and behavior in the
 Moraga Community. More work could be done to better coordinate our calendars of events. The Town coordinated implementing
 a party ordinance in conjunction with the College to ensure safety and privacy in residential neighborhoods. Further, the Town
 Planning Department worked collaboratively with the College to install a new sign at their Extended Education Building off
 Rheem Boulevard.

VI. NEW HOUSING
A.       Available Land Inventory - Ability to Accommodate Regional Share
Subdivsions
This section contains an overview of land available for residential development. For a full list
parcels, please see Appendix B. For all of the units identified in this inventory there is or will be
adequate sewer, water and electrical capacity.
Approved Subdivisions
There are several major subdivisions that have been approved and are ready with infrastructure,
with a total of 201 units expected. The 123-unit Palos Colorados development (460 acres) was
recently approved. These lots have infrastructure and have received all the discretionary review
permits they need. It is scheduled to be single family homes that will sell for over $2 million.
Creating secondary units is an important priority for the Town and Palos Colorados was
approved to have up to 30 secondary units and the developer believes the market will support
building them. Future developments will likely have similar provisions.
The seven-acre, ten-lot Los Encinos development has been approved and the infrastructure
improvements are in place. The individual houses will need to go through design review and
secure building permits.
The 19-acre, 68-lot County Club Extension was approved, but the units will need to go through
design review and secure building permits. Additionally, all of the subdivision improvements are
in place.
Subdivisions with Applications Pending
The are many additional lots, which can accommodate hundreds of housing units, that are zoned
for housing and are in various stages of the subdivision process. Some of these parcels are just
beginning the development approval process and others are farther along. Some of the pending
subdivisions include:
        Rheem Valley Estates – 17 units
        Rancho Laguna – 27 units
        Bollinger Canyon – 126 units
Because the time involved for approval and construction, the Town is not claiming any of these
lots in the adequate sites analysis. See Appendix B for more information.
5-56                                                     Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010

Individual Lots or Potential Subdivisions
There are a number of lots spread throughout the town that are suitable for development. Many
of these are relatively large, but have growth controls that limit the number of units (see the
constraints section). The Town estimates that there are approximately 334 units that can be
developed on 30 plus parcels. These parcels are listed in Appendix B, and are not claimed in the
available land inventory.
Secondary Units
The recently approved Palos Colorados development will have up to 30 secondary units. While
the Town will continue to encourage new subdivisions to have secondary units, only 30 units are
claimed for the purposes of meeting the RHNA number. The Town is taking the conservative
approach of claiming seven of these units will be affordable to extremely low/very low income
households, eight will be affordable to low income households, seven to moderate income
households and eight to above moderate income households. See pages 27 to 29 for more
information.
Moraga Center Specific Plan
Much of the demand for new housing will be met through the Moraga Center Specific Plan,
described in the background section (Section IV, E). The Specific Plan covers fourteen parcels
on 187 acres, and will accommodate up to 630 units. In addition to the housing, the Specific
Plan calls for up to 90,000 square feet of new retail and entertainment space along with up to
50,000 square feet of new office space.
The complementary retail and residential land uses to be developed in the central part of the
plan area will create an attractive, pedestrian-friendly village environment. Given that
approximately 50 percent of the MCSP area is currently vacant land, the plan is as primarily an
urban infill project, wherein available, vacant land will be put to productive, complementary use
within the existing framework of land uses and circulation. The key natural feature in the plan
area - Laguna Creek - will be visually accessible to residents and visitors, while its natural course
and conditions will be maintained.
As shown in the illustrative land use and circulation plan (photo 2), the MCSP area is bounded
to the north by residential development and to the east by the Moraga Commons Park and
recreational area as well as additional residential development. Residential development also
abuts the southern and western boundaries of the area. Significant features within the area are
the Moraga Center commercial complex and other retail and service facilities including offices
and financial institutions. The area is served by County Connection bus service with direct
service to the Orinda Bart Station which is 4.8 miles from the intersection of Moraga Way and
Moraga Road, the two principal roads serving the area.
Because of potential site constraints and market variability, the Town is only claiming 393 units
as part of its available sites inventory. Approximately 228 of these are zoned at 20 units per acre
or more. There will be a number of different types of housing in this plan, described below.
See the photos below for more information and see page 99 for parcel by parcel analysis.

Workforce Housing
Approximately 16.3 acres will be zoned for mixed use commercial/housing or retail/housing,
which will result in an anticipated 80 units of workforce housing (or up to 100 with density
bonuses). The mixed use zoning associated with the mixed use office or mixed use retail zones
permits up 20 units per acre (up to 25 with density bonuses), with a minimum of 12 units per
acre.. All of the workforce units are available to everyone.
The workforce housing may be built in addition to the 140,000 square feet of commercial space
that is permitted on the site. Specifically, there is cap on the amount of commercial/residential
office that can be built, and the residential may be built in addition to this cap. Based on the
zoning rules, which are still in draft form, it will be possible to build both the maximum amount
of commercial space, and the identified levels of housing.
Senior Housing
The Specific Plan also addresses the need for senior housing in Moraga with up to 490 units at a
maximum density of 20 units per acre (higher with a density bonus) or 30 dwelling units per acre
for a senior project. There are approximately 24 acres of this zoning. With a minimum density
of 20 dwelling units per acre for projects in the ministerial designated site area, active senior
units in this area would also address part of the Town’s fair share of affordable housing. These
active senior units are in addition to a maximum of 150 units/rooms for assisted
living/congregate care. The town is not claiming any of the congregate care/assisted living units
for the purposes of meeting the RHNA number.
Single Family Homes and Town Homes
The Specific Plan also contemplates up to 245 single family homes primarily between Camino
Ricardo and the creek. Careful siting and clustering of dwelling units in this area may be
employed to preserve portions of the existing orchard. Of these units, 180 would be moderate
density single family homes or town homes (10-12 units per acre, 17 acres). An additional 65
would be lower density single family homes (24 acres). These housing units, in close proximity to
the proposed Village center, will support the Town Center and reduce the number of vehicle
trips needed to access local-serving amenities. According to the analysis in the affordability
trends section, pages 5-30, at least 30 percent of the compact single family homes will likely be
affordable to moderate income residents.
Infrastructure and Feasibility
Most infrastructure is in place for the Moraga Center Specific Plan, including adequate sewer,
water and electricity. One of the limiting factors is the Lafayette Orinda Gateway Traffic levels
as described in the 2002 General Plan, as well as the maximum housing figure of 630 as directed
by Town Council. It is important that the associated traffic does not go above these levels.
Because different types of housing have different traffic effect, the total maximum number of
units is variable. For instance, senior, student and workforce housing will have fewer traffic
effects, so if developers build more of these units, the total number of housing units will be
higher. If developers build more single family houses, which generate more trips, the maximum
number of units will be smaller.
Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010 5-61

Chapter 5: Housing
The Town hired Economic and Planning Systems (EPS) to conduct a market assessment for the
residential portion of the Moraga Center Specific Plan. (A separate firm studied the commercial
market assessment). EPS found a strong demand for new housing, raising no concerns about the
feasibility of the Specific Plan. The 630 unit proposal (of which 393 housing units are assumed
for the available land inventory) is a likely scenario as studied in the Moraga Center Specific Plan.
Development Standards
The ordinance calls for the development of six acres at a minimum density of 20 dwelling units
per acre plus applicable density bonuses consistent with State law and a maximum density of 30
dwelling units per acre. This new district calls for the ministerial review of exclusively residential
housing projects on a minimum three acre project site. Development under this ordinance
would be allowed on the site near Aegis (between County Club Drive, School Street and Canyon
Road) and/or on the site in the orchard across the creek from the shopping center. In addition,
the Moraga Center Specific Plan calls for the development of up to 100 mixed use units at a
density of 20 dwelling units per acre within the shopping center. Together, the minimum 120
units from the exclusively residential ministerial zone and the 100 mixed use units at a density of
20 DUA would provide for 220 units at a density of 20 DUA. This number exceed the number
of lower income units that needs to be provided in the community.
Specifically, the by-right provision reads, “The planning director shall approve an application
and issue a permit in the 20 Dwelling Unit Per Acre Residential District if all of the requirements
of this Chapter have been satisfied. The planning director shall deny an application for a permit
in the 20 Dwelling Unit Per Acre Residential District if the requirements of this Chapter have
not been satisfied.”
Nonresidential Uses
The MCSP calls for a mix of residential and nonresidential uses. Specifically, it calls for the
development of up to 140,000 square feet of new commercial space including 50,000 square feet
of office space and 90,000 square feet of new retail space. The existing vacant land within the
Moraga Center Specific Plan is more than adequate to accommodate all of the potential
commercial development on a single floor. Because the land is zoned for two or three stories,
any second and third floor development will be residential. In other words, it is possible for a
development to reach the maximum permitted nonresidential square footage and still have
potential for more development, but this development would be limited to residential. If 100
dwelling units were developed above the proposed commercial space each unit could contain
approximately 1,050 square feet assuming approximately 25 percent of the floor area was
required for circulation and common areas. (140,000 square feet times 75 percent usable for
habitation equals 105,000 square feet divided by 100 units equals 1,050 square feet per unit.
Mixed Use and Underutilized Sites
All of the housing parcels are entirely vacant, except for one which is mostly vacant. The Town
is taking a number of steps to promote development/redevelopment of these properties. The
Town has worked closely with the property owner throughout the process and has reached
mutually acceptable development standards that will promote development. These include by-
right zoning on six acres, as well as flexibility to transfer this zoning to other parcels if market

                                                                                                    Chapter 5: Housing
conditions require it 4. Also, the Town has completed a Program Level EIR for the MCSP.
Future development that is consistent with the EIR (and where there are no project specific
impacts) may rely on Program EIR to expedite the development process. Additionally, the
MCSP area has been designated a potential Priority Development Area under the Focus
program, and will become a Priority Development Area as soon as the Specific Plan is adopted.
Small Sites
All of the land zoned to accommodate new residential or mixed use development affordable to
lower income households are sites that are six acres are larger. Furthermore, because all of the
land is owned by one property owner, the sites can be combined and treated as a one larger site.
Units and Zoning
Town staff will continue to meet with representatives from Saint Mary’s College to discuss
opportunities for student and faculty housing within the MCSP and facilitate discussions
between Saint Mary’s and the owners/developers of the MCSP area to encourage joint efforts
and cooperation between them in the provision of such housing. The Town will also seek input
from the School District and other employers to determine the need for and market demand for
workforce housing in the community in order to provide this information to
potential developers.
As a part of negotiating a development agreement with the principal owners within the MCSP,
the Town will pursue possible development impact fee waivers and other considerations in
exchange for commitments from the owners to provide student, faculty and workforce housing
within the MCSP area 5. Development proposals that demonstrate that they will achieve the
objectives of and comply with the MCSP will also receive priority in the development review
process as a result of the prior analysis and approvals granted by the MCSP.
See the table on Page 5-95 for a parcel by parcel summary of anticipated units by type.
4 Specifically, the Town will allow an exchange of an alternate parcel for by-right zoning if the developer determines
that the alternative parcel is more appropriate for that type of development. This is an accommodation put in place
at the request of the property owners.

B.         Potential Non-Governmental Housing Constraints
Land Costs
The cost of improved land is one of the greatest impediments to the production of affordable
housing in Moraga. A local real estate broker contacted by the Town (Wendy Holcenberg) stated
that few developable lots come on the market, but when they do, their price is often expensive.
A recent subdivision consisting of six large homesites was on the market for $5 million. Lots on
the market today range from $675,000 to $1,400,000. Even the cost of smaller parcels (quarter
acre or less) creates an impediment to the production of affordable housing.
The combination of high land prices and expensive homes practically guarantees that
homebuilders in Moraga will maximize their profits by constructing only high-priced single
family dwellings. It does not make economic or business sense for a builder to construct a
modest, entry-level home affordable to low or moderate income households on a lot that costs
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Some high-priced communities have attempted to accommodate affordable ownership housing
in large, master-planned developments through an inclusionary housing agreement with the
developer. This approach is not feasible in Moraga because there are no large parcels of
sufficient size to make an inclusionary program financially feasible, and most remaining vacant
residential land is located in hilly terrain that cannot support the high densities needed to make
an inclusionary program work.
Although it does not appear feasible to construct single family dwellings for low and moderate
income households in Moraga, absent a public subsidy of several hundred thousand dollars per
unit, there may be an opportunity to create affordable multi-family housing in the commercial
district. Moraga Center has vacant land of sufficient size and suitable characteristics to support
5-64                                                           Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010
                                                                                   Chapter 5: Housing
higher density multi-family housing. The Town has identified several sites suitable for a multi-
family project that could include dwellings affordable to low income households.
Access to Water and Sewer
EBMUD's water system serves approximately 1.3 million people in a 331-square-mile area
extending from Crockett on the north, southward to San Lorenzo (encompassing the major
cities of Oakland and Berkeley), eastward from San Francisco Bay to Walnut Creek, and south
through the San Ramon Valley. Parts of Moraga are in the current service area and parts are not,
but the entire town is within the Ultimate Service Boundary. All of the units that the Town lists
in its available sites inventory have sewer and water service.
Construction Costs
With the exception of grading and foundation work on sloped sites, construction costs are no
more expensive in Moraga than other Bay Area locations. Because Moraga’s housing market is
oriented to high-priced homes, however, builders tend to construct larger dwellings containing
many upgrades to the standard tract home. Matt Branagh of Branagh Construction estimated the
cost per square foot of a typical development at $200 to $250 for flat lots. If home sizes are
Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010 5-65

Chapter 5: Housing
3,000 to 4,500 square feet, the construction cost of these homes will be between $600,000 and
$1,125,000.
One factor that increases construction costs for some homes in Moraga is the need for special
construction techniques oriented to sloped sites with potentially unstable soil conditions.
Foundations and footings have to be installed that provide a stable construction base, which are
more expensive than on gently sloping or flat sites. This hilly construction often adds
approximately $100 per square foot.
A more typical cost for a standard track home without upgrades would be $200 per square foot.
However, the high land costs, slope and soil conditions, and market conditions in Moraga make
it unlikely that a homebuilder would construct modest homes priced for low or moderate
income homebuyers.
Geologic Constraints
Unstable soils, steep slopes, landslide susceptibility, and other hazardous land conditions reduce
the feasible development density of most residentially designated land, and thereby limit the
number of new dwelling units that can be accommodated in the Town. These soil and slope
conditions also increase land development and construction costs due to the extensive grading,
soils analysis, and construction techniques that must be employed in the Town.
While not an impediment to providing market rate housing for upper income homebuyers, these
geological conditions increase construction costs to the point of making affordable single family
housing virtually impossible. Vacant land available on more gently sloped sites in the Town’s
commercial core would be more suitable for higher density multi-family housing.
Availability of Financing
Interest rates can dramatically affect housing affordability. In recent years, credit was widely
available to many buyers but, since 2008, credit has been much more restrictive though interest
rates have been low.
Historically, substantial changes in interest rates have correlated with swings in home sales.
When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has been true when interest rates
increase. Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic growth in alternative mortgage
products, such as graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types of loans allow
homeowners to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and qualify for larger home loans.
Even during periods of high interest rates, these alternative products allow more buyers to
qualify for homeownership, thus dampening the swings in home sales that accompany changes
in interest rates.
Nevertheless, the fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially
during periods of low, stable interest rates. Most governmental programs that seek to increase
homeownership among low and moderate income households rely on loan products that
provide fixed interest rates below prevailing market rates, either for the principal loan or for a
second loan that provides part of the down payment for home purchase. Many programs offer

deferred second loans to facilitate homeownership. Figure 5-26 shows the effect of different
interest rates on monthly loan payments and total interest paid during the life of the loan.
Lowering the interest rate would have a marginal affect on housing affordability in Moraga. Low
and moderate income households would not be able to purchase even the typical lower priced
home in Moraga (approximately $700,000) without subsidized interest rates and/or a large down
payment from the sale of a previous home or other source. In order to bring the principal
amount of the mortgage down to a level where they could afford the monthly payments, a lower
income household (making $66,000 a year) would have to make a down payment of
approximately $500,000 or more to purchase the a typical lower-priced home in the Town, while
a moderate income household (making $100,000 a year) would have to make a down payment of
$265,000 or more (assuming six percent interest, 30 year fixed rate loan, one percent property
tax).

     The Town has designated four zones in which residences are permitted uses by right and three
     zones in which residences are allowed with a conditional use permit. Figure 5-27 summarizes the
     development requirements in these zones. Multi-family housing is allowed by conditional use
     only in the Multi-family and, under special circumstances, Community Commercial districts.

Secondary Units
In accordance with State law, the Town’s secondary units ordinance provides for ministerial
approval in single family and multi-family zones. The Town has established the following criteria
for second units:
 One secondary unit is allowed on each residential lot containing a single family home.
 The unit may be attached to or detached from the principal dwelling.
 The secondary unit must comply with building setback rules of the zoning district.
 The secondary unit must be one story and no higher than 19 feet.
 Secondary units may not be constructed over a basement or garage.
 The maximum lot coverage for a secondary unit and associated structures may not exceed
    1,300 square feet.
 Total floor area must be at least 150 square feet but no more than 750 square feet and may
    not be more than 25 percent of the size of the primary unit.
Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010             5-71

Chapter 5: Housing
 The unit may contain no more than one bedroom.
 One off-street parking space is required in addition to parking otherwise required.
 The lot on which the secondary living unit is to be located may not be adjacent to a lot that
     shares a property line with any other lot on which a secondary living unit has been approved
     or is located unless the secondary living units are a minimum of five hundred (500) feet
     apart.
 The property owner must occupy either the secondary unit or the principal residence.
 Design review procedures must be met including: matching existing architectural styles,
     placing utilities underground, and utilities.
The Town’s secondary unit requirements allow such dwellings in any single family
neighborhood, which makes this potentially affordable housing alternative available throughout
the Town. Size restrictions limit this alternative to one or two-person households. Parking and
distance requirements will further limit this alternative in older neighborhoods with smaller lots.
The Town has not performed an analysis of the number of secondary units that could
potentially be sited in existing neighborhoods.
The Town is interested in promoting secondary units and this housing element contains a new
program to promote secondary units (IP-H11).
Emergency, Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional and supportive housing is treated the same as other residential uses. Emergency
shelters will be allowed by right in the Institutional zone pursuant to SB 2.
Mobile Homes and Manufactured Housing
Manufactured housing is treated the same as other housing types. There was proposal in the
1980s that was approved for a development built with modular housing technology, but the
construction team switched to traditional stick built housing after having problems with the
supplier. Mobile homes can be stored on individual lots, but can not be used for occupancy.
They must be screened from view.
Parking Requirements
In most cases, Moraga requires two covered parking spaces per dwelling unit and one guest
space per two dwellings:
    Single family detached: 2 covered spaces
    Singe family attached: 2 covered spaces
    Multi-family: per unit, 2 covered spaces and 0.5 uncovered space
    Second Units: 1 space in addition to the main unit’s requirements
Lots with less than 45 feet of street frontage are required to have two additional parking spaces.
Condos are permitted some flexibility to have parking on a different parcel. The minimum
dimensions per space are nine feet wide by 19 feet deep.

                                                                                     Chapter 5: Housing
These requirements are typical or less than many suburban communities, but have two primary
effects on the development of affordable housing:
 The required number and size of spaces effectively reduces the land area available for
     dwellings, and
 The parking requirements add to the overall cost of development.
These effects are not substantial for the average single family home in Moraga, but could
negatively affect the financial feasibility of the development affordable multi-family housing for
low or moderate income households.
Moraga Open Space Ordinance
In 1986 a citizen initiative adopted the Moraga Open Space Ordinance (MOSO). The purpose of
the ordinance is to direct development to land that is suitable for growth. The ordinance placed
all land that was public or private open space before 1986 in a new zoning category called
MOSO Open Space. Agriculture is the primary land use in the open space district, but residential
uses are permitted with a conditional use permit at a density of one unit per 20 acres. This
density can be increased to one unit per five acres based on environmental sensitivity, geological
hazards, etc.. Residential use is not permitted on major ridge lines or along steep slopes. Because
there is more than adequate land outside the open space district (see land inventory), the Town
does not consider this a constraint.
Design Review Process
All new residential dwellings are subject to a design review process. Under the process, a Town
staff person (design review administrator) reviews design plans for single family dwellings on
individual lots. The staff decision may be appealed to the Design Review Board. The Board’s
decision, in turn, may be appealed to the Planning Commission, whose decision may be appealed
to the Town Council. If the design review administrator is in doubt about whether a proposal
complies with Town guidelines, the application may be referred to the Design Review Board.
Design review of new residential subdivisions and multi-family buildings is performed by the
Design Review Board directly. Submittal requirements are typical for local design review
processes, and include the submission of a site plan, landscape plan, photograph of the site, and
architectural renderings (not final specifications for building permit approval). In addition, the
Town requires submission of samples of exterior materials to be used on buildings.
The Town’s design guidelines address:
 Height, mass, and lot coverage
 Appurtenant features
 Screening of exposed mechanical and electrical equipment
 Colors and materials
 Harmonious relationship with surrounding buildings and land uses
Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010 5-73

Chapter 5: Housing
 Landscaping elements and compatibility with local climate and buildings.
The standards contained in the Town’s zoning code for evaluating these factors are rather broad
and speak to such issues as “conforms to good taste,” “good design,” “contributes to the
character and image of the town” and its “beauty, spaciousness, balance, taste, fitness, broad
vistas, and high quality.”
The Town’s design review guidelines may not greatly affect the affordability of single family
homes in Moraga as most are high-priced anyway. The application of the guidelines could
adversely affects the feasibility of developing affordable multi-family housing due the following
factors:
 The multiple appeal opportunities could greatly delay a project, resulting in the loss of
     funding or higher financing costs.
 The broad design review standards could require affordable housing developers to use
     substantially more expensive materials than would otherwise be the case, reduce project
     density below the point of financial feasibility, or restrict dwelling units to smaller sizes that
     could not accommodate families with children.
The Town has streamlined the development process for over 500 homes, well above the Town’s
RHNA. Specifically, The Town of Moraga has approved the design of 123 new market rate
homes in the Palos Colorados subdivision. In addition, the Town has approved the Precise
Development Plan for the remaining 67 lots in the Moraga Country Club extension. The Town
has also prepared an ordinance with the cooperation of the property owner that will allow
ministerial review of up to 180 dwelling units in the Moraga Center Specific Plan area.
Furthermore, the Town’s current secondary living unit ordinance complies with the requirement
in State law for ministerial review and approval. As noted above, the Town will be drafting new
ordinances to implement the Specific Plan and outline requirements for the new mixed use and
10 to 12 dwelling unit per acre zones.
Fees and Exactions
Site Improvement Requirements
Moraga’s site improvement requirements are typical of those in similar Bay Area communities
with mostly sloping terrain. Required street improvements generally include curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, and utility connections. Larger developments are also responsible for providing on-
site drainage and water and sewer lines in the rights-of-way serving the development.
Development Fees
Development fees represent a necessary, but significant portion of housing costs in most
communities. The Town of Moraga charges development fees for a number of purposes related
to residential construction, including the Town’s cost of permit processing, the provision of park
land and facilities, transportation mitigation, and environmental review. Because land costs and
constructed residential values are so high in Moraga, the proportion of a home’s cost that can be

                                                                                                           Chapter 5: Housing
tracked to the Town’s fees is relatively small in comparison to the average Bay Area community.
The fees paid by the developer of the 123-unit residential development cited earlier represent
less than two percent of the cost of a single family dwelling.
Although development and permit fees are not a significant factor in the cost of market rate
housing in Moraga, these fees could be an impediment to the production of multi-family
housing affordable to low or moderate income households. Development fees per unit,
including the school district fees, can be as much as $41,427 for a single family dwelling (see
table 5-30). Fees for multi-family units can approach $30,000 per unit (again, depending on unit
sizes, density, and project size). Given the high land and construction costs in Moraga, these fees
do not represent a large proportion of the finished cost or sales prices. Depending on the
assumptions about lot sizes, unit types and sizes, and amenities, Moraga’s development fees
represent between two percent and five percent of the cost of a new dwelling unit. Figure 5-30
summarizes the Town’s development and permit fee schedule.
The required development impact fees include: General Government Fee, Public Safety Fee,
Storm Drainage Fee, Local Traffic Impact Fee and Park Development Impact Fee. The amount
of these fees has been set in Town Council Resolution 13-2008, Exhibit C, as shown in the table
below:

Processing and Permit Procedures
Processing times and permit procedures are not considered major impediment to the production
of housing, but can delay the process for some applications. Large developments that need
multiple environmental and governmental permits may have longer approval times. Figure 5-31
summarizes the typical processing times. In general, expedited permit processing would not
substantially reduce production costs enough to make housing affordable in Moraga.

For large subdivisions or planned unit developments, the Town of Moraga uses a three part
approval process (conceptual development review, general development review and precise
development review), in addition to design review (Figure 5-32). Developers have raised
concerns that this process is slow and burdensome. The Town is interested in reducing the time
and cost associated with processing applications and has added a program to study this issue and
make recommendations to simplify the development process (See Program IP-C4).

Many of the larger land holdings have federal and State environmental restrictions because of
endangered species or wetlands. These issues are beyond the control of the Town, but can
potentially add years to the processing time.
Moraga has responded by focusing on infill opportunities. By adopting the Moraga Center
Specific Plan (anticipated January 2010 ), the Town has laid the groundwork for speedy
approvals of up to 630 units. The Rheem Center Specific Plan will also allow more infill
development. Housing in the Moraga Center Specific Plan will have a surcharge, likely $1,000
per unit (and $1,000 per square foot for commercial space), to recover the cost of preparing the
Plan. Considering the savings in processing time and cost for developers, the Town feels this is a
very good way to promote housing.
Moraga bills developers based on the actual cost of processing their applications for
subdivisions. On a straightforward application, these fees can add $25,000 per lot, which is not
unreasonable considering the sales price of the homes is often over one million dollars. For
more complicated applications, the fees can be substantially more. The recently approved Palos
Colorados development was a large, complicated development proposal featuring environmental
5-78                                                               Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010
                                                                                    Chapter 5: Housing
and viewshed issues, involving multiple jurisdictions and stakeholders, which spawned several
lawsuits. The processing costs of this application added approximately $200,000 to each lot.
Again, because of the high cost of the homes (over a million dollars), this is not a major
constraint to the development of housing. However, the Town is concerned about these costs.
One of the goals of studying ways to simplify the development process (Program IP-C4) is a
reduction of these costs.
Codes and Enforcement and On/Off Site Improvement Standards
The Town of Moraga uses the 1997 Uniform Building Code for residential construction as
required by State law. The Town has not adopted any additional requirements. The application
of the Uniform Code to housing rehabilitation could impose an impediment if the cost of
compliance exceeds a low income household’s ability to pay those costs. Many communities
mitigate this cost by not requiring the upgrading of those components of the home that are not
part of the rehabilitation.
Moraga uses the most recent version of the California Building Code for residential construction
as required by State law and generally follows the lead of the County Building Department. The
Town has not adopted minor optional components, including requiring automatic gas shutoffs
in the event of an earthquake and allowing masonry chimneys that have emissions greater than
the clean air targets. The application of the Uniform Code to housing rehabilitation could
impose an impediment if the cost of compliance exceeds a low income household’s ability to pay
those costs. Moraga mitigates this cost by not requiring the upgrading of those non-essential
components of the home that are not part of the rehabilitation.
In recent years, Moraga has encouraged developers to include environmental amenities in new
housing. The current housing element calls for cost effective sustainability features to be
included in the design guidelines for new residential construction. Although this will add some
expense to initial construction, it will decrease long term ownership costs.
Moraga requires public streets to have a 52-foot right-of-way, which includes two ten-foot travel
lanes and two eight-foot parking lanes. Some private streets are built with smaller right-of-ways
and easements for utilities. These rules are based on fire department guidelines. Streets must
have a minimum slope of two percent and a maximum slope of 20 percent (for minor collector
streets). Cul-de-sacs are limited to 34 lots. Large subdivisions must have two access points.
Code enforcement is responsive to complaints with a focus on health and safety issues.
However, there are relatively few complaints. Code enforcement does not constitute a constraint
to provision of permitted housing. Staff are most likely to be involved in abating illegal
construction that has health and safety issues.
Traffic
Voters passed Measure C (later updated with Measure J) that requires the Town to participate in
cooperative planning with respect to subregional traffic impacts. Because Moraga-bound traffic
must pass through Orinda or Lafayette to get to Highway 24, these jurisdictions must be
engaged in the planning process. The traffic limits may pose long term limitations on growth,
but in the short and medium term, as shown by the MCSP, they are not a constraint.
Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010 5-79

Chapter 5: Housing
Specifically, to avoid potential adverse impacts and meet local housing needs, the Town
reprioritized development in the Moraga Center Specific Plan area away from detached single
family residential development toward local serving higher density housing such as senior,
student and workforce housing. The total number of dwelling units proposed for the Moraga
Center Specific Plan area is 86 percent more than would have been allowed under the General
Plan (630 vs. 339) but the peak hour peak direction traffic is not increased. This is achieved by
carefully dividing the “traffic budget” between a range of dwelling unit types including senior
housing, mixed use development, higher density single family and conventional single family
units.
Constraints for Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Much of Moraga’s housing was built with younger families in mind and is not accessible to
people with disabilities. Features like steps, narrow doors and bathrooms with limited
accessibility create obstacles that prevent people with disabilities from living in the house. The
hilly topography of the area and limited access to stores, services, and public transportation
provide additional challenges. The Housing Element recommends adoption of a Reasonable
Accommodation Ordinance to allow people to put in improvements needed to make housing
more livable and accessible for persons with disabilities. It also recommends promoting
universal design.
Moraga’s definition of family is, “(a) an individual; or (b) two or more persons related by blood,
marriage, or legal adoption; or (c) a group of not more than five persons, excluding servants,
who are not related by blood, marriage or legal adoption, living together as a single nonprofit
housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit as distinguished from a hotel, club, fraternity or sorority
house, dormitory or boarding house. A family includes necessary servants.”
While this definition allows flexibility for small nonprofits and domestic help, it needs to be
expanded so it complies with State and federal law. For example, a mother raising her step-
grandson would potentially not qualify as a family.
The Town does not have any spacing or concentration requirements related to housing for
persons living with disabilities, so as a result, this issue poses no constraint to the development
of housing appropriate for persons with disabilities. The parking standards in Moraga are
relatively modest, two spaces for a single family home, and one space for studios and one
bedroom units.
The Moraga Center Specific Plan draft implementation guidelines reduce parking standards for
seniors down to .5 parking spaces per unit if the development provides a shared vehicle.
The parking requirements for rest homes, nursing homes or convalescent homes are one space
per three beds. Additionally, there is flexibility built into the ordinance for public or quasi-public
facilities (like schools) based on a study of comparable users or activities. The current standard
for single family homes is two parking spaces per dwelling unit, which includes group homes
with six or fewer people. The proposed Reasonable Accommodation procedures will provide an
additional way to reduce parking requirements for individuals.
5-80                                                         Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010

Thus, in total, the conclusion of this analysis is that the Town’s development standards and
regulations do not pose a constraint to housing for persons living with disabilities.
D.       Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Many modern design methods used to reduce residential energy consumption are based on
proven techniques that have been known to humans since the earliest days of collective
settlement. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
 Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out
     during the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven
     building techniques in this category include:
        location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar
         gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
        use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that
         absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
        “burying” part of the home in a hillside or berm to reduce solar exposure or to insulate
         the home against extremes of temperature;
        use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange
         between the interior of a home and the exterior;
        location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural air
         flow (particularly cool evening breezes); and
        use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during
         the summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
 Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
     Examples include:
        north-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling;
        minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
        location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
 Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
        use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
        use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
        use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
Moraga 2010 Housing Element Update / January 2010 5-81

Chapter 5: Housing
In addition to natural techniques that have been used for millennia, a number of modern
methods of energy conservation have been developed or advanced during the present century.
These include:
        use of solar energy to heat water;
        use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity;
        window glazing to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth;
        weather-stripping and other insulating devices to reduce heat gain and loss; and
        use of energy efficient home appliances.
Though the greatest opportunities for energy conservation are in the design and construction of
new dwellings, retrofitting existing structures for greater energy efficiency can produce valuable
savings. Measures may include weatherizing windows and doors, improving insulation, and
upgrading heating and cooling systems. Retrofitting for energy conservation is gaining popularity
among home owners, though high costs represent a barrier for lower income families.
Financial assistance to lower income families may be provided through initiatives such as the
Contra Costa County Neighborhood Preservation Program. This program provides loans to low
and moderate income individuals to improve their homes. Loans are granted for plumbing and
heating repairs, roof replacements, as well as for improvements specifically intended to improve
energy efficiency. More information can be found at: http://ca-
contracostacounty.civicplus.com/index.aspx?NID=287
The Moraga Center Specific Plan is a great opportunity to promote environmental stewardship.
Because almost fifty percent of greenhouse gases come from transportation, it is important to
have land use patterns that promote sustainability. Moraga Center will be a walkable,
environmentally-friendly, mixed use development with regular public transportation access to
the nearby BART station.
Moraga has also made important steps to ensure all buildings are environmentally friendly. All
the units in recent Palos Colorados development will achieve at least 90 points on the Build It
Green checklist. This is well over the 50 points required for minimal certification. While the
specifics of the environmental building ordinance are yet to be determined, Build It Green is one
viable option. This program is desirable because it allows builders to choose from a menu of
environmental amenities based on local conditions.

 VII. CONSITENCY WITH GENERAL PLAN
The Moraga General Plan serves as the constitution for development in the town. It is a long-
range planning document that describes goals, policies and programs to guide decision-making.
Once the General Plan is adopted, all development-related decisions in the town must be
consistent with the Plan. If a development proposal is not consistent with the Plan, it must be
revised or the Plan itself must be amended. State law requires a community’s General Plan to be
internally consistent. This means that the housing element, although subject to special
requirements and a different schedule of updates, must function as an integral part of the overall
General Plan, with consistency between it and the other General Plan elements.
The current Moraga General Plan was adopted in 2002, including the previous housing element.
This Element builds upon the 2002 document.
The largest change is language is related to the Moraga Center Specific Plan. While the Specific
Plan implements many sections of the General Plan, the General Plan must be amended to fully
support the Specific Plan. These changes have been identified outside of the housing element
and are expected to be adopted by the Town. Specifically, the Land Use element will need to be
updated to be consistent with the higher densities associated with the Moraga Center Specific
Plan. Additionally, the General Plan will be written to reflect the fact that the housing element
will be adopted at the same time as the Moraga Center Specific Plan.
The major new initiatives in this housing element update are as follows:
        Encouraging second units
        Reviewing development procedures
        Setting environmental design guidelines for all new buildings
        Allowing emergency shelters by right
        Passing a reasonable accommodations ordinance for people with disabilities
These policies are consistent with the rest of the General Plan.
It is important to understand that Moraga lists all the General Plan implementing programs in a
separate chapter (Chapter 11, Action Plan). Although all housing related programs are
reproduced here for clarity and simplicity, they will be integrated back into the Action Plan
(Chapter 11) when the housing element is adopted.

APPENDIX B – AVAILABLE SITES INVENTORY
Notes:
Lots marked as no infrastructure mean an unimproved lot. Infrastructure may be readily available, but has not been extended to the lot at this time.
All the lots that are zoned OSM and have a 0-unit capacity are open space lots which means that a conditional use permit is required for any residential development. The code reads: “any
development on such open space lands shall be limited to a maximum density of one dwelling unit per 20, 10, or 5 acres, but in no case shall density on such lands exceed one dwelling unit per five
acres” (MMC 8.52.140). All proposed development must meet MOSO standards.
All the lots that are zoned Study and have a 0-unit capacity are study district lots which means that temporary control of the development of the area is permitted while the planning agency conducts
detailed studies. The code reads: “the precise standards for the development of property in this district shall be prescribed at the time the reviewing authority approves the issuance of a conditional
use permit. The standards shall fix the density, lot area, frontage, front, side and rear setbacks, building height and site coverage requirements” (MMC 8.60.040).

Appendix F provides a summary matrix identifying the Town
department(s) responsible for implementing each program, schedule
for implementation (highlighting programs to be implemented in the
coming year), financing sources (when other than or in addition to
Town funds), and, where applicable, quantified objectives for the
production of housing units affordable to various income levels (in
accordance with State law requirements). Quantified objectives are
also summarized at the end of the Housing Element (Chapter 5).
The Action Plan, in keeping with Implementing Program IP-A4,
should be revisited on an annual basis as part of the General Plan

        made conditions of project approval.
IP-B6   Moderate Risk Areas Zoning Overlay
        Establish a zoning overlay district for all moderate-risk areas
        and discourage development in areas so designated. Where
        possible, avoid building in moderate risk areas. Where it is not
        possible to avoid building in such areas entirely, due to parcel
        size and configuration, limit development accordingly through
        density regulations, subdivision designs that cluster structures
        in the most stable portions of the subdivision, site designs that
        locate structures in the most stable portion of the parcel, and
        specific requirements for site engineering, road design, and
        drainage control.

        greater than 20 percent slope. Regulate densities and require
        that permitted structures be built in the most stable portion of
        each parcel. Prohibit the construction of new residences on
        average slopes of 25 percent or more within the proposed
        development area of a lot, with the exception of existing lots
        that were either legally created after March 1, 1951 or
        specifically approved by the Town Council after April 15,
        2002. In the case of existing lots with an average slope of 25%
        or more within the proposed development area, the design of
        all new residences shall be subject to design review approval.

            schedule for strengthening those facilities found to be
            below standard.
         Require critical facilities, such as schools and medical
            facilities, to meet the highest possible standards.
         Set priorities for non-critical facilities and establish
            procedures and a schedule for achieving compliance.
         Require basic elements of seismic retrofitting upon transfer
            of property, including inexpensive and cost-effective
            measures such as bolting of houses to foundations,
            reinforcement of chimneys, sheathing of cripple walls and
            bracing of hot water heaters.
         Include guidelines for post-earthquake decisions regarding
            evacuation and condemnation of damaged buildings.

        development and avoid environmental degradation, requiring
        environmental impact analysis and appropriate mitigations as
        necessary in accordance with applicable laws.
IP-C7   Geotechnical Reports
        Require a geotechnical report to accompany building permit
        applications for all new construction, except minor building
        additions. For hillside sites with slopes steeper than 20 percent,
        require an engineering geologic report and retain a
        geotechnical engineer and engineering geologist to review such
        reports on behalf of the Town, according to established
        guidelines and procedures for review and approval. Ensure that
        all geologic and geotechnical reports are made a part of the
        public record, organized in such a manner that they will
        become an evolving source of local geotechnical information.
IP-C8   Fee Waivers/Deferrals and Expedited Permit Processing
           Review the Town’s fee structure to ensure that
            development pays no more than its fair share of providing
            public service improvements consistent with the General
            Plan. Provide fee waivers or deferrals for projects that
            contain low- or moderate-income housing. Fee waivers or
            deferrals should be commensurate with the percentage and
            income levels of the affordable units proposed, and should
            be offered only when necessary to assure the financial
            feasibility of the project and/or the affordability of the low-
            or moderate-income units.
           Provide expedited permit processing and permit assistance
            to developers providing affordable housing to ensure that
11-10                                                              June 2002

Moraga 2002 General Plan                                        Action Plan
            unnecessary delays do not occur that could jeopardize
            project funding or result in substantial increases in project
            costs.
D.      Codes and Enforcement
IP-D1   Building and Grading Codes
        Review and revise the Town’s building and grading codes, as
        necessary, to ensure that the highest standards of the
        geotechnical engineering profession are being followed.
        Specifically, aim for the highest standards in the areas of:
         Foundation design for expansive soils
         Hillside drainage
         Fill settlement
         Slope stability analysis
         Liquefaction analysis and mitigation
         Landslide repair
        In the grading code, require that roads constructed in hillside
        areas be engineered to standards that facilitate proper
        emergency access and the delivery of necessary services, while
        reducing the potential for excessive maintenance and repair
        costs. Develop an average slope limit beyond which grading
        shall be prohibited unless grading is required for landslide
        repair or slope stabilization.
IP-D2   Building Inspection, Code Enforcement and Hazard Abatement
        Encourage the County to continue to respond to complaints of
        substandard property conditions by inspecting properties and
        enforcing applicable building, health and safety codes.
        Regularly inform elected and appointed officials regarding
        code compliance and enforcement issues.
        For critical structures and development in risk areas, encourage
        the County to implement a pro-active program of building
        inspection, code enforcement, and hazard and nuisance
        abatement. Specifically:
           Substandard Structures. Inspect and vacate or condemn
            structures that are damaged or are in imminent peril, using
            public nuisance abatement powers.
           Hazards in Town Buildings. Reduce non-structural hazards
            in all Town buildings.

            ensure their familiarity with principles of seismic design
            and with seismic code requirements.
           Grading and Foundation Inspections. Establish inspection
            procedures to ensure that all grading and foundation work
            is observed and documented at specific critical stages. For
            sensitive sites, require periodic grading and foundation
            inspection by the Town’s engineering geologist and/or
            geotechnical engineer.
           Inspection of Critical Public Buildings. For particularly
            critical public buildings, require periodic inspection by the
            Town’s structural engineer for seismic safety.

    established by the Town, consistent with requirements typically
    expected of similar development proposals. This may include a
    requirement to provide an opportunity for input by Town residents
    regarding the Opportunities and Constraints Analysis and the
    conceptual development plan.
    c) A General Plan Amendment to Implement the Conceptual
        Development and Conservation Plan in Town Policies. Upon
        review, refinement and approval of the Conceptual
        Development and Conservation Plan by the Town Council, a
        General Plan Amendment should be proposed by the property
        owner group working with Town staff to establish a policy

expression of the General Plan’s goals and policies and is the single most
important policy implementation measure of the General Plan.
The General Plan Diagram is not a map. Although it may be to scale, the uses
or alignments displayed on the Diagram should not be measured directly.
Also, the Diagram should not be used interchangeably with the Town’s
Zoning Map. The Diagram is a long-term planning tool that depicts the
desired pattern of future development at a generalized level. The Zoning Map
is a current planning tool that depicts permitted uses on a parcel level. In
cases where the land use designation of a parcel is unclear based on the
General Plan Diagram, the Planning Commission shall make a determination
as to the appropriate designation.
The General Plan Diagram presents four general categories of land use:
Residential Neighborhoods, Mixed Use Areas, Parks and Open Space, and
Community Facilities. It also displays the Town’s circulation system.
The General Plan Diagram of the Moraga 2002 General Plan is displayed on
the following page.
Appendix C provides a summary of the projected residential development
potential of remaining undeveloped lands in the Town based on the General
Plan Diagram.

APPENDIX B
SPECIFIC PLAN AREA DIAGRAMS
Land Use policies LU3.1 and LU3.2 as well as Community Design policies CD6.5 and
CD6.6 call for development of ‘specific plans’ for the areas around the Town’s two major
shopping centers—the Moraga Center and Rheem Park. These policies provide a detailed
overview of the intent for each specific plan and desired outcomes. The policies are
implemented by action IP-K1, identified as a near-term priority in the Action Plan
Summary (Appendix F).
The diagrams on the following two pages identify the specific plan area boundaries,
major features, and adjacent uses. The diagrams are provided for illustrative purposes
only to show the configuration of the Specific Plan areas and potential opportunities.
They are in no way meant to represent an approved plan or policy direction.

DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL
The following table summarizes the ‘Theoretical Maximum Development
Capacity’ of the Town of Moraga based on the General Plan Diagrams of the
1990 General Plan and the Moraga 2002 General Plan. The 1990 General
Plan figures are provided as a point of comparison.
The ‘estimated actual’ development potential for the Moraga 2002 General
Plan (shown in the last two columns) reflects assumptions, based on past
experience, about the level of development that might be expected once site-
specific reviews and considerations are taken into account (which typically
result in fewer total units than would be allowed under the ‘theoretical
maximum’).

* Most projects are not designed and/or approved at maximum allowed density due to site-specific
constraints, environmental review, and other factors. The build-out assessment in this table reflects an
assumption of 80% build-out of the maximum capacity on undeveloped (and currently unapproved) sites. This
is a conservative assumption (erring on the ‘high side) based on recent project’s approved densities in
relation to maximum potential density. The ‘% change’ column is in comparison to theoretical maximum build-
out of the 1990 General Plan. Also, see notes for Table C1.

APPENDIX D
DEFINITIONS
The following definitions should be used in interpreting and implementing
the Moraga 2002 General Plan.
Cluster Housing. Cluster housing is defined as single family dwelling units
sited on less than the minimum size lots permitted by the General Plan (see
Policy LU1.6) to preserve open space.
Critical Facility. Facilities housing or serving many people that are necessary
in the event of an earthquake or flood, such as hospitals, fire, police and
emergency service facilities; utility ‘lifeline’ facilities such as water,
electricity and gas supply; and communications and transportation facilities.
Dedication. The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for
public use, and the acceptance of land for such use by the governmental
agency having jurisdiction over the public function for which it will be used.
Dedications for roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses often are made
conditions for approval of a development by local governments.
Dedication, In lieu of. Cash payments which may be required of an owner or
developer as a substitute for a dedication of land, usually calculated in dollars
per lot, and referred to as ‘in lieu fees’ or ‘in lieu contributions.’
Defensible Space. ‘Defensible space’ is a term used in relation to both crime
prevention and fire prevention. In crime prevention, it describes a physical
design approach that helps to deter crime and promote public safety by
creating a sense of ownership for local residents over public spaces,
encouraging more street activity and ‘eyes on the street’ (though sight lines
from homes to the street and features such as front porches) and ensuring that
front entryways are clearly visible from the street. In fire prevention, the term
‘defensible space’ is used to describe the area around a home that should be
cleared of brush and other dry vegetation to help reduce fire hazards.
Density (Residential). The number of permanent residential units per acre of
land. Density may be controlled through zoning in the following ways: use
restrictions, minimum lot-size requirements, floor area ratios, setback and
yard requirements, minimum house-size requirements, limits on units per
acre, and other means. Allowable density is the major distinction between
residential districts.
Density Bonus. A density bonus is a specific number of dwelling units that
may be added to the Theoretical Residential Holding Capacity of a multi-
family residential parcel, designated 6 DU/acre or higher on the General Plan
Diagram or in the Moraga Center Area and Rheem Park Area Specific Plans.
A density bonus of 25 percent may be awarded when the Town finds that a
June 2002                                                                      D-1

Appendix D: Definitions                                 Moraga 2002 General Plan
project meets the requirements set forth in Policy H2.7 of the Housing
Element. A density bonus may not increase the permitted density by more
than 25 percent over the Theoretical Residential Holding Capacity.
Development. Development means the placement, discharge or disposal of
any material, the grading or removing of any material, the change in the
density or intensity of use of land, the subdivision of land, or the construction
or erection of a structure. Development does not include (1) work necessary
to eliminate or prevent a condition which is determined by the Town to be a
menace to life, limb or property or adversely affects the safety, use or
stability of a public way or drainage way or channel; (2) establishment of a
fire trail approved by the Moraga-Orinda Fire Protection District; or (3) a
road together with attendant underground utilities, may cross a ridge, if the
Planning Commission finds that the crossing is necessary for the orderly
development of the Town and does not conflict with the Municipal Code.
Flood, 100-Year. The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the average
every 100 years, based on historical data. The 100-year flood has a 1/100, or
one percent, chance of occurring in any given year.
General Plan Diagram. This is a multicolored map of the planning boundaries
of the Town. It is a visual representation of some, but not all, of the elements
of the General Plan. The Diagram is not intended to establish precise
boundaries of the various sub-areas of the Town but only their general
locations. The actual boundaries of each of the land uses, the precise location
of the circulation system, and details of the other elements will be determined
more precisely by reference to the approved zoning map and/or subdivision
proposals which have already been approved and developed, and in the
context of consideration of development proposals for particular properties.
An understanding of the General Plan Diagram and its relationship to the
various elements can be achieved only by reviewing it in conjunction with
the text of each of the Elements of the General Plan. The General Plan
Diagram for the Draft Moraga 2000 General Plan is contained in Appendix A
of the Plan document.
Geologic Hazards. These are geologic conditions that could have an impact
on the safety and welfare of the Town, such as, among other things, land
flow or creep, surface erosion, creek erosion, fault movement, shrink/swell of
soils and sub-surface water conditions.
Hazardous Material. Any substance that, because of its quantity,
concentration or physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant
present or potential hazard to human health and safety or to the environment
if released into the workplace or the environment. The term includes, but is
not limited to, hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.
High Risk Areas. ‘High Risk Areas’ are areas with a MOSO Open Space
designation on the General Plan Diagram and determined to be High Risk in
accordance with Part II D. of the “Guidelines for the Interpretation and
Implementation of the Moraga Open Space Ordinance – Measure A,”
D-2                                                                     June 2002

Moraga 2002 General Plan                                Appendix D: Definitions
adopted as Resolution 14-92 by the Town Council on February 12, 1992 in
accordance with the Moraga Open Space Ordinance (MOSO).
Housing Affordability. The generally accepted measure for determining
whether a person can afford housing means spending no more than 25 to 33
percent of one’s gross household income on housing costs, including utilities,
principle and interest.
Income Limits. Income limits are updated annually by the US Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for Contra Costa County. For many
State and local programs, State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) income eligibility limits are used. HCD income limit
regulations are similar to those used by HUD. In 2000, the HUD median
household income for a family of four in Contra Costa County was $67,600.
 Very Low Income Households. Defined by California Housing Element
    law as households earning less than 50 percent of the median household
    income. Thus, for the year 2000 a family of four earning less than
    $33,800 per year is considered very low income.
 Low Income Households. Defined by California Housing Element law as
    households earning 50 to 80 percent of the median household income.
    Thus, for the year 2000 a family of four earning between $33,800 and
    $54,080 per year is considered low income.
 Moderate Income Households. Defined by California Housing Element
    law as households earning 80 to 120 percent of the median household
    income. Thus, for the year 2000 a family of four earning between
    $54,080 and $81,120 per year is considered moderate income.
 Above Moderate Income Households. Defined by California Housing
    Element law as households earning more than 120 percent of the median
    household income. Thus, for the year 2000 a family of four earning
    above $81,120 per year is considered above moderate income.
Lamorinda Area. This refers to the Lafayette-Moraga-Orinda area, consisting
of all three jurisdictions.
Manufactured Housing. A manufactured home is a factory-built, single
family structure that is built on a permanent chassis and transportable in one
or more sections. This reduces construction costs considerably. Once built, a
manufactured home may be difficult to distinguish from a site-built house.
California law (Gov Code §65852.3) permits manufactured homes built
under federal and state guidelines and on a foundation to be placed on lots
zoned for conventional single-family residential dwellings. The homes must
conform to the same development standards applied to a conventional single-
family residence on the same lot, but may also be subject to three additional
architectural requirements (roof overhang, roofing material and siding
material) so long as such requirements are in accordance with State
regulations (Gov Code §65852.5), do not exceed the standards for site-built
homes on the same type of lot, and do not have the effect of precluding
manufactured housing.
June 2002                                                                   D-3

Appendix D: Definitions                                 Moraga 2002 General Plan
Moraga Open Space Ordinance (MOSO). Refers to Measure A, a voter
approved Initiative adopted at the General Municipal Election held on April
8, 1986. The Initiative regulates the uses and development of lands
designated by the Initiative measure, and provides that the Town Council
shall not amend or modify any requirement of this Ordinance without
approval by the electorate at a general election. The ballot text is attached as
Appendix E and made a mandatory requirement of this General Plan.
Multi-Family Residential. Multi-family residential refers to areas that are
designated on the General Plan Diagram or in the land use diagrams of the
Moraga Center Area and Rheem Park Area Specific Plans as six (6) dwelling
units per acre or higher. Such areas may also be used for single-family
residential development so long as minimum development densities are met.
Performance Standards. These are quantifiable rules or guidelines that are
used to determine compliance with regulations or conditions of approval
established by the Town. Examples include noise measurements and traffic
levels of service. See Growth Management Policies GM1.4 and GM1.5.
Recreational Facility. A recreational facility is any development, structure,
appurtenance or other man made amenity created for the express purpose of
providing for leisure-time recreational opportunities.
Region. This refers to the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, including the
counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo,
Santa Clara, Solano and Sonoma.
Residual Parcel. A residual parcel is a vacant lot of ten (10) acres or less in
an area that is generally bounded by existing development. A residual parcel
may have any land use designation. Land Use Element Policies LU1.11 and
LU1.12 address issues related to residual parcels.
Ridgelines. A major ridgeline means the centerline or crest of the ridges
known as Indian Ridge, Sanders Ridge, Mulholland Ridge and Campolindo
Ridge, where the crest is above 800 feet above mean sea level and within an
area with a MOSO Open Space designation on the General Plan Diagram.
A minor ridgeline means the centerline or crest of any ridge other than those
identified as ‘major ridgelines,’ where the crest is above 800 feet above mean
sea level and within an area with a MOSO Open Space designation on the
General Plan Diagram.
Development shall be prohibited on minor ridgelines immediately adjacent to
and extending into MOSO Open Space if slopes exceed twenty percent
(20%) and elevation of said ridges is greater than 800 feet above mean sea
level.
Second Unit. A self-contained living unit that is in addition to the primary
residential unit on a single lot. Typically, the unit may be either attached to
or detached from the primary unit (although the current Moraga ordinance
D-4                                                                     June 2002

Moraga 2002 General Plan                                 Appendix D: Definitions
requires that they be attached). Second units are also referred to as accessory
units, in-law units, carriage houses or granny flats.
Section 8. This is a rental assistance program operated by the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development. It provides two forms of
assistance: 1) certificate rent subsidies to owners of housing units on behalf
of very low-income tenants; and 2) vouchers used in rental housing of the
tenant’s choosing. The assistance is intended to help bridge the gap between
the household’s income and the ‘fair market rate’ for rental housing. Section
8 is the largest rental assistance program in the country. Local Section 8
programs are operated by the County Housing Authority.
Senior Housing. Defined by California’s Housing Element law as projects
developed for, and put to use as, housing for seniors. Seniors are defined as
persons at least 62 years of age.
Single Family Dwelling (Attached). A dwelling unit occupied or intended for
occupancy by only one household that is structurally connected with at least
one other such dwelling unit.
Single Family Dwelling (Detached). A dwelling unit occupied or intended
for occupancy by only one household that is structurally independent from
any other such dwelling unit or structure intended for residential or other
use.
Sphere of Influence. The probable ultimate physical boundaries and service
area of a local agency (in this case, the Town) as determined by the Local
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) of the County.
Subdivision. The division of a tract of land into defined lots, either improved
or unimproved, which can be separately conveyed by sale or lease, and
which can be altered or developed. ‘Subdivision’ includes a condominium
project as defined in Section 1350 of the California Civil Code and a
community apartment project as defined in Section 11004 of the Business
and Professions Code. The Subdivision Map Act (Division 2 of the
California Government Code) gives local jurisdictions the authority to
regulate and control the design and improvement of subdivisions.
Theoretical Residential Holding Capacity. This is a planning tool to identify
the potential, although theoretical, number of residential dwelling units that
might be developed on a piece of property. The number is determined by
multiplying the gross acreage of a property, exclusive of roads, by the
residential density indicated on the General Plan Diagram. The number
derived from this calculation shall not be the basis for transfer of
development rights. The actual amount of acreage that may be subject to
development will be determined at the time of the consideration of a
development proposal when more precise information is available. The actual
number of residential units that may be developed may be greater (due to
density bonus or transfer of development rights) or less (due to site
constraints or other factors) than the Theoretical Residential Holding
June 2002                                                                    D-5

Appendix D: Definitions                                Moraga 2002 General Plan
Capacity. The actual number of units that may be developed on a site will be
determined based upon information obtained through the appropriate
environmental review process, including constraints identified by this
General Plan and supporting studies and from the Town’s Development
Capability Maps and site development standards, as expressed in the Town’s
adopted ordinances and resolutions.
Town Center Facility. A proposed new facility that would consolidate the
Town’s administrative and planning offices, provide a new police station,
and create a new multi-use community facility. At the time of the Moraga
2000 General Plan Update, the Town had selected a preferred site near the
Moraga Center and was exploring options in terms of site acquisition, facility
design, and facility financing.
Transfer of Development Rights. Transfer of Development Rights (referred
to as ‘Density Transfer’ in the Moraga Open Space Ordinance) is the process
whereby development rights may be transferred from lands on the General
Plan Diagram with an open space designation or 1, 2, or 3 dwelling units per
acre, but only when the Town Council finds that such a transfer will result in
the dedication, protection and preservation of open space and when
appropriate guarantees are provided by the developer that the land shall be
permanently preserved as open space.
Development rights may be transferred to land residentially designated lands,
but such transfer may not increase the Theoretical Residential Holding
Capacity determined by the initial calculation (described in the definition for
“Theoretical Residential Holding Capacity”) by more than 30 percent.
Development rights may not be transferred to geologically hazardous areas
or to any area with an open space designation on the General Plan Diagram.
Uniform Building Code. A national, standard building code that sets forth
minimum building standards for construction.
Zoning. The division of a jurisdiction by legislative regulations into areas, or
zones, which specify allowable uses for real property and size restrictions for
buildings within these areas. Zoning is a key implementing program for the
General Plan. The Zoning Map is a visual display of the geographic
distribution of zones in a jurisdiction.

APPENDIX E
TEXT of the MORAGA OPEN
SPACE ORDINANCE (MOSO)
The people of the Town of Moraga DO ORDAIN as follows:
SECTION 1. Short Title.
This ordinance shall be known as the "Moraga Open Space Ordinance".
SECTION 2. Findings.
The people of the Town of Moraga find and declare the following:
a.  The character and feel of the Town of Moraga is contingent upon the
    preservation of a substantial amount of open space, the protection of the scenic
    views of major and minor ridgelines, and the regulation of development in
    sensitive open space areas.
b.  The Town has experienced significant development pressures in recent years
    which threaten the amount and quality of open space resources of the Town and
    which adversely affect the capacity of the Town's public facilities, such as
    drainage and traffic facilities, and are otherwise altering the character of the
    community.
c.  It is the intent of the people of the Town to protect the remaining open space
    resources within the Town in the interest of: (1) preserving the feel and
    character of the community; (2) ensuring the adequacy of recreational
    opportunities which are contingent on such open spaces; (3) ensuring the
    protection of local and regional wildlife resources which are dependent on the
    habitat provided by such open space; (4) ensuring that development does not
    occur in sensitive viewshed areas; (5) protecting the health and safety of the
    residents of the Town by restricting development on steep or unstable slopes;
    and (6) ensuring that development within the Town is consistent with the
    capacity of local and regional streets and other public facilities and does not
    contribute to the degradation of local or regional air quality.
d.  It is the purpose of this Ordinance to revise and augment the policies of the
    Town recorded in the General Plan and the ordinances of the Town relating to
    the preservation of open space and protection of ridgelines. This Ordinance is
    consistent with and implements the policy in General Plan Amendment 3,
    enacted November 18, 1981, which established a policy of minimum lot size
    designations of twenty (20), ten (10), and five (5) acres in some open space
    areas.
e.  In addition to the reasons described above, this Ordinance is necessary to
    promote the general health, safety and welfare of the residents of Moraga.
SECTION 3. Protection of Open Space
a. The following policy is added to Goal 1 of the Open Space Element of the
    General Plan:
June 2002                                                                            E-1
Appendix E: MOSO Text                                         Moraga 2002 General Plan
    "3) Any use of or development on lands designated in the General Plan or by
    this Ordinance as 'Open Space Private' or 'Public Open Space-Study'
    (hereinafter 'Open Space Lands') shall be limited to a maximum density of one
    (1) dwelling per twenty (20), ten (10), or five (5) acres, but in no case shall
    density on such lands exceed one (1) dwelling unit per five (5) acres. Areas
    identified as 'high risk' areas, as defined in this Ordinance, shall be limited to a
    maximum density of one (1) dwelling unit per twenty (20) acres. Density
    transfers from Open Space Lands to other lands shall be encouraged; provided
    that in no event shall dwelling units be transferred to Open Space Lands or to
    'high risk' areas. The Town Council shall identify 'high risk' areas after taking
    into account soil stability, history of soil slippage, slope grade, accessibility, and
    drainage conditions."
b.  Policy Number 1 of Goal 4 of the Open Space Element of the General Plan is
    revised to read as follows:
    "1) Development shall be prohibited on slopes with grades of twenty percent
    (20%) or greater and on the crests of minor ridgelines. The Town Council shall
    reduce the allowable densities on slopes of less than twenty percent (20%)
    through appropriate means such as requiring proportionally larger lot sizes or
    other appropriate siting limitations. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term
    'minor ridgeline' means any ridgeline, including lateral ridges, with an elevation
    greater than 800 feet above mean sea level, other than a major ridgeline."
c.  The following policy is added to Goal 1 of the Land Use Element of the General
    Plan:
    "8) Notwithstanding any other provision of the General Plan, any development
    on lands depicted in the General Plan or by this Ordinance as 'Public Open
    Space-Study' or 'Private Open Space' shall be limited to a maximum density of
    one (1) dwelling per twenty (20), ten (10), or five (5) acres, but in no case shall
    density on such lands exceed one (1) dwelling unit per five (5) acres. Areas
    identified as 'high risk' areas, as defined in this Ordinance, shall be limited to a
    maximum density of one (1) dwelling unit per twenty (20) acres."
d.  Section 8-3805 is added to chapter 38 of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of
    Moraga as follows:
    "Section 8-3805. Open Space Density.
    "(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the ordinances of the Town of
    Moraga: (1) all land within the Town of Moraga designated 'Public Open Space-
    Study' or 'Private Open Space' (hereinafter referred to as 'Open Space Lands') in
    the Moraga General Plan as such Plan existed on October 16, 1985, or which is
    designated such by this Ordinance is hereby zoned 'Open Space' ('OS'); and (2)
    any development on such Open Space Lands shall be limited to a maximum
    density of one (1) dwelling unit per twenty (20), ten (10), or five (5) acres, but
    in no case shall density on such lands exceed one (1) dwelling unit per five (5)
    acres. Areas identified as 'high risk' areas, as defined in this Ordinance, shall be
    limited to a maximum density of one (1) dwelling unit per twenty (20) acres.
    The Town Council may authorize density transfers from Open Space Lands to
    other lands pursuant to the procedures set forth in Chapter 47 herein; provided
    that in no event shall dwelling units be transferred to Open Space Lands or to
    high risk areas. In determining the appropriate density transfer credit applicable
E-2                                                                            June 2002
Moraga 2002 General Plan                                      Appendix E: MOSO Text
     to any such Open Space Lands, the Town Council may authorize the transfer of
     a net density of no greater than one (1) dwelling unit per ten (10) acres.
     "Development shall be prohibited on slopes with grades of twenty percent
     (20%) or greater and on the crests of minor ridgelines. The Town Council shall
     reduce the allowable densities on slopes of less than twenty percent (20%)
     through appropriate means such as requiring proportionally larger lot sizes or
     other appropriate siting limitations. For the purpose of this Ordinance, the term
     'minor ridgeline' means any ridgeline, including lateral ridges, with an elevation
     greater than 800 feet above mean sea level, other than a major ridgeline.
     "(b) Development shall be prohibited on minor ridgelines immediately adjacent
     to and extending into Open Space Lands if slopes exceed twenty percent (20%)
     and elevation of said ridges is greater than 800 feet above mean sea level."
e.   Section 8-5702 of Chapter 57 of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Moraga
     is amended as follows:
     "(a) Development shall be prohibited within 500 feet of the centerline of a major
     ridge (as defined in subsection (b)) located in an area designated on the General
     Plan as 'Private Open Space' or 'Public Open Space-Study' and development
     shall be subject to strict design review control in all other ridge areas. A road,
     together with the attendant underground utilities, may cross a ridge, if the
     Planning Commission finds that the crossing is necessary for the orderly
     development of the Town and does not otherwise conflict with the Municipal
     Code.
     "(b) For the purpose of this section, the centerline of a major ridge is the line
     running along the highest portion of the ridge located within those areas
     designated on the General Plan as 'Private Open Space' or 'Public Open Space
     'Study."
f.   Without limiting the generality of the Moraga Open Space Ordinance, General
     Plan Amendments No. 6, adopted in resolution No. 28-83 on June 15, 1983, and
     No. 8, adopted in Resolution No. 39-83 on September 7, 1983, are hereby
     repealed and are of no further force or effect. Such lands as were affected by
     those amendments are hereby given a General Plan designation of "Public Open
     Space-Study" and are zoned "Open Space" as provided in Section 3d above.
SECTION 4. Applicability.
The provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to any person who, as of the date of the
election has not (a) obtained a building permit for the development project, and (b)
incurred substantial construction expenses in good faith reliance on such building
permit.
SECTION 5. Implementation; Interim Development Controls; Interpretation.
a. Promptly after the enactment of this Ordinance, the Town Council shall adopt
     such revisions to the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance as may be
     necessary to fully implement the Moraga Open Space Ordinance or to ensure
     the internal consistency of the General Plan or the consistency of the Moraga
     Open Space Ordinance with the General Plan; provided that the Town Council
     shall not amend or modify any requirement of this Ordinance without approval
     by the electorate at a general election.
June 2002                                                                           E-3
Appendix E: MOSO Text                                        Moraga 2002 General Plan
b.   Until the full implementation of the Moraga Open Space Ordinance as
     contemplated by subsection (a) or until January 1, 1987, whichever occurs first,
     the Town Council, or any other reviewing authority, shall not issue any permit
     or otherwise authorize or approve any use or development, including but not
     limited to divisions of land, with a density greater than one (1) dwelling unit per
     twenty (20) acres on: (1) any lands designated in the General Plan or by this
     Ordinance as "Open Space", "Public Open Space-Study" or "Private Open
     Space", or (2) major or minor ridgelines, or on slopes greater than twenty
     percent (20%), or on slopes which are unstable or subject to erosion or
     deterioration. Nothing in this subsection is intended to authorize issuance of
     any permit or approval of any development except in compliance with Section
     3d above.
c.   In the event of any conflict between the Moraga Open Space Ordinance and the
     Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of the Moraga Open Space Ordinance shall
     prevail.
SECTION 6. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, clause or phrase of this
Ordinance, or any amendment or revision of this Ordinance is, for any reason, held
to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining sections, subsections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs, clauses and phrases shall not be affected, but shall remain in full
force and effect.

APPENDIX F
ACTION PLAN SUMMARY
The following pages provide a summary matrix of the Implementing
Programs of the Moraga 2002 General Plan (Chapter 11) as a tool to support
ongoing implementation, monitoring and management of plan-related
activities.
The summary matrix identifies:
¾ Schedule for implementation of each program, highlighting
    implementation priorities for the coming year.
¾ Reponsibility for program implementation, listing the relevant Town
    officials and/or department(s).
¾ Financing sources to support program implementation, when other than
    or in addition to Town funds.
¾ Quantified Objectives, where applicable, for the production of housing
    units affordable to various income levels (in accordance with State law
    requirements). Quantified objectives are also summarized at the end of
    the Housing Element (Chapter 5).
The Action Plan Summary provides a tool to support annual review and
updating of the Plan’s implementation status. As part of the General Plan
Annual Review, the list of implementing programs should be reviewed and
evaluated, noting both program achievements and shortcomings. This
information can then be used to strengthen the Plan’s implementation
programs and identify priorities for the subsequent year.
