Sidewalks will be located throughout the City
to provide pedestrian access. The City will
continue to require new development and
redevelopment/revitalization projects to pro-

such as sidewalks. Pedestrian walkway con-
nections will be required to provide access to
major destinations within the project, as well
as to other locations within the community,
such as recreational and community facilities.
The City will also continue to identify those
areas within the existing community that
would benefit from improved pedestrian fa-
cilities, as well as identifying funding to pro-
vide needed facilities.
PARKING
An adequate supply of off-street and on-street
parking is essential to the livelihood of some
businesses and is also important to residents
of Seaside. Parking problems exist in the cen-
tral portion of the community both in residen-
tial areas and commercial districts. Circula-
tion improvements in Seaside’s central core
will need to consider the impact on off-street
parking, and additional parking will have to be
provided in the commercial and mixed use
areas to meet the demands of new develop-
ment. The City requires the development of
additional parking facilities in accordance with
the parking standards contained within the
Zoning Ordinance, which address size, land-
scaping, configuration, and ADA accessibility.
The City supports the development of parking
garages in appropriate locations. The Seaside
Auto Mall is an appropriate location for a new
parking garage. A parking garage at the Auto
Mall would increase parking capability and
free up surface space for the Auto Mall’s cus-
tomers. Another area that would benefit from
a parking garage is the visitor-serving (re-

           1 Non-directional peak hour traffic volumes are assumed to be 10% of the daily
                 traffic volume. Directional split is assumed 60/40.
                 All volumes are approximate and assume ideal roadway characteristics. Actual
                 threshold volumes for each level of service listed above may vary depending on a
                 number of factors including curvature and grade, intersection or interchange
                 spacing, percentage of trucks and other heavy vehicles, lane widths, signal timing,
                 on-street parking, amount of cross traffic and pedestrians, driveway spacing, etc.
           2 The capacity limitation is related to neighborhood quality-of-life rather than the
                 physical capacity of the road. This assumes a standard suburban neighborhood,
                 40-foot roadway width, and 25 mile per hour speed limit with normal speed viola-
                 tion rates.
           3 Capacities given for each service level assume the same level of service for the
                 adjoining merging roadway as well as level of service being determined by vol-
                 ume-to-capacity ratio, not attainable vehicle speed. Level of service will be con-
                 trolled by freeway level of service if worse than ramp.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN
ELEMENTS
The Conservation/Open Space Element must
be consistent with the other General Plan
elements and all elements of the General Plan
are interrelated to a degree. Certain goals
and policies of each element may also ad-
dress issues that are the primary subjects of
other elements. The integration of overlap-
ping issues throughout the General Plan ele-
ments provides a strong basis for the imple-
mentation of plans and programs and
achievement of community goals. The Con-
servation/Open Space Element most closely
relates to the Land Use and Safety Elements.
The Land Use Element provides a planned
land use pattern with the following general
land use designation categories: Residential,
Commercial, Public/Institutional, Parks and
Open Space and Special. The three specific
Parks and Open Space designations (Parks
and Open Space, Habitat Management, and
Recreational Commercial) are applied to pub-
lic and private lands that are intended for
conservation, open space, and recreational
uses. These designations are typically applied
to areas that have an abundance of natural
resources, visual resources and/or public
safety concerns. The Land Use Element also

Seaside Auto Mall Master Plan
The Seaside Auto Mall Master Plan, updated
in 2003, contains specific land uses, a circula-
tion system, and design standards for the re-
development and expansion of the 41.3-acre
Auto Mall area. New development and rede-
velopment activities in the Auto Mall area will
have to be consistent with this Plan.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN
ELEMENTS
While the Economic Development Element is
an optional element and is not required by
State law, it must be consistent with the other
General Plan elements. All of the elements
are interdependent, as well as being interre-
lated. Certain goals and policies of each ele-
ment may also address issues that are primary
subjects of other elements. This integration of
issues throughout the General Plan creates a
strong basis for the implementation of plans
and programs and achievement of commu-
nity goals.
The Economic Development Element is most
closely related to the Land Use and Urban
Design Elements, which determine the
amount and type of development that will
occur in the community, and specifically ad-
dress development standards and preferred
land uses for potential economic develop-
ment opportunity areas such as the Broadway
Corridor, Fremont, the North and South
Gateways, Gigling Road, and Auto Mall (See
Seaside General Plan                               ED-2                                      August 2004

Seaside’s economy consists mainly of local
support industries including retail and ser-

cent of employment in the community. These
are generally low-paying, low-skill jobs. Addi-

A significant number of parcels in the Gigling Road/Surplus II area (See Figure LU-3 Specific Plan Ar-
eas) have already been conveyed to non-profit organizations. In order to prevent an over concentra-
tion of non-revenue generating businesses in the area and to establish a desirable environment for
new revenue generating businesses to locate in this area, the City will restrict additional non-profit
uses from locating in this area. Further, the City will strive to develop this area with businesses that
generate high paying jobs for community residents. In addition, high density rental and ownership
units with community serving retail and services are appropriate land uses for this area.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
2.      Housing Needs
This section analyzes population and housing characteristics to identify the City’s specific
housing needs. Programs to address these needs are contained in the Housing Element.
A.      Population Characteristics
Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing need. Population growth, age
characteristics, race ethnicity, employment, household income, and other issues influence the
type of housing needed and ability to afford housing.
1.      Population and Age Characteristics
Seaside’s population trends and age characteristics are closely tied to the City’s links with two
major institutions – the former Fort Ord and the California State University at Monterey Bay
(CSUMB). Overlooking Monterey Bay, the City was developed as a primarily single-family
community in the 1950s and 1960s. Since incorporation of the City in 1954, Seaside’s proximity
to the former Fort Ord, climate, and range of housing options have attracted a variety of
residents to the community. For example, population growth and age characteristics during the
1960s and 1970s were closely tied to expansion and mobilization of Seventh Infantry training at
Fort Ord. Although the closure of the base in 1993 led to a reduction in overall population in
the community, many persons who were attracted to the area for employment and other
opportunities related to the military base chose to remain in the City even after its closure.
Additional regional growth and rising housing prices throughout the Peninsula, as well as the
opening and expansion of CSUMB, have attracted additional residents to Seaside due to its
more affordable housing market. Evaluating these historic and recent population and age
trends in Seaside thus provides a basis for addressing future housing needs.
Seaside continues to be the most populated city (34,194 residents) on the Monterey Peninsula
with nearly an eight-percent increase in population from 2000 to 2008. Table 1 shows the
population growth from 2000 to 2008 for Monterey Peninsula cities and the County. While the
County of Monterey’s population increased by six percent, population of a few Peninsula cities
declined during the same period.
Closure of the Fort Ord military contributed to Seaside’s population decline 1990s. One way to
analyze the impact of the base closure on population trends is to look at the change in the
population living in group quarters and the age of residents. The population living in group
quarters dropped from 5,913 in 1990 to 103 by 2000, mirroring a 60-percent decline in the 18 to
24 age group in Seaside. This trend has been somewhat moderated by the influx of students to
CSUMB since 1995. By 2008 the population in group quarters had climbed back up to 2,618.

The base closure also impacted the age characteristics of the population in Seaside. During the
1990s, adults ages 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 decreased in number by 27 percent and five percent,
respectively. These changes affect the housing market because typically, younger adults (age 25
to 34) are at a stage just entering the job market and are looking for affordable apartments or
smaller homes, while adults ages 35 to 44 are more settled and may seek improved housing
opportunities for their families.
Middle-aged adults between 45 and 64 are typically at the peak of their careers, earning higher
wages and seeking to purchase higher end, larger single-family homes. From 1990 to 2000, this
age group increased in Seaside by approximately 18 percent; specifically, adults ages 45 to 54
increased 44 percent over the decade, while those aged 55 to 64 decreased 11 percent.

Seniors aged 65 and older generally need assistance with daily needs, transportation, health
care, and accessible housing. As of the 2000 Census, seniors comprised approximately 12
percent of the population with nearly 2,700 persons. Reduced incomes and increasing health
care costs also make affordability a key issue for senior housing. Seaside’s senior population
grew both numerically and as an overall proportion of the population between 1990 and 2000.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
The largest increase occurred in the 75-and-up age group, which grew by 60 percent from 653
persons in 1990 to 1,042 in 2000. Seaside’s large senior population indicates a need for senior
housing and services.
2.      Race and Ethnicity
The racial-ethnic composition of Seaside residents may also have an important impact on the
City’s housing needs. Demographic changes and the Fort Ord base closure have impacted the
racial/ethnic distribution in Seaside. Racial-ethnic changes may have important implications
for housing needs because different groups have different household characteristics and income
levels that affect housing needs. Thus, understanding changes in the racial-ethnic composition
of Seaside residents provides a basis for addressing housing needs. For example, research has
shown that Hispanic households often have lower incomes than other racial-ethnic groups and
have greater household expenses due to a larger average family size. Thus, Hispanics may have
more difficulty finding adequately sized and affordable housing and may be at greater risk of
overpayment and/or overcrowding than other racial-ethnic groups.
The 2000 Census was the first year that respondents could label themselves as two or more
races. It is not clear to what extent this has had an effect on the change within traditional
racial/ethnic categories. Nevertheless, all Seaside racial-ethnic groups listed in 1990 declined in
numbers by 2000, except for Hispanics (See Table 3). The Hispanic or Latino population
expanded by 61 percent from 6,787 to 10,929 persons during the 1990s, and by 2000 the
proportion of Hispanics in the City was 35 percent of the population, comparable to Whites in
Seaside (11,526 persons and 36 percent of the population). The increase among Hispanics was
nearly identical to the proportional increase for this group throughout Monterey County (61
percent), suggesting a regional demographic shift. While the population of White residents
declined the most numerically (6,618), proportionally those who classified themselves as Black
or African American declined by the largest percentage (56 percent). The Asian population also
declined by 1,374 people or 28 percent.
The most recent Census data regarding race by employment status is from the 2000 Census and
sheds some light on the extent the Fort Ord base closure has affected the racial composition in
Seaside. In 1990, of 8,655 persons employed in the Armed Services in Seaside - 5,436, or 63
percent were White, 2,235, or 26 percent were Black, 400 Asians, and 152 individuals of “Other”
races. Assuming the proportion of residents employed in the Armed Forces by race/ethnicity
was relatively unchanged, it can be inferred from Table 3 that the decline among White, Black,
Asian, and residents of Other races in Seaside is largely attributable to the Fort Ord Base
Closure, as those employed in the Armed Services dropped by approximately 7,000 people to
1,446 persons in 2000. As those employed in the military left Seaside, so did their families,
which further reduced the overall numbers of some populations in Seaside.

3.        Employment Market
The closure of the Fort Ord military base undoubtedly contributed to a decline in the overall
employment level in Seaside from 1990 to 2000. In 1990, 22,617 people were in the labor force
with 989 unemployed (four percent) while by 2000 the labor force had declined by 7,647 to
14,970 with 702 unemployed (five percent). The Census reported that the number of people
employed in the Armed Forces in Seaside declined by 7,209 from 1990 to 2000, roughly
equivalent to the overall decline in the labor force participation in Seaside. As of November
2008, the State Employment Development Department estimated the unemployment rate at 5.1
percent. Similar to most communities across the State and the nation, the increased
unemployment rate is largely an impact of the widespread recession.
As shown in Table 4, 35 percent of Seaside residents were employed in service occupations in
2000, while another 44 percent held management, professional, sales and office occupations.
Seaside had more than twice the proportion of its residents employed in service occupations
than Monterey County as a whole, while Monterey County had a significantly larger portion of
its residents in Farming/Fishing/Forestry occupations than Seaside.
Table 5 lists the average salary by occupation as reported by the California State Employment
Development Department for the Salinas Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). According to
these figures, a firefighter with a family of four and no other income is considered a low to
median income family. Additionally, a median income family employed in service occupations
(e.g., cashiers, retail sales, building and ground maintenance) with only one source of income is
considered to be a very low income family. Such a large proportion of Seaside residents
employed in service occupations helps explain why Seaside’s median household income has
historically been one of the lowest in Monterey County.

B.      Household Type and Characteristics
In addition to population characteristics, household characteristics affect the type and quantity
of housing needed in Seaside. For instance, different families (e.g., according to type, age, and
size) require different types of housing to meet their needs, while a household’s income and
assets determine the type of housing that can be afforded.
1.      Household Income
Along with housing costs, household income is the most important variable that affects housing
opportunity in a community. It determines a family’s ability to balance housing costs with
other important living expenses. This section analyzes household income data from the 1990
and 2000 Census.

In 1990, the median income of Seaside households was $28,655 versus $33,520 for Monterey
County as a whole. Seaside was the third lowest among the County’s ten cities in 1990. By
2000, Seaside residents had a median household income of $41,393 compared to a countywide
median of $48,305. As shown in Table 6, Seaside still had the third lowest median household
income in Monterey County. This is likely reflective of the large number of service employees
in the hospitality industry who reside in Seaside. In addition, remaining military personnel and
new college students, who comprise approximately six and seven percent of Seaside’s
population, respectively, generally earn lower incomes than other household groups.
The State and Federal governments classify household income into several groupings based
upon the relationship to the County Area Median Income (AMI), adjusted for household size.
In 2000, approximately 55 percent of the Seaside’s households earned moderate or above
moderate incomes, while 23 percent of households earned lower incomes (Table 7).

2.       Household Types
According to the 2000 Census, 9,833 households resided in Seaside, with an average household
size of 3.2 persons. Married-couple families comprised the majority of households. The
married-couple family category is divided into couples with children (31 percent) and those
without children (23 percent). Other families comprised 21 percent and include single-parents
with children and other related family members living together. Non-family households
comprise the remainder of households (25 percent). Overall, Seaside’s mix of household types
is fairly representative of Monterey County.

As displayed in Table 8, the City’s household composition has changed significantly since 1990.
All household types grew in number and relative percentage except for married couples. While
married couples without children increased their relative share among all household types (0.7
percentage point), the number of households declined by 121 households (five percent). The
most dramatic change among household types occurred among married couples with children.
The share of married couples with children decreased by seven percentage points and declined
by 968 households (24 percent) in the 1990s. The decrease in married couple family households
is likely related to the closure of the military base. The increase in percentage of non-family
households may be related to the opening and operation of the CSUMB campus, whose student
population has grown from 654 students in 1995 to 3,020 students in 2001. Despite the
departure of many family households with children, the average household size increased

slightly from 3.1 persons in 1990 to 3.2 in 2000 and remained at 3.2 through 2008. The number
of households in Seaside increased to 9,943 by 2008.
C.      Housing Stock Characteristics
This section of the Housing Element addresses various housing characteristics and conditions
that affect the well being of Seaside residents. Factors evaluated in this section include the
following: housing stock characteristics, tenure and vacancy rates, housing age and condition,
housing costs and affordability among others.
1.      Housing Stock
According to the Census, Seaside’s housing
stock increased by two percent over the
current decade, from 11,005 units in 2000 to
11,257 units in 2008. As shown in Table 9,
single-family units had the greatest
increases, with the increases attributable to
the production of both attached and
detached single-family units. Multi-family
units increased by less than half a percent
with slight growth in larger structures with
five or more units and a decrease in small
multi-family structures.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
2.       Housing Tenure and Vacancy
Housing tenure and vacancy rates are important indicators of the supply and cost of housing.
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. Vacancies are an important
housing market indicator because the vacancy rate often influences the cost of housing and
reflects the match between housing demand and availability.
Table 10 illustrates tenure and vacancy rates
for 1990 and 2000. In 1990, 38 percent of
Seaside residents owned the units they
occupied, while 62 percent rented. By 2000,
the homeownership rate increased modestly
to 44 percent, while the percentage of renter
households declined proportionally to 56
percent. Three factors can account for the
observed shift in tenure among Seaside
residents: (1) the total number of units in
Seaside decreased by 233; (2) the number of
vacant units increased by 575; and (3) the
number of owner-occupied units increased
by 281 during this period. As a result of these
shifts, Seaside’s homeownership rate was
nearly equal to the County average as of                                   A home for rent in Seaside
2000.
A certain number of vacant units are needed to moderate the cost of housing, allow sufficient
choice for residents, and provide an incentive for unit upkeep and repair. Specifically, vacancy
rates of five to six percent for rental housing and 1.5 percent to two percent for ownership
housing are considered necessary to balance the supply and demand for housing.
Overall vacancy rate in Seaside was 10.7 percent in 2000. However, the majority of the vacant
units were classified as “Other Vacant”, referring to units held vacant by owners for other
unspecified reasons, including being held for occupancy by caretakers. Units considered vacant
due to seasonal uses represented only 0.2 percent of all housing units in Seaside.
However, vacancy rates for rental and ownership units were low in Seaside. Specifically, Table
10 shows that over the past decade, the vacancy rate for rental housing units declined to below
optimal levels, suggesting pent up demand for housing as well as potential price escalation
among available rental units. Since lower income households disproportionately live in multi-
family rental housing, the City’s sub-optimal 1.5 percent rental vacancy rate during this period
led to price escalation, increasing overpayment and overcrowding for renter-households.
The State Department of Finance reported that the overall vacancy rate in Seaside was 12
percent in January 2008. While specific breakdown of the types of vacant units is not available,
it is reasonable to assume that much of this vacancy was due to “other vacant” units as in the
2000 Census.

3.        Housing Age and Condition
Maintaining the quality of housing in the
community is an important goal for Seaside.
Like any other asset, housing is subject to a
gradual deterioration over time.             If not
repaired or maintained, housing deterioration
can depress neighboring property values,
discourage reinvestment, and eventually
impact the quality of life of neighborhood
residents.
Seaside is a fairly mature community; over 70
percent of its housing stock is more than 30
years old (see Table 9). Typically, housing                                          An older home in Seaside
over 30 years of age is likely to have
rehabilitation needs that may include new plumbing, roof repairs, and other repairs. The
Census Bureau provides limited estimates of substandard housing, such as incomplete
plumbing and kitchen facilities. According to the 2000 Census, only 59 units lacked complete
plumbing facilities (0.6 percent of the housing stock) and 44 units lacked complete kitchen
facilities.

housing conditions, property maintenance issues, and code violations. Of the more than 11,000
units in the community at the time of the survey, approximately 1.5 percent of the housing units
were identified as having some form of housing rehabilitation or property maintenance need. 1
A majority of the housing units identified as having code violations were labeled to be in “good
condition.” Approximately 12 properties were identified as needing substantial repairs, with
only four of these sites possibly requiring demolition/ reconstruction of one of the structures
(e.g., garage, second unit) on-site. A concentration of these units occurred west of Fremont
Boulevard in the vicinity of Broadway in the Cabrillo neighborhood. Other units in need of
substantial rehabilitation were scattered in the Terrace and Noche Buena neighborhoods located
between Fremont and Yosemite and Broadway and Hilby. Several concentrations of units with
structural integrity problems exist within the Cabrillo, Terrace, Olympia, and Noche Buena
neighborhoods.
A significant number (93) of the housing
units with rehabilitation or maintenance
needs in 2002 required new exterior paint.
The greatest numbers of units in need of
paint are in the Cabrillo, Terrace, and Noche
Buena neighborhoods.               However, the
Olympia, Ord Grove, and Hannon
neighborhoods          also     had      substantial
numbers of units in need of repainting.                                         A home with code violations
Properties that were identified as needing
maintenance included properties with
inoperable vehicles stored on-site, discarded

appliances and other debris, and overall
general property maintenance needs such as improved landscaping, fencing, or other problems.
Property maintenance seemed to be a greater problem in the Cabrillo, Terrace, and Noche
Buena neighborhoods. Table 12 summarizes which neighborhoods had a concentration of code
violations or other needs that should be addressed by targeted neighborhood revitalization
programs.

D.       Housing Market
Classified advertisements in the Monterey County Coast Weekly, cross-checked with listings on
internet services (Springstreet.com, Apartments.com, Craigslist.org) and the Monterey County
Herald were used to obtain data on the rental and for-sale housing markets in Seaside. In
addition, the DataQuick Real Estate Database was used to obtain sales data for homes and
condominiums.
1.       Rental Prices
The rental housing market in Seaside
includes      apartments,        townhomes,
condominiums,         and       single-family
homes. During the month of July 2008,
50 units were listed for rent. As shown
in Table 13, of the 50 advertised units,
most were single-family homes,
townhomes or condominiums. Very
few apartments were listed for rent in
the City of Seaside.
Among the nine apartment listings, the
average rent was $1,337 a month with a
range of $875 to $1,697. Rental homes
                                                                          A typical apartment building in Seaside
were much more abundant in Seaside.
Rental homes are priced higher than apartments and most are not affordable to lower income
families. Furthermore, a high number of absentee landlords may lead to intended or
unintended neglect of properties. The average price for a rental home in Seaside was $1,860.
Most of the homes available for rent are two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes. Two-
bedroom homes ranged in prices from $1,050 to $1,900 and had a median price of $1,500. Three-
bedroom homes ranged from $1,550 to $2,550 a month and had a median price of $2,000.

2.      Home Prices
According to the DataQuick Real Estate Database
and as summarized in Table 14, 101 homes and
condominiums were sold in Seaside between
2006 and 2007. The median sale prices dropped
from $651,000 to $585,000, representing a ten-
percent decrease. Other cities, such as Gonzalez,
Greenfield and King City, experienced over 20
percent decreases in median sales prices during
the same period.

The collapse of the real estate market in California has widespread impacts. Table 15 shows
that the trend of decreasing home prices has continued into 2008. It has not only continued but
home prices continue to fall even more rapidly. This has left many homeowners with less
equity in their homes and unable to sell. Seaside experienced a 48-percent decrease in home
sale prices from June of 2007 to June of 2008 and only 23 homes were sold. The decline in home
prices was greatest in Seaside compared to other surrounding cities. The City of Salinas also
experienced a significant decline in sale prices (38 percent) during this time period.
However, looking at median sales prices in a depressed housing market can be deceptive. The
significant decreases (48 percent for Seaside) do not necessarily mean devaluation of homes to
that great extent. Instead, a part of the lower median prices is due to the fact that the majority
of homes being sold are lower end products. Nevertheless, this market has also provided first-
time and lower income homebuyers a unique opportunity to afford home purchases in areas
that were previously unattainable.

for a home in Seaside was $425,000 with a range of $290,000 to $1,200,000.

Mobile home parks provide an
affordable option for many very low
income, low income, and senior
households in Seaside.               There are
currently three mobile home parks
located in Seaside: the Trailer Terrace
Mobile Home Park; the Green Parrot
Mobile Home Park; and the Seaside
Mobile Home Estates.               The Trailer
Terrace Mobile Home Park charges $425
a month for space rental but reported
that they have not had a space opening
in 16 to 17 years. The Seaside Mobile
Home Estates offers space rental for $635
                                                                                   A mobile home park in Seaside

3.       Housing Affordability
Housing affordability can be determined by comparing the sales prices and rents for housing in
Seaside to household income. This information can help answer which households can afford
to rent or own without overcrowding or overpayment problems.
Table 17 depicts the typical annual income for extremely low, very low, low and moderate
income households. It is generally accepted that extremely low, very low and low income
households can spend up to 30 percent of their gross income toward housing expenses without
overpayment. Moderate income households can usually apply 35 percent of their income
towards homeownership without incurring a housing cost burden. The table shows the highest
monthly rent and the maximum purchase price for an individual or family at the top end of the
income categories. The illustration is expanded to include five household sizes within each
income category. For renters, housing cost is defined as rent and utilities. For purchasers,
Seaside General Plan                             HE App-16                                         August 2010
                                                           HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
housing cost includes mortgage, utilities, property tax, insurance, and homeowner’s association
fees as applicable. It is important to note that this illustration is based on a household at the top
of each income range; therefore, it would be inaccurate to infer that any household within the
range could afford to pay what the table shows for a similarly sized household at the top of the
income range.
Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low income households have incomes that do not exceed 30 percent of the Area
Median Income (AMI), as adjusted for household size. The maximum affordable home price for
an extremely low income household ranges from $30,939 to $45,354, well below the median
home price.
An extremely low income household can only afford to pay $268 (one-person household) to
$398 (five-person household) for rent. The data available on rental housing shows that there are
no available units for rent within this range. Therefore, a one-person very low income
household could not afford to rent a one-bedroom, and a small or large family (even at the top
of the income range) could not afford an adequately sized apartment without some level of
overpayment.
Very Low Income Households
Very low income households earning between 30 and 50 percent of the AMI have household
incomes ranging from $22,700 to $35,000. These households cannot purchase homes over
$94,575, putting single-family and condominium homeownership out of reach. Mobile home
ownership is a possibility, but only one mobile home was listed for sale in July 2008. Rental
housing is also out of the reach of very low income households. With rents starting at $875,
very low income households cannot afford to rent in Seaside without subsidies.
Low Income Households
Low income households earn between $36,300 and $56,000 and can afford rents ranging from
$836 to $1,273. Low income households in Seaside would be able to afford renting many
apartments in Seaside, but only a few homes were listed for rent in July 2008 at affordable
prices. Home prices affordable to low income households range from $110,748 to $168,407, well
beyond the median home price in Seaside.
Moderate Income Households
Moderate income households earn more than the county median with income ranging from
$54,400 to $84,000. They can afford rents ranging from $1,291 to $1,973 and homes priced from
$206,670 and $316,070. Moderate income households cannot afford the median priced home in
Seaside, but they may be able to afford lower priced homes. They should also be able to afford
rental rates comfortably in the City.
Based on the affordability information derived, housing affordability is a problem for nearly all
lower income households and a majority of moderate income households looking to rent or
purchase a home in Seaside.

E.      Housing Problems
A continuing priority of Seaside is enhancing or maintaining the quality of life in the
community. A key measure of quality of life in a community is the extent of “housing
problems” faced by residents. These include housing overcrowding (defined as more than one
person per habitable room) and overpayment (defined as paying more than 30 percent of
income toward housing costs). This section describes the nature and extent of housing
problems in Seaside.
1.      Overcrowding
Overcrowding is an indicator of housing affordability. Unit overcrowding is caused by the
combined effect of low earning and comparatively high housing cost in a community and
reflects the inability of households to buy or rent housing that provides reasonable privacy for
their residents. An overcrowded household is defined as one with more than one person per
habitable room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches.                   A severely
overcrowded household is defined as one with more than 1.5 persons per habitable room.
In 2000, 19 percent of Seaside households lived in overcrowded conditions, with the majority of
these residents characterized as living in severely overcrowded conditions. Renter-households
made up a larger proportion of overcrowded households than owners (Table 18). The
proportion of overcrowded renter-households out of all Seaside households was 14 percent in
2000 while only five percent of owners faced a similar problem. Severely overcrowded
households were also more prevalent than general overcrowding.

Overcrowding affected a smaller percent of the population in Seaside than it did in the County
where nearly 21 percent lived in overcrowded conditions at the time of the 2000 Census.
Renters in Seaside were more affected by overcrowding whereas owners in Monterey County
were more affected by overcrowding.

2.      Overpayment
Housing overpayment is generally defined as paying more than 30 percent of income toward
housing expenses.        Overpayment is disproportionately concentrated among the most
vulnerable members of Seaside.
Table 19 shows that overall, housing overpayment occurred evenly among renter- and owner-
households in Seaside, with nearly one-third of all households overpaid for housing in 2000.
However, when dissecting this data by income level and tenure, renter-households at the
extremely low and very low income levels were more affected by overpayment than owner-
households, largely due to the fact that households at these income levels were rarely
homeowners unless they have owned the homes for a long time and generally have lower
housing payments. In contrast, overpayment was less prevalent among low and moderate
income renter-households than owner-households. As shown earlier, rents in Seaside are
generally affordable to moderate income households and to some low income households;
whereas, homeownership was still not achievable to most households in these income levels.

Figure 3 compares the prevalence of housing overpayment by tenure in Seaside to Monterey
County as a whole. Seaside and Monterey County have similar overpayment rates at 32 percent
for Seaside and 34 percent for the County. In the low income group Seaside has slightly more
overpaying households than the County.

F.       Special Needs Groups
Certain groups in Seaside have greater difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s age, family characteristics,
disability, or employment among others. Thus, certain segments of Seaside’s population may
experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problem.
State Housing Element law defines the following groups as having special housing needs:
senior households, persons with disabilities, large households, female-headed households,
homeless people, and farmworkers. Local jurisdictions may also identify additional special
needs groups based on local conditions. In recognition that people in different walks of life
have different housing needs, State and federal housing laws are designed to encourage the
provision of a full continuum of housing so that no group is excluded from living in Seaside.
Table 20 summarizes the type and magnitude of special needs groups residing in the City.
Where available, data from the 1990 and 2000 Census is used. However, in other cases,
estimates were derived from other governmental agencies or reliable survey sources. This
section also contains a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each particular group as
well as City programs and services available to address their housing needs.

1.       Seniors
Despite high levels of homeownership,
seniors are considered a special needs group.
Most seniors have limited incomes, high
health care costs, and disabilities; finding
suitable and affordable housing may be
difficult.
A significant portion of seniors have a self-
care or mobility limitation, defined as a
condition lasting over six months that makes
it difficult to go outside the home alone or
take care of one’s personal needs.

Limited Income
Because of their retired status and fixed income, many senior households earn lower income –
placing a significant limitation on their ability to purchase other necessities of life, in particular
medical care.
Overpayment
Because of the limited supply of affordable housing, senior households often overpay for
housing. The prevalence of overpayment usually varies according to tenure with renting
seniors most often overpaying for housing.
The City of Seaside was home to 2,684 seniors or 2,023 households with seniors as of the 2000
Census. Furthermore, 1,719 households were headed by seniors, representing 17.5 percent of all
households in Seaside. The majority of the senior-headed households owned their homes.
Various programs can assist seniors with their housing needs, including: congregate care,
shared housing, rental subsidies, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the frail seniors, or
those with disabilities, housing with architectural features that accommodate disabilities can
help ensure continued independent living. Seniors with disabilities also benefit from
transportation alternatives or assisted housing with supportive services.
According to the State Department of Social Services and as shown in Table 21, four licensed
care facilities are located in Seaside, with only one residential facility for the elderly at a
capacity of 40 beds (Anjelica’s Villa). A 30-person capacity adult day care center provides care
for persons with Alzheimers. The Salvation Army also runs a 45-person capacity day services
center, which is not licensed by the State. The 80-unit Villa Del Monte also provides senior
housing.

2.      Disabled Persons
The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities. Persons with disabilities have special
needs because many earn very low incomes, have higher health care costs, and are often
dependent on supportive services.
According to the 2000 Census, the City had an estimated 5,190 persons living with a range of
disabilities. Table 22 shows that physical disabilities were the most prevalent type of disability
among all age groups. However, employment disabilities impacted most significantly the

The type and severity of one’s disability often determines the type of living arrangement that
best accommodates the needs of the individual. Many persons with disabilities live at home
independently or with family members. To maintain independent living, some may need
housing assistance or supportive services. Services can include modifying housing design
features, providing income support for those not able to work, and in-home services for persons
with medical conditions. Services can be provided by public or private agencies.
3.       Large Households
Large households are defined as those with five or more members. Large households are
considered a special needs group in most communities because of a lack of affordable housing
that can adequately accommodate large families. For lower income large families, the housing
shortage can be particularly acute and result in a greater prevalence and severity of
overcrowding and overpayment.
As of the 2000 Census, large households comprised 20 percent of all Seaside households (see
Table 20). Of these large households, 36 percent were renters and 64 percent owned their
homes. The median number of rooms per unit in Seaside in 2000 was 4.7 and the total number
of occupied units with five or more rooms (minimum requirement for large households to
avoid overcrowded living conditions) was 5,462, nearly triple the number of large households
living in the City. Among these units, 44 percent (2,386) were occupied by renters and 56
percent (3,076) by homeowners. The number of larger sized units occupied by renters was more
than three times the number of large renter households in Seaside. Similarly, the number of
larger-sized units occupied by homeowners was more than two twice the number of large
owner households. However, the price range and affordability of these units is not known and
given the level of overcrowding in the City, a mismatch between housing needs and
affordability is apparent.
A large majority (over 70 percent) of households receiving or seeking Section 8 rental assistance
are either housed in or are waiting for units with two or fewer bedrooms. These data indicate

that the overcrowding problems in Seaside are likely a result of doubling up for cost reasons,
rather than an inadequate supply of larger housing units.
4.       Single Female-Headed Families
Single female-headed families often require special consideration or assistance as a result of
their lower income, high costs of childcare, need for supportive services and affordable housing.
As a result, many single female-headed families are faced with limited housing choices. In
addition, single female-headed families also tend to experience a higher level of discrimination
in the rental housing market. Single female-headed households accounted for 14 percent of
Seaside households as of 2000. More than half of these households and seven percent of all
households were single female-headed households with children. For comparison, single male-
headed households made up less than seven percent of the population and those households
with children only accounted for 3.5 percent of all households.
Married couple households and married couple households with children made up a majority
of Seaside households. These households face less difficulty with finding housing because there
are generally two income-earning adults.

Single female-headed families with children typically face the following issues:
Limited Income
Single female-headed families, earn significantly lower incomes. According to the 1990 and
2000 Census, the number of single female-headed households with children living below the
poverty level declined from 325 to 230.
Childcare Costs
Following housing costs, single female-headed families must allocate a portion of their incomes
towards childcare costs as reliable child care is often necessary in order to retain stable
employment. Compounded with housing costs, child care costs reduce single-parent families’
ability to pay for other necessities such as food and medical care.

5.      Homeless
An accurate assessment of the homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature of
the population, and because many individuals are not visibly homeless but move around in
temporary living conditions. According to the Monterey County Homeless Census and Needs
Assessment Survey (2007), 893 men, women, and children within the County were homeless on
any given night, of which 27 or three percent were counted as living in Seaside. Of these
homeless, three individuals were considered unsheltered.

           Note: *The unsheltered population includes homeless people counted on the streets, in
           vehicles, in makeshift shelters (such as tents) and encampments.
Generally, three types of facilities provide shelter for homeless individuals and families:
emergency shelters, transitional housing, and permanent housing. All three types of facilities
are described below and currently available in Seaside, as illustrated in Table 25.
       Emergency Shelter: Provides overnight shelter and fulfills a client’s basic needs (i.e.
        food, clothing, and medical care) either on-site or through off-site services.
       Transitional Housing: a residence that provides housing for up to two years. Residents
        of transitional housing are usually connected to rehabilitative services.
       Permanent Supportive Housing: refers to housing that is affordable, service-enriched,
        and allows formerly homeless clients to live at the facility on an indefinite basis.

6.      Farm Labor
Farm workers are a special needs group due to their limited income, language barriers, and the
shortage of affordable housing. There is little consensus among the available data on the
number of farmworkers working or living in Monterey County. The Census reveals that a very
small and declining percentage of the County’s farmworkers in Seaside. Within Seaside, the
1990 Census reported that 437 residents of Seaside were employed in farming, fishing and
forestry occupations. Based on the proximity of Seaside to commercial fishing companies
operating on the Monterey Bay and the commercial fishing nets noted drying in Seaside
residential areas, a safe assumption is that many of the population counted in this group were
fishermen. By 2000, the number of residents employed in those occupations declined 24 percent
to only 332.
Due to the limited number of farmworkers in Seaside and the likelihood that most of the
agricultural population is employed in the fishing industry, the City’s affordable housing
programs generally address the needs of farm laborers in Seaside.
7.      Military Personnel
Often, lower income and an uncertain length of residency affect the housing needs of military
personnel. The City of Seaside was home to the U.S. Army base, Fort Ord which was
inactivated in 1993. In 1990, there were 8,655 people employed in the Armed Forces who
resided in the City. With the base closure, this figure dropped to 1,446 military personnel in
2000, roughly six percent of the population over 16 years of age. A majority of these personnel

worked at the Defense Language Institute, the Naval Post Graduate School, or the Coast Guard
Station.
The Army contracted with a private development team to replace and/or renovate all housing
units reserved for the military personnel on the Base within seven years. The overall plan is to
demolish 1,588 military housing units within the Seaside City limits and replace them with
1,384 new homes. This slight reduction in net military housing to remain was planned to
correlate with the future expected housing needs of the military on the Monterey Peninsula.
The active and retired military personnel will also continue to be served by the Stillwell
Community Center, commissary, post exchange, and a small medical clinic. 2 No additional
City programs are required to address the needs of the remaining military population.
8.       College Students
The college student population in the area is another significant factor affecting housing
demand. Portions of California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) are located within
North Seaside. According to the CSUMB website, the student population has grown from 3,020
in 2001 to 4,035 in 2007. A majority (55 percent) of these students live in campus apartments or
residence halls. According to the University, approximately 1,803 students (45 percent) enrolled
at CSUMB in 2007 were living off campus, including in Seaside and other nearby communities.
CSUMB’s planned expansion in 2003 anticipated a student population of approximately 8,900
students by 2008, with approximately half of these students commuting and half residing on
campus or in adjacent communities. However, the 2007-2008 school year had a total enrollment
of 4,080 student, less than half of the projected enrollment. Over 1,300 acres of land and a large
existing inventory of buildings, many of them residential, have allowed CSUMB to adopt a
strong residential campus policy. Currently, 55 percent of the enrolled students live on
campus. 3 The campus presently has the capacity to accommodate 5,591 beds (3,332 are for
students) in a variety of single-family, multi-family, and dormitory-type units just with existing
buildings, and additional residential units are planned that will help meet the remaining
needs. 4 The campus currently offers coed dorms, apartments for single and married students
and suites as well as special needs housing for disabled students and international students.
The 2007 CSUMB Master Plan includes plans for additional student housing as well as faculty
and staff housing. No additional City programs are required to address the needs of the student
population.

G.      Publicly Assisted Rental Housing
1.      Tenant-Based Housing Choice Vouchers
The Housing Choice Voucher program is the federal government's major program for assisting
extremely low and very low income families, the elderly, and the disabled to rent decent, safe,
and sanitary housing in the private market. Since the rental assistance is provided on behalf of
the family or individual, participants are able to find and lease privately owned housing,
including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments from landlords who accept
vouchers.
The Housing Authority of the County of Monterey (HACM) coordinates and administers
Section 8 rental assistance on behalf of the City of Seaside.
2.      Project-Based Rental Housing Assistance
Housing units developed with public subsidies are an important source of affordable housing
to lower income households. Preserving the long-term affordability of such housing units is
usually the most cost-effective means to providing decent and affordable housing to the lower
income households in a community. Recognizing this important resource, State Housing
Element law requires that a jurisdiction examine the potential loss of publicly subsidized multi-
family rental housing for lower income households due to expiration of deed restrictions,
affordability covenants, and/or subsidy contracts. This section evaluates the publicly assisted
multi-family rental housing in Seaside that is at risk of converting to market-rate housing and
the cost to preserve or replace the at-risk units. Resources and programs for preservation or
replacement are discussed in later sections.
Table 26 is an inventory of assisted rental housing projects in Seaside. A total of 441 assisted
units are provided in four developments, including units assisted through a variety of federal
programs. These programs include HUD Section 8 and Section 236 Programs.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Potential Loss of Assisted Housing Units
Over time, rent-restricted units can lose their affordability controls and revert to non-low-
income uses. For instance, projects are typically considered at risk due to: 1) the prepayment of
HUD- or FHA-insured mortgage loans and opting out of affordability controls; and 2)
expiration of Section 8 or other subsidy contracts. The City must evaluate the potential loss of
assisted rental housing over a ten-year planning period, from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2019.
Three of the four affordable housing projects in the City are considered at risk of converting to
market-rate housing.
Hannon Assembled Apartments: The Hannon Assembled Apartments consists of 133
subsidized rental units ranging from one- to five-bedroom townhouse style apartments. The
project was originally financed through the Federal Section 236 program, which provides an
option for the property owner to prepay the remaining mortgage after 20 years. There is also a
Section 8 rental subsidy contract for 85 units that will expire in March 2009. Section 8 contract
for this project is subject to renewal with HUD annually.
Hannon Assembled Apartments has been eligible for prepayment and opt out of the HUD
Section 236 program since 2002. As of December 4, 2008, no Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepay
the remaining mortgage and opt out of the program has been filed. 5
Del Monte Manor: Del Monte Manor consists of 192 studio to three-bedroom units. The project
was financed through the federal Section 236 program, which provides an option for the
property owner to prepay the remaining mortgage after 20 years. The earliest prepayment date
for the Section 236 loan is April 28, 2010. Of the 192 units, 98 units receive additional federal
assistance through the project-based Section 8 program. The Section 8 contract on these units
will expire on September 30, 2009. Section 8 contract for this project is subject to renewal with
HUD annually.
Villa Del Monte: Villa Del Monte consists of 48 senior apartments, with 8 affordable units. The
project was sponsored by the Seaside Civic League. The mortgage will be paid off in 2010 and
the project may risk losing federal funding. The Monterey County Housing Authority is
preparing a feasibility study to investigate options with regards to this property.
Preservation and Replacement Options
Hannon Assembled Apartments, Del Monte Manor, and Villa Del Monte are at risk of
converting to market-rate housing either through prepayment and opting out of low-income
use restrictions or through termination of the Section 8 rental assistance. Preservation or
replacement of at-risk units in Seaside can be achieved in several ways:
       Transfer of ownership to nonprofit organizations
       Provision of rental assistance
       Replacement or development of new units
       Purchase of affordability covenants
       Refinance of remaining mortgage

Transfer of Ownership: Transferring ownership of at-risk projects to nonprofit organizations
has several benefits: (1) affordability controls can be secured indefinitely and (2) the project
would be eligible for a range of government assistance. This option is only applicable to the
privately owned housing projects. Also, regardless of the number of assisted units in each
project, the cost of transferring the property applies to the entire project, including assisted and
non-assisted units.
As shown in Table 27, the estimated market value for the 405 units in the three at-risk housing
projects is $37.6 million based on typical assumptions for current market rents and general
average operating costs. These estimates are intended to demonstrate the magnitude of costs
relative to other preservation and replacement options; actual market values will depend on the
building and market conditions at the time of appraisal.

Source: All calculations by Veronica Tam and Associate, 2009.
Assumptions:
1. Two-bedroom units are used to calculate the estimated value as the unit size distribution of total project units is
    unknown.
2. Capitalization rate of 10.6 percent (or a multiplier of 9.4) is used for buildings of fair conditions.
Rental Assistance: Should at-risk projects convert to market-rate housing or lose their Section 8
subsidies, rental assistance using other funding sources may help maintain unit affordability.
The feasibility of this option depends on the willingness of property owners to accept rental
assistance and the availability of funds for rental assistance.                    Table 28 presents a simplified
analysis of rent subsidies required. Rent subsidies required are calculated only for the 263
assisted units (85 units at Hannon Assembled Apartments, 98 units at Del Monte Manor, and 80
units at Villa Del Monte). The rent subsidies for one year (in 2008 dollars) are about $1.3
million. However, over 20 years, the total subsidies are estimated at $34 million.

Assumptions
1. Two-bedroom units are used to calculate the estimated value as the unit size distribution of assisted units can
     fluctuate monthly.
2. An annual inflation rate of 2.5% is used to estimate future value of 20-year subsidy contracts.
For certain Section 8-assisted projects, HUD offers the Market-to-Market or Mark-up-to-Market
program as a preservation option. If current contract rents exceed the Fair Market Rent (FMR),
HUD gives favorable tax treatment to property owners provided that the rents are marked
down to comparable FMRs and units are preserved as affordable housing for very low-income
households (Market-to-Market). For units renting below FMR, HUD encourages the for–profit
owners to remain in the Section 8 program by allowing rents to be marked up to comparable
market rents, not exceeding 150 percent of the FMR (Mark-up-to-Market). According to HUD
data, Hannon Assembled Apartments may qualify for Mark-up-to-Market, while Del Monte
Manor may qualify for Market-to-Market incentives.
Purchase of Affordability Covenant: Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk
projects is to provide an incentive package to the owners eligible to opt out of affordability
control to maintain the projects as low income housing. This option is applicable to Hannon
and Villa Del Monte. Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the remaining
loan balance (refinancing), providing new loans or grants for rehabilitation works, and/or
supplementing the Section 8 subsidy received to market levels. The feasibility of this option
depends on whether the units require rehabilitation or are too highly leveraged. By providing
lump-sum financial incentives, on-going subsidies in rents, or reduced mortgage interest rates,
the City can ensure that some units remain affordable.
Construction of Replacement Units: The construction of new low-income housing units is a
means to replace at-risk units should they be converted to market rate housing. The cost of
developing housing depends upon density, size of the units, location, land costs, and type of
construction. As later discussed in Section 3, Housing Constraints of this Technical Appendix,
the cost to construct good quality single-family housing is about $95 per square foot, with
multi-family construction being lower. Typically, construction cost makes up approximately 50
to 60 percent of the total development costs. Assuming an average unit size of 800 square feet, a
per-square-foot construction cost of $80, an average per-unit land cost $20,000, and an
Seaside General Plan                              HE App-32                                             August 2010

additional 40 percent cost factor for predevelopment and soft costs (e.g. architectural and
engineering fees), the development cost of a multi-family unit in Seaside is approximately
$200,000. The cost to replace the 263 for-profit owned at-risk units is estimated at
approximately $52.6 million.
Comparison of Options
Different housing projects have different preservation/replacement options. For non-profit
owned projects not eligible to opt out of low income use restrictions, continuing the rent
subsidies is possibly the only option available and needed to maintain the affordability of the
units. For for-profit owned projects, transfer of ownership, purchase of affordability covenants,
and construction of replacement units are all available options. Typically, preservation of
existing units is less costly than building new units. An additional factor affecting feasibility is
the relative availability of funding for the various options.
H.      Estimates of Housing Need
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census for HUD
provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of
households in Seaside. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2000 Census is displayed in Table 29.
Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
       Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
       Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
       Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
       Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.
The types of problems vary according to household income, type and tenure. Some highlights
include:
       In Seaside, renter- and owner-households have similar rates of housing problems (49
        percent for renters and 45 percent for owners).
       100 percent of extremely low income large family renters have housing problems and
        pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs.
       Nearly half (49 percent) of elderly renters had a housing problem.

3.      Housing Constraints
Various nongovernmental factors, governmental regulations, and environmental issues pose
constraints to the provision of adequate and affordable housing. These constraints may result
in housing that is not affordable to lower and moderate income households, or may render
residential construction economically infeasible for developers. This section analyzes these
potential constraints.
A.      Nongovernmental Constraints
Nongovernmental constraints refer to market factors that impact the maintenance,
development, and improvement of affordable housing. Although every community is impacted
to varying degrees by market constraints, the City of Seaside has instituted policies and
programs to offset the impact of market forces and conserve and expand the availability of safe,
decent, and affordable housing opportunities.
1.      Market Constraints
Several local and regional constraints hinder the ability to accommodate Seaside’s housing
demand. Seaside is located near scenic Monterey Bay and the Silicon Valley, which contributes
to a high demand for housing. Although the total population has declined since 1990 due to the
closure of the Fort Ord military base, housing unit production has not kept pace with the
population and employment growth evidenced in the Monterey Peninsula, Salinas Valley, and
Silicon Valley. The high cost of land, rising development costs, and neighborhood opposition
can make it expensive for developers to build housing to support the region’s growing
workforce.
Development Costs and Financing
Development costs include the price of construction materials, land, labor, and other associated
costs. The cost and availability of financing also affects the financial feasibility of a project and
the ability of homeowners to purchase or improve their housing. This section details the impact
of development cost and financing upon housing.
Construction Costs: Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with
multi-family housing being generally less expensive to construct per unit than single-family
housing. However, within each type of development, construction costs vary significantly,
depending on the size of the unit and the number and quality of amenities that are offered.
Amenities include such items as fireplaces, swimming pools, tennis courts, grade of carpeting
and tile used types of appliances and light fixtures, and the quality of the cabinetry and
woodwork.
Construction costs are the largest component of total costs for a single-family detached unit,
accounting for 30 to 40 percent of the finished sale price. According to RS Means Residential
Square Foot Costs (2008), construction costs for an average two-story single-family home (2,000
square feet of living area), and built of stucco on wood frame total $95.48 per square-foot in the
Seaside area. For multi-family attached units, construction costs are slightly lower as
Seaside General Plan                        HE App-35                                     August 2010

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
developers can usually benefit from economies of scale with discounts for materials and
diffusion of equipment mobilization costs.
Land Costs: The cost of raw land typically accounts for a large share of total housing
production costs as well as the necessary improvements that must be made to a particular site.
The diminishing supply of residential land combined with a fairly high demand for housing
(until 2007) have kept land cost relatively high in Monterey County. Undeveloped 0.1-acre and
0.2-acre single family residential lots with approved building plans and access to water were
advertised for sale in September 2008 for $250,000 and $525,000, respectively. A 0.9-acre single-
family residential lot without access to water was listed for sale for $750,000.
Construction Financing
Prior to the recession of the early 1990s, and significant changes in lending practices following
the savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s, developers could receive loans for 100 percent or
more of a project’s estimated future value. Now, construction loans are rarely available for over
75 percent of the future project value for multi-family developments. This means that
developers must usually supply at least 25 percent of the project value upfront, and perhaps
more if the total cost is more than 75 percent of the estimated value of the project.
The financing of a residential project, particularly affordable housing is quite complex. The
level of subsidies required for affordable projects typically necessitate the pooling of multiple
funding sources. Some State housing programs require site control as a prerequisite for
applying for funding. However, site control is the most challenging aspect of affordable
housing development when nonprofit developers have little resources to compete for the land
available on the market.
As described later in this document, the City supports the production of affordable housing by
allocating water credits to developments affordable to lower income households. The City also
offers other development incentives that increase the cash flow of a project to help finance
affordable units. The City writes down land costs, and provides loans and financial assistance
for qualified projects to facilitate affordable projects for special needs groups.
Buyer Access to Financing
Between 2000 and 2006, home prices escalated and after falling to historic lows earlier this
decade, interest rates were again on the rise and had a substantial impact on housing costs for
purchasers. Many homebuyers chose variable rates as they might be a percentage point or two
lower than fixed rate mortgages. However, the ability of lending institutions to raise rates to
adjust for inflation resulted in mortgage holders overextending themselves financially, as well
as returning to a situation where high financing costs substantially constrain the housing
market.
The availability of financing largely affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to
disclose information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race of
the applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases, improvements and
refinancing, whether financed at market rate or with government assistance.

Home Purchase Loans
In 2006, a total of 609 households applied for conventional loans to purchase homes in Seaside.
The overall loan approval rate was 56 percent and 32 percent of applications were denied. No
applications were submitted for the purchase of a home in Seaside through government-backed
loan programs (e.g. FHA, VA). To be eligible for such loans, residents must not exceed the
income limits established for the program and the home value must be below a capped value.
During 2006, the housing market was at its peak. Few lower and moderate income households
would be able to purchase a home in Seaside and few homes available on the market would be
below the capped price.
Refinance Loans
Relatively low interest rates and a high prevalence of interest-only, adjustable rate, and balloon
payment mortgages led Seaside residents to file 1,788 applications for home refinance loans in
2006. Approximately 57 percent of these applications were approved, while another 25 percent
were denied.

The same proportion of Seaside applicants were denied for home improvement loans as for
home purchase loans. Although 32 percent of applicants were denied, 58 percent of
applications for home improvement loans were approved by lending institutions in 2006. The
large proportion of home improvement loan denials may be explained by the nature of these
loans. Most applicants already maintain a mortgage loan and therefore have high debt-to-
income ratio to qualify for additional financing.

     boundaries are used to provide data for Seaside.

Foreclosures
With low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero down, interest only, adjustable loans),
and predatory lending practices (e.g. aggressive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization),
many households nationwide purchased homes that were beyond their financial means
between 2000 and 2006. Under the assumption that refinancing to lower interest rates would
always be an option and home prices would continue to rise sharply, many households were
unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed rates, and decline in
sales prices that set off in 2006. Suddenly faced with significantly inflated mortgage payments,
and mortgage loans that are larger than the worth of the homes, many had to resort to
foreclosing their homes.
With implosion of the mortgage lending
market, many households have difficulty
obtaining new mortgage loans or refinancing,
even for above moderate income households.
In Monterey County, 1,688 homeowners filed
Notices of Default (NODs) and 847 homes
were foreclosed upon in the second quarter of
2008. 8 DataQuick reports that approximately
46 percent of homeowners who go into
default are able to work out financial
arrangements to either keep their houses or
sell them and pay off their debts. 9
Between June 2008 and January 2009, Seaside
                                                                               A foreclosed home in Seaside
had 174 foreclosures, with 71 of these
foreclosures being resold. 10 However, on average a foreclosed property took 99 days to resale,
while some units took over 200 days to resale. Among the 174 foreclosed homes in Seaside,
more than 60 percent were detached single-family homes and another 25 percent were attached
homes such as units in planned developments.

B.      Governmental Constraints
Local policies and regulations can impact the price of housing and, in particular, affordable
housing. Local policies and regulations may include land use controls, site improvement
requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, and other issues. This section
discusses potential governmental constraints to housing investment as well as measures to
mitigate potential impacts.
1.      Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element of the Seaside General Plan sets forth policies for residential
development. These land use policies, coupled with zoning regulations, establish the amount
and distribution of land to be allocated for different uses. Housing supply and costs are
affected by the amount of land designated for residential use, the density at which residential
development is permitted, and the standards that govern the character of development. The
following land use designations allow residential development in Seaside:
       Low Density Single-Family Residential (RLS): This designation is applied to areas
        with existing or planned detached single-family residential units. The maximum
        density allowed on lands designated RLS is eight dwelling units per acre.
       Medium Density Single-Family Residential (RMS): This designation allows detached
        single-family units at densities of up to 12 dwelling units per acre and is applied
        primarily to neighborhoods located in the central core of the City that are already
        developed with this type of use.
       Medium Density Residential (RM): The Medium Density Residential designation
        provides for single-family attached and detached dwelling units, including duplexes,
        triplexes, and condominiums, at densities of up to 15 dwelling units per acre.
       High Density Residential (RH): This designation is applied in areas of the City with
        existing or planned multi-family residential units at a density of up to 25 dwelling units
        per acre. Dwellings may include apartments, townhomes, and condominiums. Mobile
        home parks, professional office, convalescent homes, and care facilities are also
        provided. In keeping with the City’s goal of not concentrating large developments of
        multi-family housing in one area, the RH designation is applied throughout the City.
       Mixed Use (MX): Seaside has developed a Mixed Use category as a way to promote
        pedestrian and transit-oriented activity centers that have a mixture of residential,
        commercial, office, and civic uses. The Mixed Use category is applied in areas that are
        conveniently located adjacent to existing population centers. This land use designation
        assumes Community Commercial type development on approximately 65 percent of the
        acreage, with high density multi-family units at a maximum of 25 dwelling units per
        acre on 35 percent of the acreage. Under this designation, residential and commercial
        uses may be developed on the same parcel (i.e., residential above commercial).
The General Plan Land Use Element is implemented by the Seaside Zoning Code. Table 31
summarizes the land use designations and zoning districts that either allow residential

2.       Inclusionary Housing Policy
The City of Seaside has adopted an inclusionary housing requirements in its Zoning Ordinance.
All residential development, including condominium conversions, are required to provide at
least 20 percent of their total units affordable to moderate, low or very low income households.
The number of inclusionary units required is determined at the tentative or parcel map stage or
at the issuance of a building permit, if a processing map is not required. At least one third of
the required inclusionary units must be restricted to low income households. An additional one
third inclusionary units must be restricted for very low income households and the remaining
third can be moderate income. In order to encourage the development of very and low income
housing the City Council has the authority to permit the following equivalants:
        Each very low income unit is equivalent to two moderate-income units
        Each low income unit is equivalent to 1.5 moderate income units.
Inclusionary units can be for sale or rental. For sale inclusionary units must be priced at an
affordable sale price with renewed restrictions upon each change of ownership up to the 30-
year affordability period. The maximum sale price for the resale of an inclusionary housing
units must be lower of either the fair market value or the seller’s lawful purchase price
increased by the lesser of the rate of increase of area median income during the seller’s
ownership or the rate at which the consumer price index increased during the seller’s
ownership. Sellers are able to recover the market value of capital improvements made to the
property.
Seaside General Plan                         HE App-40                                    August 2010

                                                            HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
The inclusionary housing policy is not a constraint on housing because it includes reasonable
exemptions and fosters the creation of affordable housing. Density bonus units are not
included when determining the number of required inclusionary units. Affordable housing
developments with units that are very low, low and moderate income restricted are exempt
from the ordinance, as is housing constructed by a government agency and second dwelling
units. The City of Seaside offers three alternatives to developers to satisfy inclusionary housing
requirements:
     1. Off Site Construction: Units can be constructed off site if the inclusionary units will be
        located in an area that the Council finds is in greater need of affordable housing.
     2. Land Dedication: In lieu of building inclusionary units, a developer can choose to
        dedicate land to the City suitable for the construction of inclusionary units that the
        Council determines to be of equivalent or greater value than is produced by applying
        the inclusionary obligation.
     3. Combination: The Council may accept any combination of on-site construction, off-site
        construction, in-lieu fees and land dedication that at least equal the cost of providing
        inclusionary units on-site construction. The value of a proposed land dedication will be
        determined by a City appointed appraiser.
The Council can approve, conditionally approve or reject any alternative proposed by a
developer. Any approval or conditional approval must be based on the finding that affordable
housing creation would be better served by a proposed alternative. When making a finding, the
Council must consider the following:
     1. Whether implementation of an alternative would overly concentrate inclusionary units
        within any specific area and, if so, must reject the alternative unless the undesirable
        concentration of inclusionary units is offset by other identified benefits that flow from
        implementation of the alternative is issue; and
     2. The extent to which other factors affect the feasibility of prompt construction of the
        inclusionary units on the property, such as costs and delays, the need for an appraisal,
        site design, zoning, infrastructure, clear title, grading and environmental review.
A developer can also apply for an adjustment or waiver of of inclusionary housing
requirements which the Council determines. To receive an adjustment or waiver, the developer
must make a showing when they are applying for a first approval for the residential
development and/or as part of any appeal that the City provides as part of the process for the
first approval. In determining whether a developer is eligible for an adjustment the Council
assumes the following:
     1. That the developer is subject to the inclusionary housing requirement or in-lieu fee;
     2. The extent to which the developer will benefit from inclusionary incentives;
Seaside General Plan                       HE App-41                                    August 2010
HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
    3. That the developer will be obligated to provide the most economical inclusionary units
         feasible in terms of construction, design, location and tenure; and
    4. That the developer is likely to obtain other housing subsidies where such funds are
         reasonably available.
Inclusionary housing is not a constraint on housing development in Seaside due to the low
market-rate cost of housing in the City. A development scenario that is currently being
proposed for 640 Francis Avenue in Seaside demonstrates that affordable housing created by
the inclusionary housing policy is similar in price to market-rate units (Error! Reference source
not found.). This project is currently entitled and has received occupancy permits. It is the
conversion of a mixed use building to multi-family.
Based on the development scenario, a moderate income restricted unit will generate more rental
income than a market rate unit as shown in Error! Reference source not found., offsetting a
portion of the subsidies for the low income units. A moderate income household can affordable
to pay between $1,363 to $2,100 (see Table 17). The rent for a market rate unit as well as the
designated moderate-income units are both affordable to moderate income households.

3.       Residential Development Standards
Seaside regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
through the Zoning Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of residents, implement the policies of the City’s General Plan, and
preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods. Table 33 summarizes the most pertinent
residential development standards in Seaside.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Lot Standards
The minimum lot sizes for residential lots in Seaside range from 3,750 square feet to 5,500
square feet. The RS-12, RM, and RH zones allow small lots of 3,750 square feet for single-family
as well as high density residential units. The commercial mixed use zones (CD, CMX and CC)
allow a minimum lot size of 4,000 square feet. The largest minimum lot size of 5,500 square feet
is only required in the RS zone. Lot widths are 40 feet in the RS and Commercial zones, and are
50 feet in the medium and high density residential zones. These minimum lot size standards
are typical and cover the majority of the City and do not constrain residential development.
Residential Density
The lowest housing unit density maximum in Seaside is set at eight units per acre in the RS
zones. The medium density zone (RM) has a maximum density of 15 units per acre and the
maximum residential density in the City is 25 units per acre in the remaining residential zones.
A maximum residential density of 25 units per acre is allowed in the Downtown Commercial
(CD), Commercial Mixed Use (CMX), and Community Commercial (CC) Zoning Districts only
on second floors as part of a mixed use project. Residential uses are not permitted in all other
commercial zones. Seaside is a small residential community that allows for moderately high
density development.
Lot Coverage
The Zoning Code establishes a maximum lot coverage of 65 percent for the RS and RM zones
and 60 percent for the RH zone. Commercial zones where residential uses are allowed set a
maximum lot coverage of 90 percent for residential and residential mixed-use developments.
The City’s lot coverage standards are typical, and the larger the lot, the more feasible to achieve
the maximum allowable density.
Yard Setbacks
Commercial mixed use zones in Seaside have no setback requirements. All residential zones
have a 15-foot front setback, 10- to 15-foot side setbacks, and 15- to 20-foot rear setbacks. These
setbacks are intended to create a safe and visually cohesive aesthetic to residential development
throughout the City.
Height Limits
Seaside allows height limits of up to 24 feet in low density residential zones, which allows up to
two stories with review approval. Multi-family units can be as high as 36 and 48 feet in the
medium and high density residential zones, respectively. Commercial zones where residential
uses are permitted can accommodate buildings up to 48 feet. These height limits can
accommodate three- to four-story buildings, allowing the achievement of maximum permitted
densities.
Parking Standards
In addition to the development standards identified above, Seaside requires a certain number of
parking spaces to be provided for each new residential unit. The requirements are identified in
Table 34. Typically, the cost associated with parking construction (particularly covered
parking) can be viewed as a constraint to affordable housing development, particularly for
multi-family housing. Seaside’s parking requirements are designed to accommodate vehicle
ownership rates associated with different residential uses. The City also offers reduced parking

                                                                   HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
requirements for senior housing. Overall, the City’s parking standards for multi-family and
senior housing developments are comparable to parking standards established by the State
density bonus law for affordable housing projects.

4.       Flexibility from Development Standards
Seaside provides several mechanisms to maintain flexibility in development standards. This
flexibility is an important means to address limitations inherent at a specific site (e.g.,
topographic, geographic, physical, or otherwise), as well as provide a means to address other
important goals and objectives of the City Council, such as providing affordable housing for all
income groups.
Planned Development Permit
The Planned Development Permit is intended to provide for flexibility in the application of
Zoning Code standards to proposed development under limited and unique circumstances. The
purpose is to allow consideration of innovation in site planning and other aspects of project
design, and more effective design responses to site features, uses on adjoining properties, and
environmental impacts than the Zoning Code standards would produce without adjustment.
Density Bonus Ordinance
A density bonus up to 35 percent over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density
under the applicable zoning district is available to developers who provide affordable housing
as part of their projects. State law also entitles developers of eligible affordable and senior
housing to at least one regulatory concession or incentive. Density bonuses, together with the
incentives and/or concessions, result in a lower average cost of land per dwelling unit thereby
making the provision of affordable housing more feasible.
Mixed-Use District
The mixed-use district permits residential development in conjunction with certain office
and/or commercial uses within potential pedestrian- and transit-oriented activity centers. It
Seaside General Plan                               HE App-45                                         August 2010

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
has been used successfully to combine apartments with retail and offices along major
thoroughfares and is a return to the mixed land use of older downtown areas. The General Plan
provides for approximately 37 acres of mixed use development in the downtown area and 89
contiguous acres in North Seaside near the CSUMB campus.
Design Flexibility of Substandard Lots
This option provides relief from established zoning requirements for single family units on
substandard lots. The standards allow exceptions to setback requirements in exchange for
architectural design features to enhance the development and maximize use of remaining open
space on the property. This provision of the Zoning Code has been used on several occasions to
foster development on lots which otherwise could not be developed.
In summary, the City of Seaside provides design
flexibility in its zoning ordinance to facilitate and
encourage infill development and housing
opportunities in single-family, multi-family, and
commercial zones. These incentives can be used
to mitigate any potential impact of residential
development standards on the cost and
affordability of housing. As later illustrated in
the three conceptual site plans, development
standards in the City can facilitate a variety of
housing types and densities, including family
apartments,          senior    apartments,        and
                                                                 An example of infill housing in Seaside
townhomes/condominiums.
5.       Coastal Zone
Pursuant to State law, a jurisdiction must maintain records of affordable housing in the Coastal
Zone. Specifically, demolition of housing units previously occupied by low and moderate
income households must be replaced. However, several exceptions apply:
        The conversion or demolition of a residential structure that contains fewer than three
         dwelling units, or, in the event that a proposed conversion or demolition involves more
         than one residential structure, the conversion or demolition of 10 or fewer dwelling
         units.
        The conversion or demolition of a residential structure for purposes of a nonresidential
         use which is either "coastal dependent" or "coastal related" uses such as visitor-serving
         commercial or recreational facilities, coastal-dependent industry, or boating or harbor
         facilities.
        The conversion or demolition of a residential structure located within the jurisdiction
         that has less than 50 acres of vacant, privately owned land available for residential use
         within the coastal zone or three miles from the coastal zone.
Seaside General Plan                         HE App-46                                      August 2010

                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure located within the jurisdiction,
        where a procedure has been established to allow an applicant for conversion or
        demolition to pay an in-lieu fee for affordable housing development.
Although a portion of Seaside is located in the Coastal Zone, privately held vacant lands do not
total more than 50 acres. Furthermore, most demolition activities that had occurred involved
structures of fewer than three units.
The Del Monte Subarea encompasses roughly nine acres of urban area along Del Monte
Boulevard from its intersection with Canyon Del Rey (Highway 218) to its intersection with
West Broadway Avenue to the northeast. Roberts Lake and Laguna Grande Subareas are to
the southwest, and the Beach Subarea is to the northeast on the opposite side of Highway 1 and
the Monterey Bay Coastal Recreational Trail.
The Del Monte Subarea includes the Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way, which is to become
the future location of a multimodal transit hub. In 2008, the West Broadway Urban Village
(WBUV) Specific Plan was prepared which includes the Del Monte Subarea. The goal of the
Specific Plan is to revitalize and enhance the Del Monte Boulevard and West Broadway Avenue
urban area through creation of a pedestrian-friendly Urban Village. The
Specific Plan envisions the Del Monte Boulevard Subarea to be an active mixed-use commercial
corridor that promotes connectivity and provides supporting uses to the future multimodal
transit station and the existing and planned hotels on Canyon Del Rey Boulevard. The Del
Monte Subarea current land uses include commercial and light industrial uses.
Projects proposed within the Coastal Zone are required to obtain Coastal Development Permit
approval from the California Coastal Commission in addition to a planning permit. When
required, a Coastal Development Permit application shall be submitted to the Coastal
Commission after the required City planning permit has been approved.
6.      Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and implement development standards to encourage and facilitate
the development of housing for all economic segments of the community. This includes single-
family homes, multi-family housing, secondary dwelling units, manufactured housing, mobile
homes, transitional housing, farm worker housing, and emergency shelters.
Seaside provides for a wide range of housing types throughout the community. Table 35
summarizes the housing types permitted in each of the City’s primary residential zones. Each
residential use is designated by a letter denoting whether the use is permitted by right (P),
requires a minor use permit (MUP), use permit (UP), or is not permitted (--).

Single-family Units
Single-family homes are permitted in the RS, RM and RH zones. The RS (Single-Family
Residential) zone is applied to areas of the City that are appropriate for neighborhoods of
detached single-family dwellings, surrounding the more densely developed core of the City.
The RM (Medium Density Residential) Zone is applied to areas of the City that are appropriate
for neighborhoods with a variety of housing types including attached and detached single-
family dwellings, duplexes and triplexes and some condominiums. The RH zone (High Density
Residential) is applied to areas of the City that are appropriate for a mixture of multi-family
housing, including apartments, townhomes and condominiums and personal offices,
convalescent homes and care facilities.
The Seaside Zoning Code defines single-dwelling as a building designed for and/or occupied
exclusively by one family. Attached single-family dwellings include condominiums and
rowhouses. Attached single-family dwellings are only permitted with a Use Permit in the same
zones. Affordable attached single-family dwellings also require a Use Permit, but are only
permitted in the RS and RM zones. Requiring the approval of a Use Permit for affordable
attached single-family homes in RS and RM zones while market-rate units are permitted via a
Use Permit in all residential zones may be interpreted as a potential constraint to affordable
housing development. The City will amend the Zoning Code to have consistent provisions for
market-rate and affordable attached single-family homes.
Multi-family Units
Multi-family units are dwellings that are part of a structure containing one or more other
dwelling units, or a non-residential use. An example of the latter is a mixed-use project where,
for example, one or more dwelling units are part of a structure that also contains one or more
commercial uses (retail, office, etc.). Multi-family dwellings include: duplexes, triplexes,
fourplexes (buildings under one ownership with two, three or four dwelling units, respectively,
Seaside General Plan                          HE App-48                              August 2010

in the same structure); apartments (five or more units under one ownership in a single
building); and townhouse development (three
or more attached dwellings where no unit is
located over another unit), and other building
types containing multiple dwelling units (for
example, courtyard housing, rowhouses,
stacked flats, etc.).
As of January 2008, multi-family housing units
constituted approximately 20 percent of
Seaside’s housing stock. The Zoning Ordinance
provides for multi-family developments by-
right in the RM and RH zones at 15 and 25 units                     A typical duplex structure in Seaside
per acre, respectively.
Mixed Use
Mixed Use projects combine both commercial and residential uses, where the residential
component is typically located above the commercial use. Mixed use development is
conditionally permitted in the CD, CMX and CC zones. Mixed use projects require approval of
a Minor Use Permit by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission in the CD and CMX
districts, whereas these developments require approval a Use Permit by the Planning
Commission in the CC zone.
Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities include a single-dwelling or multi-unit facility licensed or supervised
by a Federal, State, or local health/welfare agency, which provides 24-hour nonmedical care of
unrelated persons who are disabled and in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance
essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual in a
family-like environment.
Small residential care facilities are permitted by right in the RS, RM and RH zones and large
residential care facilities are permitted via a Use Permit in the RS, RM, RH, and CC zones. In
order to obtain a Use Permit the following must be found by the Planning Commission:
       The design, location, size and operating characteristics of the proposed activity are
        compatible with the existing and planned future land uses in the vicinity.
       The site is physically suitable for the type, density and intensity of use being proposed,
        including access, utilities and the absence of physical constraints; and
       Granting the permit would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety,
        convenience or welfare or materially injurious to persons, property or improvements in
        the vicinity and zone district in which the property is located.
The Commission can also impose reasonable conditions to ensure that the applicant will comply
with all findings.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Residential Second Units
A “Residential Second Unit” (also known as a granny flat) is a second permanent dwelling that
is accessory to a primary dwelling on the same site. As defined by the Seaside Zoning Code, a
second unit or carriage house provides complete, independent living facilities for one or more
persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, sanitation, and
parking, and if attached to the primary dwelling, is provided exterior access separate from the
primary dwelling. This definition includes guest houses. Second units may be an alternative
source of affordable housing for lower income households and seniors.
California law requires that local jurisdictions adopt ordinances to establish the conditions
under which second dwelling units are permitted by right (Government Code, Section 65852.2).
A jurisdiction cannot adopt an ordinance that precludes the development of second units unless
findings are made acknowledging that allowing second units may limit housing opportunities
of the region and result in adverse impacts on public health, safety, and welfare.
The City adopted a second unit ordinance in 2006 to allow Residential Second Units in the RS,
RM, and RH districts with a ministerial permit. The Building Division of the Community
Development Department issues a building permit for a second unit if all building permit
submittal requirements are met, and if it conforms to the performance standards contained in
Section 17.42.190 of the Zoning Code.
Manufactured Housing
Pursuant to State law, manufactured housing placed on a permanent foundation is permitted in
all residential zones. Such housing is subject to the same development standards and design
review criteria as stick-built housing as set forth by the zoning district. Manufactured housing
is permitted in the single-family residential district when all development standards of section
17.42.130 are met. These include design, aesthetic and construction standards.
Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing
The term “Emergency Shelter” means a facility for the temporary shelter and feeding of
indigents or disaster victims, operated by a public or non-profit agency. Transitional housing
units or facilities provide a residence for homeless individuals or families for an extended
period of time, usually six months or longer, which also offers other social services and
counseling to assist residents in achieving self-sufficiency. Transitional housing may be
accessory to a public or civic type use.
Emergency shelters and transitional housing are permitted in Seaside according to the
conditions in section 17.42.090 of the Zoning Code. The emergency shelter ordinance creates
Category 1 and Category 2 shelters. Category 1 shelters are for families and single women with
children and are permitted in the R1 and R2 zones. Category 2 shelters are for single men and
single women and may be permitted in the R3 zone. The ordinance also provides flexibility in
allowing temporary emergency shelters for the homeless in other zones based on applicable
criteria and commission approval.
Pursuant to recent changes to State law (SB 2), the current emergency shelter/transitional
housing ordinance must be amended to remove the Use Permit procedure. SB 2 requires that
local jurisdictions make provisions in the zoning code to permit emergency shelters by right in

shelter. Local jurisdictions may, however, establish standards for the following to regulate the
development of emergency shelters:
        The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be served nightly;
        Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to exceed parking requirements
         for other residential or commercial uses in the same zone;
        The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and client intake areas;
        The provision of onsite management;
        The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that emergency shelters are not
         required to be more than 300 feet apart;
        The length of stay;
        Lighting; and
        Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
The City will amend the Zoning Code to permit emergency shelters by right in the CC
(Community Commercial) zone. Properties in this zone are located along the City’s major
transportation corridors and therefore have easy access to public transportation. As shown in
the Housing Resources section of this Technical Appendix, vacant and underutilized CC
properties total approximately eight acres, adequate to accommodate at least one emergency
shelters.
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50675.2) defines “transitional housing” and
“transitional housing development” as buildings configured as rental housing developments,
but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and
recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined
future point in time, which shall be no less than six months. Pursuant to SB 2, transitional
housing that is configured as rental housing developments should be permitted by right where
rental housing is permitted.
However, the State definition of transitional housing does not encompass the various types of
such housing facilities. Transitional housing can be regular rental housing developments but
may also be configured as group quarters. Therefore the Seaside Zoning Code will be
amended. Small transitional housing facilities serving six or fewer residents will be permitted
by-right in all residential zones. Large transitional housing facilities serving seven or more
persons that also function like regular rental housing will be permitted by-right in zones where
regular housing is permitted. A use permit will be required for large transitional housing
facilities serving seven or more persons that function like group quarters.
Criteria that would be used to review UP applications for large transitional housing facilities
that function like group care facilities pertain to performance standards and will not be specific
to the proposed use. Potential conditions for approval of these facilities may include hours of
operation, security, loading requirements, and management. Conditions would be similar to
those for other similar uses in the same zones and would not serve to constrain the
development of such facilities. The required findings for approval of a UP are stated in Section
17.50.070 of the Zoning Code and will be the same as described above for residential care
homes.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Supportive Housing
New State law (AB 2634 – Housing for Extremely Low Income Households) requires local
jurisdictions to address the provisions for supportive housing. California Health and Safety
Code (Section 50675.2) defines “supportive housing” as housing with no limit on length of stay,
that is occupied by the low-income adults with disabilities, and that is linked to onsite or offsite
services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or
her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
community.
Currently, the Zoning Code does not address supportive housing. To facilitate and encourage
the provision of supportive housing in Seaside, the Zone Code will be amended to define and
identify zones that permit or conditionally permit supportive housing consistent with AB 2634.
Small supportive housing facilities serving six or fewer residents will be permitted by-right in
all residential zones. Large supportive housing facilities serving seven or more persons that
also function like regular rental housing will be permitted by-right in zones where regular
housing is permitted. A use permit will be required for large supportive housing facilities
serving seven or more persons that function like group quarters.
Criteria that would be used to review UP applications for large supportive housing facilities
that function like group care facilities pertain to performance standards and will not be specific
to the proposed use. Potential conditions for approval of these facilities may include hours of
operation, security, loading requirements, and management. Conditions would be similar to
those for other similar uses in the same zones and would not serve to constrain the
development of such facilities. The required findings for approval of a UP are stated in Section
17.50.070 of the Zoning Code and will be the same as described above for residential care
homes.
Single Room Occupancy Units
AB 2634 mandates local jurisdictions address the provision of housing options for extremely
low income households, including Single Room Occupancy units (SRO). SRO units are one-
room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. It is distinct from a studio or
efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen and bathroom.
Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many SROs have one or
the other. Currently, the Zoning Ordinance does not expressly address SROs. The Zone Code
will be amended to facilitate and encourage the provision of SROs.
SROs will be conditionally permitted in the RH zone. Criteria that would be used to review Use
Permit (UP) applications for SROs pertain to performance standards and will not be specific to
the proposed use. Potential conditions for approval of these facilities may include hours of
operation, security, loading requirements, and management. Conditions would be similar to those
for other similar uses in the same zones and would not serve to constrain the development of such
facilities. The required findings for approval of a UP are stated in Section 17.50.070 of the Zone
Code and will be the same as described above for residential care homes.
Seaside General Plan                       HE App-52                                   August 2010

                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
7.      Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Housing options for persons with disabilities are often limited. The Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) came into effect in 1990. Multi-family housing built prior to 1990 does not typically
include accessible units on the ground floor. With limited multi-family construction between
1990 and 2008, few rental housing units in Seaside are accessible. ADA does not cover single-
family homes. Rehabilitation to accommodate the accessibility needs of disabled residents is
needed, particularly to the older housing stock. Therefore, it is important that City’s codes,
policies and regulations are free of undue constraints to encourage rehabilitation of the existing
housing stock and to comply with ADA requirements.
Land Use Controls
Small family homes, foster family homes, and adult day care and adult residential facilities
providing care to six or fewer adults are permitted by right in the RS, RM and RH zones.
Residential care facilities for seven or more people and adult day cares are also permitted with a
Use Permit in the RS, RM, RH, and CC zones. The City has not adopted any spacing or
concentration requirements for residential care facilities.
According to the State Department of Social Services, several residential care facilities are
located in Seaside:
       Adult Residential Care: Two facilities totaling 25 beds
       Residential Care for the Elderly: One facility with 40 beds
This Housing Element update includes a program to amend the Zoning Ordinance to address
provisions for emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and SRO units.
The City will not adopt a spacing or concentration requirement for these facilities. These
amendments will expand housing opportunities for persons with disabilities.
Approval Procedures
Small residential care facilities are permitted by right in residential zones and large residential
care facilities are permitted via a Use Permit in the RS, RM, RH, and CC zones. In order to
obtain a Use Permit the Planning Commission must determine that the development standards
of the building are suitable to the zone and that the use is not detrimental to the community, as
discussed above. The procedures do not apply to the status as “disabled” housing and apply to
similar housing that is not intended for persons with disabilities. Approval procedures for
small residential care facilities are no different from traditional residential uses, such as single-
or multi-family.
Transitional and supportive housing will be approved based on the type of housing they are
(either residential or group quarters) as described above, with no regard to the population they
serve.
Definition of Family
Local governments may restrict access to housing for households failing to qualify as “family”
by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, a restrictive definition of
“family” that limits the number of and differentiates between related and unrelated individuals
living together may illegally limit the development and siting of group homes for persons with
Seaside General Plan                        HE App-53                                    August 2010

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
disabilities but not for housing families that are similarly sized or situated. 11 Seaside’s Zoning
Ordinance does not define family.
Reasonable Accommodations Procedure
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act direct
local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or exceptions) in
their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary
to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it
may be a reasonable accommodation to waive a setback requirement so that a paved path of
travel can be provided to residents who have mobility impairments. Another example would
be to waive the maximum lot coverage requirement may be a reasonable accommodation to
allow a disabled person to create a bedroom on the ground floor.
The City of Seaside currently includes a reasonable accommodation for disabled persons as a
cause for a variance. The procedure requires applications to include the current use of the
property in question, a description of the accommodation required and the basis for the claim
that the applicant is considered disabled, a detailed explanation of why the accommodation is
reasonable and necessary to afford the applicant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
dwelling in the City.
This procedure of requiring a variance is considered potentially constraining to housing for
persons with disabilities. As the public hearing process adds time and costs to the disabled
applicants. The City will amend the reasonable accommodation procedure to provide flexibility
in the application of planning and development regulations for disabled residents via an
administrative procedure.
Building Codes
The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that regulates the access and
adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. Government Code Section
12955.1 requires that 10 percent of the total dwelling units in multifamily buildings without
elevators consisting of three or more rental units or four or more condominium units are subject
to the following building standards for persons with disabilities:
      The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless exempted by
       site impracticality tests.
      At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level served
       by an accessible route.
      All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an accessible
       route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to this chapter
       may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms, living rooms,
       bedrooms, or hallways.
11   California courts (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.) have
     ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons related by
     blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of unrelated persons as a single
     housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a manner that distinguishes between
     blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any legitimate or useful objective or purpose
     recognized under the zoning and land use planning powers of a municipality and therefore violated rights of
     privacy under the California Constitution.
Seaside General Plan                               HE App-54                                           August 2010

                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
     Common use areas shall be accessible.
     If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking spaces is required.
No unique Building Code restrictions are in place that would constrain the development of
housing for persons with disabilities. Compliance with provisions of the City’s Municipal
Code, California Code of Regulations, California Building Standards Code, and federal
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is assessed and enforced by the Building and Safety
Department as a part of the building permit submittal.
Conclusion
The Zoning Code will be amended to address emergency shelters, transitional housing,
supportive housing, and SRO housing. The City will also amend the Zoning Code to process
reasonable accommodation requests via an administrative procedure. In addition, the Zoning
Code will be amended to address the provision of SRO housing in compliance with State law.
With these revisions, no policy or regulation of the City of Seaside serves to constrain housing
for persons with disabilities.
8.       Development Permit Procedures and Processing Times
The evaluation and review process required by local jurisdictions often contributes to the cost of
housing in that holding costs incurred by developers are ultimately manifested in the unit’s
selling price. Seaside’s development approval process is designed to further housing
development. Together, the following figures and Table 36 and Table 37 show the type of
approvals required for the most common types of residential development as well as the
reviewing bodies.
Single-family detached units, both market rate and affordable, are permitted by right in
residential zones and only require an architectural review if the buildings are taller than 18 feet
or meets any of the requirements listed in the discussion of the architectural review process
below. Single-family attached housing requires a use permit however, affordable single-family
attached housing is not permitted in the RH zone. Requiring a use permit for attached single-
family development in a the lower density residential zones and not permitted affordable
single-family attached housing in the RH zone while permitting market rate single-family
attached housing may be considered a constraint. The City will amend the Zoning Code to
have consistent provisions for market-rate and affordable attached single-family homes.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
The Planning Department has established a time table for processing applications consistent
with Permit Streamlining Act. Review of the application for completeness is made within one
week and the applicant is notified of any missing elements of the application. If the project is
not categorically exempt and requires an initial study, the study is completed and posted with
the County recorder within one week of submittal in order to meet the required review period.
Simple projects are processed through the Board of Architectural Review and if needed, posted
for public hearing, and considered by the Planning Commission within six weeks. If the
application requires City Council approval (zoning amendment, General Plan amendment, or
an appeal) the application is usually placed on the next possible City Council Agenda.

A typical single-family development can be processed between 35 and 90 days when an
application is deemed complete. A typical multi-family project can be processed within 90 days
from the date the application is deemed complete. The City works to expedite project review
and approval.
Use Permits
The Seaside Zoning Code specifies that the purpose of a use permit is to ensure the proper
integration of uses which, because of their special nature, may be suitable only in certain
locations; and provided such uses are arranged or operated in a particular manner.
The Use Permit and Minor Use Permit are for the discretionary review of uses and activities that
may be appropriate in an applicable zone, but whose effects on a site and surroundings cannot
be determined before being proposed for a specific site. Minor Use Permit approval may be
considered only for a project that is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA). A Use Permit is reviewed by the Planning Commission, whereas a Minor Use Permit
is reviewed by the Zoning Administrator. Findings and decisions are based on the following
criteria:
        The proposed use is allowed within the applicable zone and complies with all other
         applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and the Municipal Code;
        The proposed use is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan;
Seaside General Plan                         HE App-58                                August 2010

                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
       The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed activity are
        compatible with the existing and planned future land uses in the vicinity;
       The site is physically suitable for the type, density and intensity of use being proposed,
        including access, utilities, and the absence of physical constraints; and
       Granting the permit would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety,
        convenience, or welfare, or materially injurious to persons, property, or improvements
        in the vicinity and zone district in which the property is located.
A Use Permit is typically processed within eight weeks for approval by the Planning
Commission and ten weeks if City Council approval is also required. City Council approval is
generally only required upon appeal. A public hearing for a Minor Use Permit will be held only
if requested by any interested person. These processing times do not add substantial time or
cost to the processing of a project and are not considered a constraint to development.
Variances
Variance and Minor Variance permit alterations of development standards as they apply to
particular uses when practical difficulties develop from the strict interpretation and
enforcement of zoning codes. A variance may be granted, or variances may be required in
particular cases for building setbacks, height, bulk and density, parking, landscaping, walls and
fencing and business operation. Variances may not be granted for land uses, residential
density, specific prohibitions (such as prohibited signs and procedural requirements), or other
economic considerations.
A Variance is reviewed by the Planning Commission and a Minor Variance is reviewed by the
Zoning Administrator. A Minor Variance applies to relief from the Zoning Ordinance for the
following requirements up to a maximum reduction of 10 percent:
       Distance between structures;
       Parcel dimensions (not area);
       Setbacks;
       Structure height; or
       On-site parking, loading, and landscaping.
A public hearing is required for a Variance and required if requested for a Minor Variance. A
Variance can take approximately two months to process. Findings and decisions are based on:
       There are special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape,
        topography, location, or surroundings, so that the strict application of the Zoning
        Ordinance deprives the property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity
        and within the same zone;
       The approval of the Variance or Minor Variance includes conditions of approval as
        necessary to ensure that the adjustment granted does not constitute a grant of special
        privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and
        within the same zone; and

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
        The Variance or Minor Variance is consistent with the General Plan, and any applicable

Architectural Review
Architectural review is intended to improve the aesthetic appearance of open spaces and
structures, especially those visible from the public rights-of-way, and to establish design
standards and policies promoting and enhancing good design. Architectural review is requires
for the following projects:
        Landscape plans for new residential and commercial development, additions of greater
         than fifty percent of the existing floor area for residential dwellings, additions and/or
         interior remodels to commercial building requiring site plan review approval;
        New, expanded, or substantially converted residential structures on substandard lots;
        New single-family dwellings with a height greater than eighteen feet, additions greater
         than eighteen feet in height to existing dwellings, subdivision resulting in two or more
         dwellings and two-, three- and multi-family structures;
        New mixed use projects;
        Publicly financed projects administered by the City;
        Signs posted within the City that are not professionally rendered or in strict compliance
         with Chapter 17.36 or a master sign program approved by the BAR, provided that each
         sign approved by the BAR shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 17.36; and
        Satellite dish antennas greater than one meter in diameter.
Architectural reviews are conducted by the Board of Architectural Review (BAR) and are
conducted after all other commission and council approvals are in place. The BAR considers all
aspects of architecture, landscape and lighting and may impose conditions of approval. The
process ensures that the architectural review is focused on the aesthetics of the project.
Specifically, the Zoning Ordinance identifies three aspects of review:
        Architectural considerations including the character, quality, and scale of the design,
         architectural relationship with the site and other structures, building materials, colors,
         fencing, trash enclosure and walkway improvements, exterior lighting and signs, and
         the screening of exterior appurtenances.
        Landscape considerations, including the color, coverage, location, size, texture, and type
         of plant materials, provisions for irrigation, maintenance, and the protection of
         landscaped areas, and similar elements.
        Light considerations, including the proposed placement of fixtures, type of fixtures, and
         illumination levels.
In making its decisions, the BAR can impose conditions it deems reasonable and necessary to
protect the best interests of the surrounding areas, as well as to further the public health, safety
and general welfare of the community. The BAR can adopt, by resolution, subject to
ratification by the Planning Commission, measures to streamline the review and approval of
minor changes.

                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
The City of Seaside provides a Single-Family Residential Design Guidelines document on its
website. The purpose of the document is to assist staff, the public and decision-makers through
the architectural review process by clearly defining the City’s expectations for design quality,
use of materials and architectural imagery. These Design Guidelines are also used by the BAR
in the case of formal architectural review as their guidelines for approving a single-family
project. The guidelines are designed to reinforce policies set out in the General Plan including
improving they physical appearance of residential neighborhoods and protecting the character
of single-family neighborhoods by restricting out-of-scale buildings, incompatible uses and
designs, blocked views and/or access to sunlight and excessive through traffic. The Design
Guidelines are summarized below:
    1. Site Planning
           a. Front Yard Coverage, Landscape and Hardscape
           - Enhance neighborhood character by enhancing the minimized paved surfaces in
                front yards and maintain landscaped areas.
           - Encourage drought-tolerant and low water usage plants artfully installed.
           b. Garage Placement
           - Street frontages dominated by front-loaded garages are detrimental to the sense
                of a people-friendly and pedestrian-oriented neighborhood.
           - Side-accessed, alley-accessed and detached rear garages are encouraged to
                diminish the visual impact of the garage along street frontages.
           c. Driveways
           - Provide adequate space between driveways (at least 18 inches) and minimize
                visual impact.
           - One curb cut per residential lot and encourage the use of alternative materials.
           d. Walls, Fences and Screening
           - Walls and fences should be designed in such a manner as to create an attractive
                appearance to the street and to compliment the style and character of the homes
                and the neighborhood.
           - Solid walls over 36 inches in height are strongly discouraged.
    2. Mass and Scale
           - Physical size and mass of building should be proportional to lot size.
           - Overall design should be compatible with scale and mass of surrounding
                properties.
           - Architectural elements should be designed to eliminate box-like appearances.
           - Scale and mass of new infill development should be reduced by stepping down
                building height toward street and adjacent smaller structures.
           a. Building Heights and Second Story Decks
           - Entries and massing of stories should be proportion to building façade.
           b. Second Story Setbacks
           - The second story setback should average five feet more than the first floor
                setback
    3. Architectural Features – designed to encourage high quality design to enhance the
        character of residential neighborhoods.
           a. General – so specific style is required but the focus is on compatibility with
                surrounding homes and styles.
           - Building should be consistently one style rather than a mix of styles.
           b. Front Porches and Entries
Seaside General Plan                      HE App-61                                  August 2010

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
            -   Front porches, back porches and/or decks that permit casual observation of
                alleys and streets, are encouraged.
            c. Roof Articulation
            - The use of traditional roof forms such as gables, hips and dormers are
                encouraged.
            - Avoid box-like appearance through variation in the roofline and building
                elevations.
            d. Materials
            - Consistent and harmonious use of high quality, durable materials is encouraged.
            - Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material is discouraged.
The City does not have specific multi-family design guidelines and generally applies the single-
family design guidelines to multi-family development. These guidelines encourage the use of
design, materials, or placement that are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. They
do not necessarily result in increases in construction costs. Since the guidelines are only
generally applied to multi-family development, they do not constrain the development of
affordable housing.
Planned Development Permit
A Planned Development permit is intended to provide for flexibility in zoning ordinance
standards to proposed developments under limited and unique circumstances. A Planned
Development permit allows for innovation in site planning and other aspects of project design.
The City expects each planned development project to be of obvious, significantly higher
quality than would be achieved through conventional design practices and standards. Planned
Development permits are only accepted for sites larger than one acre and the project must also
be approved before the grading or building permits are issued.
A Planned Development must meet certain standards:
       Infrastructure Requirements: Proposal shall not be approved unless adequate sewer
        and water lines and streets already service the site, or the developer proposes to install
        the facilities at the developer's expense.
       Street Design: The street system in a Planned Development shall conform to the existing
        topography rather than cut through it, to minimize cut-and-fill grading activities. A
        planned development of five or more acres shall be designed and constructed with
        direct access to at least one major thoroughfare.
       Preservation of Community Assets and Landmarks: Historic places, groves, scenic
        points, trees, waterways, and other community assets and landmarks within the project
        site shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
       Open Space: A residential Planned Development project of three acres or more shall be
        designed to either provide a minimum of 10 percent of the total area in one centrally
        located usable open space area, or dedicate 10 percent of the total area of the site to the
        City.
Seaside General Plan                         HE App-62                                August 2010

                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
       Screening Buffer: A Planned Development project proposed to be of higher density or
        different character than an existing abutting single-family residential neighborhood shall
        be designed and constructed to provide an appropriate screening buffer between the
        proposed development and the abutting residential neighborhood.
The timeframe for processing a Planned Development varies depending on the complexity and
level of CEQA review required.
9.      Planning and Development Fees
Planning Fees
Housing construction imposes certain short- and long-term costs upon local government, such
as the cost of providing planning services and inspections. In addition, long-term costs related
to the maintenance and improvement of the community’s infrastructure, facilities, parks, and
streets are also imposed. Proposition 13 has severely constrained the amount of property tax
revenue that a city in California receives. As a result, Seaside charges various planning and
development fees to recoup costs and ensure that essential services and infrastructure are
available when needed. Planning fees for the City of Seaside and neighboring jurisdictions are
summarized in Table 38. As shown, fees charged by Seaside are generally lower than
comparable sized communities such as Monterey and Santa Cruz.

Planning and processing fees charged for typical residential projects are shown in Table 39. On
a per-unit basis, planning and processing fees amount to approximately $877 per multi-family
unit and $2,639 per single-family unit. Given that the City’s fees are comparable to fees charged
by jurisdictions of similar size and the per-unit average fee for multi-family projects is less than
the per unit fee for single-family projects, Seaside’s permit processing fees are not an undue
constraint.

Development Fees
The City of Seaside does not charge any development impact fees on new residential
development. While the school district, the water management district, and the regional
sewage collection and treatment agency charge fees for new development , the City has no
discretionary review authority over these fees or thes agencies. Table 40 summarizes the
development fees charged by other agencies. As shown, reduced water and sewer fees are
available for affordable housing units.
New development within the jurisdiction of the Fort Ord Reuse Authority (which includes
lands located in the cities of Seaside and Marina, and unincorporated Monterey County) is
assessed impact fees established and collected by the Reuse Authority. These fees amount to
$43,440 per dwelling unit and are collected directly by the Reuse Authority.

Although the cost of impact fees may constrain residential development, these fees are
necessary for public entities to recoup the cost of service delivery and these fees are imposed by
other agencies not within the City’s control. Furthermore, other jurisdictions served by these
agencies are also charged comparable fees.

Conclusion
Overall planning and processing fees charged by the City and impact fees charged by other
public/quasi-public agencies amount to less than ten percent of the total development costs, a
moderate level when compared to most jurisdictions in the region. Therefore, the planning and
development impact fees are not an undue constraint.
10.      On- and Off-Site Improvements
Another factor adding to the cost of new construction is the provision of adequate infrastructure
to support municipal services for new resident development.                             In many cases, these
improvements are dedicated to the City, which is then responsible for their maintenance. The
cost of these facilities is borne by developers, added to the cost of new housing units, and
eventually passed in various degrees to the homebuyer or property owner. Because areas

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
where new development and redevelopment will occur are largely developed with
infrastructure in place, the City does not assess major infrastructure buy-in fees.
On- and off-site infrastructure improvements/requirements are assessed based on the merits of
each project during discretionary project review, and for larger projects may be determined
through the environmental review process. Typically, the following are required for new
construction and new subdivisions:
       Install city standard sidewalk, curb and gutter.
       Install reclaimed water system for landscaping irrigation.
       Install storm water retention system for all impervious surfaces.
Fess associated would be billed as actual time spent on inspections charged at $100/hour.
For new homes within existing neighborhood, the following are typically required:
       Install storm water retention system.
       Repair sidewalk, curb and gutter if damaged or unsafe. If repair is necessary, $180.25 fee
        would be applicable for an encroachment permit.
11.     Building Codes and Enforcement
Building and safety codes, while adopted to preserve public health and safety ensure the
construction of safe and decent housing, have the potential to increase construction costs and
impact the affordability of housing. These include the following building codes, accessibility
standards, and other related ordinances.
Uniform Building Code (UBC)
Seaside has adopted the 2007 California Building Standards Code, which includes the 2006
International Building Code. Enforcement of applicable building codes requires inspections at
various stages of construction to ensure code compliance. The California Building Standards
Code prescribes minimum insulation requirements to reduce noise and promote energy
efficiency.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
The City’s building code requires new residential construction to comply with ADA
requirements. State law requires buildings consisting of three or more units to incorporate
design features, including: 1) adaptive design features for the interior of the unit; 2) accessible
public and common use portions; and 3) sufficiently wider doors to allow wheelchair access.
These codes apply to all jurisdictions and are enforced by federal and state agencies. This
Housing Element includes a program for the City to adopt and implement a Reasonable
Accommodations Ordinance to facilitate the development of housing for persons with
disabilities.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
As the permit holder of a Municipal Storm Water Permit, the City must implement an Urban
Runoff Management Program to reduce the discharge of pollutants into the storm sewer
system. Prior to issuance of a building permit or any discretionary land use approval or permit,
Seaside General Plan                       HE App-66                                   August 2010

                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
the applicant must submit a storm water mitigation plan and implement Best Management
Practices in accordance with state and local regulations.
Code Enforcement
The City’s compliance/inspection staff is responsible for enforcing local and state property
maintenance codes. Building inspections are made daily and are typically available the day
following request by the contractor. Additional fees to cover inspection costs are charged to the
requesting party. Inspections of unsafe buildings are made only on a complaint or referral
basis.
C.       State Tax Policies and Regulations
1.       Proposition 13
Proposition 13, a voter initiative that limits increases in property taxes except where there is a
transfer of ownership, may have increased the cost of housing. The initiative forced local
governments to pass on more of the costs of housing development (e.g., construction of
infrastructure and community facilities) to developers who use Mello Roos as a way to offset
facilities and improvement costs.
2.       Federal and State Environmental Protection Regulations
Federal and State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects
(e.g., subdivision maps, use permits, etc.). Costs, resulting from fees charged by local
government and private consultants needed to complete the environmental analyses and from
delays caused by mandated public review period, also add to the cost of housing. However, the
presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure environmental quality
for Seaside residents.
D.       Environmental/Infrastructure Constraints
Overcoming environmental and infrastructure constraints can add significantly to the cost of
developing housing. In Seaside, the primary environmental constraints are lack of an adequate
water supply, inadequate water, sewer, and storm drainage collector lines in some areas,
inadequate road widths in other areas, environmental hazards located on the former Ft. Ord,
and significant biological resources located in the eastern portion of the community and
protected by the Habitat Management Plan (HMP).
1.       Protected Habitat
Federal and State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects
(e.g., subdivision maps, use permits, etc.). Costs, resulting from fees charged by local
government and private consultants needed to complete the environmental analyses and from
delays caused by mandated public review period, also add to the cost of housing. However, the
presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure environmental quality
for Seaside residents.
Seaside General Plan                       HE App-67                                  August 2010

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
The 1997 Fort Ord Base Reuse Plan set aside approximately 20,000 of the 28,000 acres of the
former Fort Ord for habitat (16,000 acres) and open space recreational uses. A large portion of
this “habitat reserve” is located in the eastern portion of Seaside and is protected from
development by the Habitat Management Plan. However, the Habitat Management Plan
identifies the land immediately adjacent to the City’s former eastern boundary as
“development” areas. As shown on the Land Use Policy Map, Seaside has planned the entire
area between the old eastern City boundary and the “habitat reserve area” for single-family
residential development, which would allow for the development of approximately 2,200
housing units in this area. However, without additional water supplies and a clean slate for
ordnance and hazardous waste removal, new development cannot occur in this area. No
housing is currently planned in the “habitat reserve” area.
2.      Tree Ordinance
The Tree Ordinance prohibits the removal of any tree on private property in the City without a
permit. The ordinance also contains a list of trees which may not be planted without a permit
(including , Coast Redwood, Blue Gum Eucalyptus, Willows, Cottonwood, and Poplar).
3.      Hazardous and Toxic Sites
Large portions of the former Ft. Ord base contain hazardous and toxic waste sites, as well as
unexploded ordnance. These areas of Seaside are identified as a Superfund National Priority
Hazardous Waste Site. No housing is currently proposed in these areas. As described in the
Safety Element, the City cooperates with the federal government to obtain Superfund monies
and implement Superfund clean-up activities. Clean-up of these sites is the responsibility of the
federal government and is expected to be completed in 10 to 15 years depending on federal
funding appropriations.
4.      Infrastructure
Development on existing undeveloped land or redeveloped to higher residential densities
would not require the provision of new infrastructure systems, but may create a need for
upgrades to existing storm drain lines, water lines, sewer lines, street, telephone lines and other
infrastructure. These upgrades will add to development costs, which could reduce the
construction feasibility of units affordable to lower income households without subsidy. The
upgrade of the water system and other infrastructure serving Seaside is ongoing as part of the
City’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP).
5.      Water Supply
The Monterey Peninsula has long faced water supply challenges which have hindered new
residential development opportunities. Challenges facing the Peninsula include the lack of
permanent diversion rights from the Carmel River and pumping reduction requirements of the
Seaside Basin Adjudication.
The City of Seaside receives its primary potable water supply from the from the Seaside Basin,
the Carmel River, and Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin. Historic use of the region’s
Seaside General Plan                      HE App-68                                     August 2010

                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
groundwater resources has exceeded safe yield and resulted in lowering of water levels and in
saltwater intrusion. Constrained water supply will continue to be a significant factor in the
growth locally and regionally.
The Seaside Municipal Water System, California-American Water Company (Cal-Am), and the
Marina Coast Water District (MCWD) provide water services to the City. The Seaside
Municipal System is operated and maintained by the City. The system serves the Del Monte
Heights area from three existing wells. The rest of the City is served by Cal-Am, a privately
owned and operated company. Cal-Am serves their customers with water drawn from Carmel
River surface water, alluvial ground water in the Carmel Valley, and from the Seaside coastal
ground water basin. MCWD serves Fort Ord lands within the City limits.
The MPWMD has authority over the creation or expansion of all water districts and allocates
supplies to cities within its jurisdiction. MPWMD has established criteria by which water
credits are allocated for new development. Residential water credits are based on the number
of plumbing fixtures. To build a subordinate unit on an existing lot, the number of plumbing
fixtures must be maintained for both the main and subordinate units, making the addition of a
full functioning unit difficult. To build housing in commercial zones, the existing commercial
use must be reduced in size to provide water credits for the units.
Seaside has a remaining water allocation balance of 43 acre-feet, a majority of which is
appropriated for proposed economic development projects, which include mixed use projects.
The City’s development strategy is to focus on mixed-use developments to promote balanced
jobs and housing growth.
Although, water scarcity and the provision of an alternative water supply is ultimately beyond
the control of the City, Seaside supports regional efforts to create proposed new water supply
projects and the use of recycled water. A regional water supply project is proposed to meet the
existing level of California-American Water Company (Cal-Am) system production of 15,285
acre feet annually (AFA) as a (short-term goal). The regional project also contemplates a local
desalination plant in Moss Landing or the City of Marina. An EIR is being prepared for the
desalinization project; however, the proposed project will not likely be in place for at least five
years. Thus, the lack of water will continue to constrain the production of housing in Seaside
Proper.
The City of Seaside received a water allocation of 1,012 AFY from the United States
Army with the closure of the former Fort Ord.                 Subtracting water allocated to
completed or approved developments, the estimated remaining water allocation for
former Fort Ord lands is 160-165 AFY.
The City also continues to require new public and private development and redevelopment
projects to install and utilize water conservation measures per Section 13.18.010 of the Seaside
Municipal Code. Section 13.18.010 requires:
       The installation of low water-use plumbing fixtures, and low water-use landscape
        materials in new construction;
       The installation of low water-use plumbing fixtures in existing hotels and motels; and
Seaside General Plan                       HE App-69                                  August 2010

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
       The retrofitting of plumbing fixtures in all existing residential buildings at the time of
        change of ownership or physical expansion, or in the cases of commercial property, at
        the time of change of ownership, or change or expansion of use.
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water providers develop written policies that grant
priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower-income
households. The legislation also prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning the
approval of development that includes housing affordable to lower income households, unless
specific written findings are made. The City will provide a copy of the adopted 2009-2014
Housing Element to the water districts within 30 days of adoption. The City will also continue
to coordinate with the water districts to ensure affordable housing developments receive
priority water service provision.

4.       Housing Resources
This section analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing in Seaside. This includes an evaluation of the availability of land; the
City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing needs, and the administrative
resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs.
A.       Financial Resources
As a small community, the City has limited availability of funds for affordable housing
activities.    Key funding sources include Community Development Block Grants and
Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside funds. However, the most significant resource available to
the City is the Inclusionary Housing Policy. Through this policy, the City has achieved
affordable housing for lower and moderate income households.
1.       Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
Through the CDBG program, HUD provides funds to local governments for a range of
community development activities. The eligible activities include, but are not limited to:
acquisition and/or disposition of real estate property, public facilities and improvements,
relocation, rehabilitation and construction (under certain limitations) of housing, home
ownership assistance, and also clearance activities. In addition, these funds can be used to
acquire or subsidize at-risk units. During FY 2008/09, the City of Seaside received
approximately $404,205 from U. S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that can be used
for these purposes.
2.       Redevelopment Set-Aside
State law requires redevelopment agencies to set-aside 20 percent of tax increment revenue
generated from redevelopment projects for activities that increase, improve or preserve the
supply of affordable housing. Affordable housing developed with 20 percent tax-set-aside
funds must remain affordable to the targeted income group for at least 55 years for rental
housing and 45 years for ownership housing. Approximately $20 million in tax increment set-
aside funds will be available for affordable housing activities through 2014. These activities
include single-family and multi-family housing rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer assistance,
developer incentives, and homeless assistance.
B.       Administrative Resources
Described below are public and non-profit agencies that can serve as resources in the
implementation of housing activities in Seaside. These agencies play an important role in
meeting the housing needs of the City. In particular, they are critical in the production of
affordable housing and the preservation of at-risk housing units in Seaside. There are
additional nonprofit agencies that are developing a local track record; these agencies may also
assist in this area during the life of this Housing Element.
Seaside General Plan                         HE App-71                              August 2010

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Seaside Redevelopment Agency (SRA)
The Seaside Redevelopment Agency is responsible for planning and coordinating activities
within the City’s redevelopment project areas. Existing redevelopment project areas include
Noche Buena, Del Monte Heights, Hannon, Laguna Grande, Gateway Autocenter Expansion
Area Redevelopment Project, and City Center Revitalization Areas. All of the former Fort Ord
is a redevelopment project. The SRA is active in the rehabilitation and production of low and
moderate income housing through a variety of programs and projects.
Community Housing Improvement Systems and Planning Association (CHISPA)
CHISPA is a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) operating in the Central
Coast area. As the largest private, nonprofit developer in Monterey County, CHISPA has
completed more than 1,900 affordable single-family, multi-family, and senior housing units
since its incorporation in 1980.
Habitat for Humanity
Habitat for Humanity is a community service organization that renovates and builds homes
with the goal of eliminating poverty and providing decent shelter for all. Through volunteer
labor and tax deductible donations of money and materials, Habitat for Humanity constructs or
rehabilitates homes in partnership with the families that will become the owners of the
properties. Rehabilitated or newly constructed homes are sold to the families for the cost of
materials through a mortgage that does not include interest or profit. Habitat for Humanity,
Monterey County is located in Seaside and actively works with jurisdictions to find and acquire
appropriate properties for residential development and redevelopment.
Monterey County Alliance on Aging
The Alliance on Aging offers a homeshare program that pairs senior home owners with a
companion who is willing to assist with household chores such as cooking or driving in
exchange for a place to live at a reduced rate. The stated mission of the program is to help
seniors stay in their homes as long as possible, to prevent early institutionalization. At the same
time, the program makes available affordable housing opportunities for companion seniors.
Seaside General Plan                      HE App-72                                     August 2010

                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
C.      Future Housing Needs
State law requires communities to demonstrate that they encourage and facilitate housing
production commensurate with their fair share of the region’s future growth from 2007-2014. 12
The City’s share assigned by the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) is
included in the Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP). Therefore, an important component of
the Housing Element is the identification of suitable sites to accommodate housing that is
affordable in accordance with the RHNP.
1.      Regional Housing Needs Allocation
AMBAG has assigned a portion of the region’s future need for housing to each community
within the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey as part of the Regional Housing Needs Plan
(RHNP). Seaside’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is 598 housing units from
January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2014 (Table 41).
                Table 41: Regional Housing Needs Share for Seaside
                Income Category                Income Threshold            Number of Units
                Extremely Low/Very Low         50% or less of the AMI                       134
                Low                            51% to 80% of the AMI                        101
                Moderate                       81% to 120% of the AMI                       113
                Above Moderate                 Over 120% of the AMI                         250
                Total                                                                       598
                Source: AMBAG, July 11, 2008.
The City has a RHNA allocation of 134 very low income units. Pursuant to new State law (AB
2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income (30 percent of less of AMI)
housing needs based on Census income distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low
income units as extremely low. According to the CHAS data developed by HUD using 2000
Census data, the City had 2,142 households with incomes at or below 50 percent AMI (977 (45.6
percent) extremely low and 1,165 (54.4 percent) very low income) as shown in Table 29.
Therefore the City’s RHNA of 134 very low income units may be split into 61 extremely low and
73 very low income units. However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the RHNA,
State law does not mandate the separate accounting for the extremely low income category.
12  While the Housing Element planning period is for July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2014, the Regional Housing
    Needs Allocation (RHNA) has a longer timeframe – January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2014.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
2.      Credits toward RHNA
Jurisdictions may count toward their RHNA the number of units that have been constructed
since January 1, 2007. In addition, jurisdictions may count units that have received building
permits, planning approvals, and other discretionary approvals that will be constructed during
the 2007-2014 RHNA period. Table 42 summarizes the number of units produced/issued
permits since January 2007. In 2007, the City saw a sharp decrease in the number of units
produced due to primarily to the changing market conditions.
Overall, only 21 units have been constructed or approved since January 2007. Five of these
units are new market rate single-family dwellings. In addition, two above moderate income
units were created by the conversion of office space at 510 Hilby Avenue and 640 Francis
Avenue into residential units. The City has also achieved several affordable units through the

        of two commercial offices into apartment units with two existing residential units. One
        of the units will be deed-restricted in perpetuity as housing affordable to a moderate
        income household.
       1200 San Pablo Avenue: The proposed project is for the demolition of an existing
        single-family dwelling with the reconstruction of a six-unit apartment building. The
        new apartment building has received a one-unit density bonus. The density bonus was
        approved by the City Council on October 15, 2009. The new apartment building will
        require two low-income units for a term of 40-years.
These projects demonstrate the feasibility of small-lot developments in Seaside and also the
potential and feasibility of recycling existing underutilized properties for residential uses.
Specifically, two projects involve the conversion of underutilized commercial uses into
residential uses and one project is an intensification of a residential site.

D.      Residential Development Potential
1.      Vacant and Underutilized Sites Inventory
Residential growth in Seaside could occur on a variety of residential and mixed use acreage
throughout the community. To evaluate potential land resources for residential development, a
parcel-specific site analysis was performed using a Geographic Information System. The vacant
and underutilized land survey was conducted by reviewing individual parcels, the current
development and density on those parcels, and potential units based on maximum and average
densities. Table 43 summarizes these results and maps are provided in Figure 7 through
Figure 11. Various sources of information were used to help identify vacant and underutilized
sites:
       West Broadway Specific Plan Existing Conditions Report: In developing the Specific
        Plan, the City reviewed the existing conditions of properties within the Specific Plan
        area. Underutilized sites with potential for redevelopment were identified during this
        process. The Specific Plan noted vacant and underutilized properties throughout the
        entire Specific Plan area. They range in size and location, with some at significant and
        strategic locations. A vacant parcel is one that has no development on site or one that
        has built structures that are currently vacant. An underutilized parcel is where the
        structure on the site does not maximize its potential, such as taking advantage of a land
        use designation or location to benefit both the property/business owner and the
        community. Many businesses are marginally operating particularly in light of the
        current economic conditions. Many properties have not gone through major upgrades
        and retrofitting/renovating for modern uses would not be cost-effective. The following
        series of photos from the Specific Plan illustrates the typical conditions of underutilized
        uses in the Specific Plan area:

       City Direction: Staff has identified a number of properties appropriate for development
        based on development interests and City objectives for the area. Specifically, two large
        sites (of multiple parcels) have been identified as opportunity housing areas.
        Conceptual site plans have been created by the City as part of this Housing Element to
        help illustrate feasibility and City intentions for the areas. These conceptual site plans
        will be used to promote sites to interested developers.
       Field Survey: Sites were also identified as a result of field surveys.
Estimating Development Potential
To estimate the level of development allowed, each vacant and underutilized parcel was
reviewed for appropriateness for residential use, and those deemed less appropriate for
housing due to surrounding land uses as well as the configuration and size of the property were
eliminated from the following analysis. In order to determine realistic capacity for infill sites, a
density factor of 80 percent of the allowable density was used. Since no significant infill
residential projects have been constructed in Seaside in recent years, this assumption was based

on a combination of typical industry standards and research into projects that have been built or
approved in similar zones within the neighboring jurisdiction of Salinas. 13
Residential development capacity within the Seaside East Planning Area and the proposed
West Broadway Urban Village Specific Plan Area 14 was estimated with different assumptions.
For Seaside East Planning Area, potential density is estimated at 70 percent of the allowable
density. The assumption for this “greenfield” site is based on the fact that adequate acreage
must be set aside for necessary facilities and infrastructure improvements.
West Broadway Urban Village Specific Plan
Parcels in the West Broadway Urban Village Specific Plan Area are designated for a range of
residential densities. For example, the MX designation for parcels in the Specific Plan Area
allows between 30 and 60 units per acre within a total FAR of 3.0, including commercial uses.
Mixed use projects are required to have a minimum density of 30 units per acre; Planning
Commission approval is required if the development proposes a density of less than 30 units
per acre. As no minimum unit size is established for the Specific Plan area, the Specific Plan
offers the flexibility for the developer to achieve the highest number of units with a combination
of commercial uses. The groundfloor commercial requirement for a mixed use project would
not preclude a development from achieving up to 60 units per acre. The Specific Plan area
currently contains 84 units but envisions close to 500 units at buildout along with
approximately 400,000 square feet of nonresidential development. Therefore, for MX-zoned
parcels in the Specific Plan Area, this sites inventory assumes an average density of 45 units per
acre. This average density is based on high density projects in similar zones in neighboring
cities. 15
The development standards for the West Broadway Urban Village Specific Plan are established
to encourage redevelopment of existing properties into more urbanized, high intensity uses
between three and five stories, with hotels going up to eight stories. The parking requirements
for mixed use residential units are: 1.5 spaces per unit with two or more bedrooms and one
space per studio or one-bedroom unit.
Fort Ord
As presented in Table 43, much of the residential growth potential in Seaside comes from
vacant sites, including a vacant RH site on the former Fort Ord. The RH zone is applied to areas
of the City that are appropriate for a mixture of multi-family housing, including apartments,
townhomes and condominiums, convalescent homes and care facilities. This piece of property
is being contemplated for workforce and affordable housing for an equestrian master planned
community that is being proposed immediately to the east in Monterey County. The City has
met with the developers and the City Council and Agency Board has indicated willingness to
13   The two projects are: 1) 75 Castro Street - 9 units built on a 0.52-acre site that allowed 24 dwelling units per net
     acre, meaning the project built out at 75 percent of allowable density; and 2) Tynan Village at 303 Front St. - 171
     units built on a 5.91-acre site that allowed 1,500-square-foot minimum lot size (equivalent to 29.4 units per acre)
     with the State mandated density bonus, meaning the project built out at 98 percent of allowed density.
14   Adoption of the West Broadway Urban Village Specific Plan is anticipated to occur during the summer of 2009,
     before the adoption of this 2009-2014 Housing Element.
15   The sample projects are: 1) Sherwood Village in Salinas, an affordable senior housing project at 808 N. Main
     Street - 124 units on a 2.95-acre site, for density of 42 units per acre; 2) An SRO project at 306 Soledad Street in
     Salinas - 21 units on a 0.45-acre site, for a density of 46 units per acre; and 3) A senior housing development in
     Pacific Grove that achieved 49 units on a one-acre site.

consider approval of an Exclusive Negotiating Agreement with the developers of the proposed
project.
Lot Consolidation
The City recognizes that many existing parcels in the City are small and lot consolidation may
be required to accommodate new affordable housing construction. The City has an incentive
program to encourage lot consolidation, providing redevelopment funds to affordable housing
developers to assist in the acquisition of adjoining properties.

2.      Conceptual Sites Plans
The City has identified two key properties for residential development. To assist in marketing
these sites, conceptual site plans have been prepared for these sites.
East Broadway Site (Broadway and Terrace)
The East Broadway site consists of 14 individual parcels located on the block bounded by
Broadway Avenue to the south, Terrace Street to the west, San Lucas Street to the east and
Olympia Avenue to the north. The City of Seaside Redevelopment Agency owns 13 of the
parcels and the City of Seaside owns the remaining parcel. Eleven of the parcels are vacant.
The other three parcels contain a vacant building, its associated parking lot and a small single-
story building occupied by a hair salon. The City’s ownership of these parcels prompted their
inclusion in the sites inventory. Additionally, the site was seen as optimal because of its
location on Broadway Avenue. The City of Seaside expects this portion of Broadway Avenue to
develop with higher density mixed-use and residential development in the near future. This
would continue a trend of redevelopment already being undertaken along Broadway Avenue to
the west of the site. Additional details about the East Broadway Conceptual Plan can be seen in
Figure 10.
942 Hilby Avenue
942 Hilby Avenue is a 2.4-acre site currently occupied by a single-family home. According to
Monterey County Assessor’s data, the site and single-family home are currently owned by a
private individual. The site was identified through a field survey as potentially underutilized
due to its large size and its current occupation by a small single-family home. The parcel is also
zoned Community Commercial (CC), which will allow mixed-use and multi-family
development. The neighborhood surrounding the site is urban in character, including the
Fremont Boulevard commercial corridor to the west. Most nearby single-family residential
parcels are less than 0.25 acres. Additional details and plans for 942 Hilby Avenue can be seen
in Figure 11.

3.      Adequacy of Sites Inventory
Table 46 summarizes the City’s ability to meet its share of the region’s housing need as
determined by the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments. To facilitate the
development of housing for lower income households, the City focuses its efforts on sites zoned
for multi-family residential development at 25 units per acre and mixed-use sites within the
West Broadway Specific Plan area at 60 units per acre. The West Broadway Specific Plan was
adopted in January 2010. Vacant and underutilized sites at these areas far exceed the City’s
remaining RHNA of 583 units. The Specific Plan alone anticipates a net increase of 400 units
within the Specific Plan area at buildout. This sites inventory assumes a conservative 181 units
in the Specific Plan area, well within the capacity offered by the Specific Plan. Even when half
of the Specific Plan mixed use sites are realized with a residential component, the City still has
adequate capacity to achieve its remaining RHNA.
Furthermore, while the efforts for compiling a vacant and underutilized sites inventory focused
primarily on multi-family and mixed use sites in the City, additional capacity for single-family
residential development exists in the City (although not shown in this inventory due to their
longer development time frame).

5.      Evaluation of Adopted Housing Element
In order to draft an effective housing plan for the 2009-2014 Housing Element, the City must
evaluate the effectiveness and continued appropriateness of existing housing programs and
actions. This evaluation includes the following:
       The effectiveness of the adopted Housing Element in the attainment of the State housing
        goal;
       An analysis of the significant differences between the adopted goals and the actual
        accomplishments; and
       A description of how the goals, objectives, policies and programs of the 2009-2014
        Housing Element incorporate lessons learned from the results of the 2002-2009 Housing
        Element adopted in 2003.
A.      Accomplishments of Adopted Housing Element
This section presents a comparison of the five-year objectives established for each housing
program adopted under the 2003 Housing Element with the actual accomplishments from 2003
to the present, Table 47 summarizes the City’s accomplishments in the areas of:
       Providing Adequate Site;
       Housing Rehabilitation and Improvement;
       Housing Affordability;
       Preservation of Affordable Housing;
       Removing Constraints; and
       Fair Housing
The previous Housing Element was adopted in 2003 and initially covers the planning period of
July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2007. Legislation was passed to extend the timeframe to June 30,
2009. Therefore, this section summarizes the City’s achievements through December 2008 (as of
writing of this Technical Background Report).

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
The Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) identified a Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) of 1,305 housing units for Seaside for the 2000
through 2007 planning period. Table 48 summarizes the City’s achievement with
regard to meeting the RHNA. Due to the escalated housing market between 2000 and
2007, much of the housing produced was affordable only to above moderate income
households.

6.      Public Comments Received
As part of the Housing Element update, the City of Seaside provided various opportunities and
venues for public input. Comments received during the update process are summarized below.
A.      Interviews with Focused Groups
Based on the City’s past experience with community outreach efforts, the general public rarely
participates in public meetings unless there is an immediate issue that may impact specific
neighborhoods. In light of the past experience, the Housing Element update process
augmented public meetings with interviews with service providers, housing professions, and
community stakeholders who have an indepth understanding of the issues and concerns,
constraints, and opportunities relating to housing Seaside residents.
On September 25, 2008, the City of Seaside conducted interviews with housing professionals,
service providers representing the interest of low and moderate income households and special
needs groups, and community stakeholders regarding housing needs in the City. Over 50
individuals, groups, and organizations were invited to participate in the interviews:

Along with the invitation, a simple questionnaire was sent to these agencies and organizations
to solicit input on housing needs. These agencies returned the survey:
    •    Alliance on Aging
    •    Housing Choices Coalition
    •    Housing Advocacy Council
    •    Monterey County Housing Alliance
In addition, representatives from the following groups participated in the interviews:
    •    CHISPA, Inc.
    •    JNM Company
    •    WM David Martin
    •    Interim, Inc.
    •    Monterey County Association of REALTORS®
The comments received are summarized below:
Affordable Housing
    • There is a general lack of affordable housing for persons with disabilities. Mentally ill
         persons are being housed in other communities.
    • CHISPA is looking for opportunities to develop supportive housing single adults to live
         an independent life.
    • The current market conditions offer opportunities for many households to purchase
         moderately priced homes (between $300,000 and $400,000).               However, many
         homebuyers may have difficulty competing with investors with large cash flows.
    • City should offer assistance to make improvements to existing homes.
    • A possible option is to convert existing apartments into affordable housing units.
    • There is a need for senior housing in Seaside.
    • There is a lack of accessible housing. Rehabilitation of existing units to meet ADA
         standards is usually difficult.
    • There is also a need for student housing in Seaside.

HOUSING ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Constraints
    • Lack of water allocation for multi-family housing construction.
    • Difficult to achieve affordable multi-family housing on small lots. An ideal project size
        is 50 units.
    • Economic development is important to facilitate redevelopment. City needs to pursue
        more economic development activities.
    • Opportunities exist in converting some motels into housing. However, most sites are
        small and therefore have problem meeting the residential development standads.
B.      Joint Planning Commission/City Council Study Session
The City conducted a joint study session with the Planning Commission and City Council on
July 16, 2009. The Study Session was advertised in locally circulated newspapers, posted on
City website, and flyers were sent to the same agencies invited to the Focused Group
Interviews. These groups represent a broad spectrum of the community, representing the
interests of low and moderate income households, as well as persons with special needs.
 While there were members of the public who attended the joint study session; no members of
the public spoke at the meeting. The City Council and Planning Commission expressed
concerns with rehabilitation needs in the community and how programs can be revamped to
expand the utilization of these programs by residents. Homebuyer/foreclosure assistance was
also identified as critical needs in Seaside. The 2009-2014 Housing Element reflected the
comments from the Planning Commission and City Council, incorporating revisions to several
of the City’s key houshing programs to enhance effectiveness.

Notes: 1 - For various reasons, many parcels in the community have not been developed to their maximum density or intensity. In the future, maximum development as described in this
workbook can be expected to occur on a limited number of parcels. Instead, the overall future development of the City is anticipated to occur at the average level of development
intensity or density indicated in Table LU-2. The average DU/ac or FAR is for planning purposes only and in no way limits development from occurring to the maximum allowable level

Policies and plans in the Safety Element are
designed to protect existing and planned land
uses identified in the Land Use Element from
safety hazards. Potential hazards are identi-
fied in the Safety Element, and action pro-
grams are established to avoid or mitigate
safety impacts from planned development.
Concurrently, the Land Use Element contains
policies to ensure that environmental condi-
tions, including hazards, are considered in all
land use decisions.
The distribution of residential and other sensi-
tive land uses on the Land Use Policy Map is
designed to avoid areas where hazardous
conditions have been identified.
Evacuation routes, which utilize the circula-
tion system, are also described in the Safety
Element. The provision of viable evacuation
routes within the City is inextricably linked to
the existing and planned circulation system

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
PLAN
In concert with the other six Elements of the
General Plan, the Urban Design Plan provides
a comprehensive guide for developing and
redeveloping Seaside. The primary issues ad-
dressed in the Urban Design Plan include im-
proving the City’s image and identity; improv-
ing the residential neighborhoods and busi-
ness districts, enhancing viewsheds and
streetscapes, and encouraging the provision
and maintenance of civic art projects. By ad-
dressing these issues, the Urban Design Plan,
illustrated in Figure UD-1, will help Seaside
improve its overall quality of life. Figure UD-1
also includes a key to the symbols used on
the following figures.                                                                        Figure UD-2
