City of Galt Annual 2030 Galt General Plan                                                March 2016
and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Introduction
Government Code Section 65400 (a) (2) requires the City to file an annual report addressing the
status of the General Plan and progress made toward implementation of its goals, policies and
programs, including progress in meeting its share of regional housing needs and efforts to remove
governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing. The
annual report requires presentation to the City Council for review and acceptance. A copy of the
annual report is required by, and provide to, the Office of Planning and Research and the
Department of Housing and Community Development by April 1 of each year.
This annual report covers the calendar year January 1 to December 31, 2015.
Acceptance Date
The 2015 Annual General Plan Progress Report was reviewed by the Planning Commission on
March 10, 2016 and accepted by the City Council on March 15, 2016.
Planning Division
     “The Legislature finds and declares that California’s land is an exhaustible resource, not
     just a commodity, and is essential to the economy, environment and general well-being of
     the people of California. It is the policy of the state and the intent of the Legislature to
     protect California’s land resource, to insure its preservation and use in ways which are
     economically and socially desirable in an attempt to improve the quality of life in
     California.” Government Code Section 65030
To this end, the Planning Division plans for and promotes reasonable, productive and safe long-
term uses of the land, which fosters economic and environmental prosperity.
Planning Division activities include preparing and administering the City’s General Plan and
Zoning Ordinance, processing amendments, conducting environmental reviews, processing
specific plans, reviewing subdivisions and development proposals, informing the public of the
City’s land use policies and development ordinances, processing annexation requests, and
providing demographic and census information.
Planning Commission’s Activities
The Planning Commission has authority over planning and zoning matters as set forth by City
Code and state law. The Planning Commission makes recommendations to the City Council
regarding general plan amendments, zone changes, planned developments and amendments to the
Development Code. The Commission may approve, conditionally approve, or deny applications
for tentative subdivision maps, development plans, conditional use permits and variances. The
latter items are reviewed by the City Council only on appeal. The Commission also performs
review of environmental, documents in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) in conjunction with review of development applications.

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
The Planning Division provides staff support to the Planning Commission. Routine tasks include
the scheduling of meetings, preparing agendas, posting hearing notices, preparing staff reports and
recommendations, and preparing minutes. Planning Division staff provides environmental review
as required under CEQA and land use analysis, and prepares staff reports for the Planning
Commission and City Council.
During the 2015 annual reporting period, the Planning Commission reviewed the 2030 General
Plan Update and the 2013-2021 Housing Element, recommended approval of the City’s new
Development Code and Landscape Design Guidelines to the City Council, recommended approval
of the Dry Creek Oaks general plan amendment, zone change and tentative subdivision map to the
City Council, approved architectural plans for two subdivisions, approved the Cal Waste MRRF
expansion conditional use permit application, and attended a joint Planning Commission/City
Council workshop on the Eastview/Liberty Ranch Specific Plan and Annexation project.
Status of General Plan
Each element of the General Plan was completed according to the General Plan Guidelines
developed and adopted by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research. The City Council
adopted the City of Galt’s General Plan on April 7, 2009. The General Plan consists of 10
elements. Adoption of the General Plan in 2009 culminated a nearly six-year period during which
the City worked with the General Plan Advisory Committee, Planning Commission and the City
Council to update the General Plan. This process involved over 50 public meetings during that
timeframe.

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Circulation Element – Adoption date: April 7, 2009
The General Plan addressed several transportation issues that are critical to the continued
development of Galt. The Land Use and Circulation Diagram (page 11) depicts the proposed
circulation system. This circulation system is represented on the diagram as a set of roadway
classifications that have been developed to guide Galt’s long-range planning and programming.
Roadways are systematically classified based on the linkages they provide and their function, both
of which reflect their importance to the land use pattern, traveler, and general welfare.
Major improvements to the roadway system include: the widening of State Route (SR) 99;
improvements and realignments of major SR 99 overpasses and on- and off-ramps; new north-
south extensions of Carillion Boulevard, Marengo Road and Industrial Drive; and new east-west
extensions of Walnut Avenue, Simmerhorn Road and Boessow Road. The Land Use and
Circulation Diagram and related policies also call for the widening and improvement of Twin
Cities Road through the Planning Area.
In addition to addressing future roadway plans and improvements, the Circulation Element
contains goals, policies and implementation programs related to the following issues:
        City Street System
        Freeways and Highways
        Residential Streets
        Automobile Parking
        Transit Facilities and Services
        Non-Motorized Transportation
        Airports
        Complete Streets
In coordination with the completion of the 2030 General Plan, City staff undertook a
comprehensive update of the CIP consistent with the General Plan in 2009. This update was
completed in March 2010 and again in 2012. A review of the Development Impact Fees for Traffic
also occurred in 2015.
2015 Amendments: None.
Pending Amendments: As noted in the Land Use Element discussion, City staff is processing a
request to amend the General Plan to accommodate a proposed 504-acre development, which will
include modifications to the circulation system within and adjacent to the project site.

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Community Character Element – Adoption Date: April 7, 2009
This chapter establishes qualitative urban design goals and policies which reinforce
communitywide concepts depicting a framework of neighborhoods, corridors and landmarks.
Community design integrates diverse development concepts at an array of levels. From the overall
City to neighborhoods and districts to streetscape and structure design. The goals and policies
presented in this element provide for the visual pattern of land uses and circulation.
Key issues include the maintenance and enhancement of the quality of life in Galt by providing an
overall theme of Galt as an urban city in the midst of a rural and open space landscape, establishing
well-designed and inviting greenways and corridors in the City, providing the framework for the
protection of Galt’s historic downtown and preserving and enhancing Galt’s trees.
The Community Character Element contains goals, policies and implementations programs related
to the following issues:
   Overall Community Design
   Gateways and Community Corridors
   Downtown
   Trees
2015 Amendments: None

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Conservation and Open Space Element – Adoption Date: April 7, 2009
Galt’s environmental resources (water, vegetation, wildlife and open space) contribute to the
City’s economy and are important elements in the quality of life of Galt’s residents. These natural
resources exist in limited quantity and are at risk of destruction or degradation through continued
urban development. The General Plan seeks to balance the need for growth with the need for
conservation and enhancement of the area’s natural resources, frequently in cooperation with other
agencies. This chapter addresses the following topics:
   Water Resources
   Fish and Wildlife Habitat
   Vegetation
   Agriculture, Open Space, and Natural Resource Preservation
   Air Quality – General
   Air Quality – Transportation
   Global Warming and Energy Conservation
The City continues to participate in the ongoing planning process for the South Sacramento Habitat
Conservation Plan. The County is preparing a Draft document and the associated CEQA
compliance.
2015 Amendments: None

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Economic Development Element – Adoption Date: April 7, 2009
This chapter addresses key economic development issues relating to the maintenance and
enhancement of Galt’s quality of life by retaining and encouraging the expansion of existing
industries and businesses in the community; encouraging the development of new industries and
businesses in the community thereby creating new jobs for Galt residents; and preserving and
enhancing the rich historic character of the community.
Economic development pertains to planning for a community where businesses can thrive and
attract wealth, provide jobs and income growth for local residents, generate revenue for local
government, and revitalize existing neighborhoods. The policies in this chapter will help Galt to
identify its role within the regional economy and position the community to benefit from economic
opportunities as they arise. This includes targeting the types of businesses that the community
wants to attract and retain, ensuring that resources are available for the labor force to improve its
occupational skills, and creating a business climate that makes the community attractive for
business location and expansion.
The chapter addresses the following topics:
   Retail Attraction and Development
   Downtown Development
   Industrial and Office Attraction and Development
   Business Retention and Expansion
   Workforce Development
The City conducted a major update of its zoning regulations and Downtown Specific Plan and
created from them a new Development Code, which simplifies many processes, thereby making
the development process in the City easier to navigate and thus, more attractive to the retention
and expansion of existing businesses and to attract new businesses.
In addition, the City hired a new part-time Economic Development Manager, who will be
responsible for growing and retaining existing businesses in Galt and attracting new ones to the
City.
2015 Amendments: None

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Historic Resources Element – Adoption Date: April 7, 2009
Galt has a rich historic heritage and many significant historic buildings, events and artifacts reflect
its past. Downtown Galt in particular includes several buildings that are on a local cultural
resources inventory. The General Plan sets the framework for a comprehensive program to foster
historic preservation efforts in Galt through a systematic program, community education, and
coordination within the City and historic preservation groups. This chapter contains goals, policies
and implementation measures related to the following topics:
    Historic Preservation
    Economic Incentives for Historic Preservation
    Historic Preservation Education and Awareness
    Archaeological Resources
2015 Amendments: None. However, a professional historic evaluation of all the listed structures
is strongly recommended for the future.

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Land Use Element – Adoption Date: April 7, 2009
This part is the most familiar of all of the policy chapters in the General Plan. It contains the Land
Use and Circulation Diagram that prescribes uses for all of the Planning Area and describes
standards for each of the land use designations shown on the Land Use and Circulation Diagram
on the following page. The element defines a series of goals, policies and implementation
measures related to the following topics:
        Overall City Growth and Expansion
        New Development
        Downtown
        Residential Growth
        Commercial, Mixed-Use and Public/Quasi-Public Development
        Office Professional Development
        Industrial Development
        Agriculture, Open Space and Parks
        Environmental Justice
        General Plan Maintenance
It is important that the users of this policy document understand that the goals, policies, standards
and implementation programs described in Part II are as important, if not more so, than the Land
Use and Circulation Diagram in representing the City’s land use and development policy.
Accordingly, any development proposals or review thereof must consider this policy document as
a whole, rather than focusing solely on the Land Use and Circulation Diagram or on particular
policies and programs.
2015 Amendments: One. The City approved the Dry Creek Oaks project, which consisted of a
proposal to subdivide 39.52 acres into 201 senior restricted single family lots, a General Plan
Amendment to change the land use from Low-Density Residential (LDR) to Medium Density
Residential (MDR) and a rezone from Low-Density Single-Family (R1A) to Dry Creek Oaks
Planned Development (PD) and Open Space (OS). The density of the proposed development is 5
units per gross acre. In addition, the project approval consisted of the subdivision of 13.53 acres,
for commercial use and a General Plan Amendment from Light Industrial (LI) to Commercial (C)
and a rezone from Light Industrial (LM) to Commercial (C). The remaining portion, 15.1± acres,
is planned as a senior restricted multi-family facility (7.1 acres) and an assisted living facility (8
acres) and included a General Plan Amendment from Light Industrial (LI) to High Density
Residential (HDR) and a rezone from LM to Multiple Family (R4).
Pending Amendments: The City is currently processing a formal application by the owner of
approximately 358 acres east of Marengo Road, south of Twin Cities Road and north of the Ione
spur railroad tracks. The owner wished to pursue development of a Specific Plan and annexation
of that property to the City for development purposes. The owner submitted a formal application
for a Specific Plan as set forth in Galt General Plan Policy LU-1, along with requests for a General
Plan Amendment, Pre-zoning, a Development Agreement and vesting tentative subdivision maps.

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Noise Element – Adoption Date: April 7, 2009
A feature of Galt’s small-town character and quality of life is its relatively quiet atmosphere. Noise
results from many sources, including road traffic, railroad operations, aircraft, and industrial
activities. Exposure to excessive noise has often been cited as a health problem, not so much in
terms of actual physiological damage such as hearing impairment, but more in terms of general
well-being and contributing undue stress and annoyance.
This chapter contains goals, policies and implementation measures on the following topic:
        Noise
2015 Amendments: None. However, a new noise ordinance pertaining to noise as it relates to
land use issues was included within the Development Code update, which was implemented in
July 2015, and which is consistent with the General Plan Noise Element. In addition, the City
constructed all of the improvements necessary for a new Railroad Quiet Zone from Kost Road to
Elm Avenue in 2015 and the City expects the Quiet Zone to be approved by the railroad and fully
operational in 2016.

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
Public Facilities and Services Element – Adoption Date: April 7, 2009
This chapter addresses how to provide public facilities and services needed to adequately serve
development within the General Plan. While the development of detailed plans for facilities and
services is beyond the purview of the General Plan, this chapter does establish a framework for
guiding planning decisions related to facility development and service provision. The general
emphasis of the policies and programs is on ensuring the provision and maintenance of adequate
services, while discouraging unnecessary, wasteful, or inefficient extension of existing systems or
development of new facilities. This chapter contains goals, policies and implementation programs
related to the following facilities and services:
   Public Faculties and Services Funding
   Water Supply, Treatment and Delivery
   Wastewater Collection, Treatment, Disposal and Reuse
   Stormwater Drainage
   Solid Waste Collection and Disposal
   Law Enforcement
   Fire Protection and Emergency Medical Services
   Parks and Recreational Open Space
   Education
   Childcare
   Gas and Electric Services
   Information Technology
The City continues to employee a full-time IT Manager and two full-time IT Technicians (one
position is a contract position).
A modern voice over internet protocol (VOIP) phone system was installed for all City facilities in
2015, which is in conformance with implementation program PFS-M of the General Plan.
2015 Amendments: None

Table 4 provides the 2015 maximum household income limits for Sacramento County (very low-
low-, moderate- and above-moderate-incomes) as determined by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development and derived from the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development. The median income was estimated to be $76,100.00 for a four-person

Sphere of Influence Boundary Amendments
The City of Galt applied to the Sacramento Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) for
an amendment to the Sphere of Influence (SOI) consistent with the newly adopted 2030 Galt
General Plan on July 20, 2009. It was approved on January 9, 2011.
As part of this application submission, City staff prepared a Municipal Services Review (MSR),
which was submitted with the SOI application. The amended SOI application includes
approximately 1,053 acres to be added to the SOI on lands north of Twin Cities Road from
Cherokee Lane on the east to the U.P.R.R. mainline to the west. The northern boundary generally
follows Skunk Creek between the eastern and western margins noted above. Refer also to the
diagram below.
A simultaneous detachment of approximately 1,613 acres was also approved. The detached area
is located between Sargent and Christensen Roads from Twin Cities Road on the north to the
Sacrament/San Joaquin County boundary to the south. The amended SOI, shown below, allows
for future annexation of land to the City of Galt.

Redevelopment Activities
The City of Galt established the Redevelopment Agency, pursuant to Redevelopment Law, in 1983
and created the Galt Redevelopment Project Area. The City Council declared itself the Agency
and assumed all the rights, powers, duties and privileges vested in a redevelopment agency. The
City amended the redevelopment project area in 2007. This amendment extended the expiration
date of the project area and expanded its boundaries.
Subsequently, the State of California Governor’s Office and Legislature spent most of 2011
dismantling redevelopment agencies statewide. The Legislature passed two Assembly Bills in
2011: AB1X 26, which eliminated redevelopment agencies and created successor agencies, and
AB1X 27, which exempted agencies from such elimination if they agreed to make specified
payments to the state. The legality of the bills was subsequently challenged and the State Supreme
Court ultimately upheld AB1X 26 and struck down AB1X 27. Consequently, Galt’s
Redevelopment Agency ceased to exist and the City will be the successor agency to wind down
the activities of the agency and ensure payment of all outstanding obligations.
Nevertheless, the Galt Redevelopment Agency initiated a number of projects in 2011 prior to its
elimination. Since those activities were in place prior to AB1X 26, it was expected that they could
all continue until completed. However, the State Department of Finance (DOF) has ultimate
approval authority over the Successor Agency and its Oversight Board to determine the
Recognized Obligation Payment Schedules (ROPS) for Galt. Even though DOF approved
virtually all projects on three prior ROPS, they denied several of those same projects on the recent
ROPS IV.
Commercial Revitalization:
Central Galt Corridor Project
This project is intended to beautify and enhance the main C Street corridor from SR 99 to Fourth
Street, and it includes part of Lincoln Way between A and C Streets. The project will help improve
community identity, connectivity, and business development in Galt’s central business district.
Proposed improvements include adding landscaped median islands, street trees, streetlights and
banners to unify the design theme with the new improvements at the Central Galt Interchange.
The center turn lane will include tinted concrete or special asphalt design to set it apart from the
rest of the street, and pedestrian safety crossings will be established. Previous “Old Town”
improvements that ended at Sixth Street will be extended on C Street to Lincoln Way. The City
obtained a $2 million SACOG grant to revitalize and enhance the C Street corridor (including
portions of Lincoln Way and Fourth and L Streets).
Preliminary design work and public input for this project was completed in 2011. Construction
will be dependent on funding availability.

and Housing Element Progress Report for 2015
U.P.R.R. Transit Stop/Parking Lot and Site Improvements Project
This project, associated with the Central Galt Corridor project, is intended to develop a portion of
the U.P.R.R. property adjacent to Fourth Street from B Street to E Street with a parking lot and
other park-like improvements. Improvements include a transit stop, farmer’s market area, and
extended landscaping with walkways and ornamental planting. If and when the commuter train
associated with the High Speed Rail project comes to fruition, this site could also serve as a park-
n-ride lot for commuters and a transit transfer point. Overall, this project is also contingent on
funding availability; however, construction of a portion of the project is within the SACOG grant
noted above. Additionally, work was completed in later 2015 on the railroad quiet zone, which
will further make the downtown area more attractive.
Simmerhorn Commercial Project CEQA
The Simmerhorn Commercial property is vacant land that has been designated for retail
development in the Galt General Plan for over two decades. It consists of approximately 41.5
acres on the east side of SR 99, south of Simmerhorn Road. The recently constructed Central Galt
Interchange provides direct access to the site and it is highly visible from the highway.
In an effort to streamline future development of this prime retail property, the City/RDA initiated
compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act based on a conceptual 500,000 square
foot shopping center project. The CEQA document was adopted in early 2012 and identifies the
various mitigation measures a developer would need to address prior to developing the site. The
CEQA clearance for the project effectively saves 6-12 months of processing time assuming the
project is within the parameters identified in the CEQA analysis. The City hired an Economic
Development Manager in October 2015 and the development of this site is a top priority of the
new Manager. The City is working with the site’s owner to actively market it as a retail center.
Affordable Housing Development Progress
With the loss of Redevelopment 20% set-aside funding, the City has not been able to
encourage/assist with development of any affordable housing.

IX. EXTREMELY-LOW INCOME TEST
Section 34176.1(a)(3)(B) requires that the Housing Successor must require at least 30 percent of
the FUND to be expended for development of rental housing affordable to and occupied by
households earning 30 percent or less of the AMI. If the Housing Successor fails to comply with
the Extremely-Low Income requirement in any five-year report, then the Housing Successor must
ensure that at least 50 percent of the funds remaining in the FUND be expended in each fiscal year
following the latest fiscal year following the report on households earning 30 percent or less of the
AMI until the Housing Successor demonstrates compliance with the Extremely-Low Income
requirement. This information is not required to be reported until 2019 for the 2014 – 2019 period.
X. SENIOR HOUSING TEST
The Housing Successor is to calculate the percentage of units of deed-restricted rental housing
restricted to seniors and assisted by the Housing Successor, the former redevelopment agency
and/or the City within the previous 10 years in relation to the aggregate number of units of deed-
restricted rental housing assisted by the Housing Successor, the former redevelopment agency
and/or City within the same time period. If this percentage exceeds 50 percent, then the Housing
Successor cannot expend future funds in the FUND to assist additional senior housing units until
the Housing Successor or City assists and construction has commenced on a number of restricted
rental units that is equal to 50 percent of the total amount of deed-restricted rental units. The
following provides the Housing Successor’s Senior Housing Test for the 10 year period of 2005 –
