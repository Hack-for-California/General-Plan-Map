     VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                            In “Building a City”, Rancho Cordova will:
      ¾ Have a place in the region as a vibrant destination;
      ¾ Control its destiny, including the establishment of meaningful boundaries;
      ¾ Become a catalyst for change and an example to other cities nationwide of excellence
           and innovation in government;
      ¾ Avoid the pitfalls of other cities, standing on the shoulders of past planning and city-
           building efforts, and gathering together the best ideas and programs from around the
           nation and around the world;
      ¾ Intentionally seek change in both land use and the scope of the City’s operations to
           effect profound improvement in the City; and
      ¾ Have measurable fiscal success and be able to provide the services and functions
           that make Rancho Cordova a desirable place to live, work, and play.
INTRODUCTION
Rancho Cordova is no ordinary City and this is no ordinary General Plan. The residents and
leaders of this community dare to dream of a brighter future and have set out to “Build a
City”. This General Plan serves as the blueprint to build this City.
Rancho Cordova incorporated in July 2003 with a desire for local control over land uses and
services. The City is centrally located in the Sacramento region with a strong job base and
an older housing stock that cannot house all of the City’s workforce. Rancho Cordova is
rich in history and community pride with a diverse population. As the City grows from a
population of 50,000 to more than 300,000 in the Planning Area, the City is focused on
maintaining a balanced and unified community, enhancing the City’s existing neighborhoods
and services, and becoming a vibrant destination place in the region.
                                                                            RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                                       I INTRODUCTION
             GENERAL PLAN
             PURPOSE
             California law requires each city to adopt a comprehensive, long-term General Plan to guide
             the physical development of the incorporated city and land outside city boundaries that bears
             a relationship to its planning activities. The General Plan serves as a blueprint for future
             growth and development; the blueprint to “Build a City”. As such, the plan contains policies
             and programs designed to provide decision makers with a solid foundation for land use and
             development decisions. The General Plan organizes the desires of Rancho Cordova residents
             with respect to the physical, social, economic, and environmental character of the City.
             In accordance with California Government Code Section 65302, a General Plan must address
             the issues of land use, circulation, housing, noise, safety, conservation, and open space. The
             General Plan also addresses topics of special and unique interest, including urban design,
             economic development, air quality, historic and cultural resources, infrastructure, services,
             and finance. These topics are optional, but reflect issues that are important to the
             community.
             According to state law, the General Plan is the primary document the City utilizes to regulate
             land use. Consequently, the Zoning Ordinance, Specific Plans, and individual public and
             private development proposals must be consistent with the General Plan goals, policies, and
             standards. This General Plan is the policy guide for the development (both public and
             private) of the City of Rancho Cordova. It is the basis for all land use decisions, including
             subdivisions, capital improvements, development agreements, and many other actions that
             must be consistent with this plan. The General Plan identifies the City’s land use, circulation,
             environmental, economic, and social goals and policies. It provides a basis for local
             government decision-making. Additionally, it informs citizens, developers, and decision-
             makers, as well as other jurisdictions and public agencies, of the ground rules that guide
             development within the City.
             THE PLANNING AREA
             The General Plan for the City of Rancho Cordova addresses all land both within the City
             limits and an area beyond the City that bears relation to the City’s planning efforts. This area
             is referred to as the General Plan Planning Area and is illustrated in Figure I-1. Roughly
             speaking, the General Plan Planning Area is defined as the City plus the developed areas of
2 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

                           I INTRODUCTION
Rosemont, Larchment, and Gold River, and the undeveloped areas south of Jackson
Highway and east of Grant Line Road.
The area outside of the current City limits represents an area that the City of Rancho
Cordova has an interest in guiding land use and circulation decisions for and is envisioned as
the area into which the incorporated City boundaries may eventually expand. Currently,
Sacramento County has jurisdiction and land use authority over land outside of the City
limits that is within the General Plan Planning Area. Additionally, the cities of Sacramento
and Folsom have General Plan Planning Area boundaries that overlap the boundaries of
Rancho Cordova General Plan Planning Areas. Through policy direction and
implementation of this General Plan, it is the City’s intent to enter into agreements for
cooperative land use and circulation planning for areas outside of the City’s jurisdiction that
have an impact on the City of Rancho Cordova.

                                        I INTRODUCTION
             ORGANIZATION                  AND     USE
             State law requires that certain topics, or elements, be covered in the General Plan. These
             include land use, circulation, housing, open space, conservation, safety, and noise. Additional
             topics may be covered at the discretion of the City, provided that all topics are elements are
             consistent with one another. Rancho Cordova has elected to include twelve elements in the
             General Plan. Table I-1 lists these elements and shows how they relate to the State
             requirements.
             Each of the City’s twelve Elements includes the following components:
                  •   Vision Statement. The Vision Statement reflects the community’s desires for the
                      City’s future relative to each individual element.
                  •   Introduction and Purpose. This section briefly explains what the Element is
                      intended to do and the reason for the particular Element.
                  •   Related Plans and Programs. This section highlights significant plans and
                      programs that are related to a particular element and explains the relationship of
                      such to the City’s General Plan.
                  •   Issues and Considerations. This section briefly explains the setting of the topic of
                      the element and outlines those real and perceived problems and concerns identified
                      by the community, as well as desires for change or growth.
                  •   Goals, Policies, and Actions. The goals are overall statements of community
                      desires and are comprised of broad statements of purpose or direction. The policies
                      serve as guides to the decision makers in reviewing development proposals and
                      making other decisions that affect the future growth and development of the City.
                      Actions are the implementation steps necessary to ensure the goals and policies are
                      carried out.
             The General Plan also includes several maps and tables that help to express and describe the
             vision, objectives, or key components of the plan. The Implementation Chapter establishes
             an implementation matrix identifying responsible parties, time frame, and funding sources for
             each of the action items from all of the City’s General Plan Elements. The Implementation
             Program is reviewed annually to update specific actions, schedules, responsible parties and
             measures to ensure that General Plan goals, policies and plans are implemented. The
             Glossary provides a set of definitions for technical terms used in the Plan.
             The organization of the General Plan allows users to easily locate issues of interest and
             quickly obtain a perspective on the City’s policies on the subject.

                                        I INTRODUCTION
             ANNEXATIONS                AND     PRE-ZONING
             This General Plan addresses all land both within the City limits and an area beyond the City
             that bears relation to the City’s planning efforts - the General Plan Planning Area. It is
             intended to be an area that the City has an interest in guiding land use decisions by the
             County of Sacramento and is envisioned as the area that the incorporated City boundaries
             may eventually expand.
             Included within the Planning Area, but outside the City limits, is the City’s Sphere of
             Influence. The Sphere of Influence is the probable physical boundaries and service area for
             the City, as determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo). The Sphere
             of Influence boundary includes all City lands and unincorporated lands that may be annexed
             as part of the ultimate development of the City.
             Any annexation of land into the City of Rancho Cordova would need to be consistent with
             the policies of this General Plan and approved by LAFCo. As part of the process of
             annexation the land in question will be prezoned. Any prezoning applied to an annexation
             area needs to be consistent with this General Plan.
             COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
                                     Over the last two years, the General Plan Team has engaged the
                                     community and its decision makers in more than 50 workshops,
                                     stakeholder meetings, study sessions, and public hearings to
                                     understand the vision and desires for Rancho Cordova and to develop
                                     the blueprint to build that future City. Hundreds of residents,
                                     employees, business owners, and other stakeholders have spent
                                     countless hours sharing ideas, expressing views, debating policies, and
                                     making hard decisions with the intent of creating a General Plan that is
                                     right for Rancho Cordova. Public participation on the development
             and review of the City’s General Plan is summarized below.
                 •    Visioning Workshops. The General Plan Team facilitated four Visioning
                      Workshops throughout the community to introduce the General Plan project,
                      provide context for Building a City, and to solicit input on desires for the future of
                      Rancho Cordova.

                    I INTRODUCTION
• Surveys. Three individual surveys were prepared for the General Plan as listed
  below. Each of the surveys was distributed at public and stakeholder group
  meetings and made available electronically on the City’s website.
  −    A General Plan Survey to better understand who lives here and why, as well as
       the likes and dislikes of the existing community (translated in Spanish and
       Russian).
  −    A Visual Preference Survey to better understand community preferences on
       urban design and community form.
  −    A Downtown Survey to better understand the desired role and targeted uses of
       a new Downtown Rancho Cordova.
• Stakeholder Meetings. The General Plan Team facilitated or
  attended several stakeholder meetings with property owners,
  Economic Development Committee, Chamber of Commerce,
  Neighborhood Associations, Local Community Organizations,
  Habitat 2020, Building Industry Association, SMUD, Air Quality
  District, and Walk Sacramento on a variety of topics during the
  development and review of the Draft General Plan.
• General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) Meetings. The GPAC held ten
  meetings on a variety of General Plan topics including the context of a future City
  and corresponding land use considerations, the “Building Block” concept
  (neighborhoods, villages, and districts), and the potential creation of a Downtown.
  The Committee also discussed housing issues, policies, and programs. In an effort
  to allow careful consideration of issues for each of the 12 General Plan Elements,
  the GPAC split into two groups for the identification of key
  issues the elements should solve and the review of
  preliminary goals and policies and diagrams (including the
  Land Use Map and conceptual land use plans for several
  Planning Areas). On April 20, 2006 the GPAC provided final
  comments and recommendations on the Draft General Plan
  for consideration and action by the Planning Commission
  and City Council.
• Planning Commission Public Hearings. As General Plan Advisory Committee
  members, the Planning Commissioners were engaged in the development and
  review of the General Plan. The Planning Commission held public hearings April
  13, 2006 regarding the adequacy of the Draft General Plan EIR and June 8, 2006 to
  provide a formal recommendation to the City Council on the project.
• City Council Study Sessions, Meetings, and Hearings. The City Council held
  22 meetings on the General Plan and adopted Interim General Plan documents
                                                                        RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 7

                                        I INTRODUCTION
                     including the Vision Book, Draft Land Use Map Book, and Draft Circulation Plan.
                     In April 2006, the City Council conducted two day-long study sessions with the
                     Planning Commission to review all 12 elements of the Draft General Plan. In May
                     2006, the City Council provided final policy direction to staff and directed staff to
                     proceed with required analysis prior to adoption of the General Plan and
                     certification of the EIR.
             THE VISION FOR RANCHO CORDOVA
                             Rancho Cordova will be known as a vibrant community where people love to
                             live, work and play. Rancho Cordova is not a suburb, not simply an
                             employment center – it is a City, a regional destination place. A healthy mix
                             of land uses, including public spaces, services, culture, open space and
                             recreation, in addition to well-planned roadways, public transportation routes
                             and trails will be emphasized in the City’s land use pattern. An integrated
                             network of neighborhoods, villages, and districts will be emphasized as
                             building blocks for the community’s growth and revitalization.
                               The City will have a unifying image and identity that reflects the pride in the
                               community history and the desire for a brighter future. The quality of the
                               built environment will be reflected in the character of the neighborhoods,
                               the walkable streets, the unified architectural details and landscaping, and the
                               dynamics of the public spaces. Vibrant mixed-use projects will be designed
                               for activity at the core of villages, districts, and transit stations. Residential
                               neighborhoods will include a diverse range of housing types that create a
                         strong sense of community and identity in a walkable environment.
                         All areas of the City will be served by public transit and easily accessible from the
                         City’s trail system. Civic spaces will provide a gathering place for socializing,
                         playing, and experiencing culture and music. Parks, schools, and other
                         community assets will be built into the neighborhoods and scaled and designed as
                         active neighborhood centers.
                       Downtown will be centrally located with compact mixed-use and transit-oriented
                       development, where residents and visitors can live, work, shop, dine, and be
                       entertained. The Downtown will be a lively and safe place to gather during the
                       day, at night, and on the weekends. The Downtown skyline will be visible from
                       surrounding jurisdictions.
8 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

                            I INTRODUCTION
Open spaces and creek corridors will provide connections to the
American River Parkway, Cosumnes River, the local trail system, and
other regional amenities in the area. Residents will be able to walk
from their homes to a local bus stop and ride transit to and from
work. Recreational opportunities will be available throughout the
community with trails, parks, and athletic facilities.
All age groups will be represented in the community. There will be
support services and activities for the young and old. Rancho
Cordova will be known for its multi-cultural presence in the region. It
will embrace the many cultures that define the community and its
history. The community’s history will be proudly displayed through
cultural events and public exhibits.
RANCHO CORDOVA                      IN   2050
What will the City of Rancho Cordova be like in 2050? Here are
examples of life in the community as it is envisioned by the residents
and the City’s decision-makers:
     •   Rancho Cordova will be easy to get around in. A wide
         variety of travel will be available, from light rail to personal
         vehicles to bicycling and walking. Traffic will be reduced,
         and drivers will find it easy to reach destinations in Rancho
         Cordova and outside the city.
     •   People will feel safe working, living, and playing in our
         community. Young people will have many options for
         activities, providing safe, healthy alternatives to crime and
         gang activity.
     •   The city will have an identifiable look and feel. You will know
         immediately that you are in Rancho Cordova—the quality of
         the built environment, the character of the neighborhoods, and
         the dynamics of the City’s public spaces will be a draw for
         persons throughout the region.
                                                                          RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 9

                                        I INTRODUCTION
                                      •   Rancho Cordova will be a city full of open spaces and
                                          opportunities for exercise and recreation. Trails and open spaces
                                          will be integrated into the City’s neighborhoods, linking people
                                          with shopping areas, public areas … and with other people.
                                          Civic gathering places will be focuses of activity, places where the
                                          community comes together to meet, to hear music and see plays,
                                          and to experience other cultures. Schools and parks will be
                                          integral parts of the community, providing additional
                                          opportunities for recreation, arts, or just peace and quiet.
                  •   Rancho Cordova will be a multicultural city that recognizes and celebrates the many
                      cultures that make up its neighborhoods. The City’s public spaces and commercial
                      areas will be important places for making connections with the people, foods, and
                      ideas of other cultures and nationalities.
                                                              •  The City will be an exciting place for
                                                                 residents of all ages. The City’s population
                                                                 will be older than it is today, with more
                                                                 maturing households, and the City will
                                                                 respond by providing a wider range of
                                                                 housing opportunities.
                                                              •  Rancho Cordova will have an identifiable
                                                                 downtown—a place where people gather
                                                                 to work, shop, enjoy a meal, and take part
                                                                 in civic and cultural events. Everyone will
                                                                 know where the downtown is, and the
                                                                 downtown will be a place that helps bring
                                                                 together the City’s residents.

                                 II LAND USE
     VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                            Rancho Cordova will be a series of walkable neighborhoods, villages,
 and districts, each with a center of activity that promotes interactions between residents,
 employees, and visitors. The City will create itself as a memorable destination, with a full
 range of entertainment and recreation opportunities. The City will provide a balanced mix of
 housing, jobs, commercial activities and services, as well as cultural and civic amenities.
 Rancho Cordova will foster an integrated mix of uses that are connected by lively streets and
 contiguous open space areas. Downtown Rancho Cordova will be the “heart” of the City - a
 place to celebrate diversity and community.
INTRODUCTION
Existing land use patterns in Rancho Cordova began during the Gold Rush and expanded
with the development of Mather Air Force Base and Aerojet. Regional growth patterns,
geography, and circulation have impacted the land uses that comprise the City’s current
development pattern. Rancho Cordova is a jobs rich community with regional transit and
recreational amenities. However, the City has an aging housing supply that does not meet the
needs of the existing workforce and the community lacks a full range of retail services and
entertainment venues.
The community wants to reinvent itself as a dynamic place with a new sense of identity and a
reputation as a vibrant regional destination. Rancho Cordova will establish land use patterns
that create a balanced land use mix and a desirable place to live, work, and play.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                                             II LAND USE
             PURPOSE
             The Land Use Element provides the central framework for the General Plan and serves as a
             compass to guide planners, the general public, and decision makers on the desired pattern of
             development in Rancho Cordova. It describes both existing and future land use activity, the
             latter of which was designed to achieve the City’s long-range goals for physical development.
             This Element also identifies the distribution, location, and intensity of all land uses types
             throughout the City. Text, maps, and diagrams establish the blueprint for future land uses
             within the City and describe how these uses are integrated with the other General Plan
             elements and policies.
             RELATED PLANS                  AND     PROGRAMS
             Formulation, adoption, and implementation of local land use policy require consideration of
             several related plans, programs, and agencies, both local and regional in nature. Relevant
             plans and agencies are summarized below.
                      Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) Blueprint Plan. SACOG
                       provides transportation planning and funding for the six-county greater Sacramento
                       region, and serves as a forum for the study and resolution of regional issues. The
                       SACOG Blueprint is a land use and transportation study of the Sacramento region
                       that focuses on development of walkable, transit-oriented communities that better
                       integrate jobs and housing to accommodate the projected growth and long-term
                       needs of the region over the next 50 years. The Preferred Blueprint Scenario was
                       adopted by SACOG in December 2004. It has influenced the Rancho Cordova land
                       use plans and will provide guidance to the funding of regional transportation
                       improvements.
                      Rancho Cordova General Plan Pro Forma (Pro Forma). The Pro Forma is a
                       fiscal impact analysis of the proposed General Plan intended to evaluate the
                       economic viability of proposed land uses and services. The Pro Forma was prepared
                       concurrently with the General Plan and will be used to determine the right balance
                       of land uses, along with the types and levels of services, as well as to evaluate future
                       proposed development projects.
                      Rancho Cordova Retail and Office Demand Analysis (Bay Area Economics).
                       Phase I of the City’s Pro Forma work included a market demand analysis for retail
                       and office development. The information was used in the strategic land planning to
2 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

                           II LAND USE
  ensure the right amount of retail and office land and development potential within
  the General Plan Planning Area.
 Rancho Cordova Retail Strategy (Leland Consulting Group). Based on the Pro
  Forma Retail Demand Analysis, the Strategy focuses on the location and distribution
  of retail centers. The strategy evaluates retail trends, tested for two general retail
  categories (grocery anchored centers and general merchandise centers), provides
  recommendations for type, scale, and location of retail centers that have been used
  in the City’s land use planning and will inform future planning efforts.
 City Zoning Code. The Zoning Code establishes districts throughout the
  community with allowed use and development standards. These development
  standards create the framework for the physical form of the community (e.g.,
  building setbacks, heights).
 Citywide Design Guidelines. The Design Guidelines supplement the Zoning
  Code development standards with more detailed provisions that direct the look and
  feel of development. The guidelines and standards govern the site and architectural
  character of development.
 Rancho Cordova Redevelopment Plan. The City’s Redevelopment Agency is
  currently preparing a Redevelopment Plan that will allow the Agency to collect tax
  increment revenue for the purpose of improving and redeveloping commercial and
  residential areas, and supporting the production of mixed-income housing in the
  City. The Redevelopment Plan Area is approximately 2,500 acres in size (see Figure
  ED-1).
 Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan. The Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan
  incorporates past planning efforts for revitalization of the corridor into a single
  action plan. The Specific Plan will include a detailed land plan with pulse points of
  activity, development and design provisions, streetscape improvements, economic
  strategies, cost estimates, and action steps for redevelopment of Folsom Boulevard.
 Mather Redevelopment Plan.                Sacramento County adopted the Mather
  Redevelopment Project Area and Mather Redevelopment Plan in 1995. The Project
  Area includes the Mather Airport, Independence at Mather, extensive parklands and
  the Mather Golf Course. The redevelopment strategy includes converting the
  former base to productive uses consistent with the Mather Specific Plan and
  Infrastructure and Financing Plan.
                                                                        RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

                                              II LAND USE
                     Mather Field Specific Plan. Sacramento County adopted the Mather Field Specific
                      Plan in May 1997 to provide guidance on the conversion of land uses in Mather
                      Field from military to civilian uses. The Specific Plan establishes specific
                      requirements for private and public development including the location, type,
                      intensity and character of land uses, circulation patterns, necessary infrastructure
                      improvements, and the location and general configuration of parks and open space.
                     Mather Airport Policy Area (MAPA). Sacramento County established the Mather
                      Airport Policy Area around Mather Field in 1998 as part of the County Noise
                      Element. The MAPA policies place additional development conditions on new
                      residential uses within the geographic boundaries of the MAPA, providing
                      protection to the airport and surrounding land uses beyond regulations of the of the
                      Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP)/Airport Land Use Plan (ALUP). The
                      MAPA prohibits new residential development within the CLUP/ALUP zones that
                      are subject to noise levels of 60 decibels (dB) community noise equivalent level
                      (CNEL) or above. Relevant measures are incorporated into the City’s Noise
                      Ordinance.
                     Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo). LAFCos are State-mandated
                      quasi-judicial countywide commissions. They oversee boundary changes of cities and
                      special districts, the formation of new agencies (including the incorporation of new
                      cities and districts), and the consolidation or reorganization of special districts and
                      cities.
                     California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA is the State’s
                      environmental review process that requires public agencies to identify the significant
                      environmental effects of a project and either avoid the significant environmental
                      effects, where feasible, or mitigate the significant environmental effects, where
                      feasible.
             RELATIONSHIP                 TO    OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
             The Land Use Element relates directly to all other elements of the General Plan. This
             Element establishes the planned land use pattern for Rancho Cordova based on historic
             development and the community’s vision for the future. Land use planning takes into
             consideration balanced housing needs and housing choices identified in the Housing
             Element. Natural and manmade hazards, development constraints, and conservation policies
             that affect the potential siting of the land uses are identified in the Safety and Natural
             Resources Elements. The open space policies of the City, including the integration of the
             parks and opens spaces into land planning, are outlined in the Open Space, Parks, and Trails
4 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

                                 II LAND USE
Element. Land use classifications and development standards in the Land Use Element
create a physical form related to the community design principles and aesthetic policies of
the Urban Design Element. Land use mix and distribution relate directly to the land use
economics outlined in the Economic Development Element. A circulation plan is
established in the Circulation Element to accommodate increased traffic from the planned
development outlined in the Land Use Element. The Cultural and Historic Resources
Element identifies locally important sites, buildings, and memorabilia and promotes the
inclusion of cultural arts into the built environment. Finally, the other General Plan
elements ensure that the infrastructure, services, and environmental quality standards
necessary for development are available to accommodate planned land uses.
ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
LAND USE SETTING
The City of Rancho Cordova is located entirely within the eastern portion of Sacramento
County, covering approximately 33.6 square miles and 20,071 acres (almost 3.3 percent of
the land area for the entire County). The Planning Area for the City of Rancho Cordova
General Plan contains the existing incorporated areas of the City and a larger study area
including the unincorporated area extending east to Prairie City Road, south to Jackson
Highway (SR 16), west to Watt Avenue, and north to the American River. The General Plan
Planning Area, with nearly 62,000 acres, is almost three times the size of the incorporated
City. Land uses south of the General Plan Planning Area include primarily agricultural land
and industrial land uses, while the remainder of the Planning Area boundaries is adjacent to
residential, commercial, and open space uses.
The General Plan Planning Area contains a mix of land uses: residential, commercial/retail,
office/business center, institutional (e.g., church, school), industrial/warehouse, drainage
channels/canals/levees, infrastructure (e.g., roads, utility corridors), commercial recreational,
and open space/preserve uses. The majority of the land is undeveloped and vacant land,
some of which contains existing agricultural uses. While the City does not currently have
jurisdiction over lands currently outside of the City boundary, it is the City’s intent to enter
into cooperative agreements on land use and circulation planning for areas outside of the
City’s jurisdiction.
Significant natural features in the General Plan Planning Area include the American River,
numerous creeks and streams, wetlands, and annual grasslands. Wetlands and annual
grasslands are prevalent throughout the undeveloped portion of the Planning Area.
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 5

                                              II LAND USE
             Morrison Creek, Laguna Creek, Alder Creek, and Frye Creek traverse the Planning Area.
             Other prominent land uses in the Planning Area include office parks along the Highway 50
             corridor; manufacturing and distribution facilities located along parts of Folsom Boulevard
             and Bradshaw Road; and Mather Airport, formerly known as Mather Air Force Base, which
             now operates as a public cargo airport. The majority of the former Mather Air Force Base,
             including the airport, a residential community known as Independence at Mather, and the
             Mather Regional Park are located outside the City Boundaries. The Mather Commerce
             Center, a business office complex associated with the airport, is located within the City.
             Generally east of Mather Airport is the Aerojet property, which constitutes the largest land
             use (13,000 acres) within the Planning Area and is located south of Folsom Boulevard
             between the Folsom South Canal and Prairie City Road.
             ISSUES THIS ELEMENT ATTEMPTS                                  TO    SOLVE
             The primary issues that this element attempts to solve are listed below. These are the
             significant land use issues and concerns that were raised during development of the General
             Plan.
                     Balancing the mix of land uses to ensure the City can house its workforce and
                      establish a fiscally viable future for the City.
                     Integrating residential, commercial, and office uses in an urban environment to
                      improve livability and to reduce urban sprawl.
                     Establishing more livable and sustainable neighborhoods where residents can walk to
                      commercial services and recreational amenities.
                     Creating a full range of retail shopping and commercial service opportunities in the
                      Planning Area so that all existing and future residents are able to meet their shopping
                      needs locally.
                     Unifying the community and ensuring mobility between areas separated by U.S.
                      Highway 50 and the Folsom South Canal.

         of the Planning Area to the south and east to define the City’s edge.
        Extend the benefits of growth to areas of the City developed prior to Incorporation
         in 2003.
        Invest in all areas of the City – financially, socially, and physically.
CONCEPTS             OF THE         CITY’S LAND USE PLAN
Smart Growth
One of the essential goals of the City is to ensure that future growth is smart growth. A City
is being built where quality of life and community balance are top priorities. Rancho
Cordova is striving to change the way development occurs so that all new development
positively improves the image and character of the City. Each building block of the
community (neighborhoods, villages, districts, and centers) will be developed in keeping with
the following nine Smart Growth Principles, which are described in more detail below.
        Balanced Land Uses
        Transportation Choices
        Housing Choices
        Integrated (Mixed) Land Uses
        Compact Urban Development
        Walkable Neighborhoods
                                                                                  RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 7

                                                II LAND USE
                      Preservation/Integration of Natural Resources
                      Quality Design/Sense of Place
                      Regeneration/Infill
             Balanced Land Uses
             Providing the right overall balance of land uses is a significant priority for the City.
             Residential, commercial, office, industrial, and public/quasi-public uses need to be provided
             throughout the entire community and should be sized commensurate with their service area.
             Retail shopping opportunities must be provided close to homes. Overall land planning
             activities must include consideration for public/quasi-public uses that may otherwise go
             unplanned (e.g., hospitals, utility and infrastructure substations, churches, etc). Balance also
             includes providing a range of housing choices throughout the community (see the Housing
             Element for additional discussion). A balanced community is a healthy community – one
             that can support itself over the long-term and provide the goods and services that residents
             need and expect. Additionally, when land use decisions affecting the land use balance in the
             community are made, they must be maintained with unwavering dedication in the face of
             market forces and development pressure.
             Transportation Choices
             As Rancho Cordova grows from a community of 50,000 people to a thriving City with a
             population of more than 300,000, the movement of people in and around the City will be a
             key issue. Walking, cycling, public transit, and driving will all be important modes of
             transportation. Residents, employees, and visitors of Rancho Cordova should have
             transportation choices in moving throughout the community and traveling to adjacent and
             nearby communities in the region. Streets will be designed to safely accommodate all modes
             of transportation; a continuous system of off-street trails will connect residential, commercial,
             office, community/civic, and open space areas of the City; a range of transit services (buses,
             trolleys, shuttles, light rail) will be accessible, safe, and efficient. Land use and transportation
             planning will go hand and hand to ensure that transportation choices are integrated into the
             land planning and implementation of future Rancho Cordova.
             Housing Choices
             In order to meet a diverse housing demand, the City will need to diversify its existing housing
             supply. Approximately 60 percent of the existing housing is single-family with a typical
             density of approximately five units per acre. The remaining 40 percent of the City’s existing
             housing supply is predominantly multi-family. The City lacks executive housing, large lot
8 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

                                  II LAND USE
single-family homes, higher density single-family homes (e.g., town homes, zero lot lines),
condominiums, luxury apartments, housing for seniors, and mixed-use housing above
ground floor retail or office. New development and redevelopment of housing within the
City will need to integrate a range of housing types and densities within each neighborhood
to improve housing choices throughout the community.
Integrated (Mixed) Land Uses
Mixed use is the vertical and/or horizontal integration of residential, commercial, office,
and/or community/civic uses within the same development. By integrating or mixing these
compatible uses in close proximity to one another, the City will create desirable places for
people to live, work, shop, and play. Land use categories herein include mixed-use
designations to encourage integration of uses. Additionally, the “building block” concept of
neighborhoods, villages, and districts served by centers in walking distance of residents
ensures horizontal integration of compatible uses.
Compact Urban Development
The General Plan encourages compact urban development within core areas of the City.
Compact development uses less land than conventional development for a more efficient
land use pattern conducive to the integration of compatible uses in close proximity.
Compact urban development helps to improve air quality; reduce traffic congestion; promote
transit ridership; and provide public services, including most public utilities, at a lower cost
per unit or square foot. Compact communities also have a higher per-square-foot market
value than traditional communities. In order to ensure a clear edge to the City, land use
density and intensity will transition down toward the southern and eastern boundaries of the
General Plan Planning Area.
Walkable Neighborhoods
Walkable neighborhoods are areas where residents can easily walk from their homes to
schools, parks, jobs, and shopping areas. In Rancho Cordova, a child should be able to walk
or ride a bike a short distance to school, the park, or a market without having to cross many
busy streets. Wherever possible, streets will be designed as pedestrian-friendly spaces with
living spaces and storefronts facing the street and landscape enhancements. Neighborhood
streets will be designed for slower speeds and pedestrian crossings at key locations. Off street
trails and enhanced street sidewalks will connect neighborhoods to parks, open space, and
natural resource areas. Walkable communities provide numerous personal and social
benefits, such as lower transportation costs, greater social interaction, improved personal and
environmental health, and expanded consumer choice.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 9

                                             II LAND USE
              Protection/Integration of Natural Resources with Urban Land Uses
              Natural resources are a valued amenity within Rancho Cordova. Natural habitats are places
              where plants and animals unique to Rancho Cordova and the region thrive. The City will
              strive to balance preservation and development interests effectively in order to maintain
              valuable resources through the design of land plans and the siting of natural resource
              protection areas.
              Quality Design/Sense of Place
              One of the most important aspects of creating community character and sense of identity is
              through the quality of project design. Rancho Cordova adopted design guidelines and
              requires design review to ensure that new development and redevelopment improves the
              aesthetics of the community. Quality design is not simply about the architectural style, colors,
              and materials of a building, but also the site design, public realm, and relationship to
              surroundings. All development should be designed to contribute to the character of the
              community and to create a unique and memorable place that is inviting to residents,
              employees, and visitors.
              Regeneration/Infill
              While the majority of land in the General Plan Planning Area is currently undeveloped,
              revitalization of existing neighborhoods and commercial areas is a significant priority in
              Rancho Cordova. The City will establish incentives and programs for redevelopment/infill
              development within existing Rancho Cordova.
              Building Blocks of the City
              In building the City, several basic elements are needed. These elements are considered the
              City’s “building blocks”, which are the neighborhoods, villages, and districts throughout the
              community (See Figure LU-1). Each of the building blocks is described in detail below.
              Overall, the building blocks concept is a system that attempts to ensure walkable, livable, and
              sustainable development in both existing and new areas of the community.

                    BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE CITY
Neighborhoods
Neighborhoods are the most basic building block of the City (Figure LU-2). They are
predominantly residential and are made up primarily of single-family homes (attached and
detached), but may also include smaller multi-
family units. While the average density is
approximately six units per acre, diversity in                   FIGURE LU-2
housing choices is critical to the success of                   N EIGHBORHOODS
neighborhoods (e.g., range of lot and home sizes,
diversity in housing products/costs).
Neighborhoods are compact and walkable in
design, scaled at approximately one-third mile in
radius with an average size of about 200 acres. The
residential population of the neighborhood
building block is approximately 4,000 people.
                                                                         RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 11
                                              II LAND USE
              The small scale of neighborhoods allows residents to walk almost anywhere in the
              neighborhood in about 15 minutes. Parents feel safe letting their children play outside
              because traffic is local in nature and development is designed so that, even indoors, people
              are focused on the streets and public areas of development. Local streets are designed with a
              modified grid pattern that includes short blocks, offering a variety of paths to and from the
              major roadways. This street system disperses traffic among all the streets, creating greater
                                                      variety in route choices and diffusing traffic
                                                      throughout the neighborhood.
            FIGURE LU-3
                 VILLAGES                             Neighborhoods also include many amenities, such as
                                                      trails and local parks. Their major feature is the
                                                      “neighborhood center,” which is a gathering place for
                                                      residents. These centers are usually defined by
                                                      schools, neighborhood parks, community centers, or
                                                      small commercial outlets serving local residents (e.g.,
                                                      coffee shops, small markets). They are places where
                                                      people come together to socialize and participate in
                                                      community events and activities. They are dynamic
                                                      uses that help to create a sense of place within the
                                                      neighborhood.
              Villages
              A cluster of three to four neighborhoods comprises a village, which is generally about 750
              acres in size (Figure LU-3). The neighborhoods within a village are connected by a series of
              trails and pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly streets that make walking and bicycle-riding a
              pleasant experience. Single-family and multi-family residential areas within a village are
              integrated seamlessly with a concentration of higher-density development near activity
              centers.
              With a residential population of between 12,000 and 15,000 persons, this cluster of
              neighborhoods is supported by a “village center” that serves the daily shopping needs of
              residents. Village centers are five- to fifteen-acre pedestrian-oriented developments with
              smaller parking fields and buildings located in proximity to the street. Village center uses
              may include small- and medium-size grocery stores, drug stores, restaurants, banks, and other
              similar uses. Typically, no single tenant in a village center is larger than 50,000 square feet to
              ensure a local, rather than a Citywide or regional, retail focus. Village centers are sized and
              located to encourage local markets and support services in proximity to all residents of the
              village.

                                  II LAND USE
Districts
Districts are comprised of three or four villages, with a
corresponding residential population of approximately
45,000 people (Figure LU-1). Villages within each                       FIGURE LU-4
district generally share a common geography and are               DISTRICT IN RANCHO
designed to connect trails, parks, open space, and                          CORDOVA
activity centers serving the district. Using these
guidelines, there are about ten or twelve districts
throughout the City separated by Highway 50, Jackson
Highway, Grant Line Road, and other major
thoroughfares within the General Plan Planning Area.
Conceptual district locations are shown in Figure LU-
4 for illustrative purposes only. Subsequent policies
and actions in the Land Use, Urban Design, and
Economic Development Elements encourage the use
of district themes or common identifiable
characteristics to unify these geographic areas.
At the heart of the district is a “town center.” Town centers are vibrant activity centers that
serve the major retail and entertainment needs of the district. They are mixed-use
destination places with both daytime and nighttime activity. In addition to retail, service,
restaurant, office, and residential uses, town centers may include special uses that serve a
Citywide or regional demand (e.g., entertainment, sports/fitness). Town centers are
pedestrian-oriented developments focused on public gathering places. Described below are
three distinct types of town centers that serve different purposes within the City’s building
block framework.
        Local Town Center. Local town centers are the most prevalent and fundamental
         type of town center. They provide most of the commercial shopping needs of the
         district and are designed to supplement village centers with retail, service, and
         entertainment needs for a larger population. Local town centers are typically
         between 15 and 30 acres in size and will probably not include uses such as grocery
         stores that are provided in the village centers. Rather, general retail and restaurant
         uses are envisioned for the local town center (e.g., clothing stores, book/music
         stores).
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 13

                       Regional Town Center. Regional town centers are designed to meet a regional
                        need for shopping, entertainment, and other large destination uses (e.g., sports
                        arena). They are strategically located for accessibility and range in size from 25 to 100
                        acres.
                       Transit-Oriented Town Center. Transit-oriented town centers are sited along
                        existing or potential light rail or bus-rapid-transit routes, and specifically near stations
                        for transit services. They are multi-story, mixed-use developments that provide new
                        housing opportunities and practical alternatives to automobile mobility. The highest
                        residential densities in the City are usually located here. Office uses may also be
                        located at these sites, attracting people from other areas of the City and region.
                        Structured, shared parking is common in transit-oriented town centers.
              THE LAND USE PLAN
              The future land use plan for Rancho Cordova consists of both the text of this Element and
              the accompanying Land Use Map (Figures LU-5 and LU-6). The Map graphically illustrates
              the desired land uses for each parcel in the City and the General Plan Planning Area.
              Although uses are plotted for all property within the Planning Area, only land within the
              jurisdiction of the City is regulated by these land uses.
              The first figure (LU-5) illustrates the General Plan land use designations for most of the
              General Plan Planning Area developed prior to the City’s Incorporation in 2003. This map is
              parcel based with a specific land use category applied to each parcel. Subsequent zoning and
              new development/redevelopment must comply with the General Plan land use designation.
              Figure LU-6 identifies 16 individual planning areas within the General Plan Planning Area
              with unique characteristics/features that warrant more detailed planning efforts. Each of the
              16 Planning Areas is listed in the Land Use Element with a description of land uses,
              environmental conditions, and target residential and employment populations. A few of the
              Planning Areas include parcel specific land use designations (Land Plans), but the majority of
              Planning Areas include Conceptual Land Plans and require subsequent master planning prior
              to development (e.g., Specific Plan, Special Planning Area). Conceptual Land Plans are not
              discrete land uses like the land use categories plotted in Figure LU-5; rather, they reflect the
              City’s Building Block concepts and relevant goals, policies, and actions applied to known
              constraints/opportunities and act as place holders for more detailed land planning.

Land Use Classifications
The City’s land use designations reflect the building blocks concept of neighborhoods,
villages, and districts, and establish several mixed-use designations in accordance with the
smart growth principles espoused in this Element. Land use designations are organized into
categories of agriculture, residential, public/quasi-public and open space, non-residential and
mixed-use, industrial, and other designations, which are applied to individual properties as
shown on the General Plan Land Use Map. Development standards corresponding to each
land use designation reflect desired development patterns throughout the City.
A variety of land uses are established to reflect the more mixed and, in some cases, more
intense land uses envisioned for the City. These mixed-use categories provide the
opportunity to combine residential, commercial, and office uses on a single site (depending
on the designation). In some instances, the mixing may be horizontal (e.g., residential uses
next to commercial uses), while in others it may be vertical (e.g., residential use above
commercial use in a multi-story building). It is anticipated that compact, mixed-use
development will become the standard pattern of development in greenfield areas and within
core areas of the City. The appropriateness of more compact mixed-use development for
infill and redevelopment areas will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Agriculture Categories
General Agriculture
Lands within the General Agriculture category are set aside for commercial-
level agricultural production. Sites for General Agriculture are considered
economically viable for farming operations.
Rural Agriculture
The Rural Agriculture category allows agricultural activities and is designed as a
transition category between intensive agricultural activities (as under the
General Agriculture category) and residential uses. Allowed uses include very-
low density (10 acre lot) agricultural residential use.
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 17

                            City, where urban development meets the rural portions of the region. Large,
                            ranchette-style homes on two- to ten-acre lots are the predominant use.
                            Farming activities may be found on these lots, but the activities are not
                            intensive and do not interfere with the residential nature of the category.
                            Estate Residential
                            The Estate Residential category is characterized by larger, “executive”-style
                            homes on generous lots. This designation can provide a smooth transition
                            between the rural areas of the City and the more intensively developed
                            neighborhoods or be located inside urban development at carefully selected
                            locations. Estate residential areas are typically sited near community amenities
                            or natural features.
                            Low Density Residential
                            The Low Density Residential category represents the traditional single-family
                            neighborhood with a majority of single-family detached homes. This is the
                            predominant land use category of the City’s neighborhoods.
                            Medium Density Residential
                            The Medium Density Residential category is generally characterized by small lot
                            single-family detached, single-family attached (e.g., town homes,
                            condominiums, brownstones), and small apartment complexes. Medium
                            Density development is often found as part of a village development.
                            High Density Residential
                            High density residential is the most urban residential category available. The
                            predominant style of development is larger multi-family housing complexes,
                            including apartments and condominiums. Vertical mixed-use projects with
                            residential use are typically developed in the high-density category. Parking for
                            these facilities is usually provided in traditional surface lots located around the
                            complex. At higher densities, parking may be in a parking structure or
                            underground.

                                  II LAND USE
Public/Quasi-Public and Open Space Categories
Public/Quasi-Public
The Public/Quasi-Public category covers a variety of public and other land uses, including
land owned by the City and other public agencies. Possible uses include civic buildings;
schools, colleges, and universities; religious institutions; hospitals; museums; cemeteries; and
others. Most buildings in this category are high profile and prominent within the
community. In order to meet future community needs, new development projects should
include public/quasi-public sites for future, undetermined uses.
Parks and Open Space
Land within the Parks and Open Space category is designed to be used for
both active and passive recreational activities, such as parks, lakes, golf courses,
and trails. Typically parklands are under the jurisdiction of the Cordova
Recreation and Park District; however, they may be commercial recreational
facilities that are principally oriented toward outdoor uses. Typically, public
open space lands will be administered by the City, but may be held in either
public or private ownership. Land within this category may also be used for
detention basins, creek ways, and other more passive uses when collocated next to active
recreational uses or when open spaces serve two uses, such as a ball field in the summer and
a detention basin in the winter.
Natural Resources
Land within the Natural Resources category is set aside as natural habitat and
typically has no urban development on it. Often, open space trails will be sited
adjacent to Natural Resource areas.
Non-Residential and Mixed-Use Categories
Residential Mixed-Use
The Residential Mixed-Use category is characterized by predominantly
residential development at medium to high densities. It allows for commercial
or office uses to be co-located on the same property either vertically or
horizontally. It does not preclude solely residential development within the
category, but rather encourages a mixing of uses.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 19

                             Commercial Mixed-Use
                             The Commercial Mixed-Use category encourages the integration of retail and
                             service commercial uses with office and/or residential uses. In mixed-use
                             projects, commercial use is the predominant use on the ground floor. Parking
                             for mixed-use projects may be combined or separated, depending on the
                             characteristics of the project. This listing may also include hospitals and other
                             public/quasi-public uses.
                             Office Mixed-Use
                             The Office Mixed-Use category encourages the integration of commercial
                             and/or residential use in conjunction with office use of a site. In any case,
                             office uses are the predominant use, but others may be included in a vertical or
                             horizontal configuration. For example, a site may be developed with an office
                             building that is three or four stories but where the ground floor is occupied by
                             one or more retail and restaurant uses. This listing may also include hospitals
                             and other public/quasi-public uses.
                             Village Center
                             The Village Center category provides daily shopping needs to residents within
                             a village as described in the City’s building blocks concept. Typical uses include
                             small to medium sized grocery stores, drug stores, dry cleaners, and coffee
                             shops. This category also allows for the integration of office, public/quasi-
                             public, and/or residential use in conjunction with the predominant commercial
                             uses of the site. Development is pedestrian-friendly and oriented toward the
                             street.
                             Local Town Center
                             The Local Town Center category provides retail services, restaurant, and
                             entertainment uses within a district as described in the City’s building block
                             concept. Typical uses include a combination of general retail, restaurant, office,
                             and residential uses. This category may also include large retail stores, lodging,
                             entertainment, public/quasi-public, and indoor and outdoor recreational
                             facilities. Residential densities are medium to high in nature. Development is
              pedestrian friendly with gathering places for both daytime and nighttime activities.

                                  II LAND USE
Regional Town Center
The Regional Town Center category is generally characterized by a horizontal
or vertical mix of integrated retail, office, and residential uses that serve both
the entire City and the region, with population bases of at least 100,000 people.
Large retail stores, restaurants, public/quasi-public uses, and entertainment
venues are common. Regional town centers are vibrant destination places for
the entire region and foster an active nightlife.
Local Transit-Oriented Development
The Local Transit-Oriented Development category is located near an existing
or future light rail transit, bus rapid transit, or other major mass transit route
stop. Development within this category is generally characterized by a vertical
or horizontal integration of office, retail, and residential uses in one or more
multi-story structures. Public/quasi-public uses are also permitted in this
category. Uses should be designed to support alternatives to
vehicle/automotive circulation.
Regional Transit-Oriented Development
The Transit Oriented Development category is located next to an existing or
future light rail transit, bus rapid transit, or other major mass transit route
stop. Development within this category is generally characterized by a vertical
integration of office, retail, public/quasi-public, and residential uses in one or
more multi-story structures. These sites provide housing, retail, and
employment opportunities and practical alternatives to vehicle mobility.
Regional transit-oriented developments differ from local transit-oriented developments in
that they have a higher intensity of development, uses scaled more toward a regional market,
and experience higher boarding levels onto the mass transit system at their associated station.
Industrial Categories
Light Industrial
Uses within the Light Industrial category generally include industrial or
manufacturing activities that occur entirely within an enclosed building. This
category also includes warehousing activities or distribution centers, but
excludes corporation yards. Employee intensive operations (e.g., research and
development) that would otherwise not occur within the Office Mixed-Use
designation are permitted. This listing may also include hospitals and other
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 21

                             Heavy Industrial
                             Uses within the Heavy Industrial category include industrial or manufacturing
                             activities that may occur inside or outside of a building or structure. This
                             category includes corporation yards and surface mining and related operations.
                             Surface Mining
                             The Surface Mining category allows for surface mining activities. It is a long-
                             term designation applied to areas where surface mining will be occurring for
                             more than ten years.
              Other Designations
              Planning Areas
              The General Plan Land Use Map establishes a series of 16 individual Planning Areas –
              Aerojet Planning Area, Countryside/Lincoln Village Planning Area, Downtown Planning
              Area, East Planning Area, Folsom Boulevard Planning Area, Glenborough Planning Area,
              Grant Line North Planning Area, Grant Line South Planning Area, Grant Line West
              Planning Area, Jackson Planning Area, Mather Planning Area, Rio del Oro Planning Area,
              Suncreek/Preserve Planning Area, Sunrise Boulevard North Planning Area, Sunrise
              Boulevard South Planning Area, and Westborough Planning Area. Land uses within these
              Planning Areas are described in general and mapped either with land use plans (e.g.
              Countryside/Lincoln Village Planning Area) or conceptual land use plans (e.g. Rio del Oro
              Planning Area) in the Planning Areas discussion of this Element. In most cases, the Planning
              Area designation is intended to direct further planning efforts in greenfield areas where
              detailed land planning will be evaluated in conjunction with subsequent development
              applications, including:
                      Specific Plans; and
                      Special Planning Areas.
              Convention Overlay
              The Convention Overlay defines an area around the intersection of Sunrise Boulevard and
              Folsom Boulevard (as shown in Figure LU-7), which supplements any underlying General
              Plan land use designation or zoning district. Uses located within the area of the overlay are
              intended to foster and support a convention center district, including hotels, restaurants, and
22 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

                                 II LAND USE
meeting spaces. Retail and office uses are not excluded from the Convention area, provided
that they contribute to and support the creation of a convention center. This includes the
use of retail and/or office as a ground floor use with a hotel or meeting spaces above.
Higher density (multiple-story) residential uses are also permitted. Development is often
multi-story with pedestrian connections throughout (e.g., sidewalks, catwalks, bridges, etc).
The intent is that no development stands alone. The development of single-story concrete
tilt-ups is highly discouraged. Meeting rooms may be found on the ground floor of buildings
with offices or residential above. Additionally, the Convention Overlay area is a prime
location for locating a performing arts and entertainment center/complex in the City.

Redevelopment Overlay
The City has established a Redevelopment Plan and Redevelopment Area, as described in the
Economic Development Element. The plan area is approximately 2,500 acres (see Figure
ED-1) and includes portions of Folsom Boulevard, the Trade Center Drive Area, the
Coloma Boulevard corridor, the Zinfandel Drive Corridor, the Lincoln Village area, and the
area located between Old Placerville Road, International Drive, White Rock Road, and
Highway 50, including the Downtown. The Redevelopment Plan will facilitate and help
finance redevelopment efforts in the City for maximum economic benefit.

              Land Use Development Standards
              State General Plan law requires that the Land Use Element specify the maximum densities
              and intensities permitted within the Land Use Plan. The land use designations shown on the
              Land Use Map are described in detail in this Element. Table LU-1 lists each of the land use
              designations shown on the Land Use Map and provides a corresponding indication of
                                                 maximum density or intensity of development, minimum
                                                 and maximum floor area ratio, and maximum height.

                FAR represents the ratio
                between the total gross floor
                area of all buildings on a lot
                and the total land area of
                that lot. For example, a
                20,000 square foot building
                on a 40,000 square foot lot
                yields a FAR of 0.50:1. A
                0.50:1 FAR describes a
                single-story building that
                covers half of the lot, or a
                two-story building covering
                approximately one-quarter of
                the lot.

GENERAL PLAN                            AND          ZONING CONSISTENCY
The Zoning Code serves as the primary tool for implementing the City’s General Plan land
use policy. State planning law requires the Zoning Code to be consistent with the General
Plan. Each General Plan land use category must have one or more corresponding zoning
district, and the development standards and land use regulations contained in the Zoning
Code must reflect the policy statements in the Land Use Element. While the General Plan
may be somewhat broad in its discussion of permitted land uses and development intensities,
zoning provisions must identify specific regulations so that property owners and developers
can determine how particular properties can be used and developed. The following table
identifies the relationships between land use categories and zoning districts.

              PLANNING AREAS
              There are 16 individual Planning Areas as part of the General Plan Land Use Map. Land
              uses within these Planning Areas are described in general and mapped with detailed or
              conceptual land plan. Each Planning Area has unique characteristics, opportunities, and
              constraints. The Planning Areas were established based on several criteria, including existing,
              proposed, or approved project boundaries; location within the General Plan Planning Area;
              ownership; type of existing or proposed land uses; distinctive issues; and geographic or
              environmental features.
              Additional information on each of the 16 Planning Areas is provided at the end of this
              element with discussion of land uses, environmental conditions, and target residential and
              employment populations. Each Planning Area also includes either a detailed or conceptual
              land plan to guide subsequent development of the area. Detailed planning efforts (e.g.,
              Specific Plans) will be required for implementation of the majority of Planning Areas after
              the General Plan is adopted. Subsequent planning efforts will establish land use and
              circulation patterns; explore infrastructure, phasing, and financing issues; and determine that
              use, development, and design are consistent with the City’s General Plan. General
              information and population and employment assumptions will serve as a guide for future
              land use designations and development within each of the Planning Areas.
              For three of the Planning Areas located in developed areas of the City (Countryside/Lincoln
              Village, Sunrise North, and Sunrise South), the land use plans are not conceptual in nature.
              Instead, they represent the actual General Plan land use designations for individual parcels.
              For these three Planning Areas, no additional land use planning process is required.
              Conceptual land use plans for undeveloped areas of the City are intended to reflect the
              creation of new livable neighborhoods like those described by the building block concept and
              to adhere to the Council’s direction to transition the density and intensity of development
              near the edge of the General Plan Planning Area. The residential land use categories shown
              on the conceptual land use maps are consolidated into three categories as follows:
                      Residential-Mixed Density - includes the range of densities associated with typical
                       neighborhood development,
                      Residential-Estate/Rural - represents the range of lower densities associated with
                       edge neighborhood development, and
                      Residential-Higher Density - signifies higher density residential development
                       located near village and town centers.

                                  II LAND USE
The conceptual land use plans also show general locations of natural resource areas, areas
constrained by the Mather overflight zone, sites for additional employment opportunities,
and desirable locations for retail development. The density, intensity, scale, boundaries, and
exact location of above listed uses are conceptual only. Village center, local town center, and
regional town center locations reflect analysis of retail demand and strategic location. It is
anticipated that additional retail capacity and market opportunities will be incorporated into
the subsequent master planning of these areas. Final land uses and locations will be
determined in conjunction with subsequent planning applications for master land use plans.
While the General Plan contains conceptual land uses for each of the 16 Planning Areas,
some of the Planning Areas are located outside the City limits. The land use designations
endorsed by the General Plan for the Planning Areas located outside the City limits are
merely advisory in nature. The General Plan does not change land use designations for land
located outside of the City’s jurisdiction.
LAND USE POTENTIAL                       AND     POPULATION ESTIMATES
The General Plan establishes the development envelope for buildout of the Planning Area.
Table LU-3 provides a summary of acreage, dwelling units, corresponding density and
population (including percentages) for a land within the City limits, land outside the City
limits, and total Planning Area. Almost 30 percent of the land and nearly 60 percent of the
planned housing and population are located within the existing City limits.
Table LU-4 provides a breakdown of acreage by individual land use category for land within
the City limits and the entire Planning Area. These acreage figures include both parcel
specific land use designations and a summary of general assumptions about conceptual land
uses in many of the City’s 16 Planning Areas. Assumptions are consistent with the vision,
principles, and policies of the General Plan as reflected in the PLACE3S land use model.
Table LU-5 establishes the development potential for each of the 16 Planning Areas. Three
of the Planning Areas (Countryside/Lincoln Village, Sunrise Boulevard North and Sunrise
Boulevard South Planning Area) have specific land plans with parcel specific designations
that collectively establish a development capacity for those Planning Areas. The other 13
Planning Areas have conceptual land use plans that reflect the vision, goals, and policies of
the General Plan. Development capacity for those planning areas was estimated using the
PLACE3S land use model with blended place types intended to allow flexibility in the
ultimate implementation of the General Plan in those areas. Each of those Planning Areas
will be required to develop more specific land plans consistent with the General Plan and
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 29

              this table establishes the development capacity for which subsequent plans must comply to
              be found consistent with the General Plan and corresponding environmental evaluation.
              Finally, Table LU-6 provides more detailed information about existing conditions and phased
              build out of the General Plan with regards to residential units, population, non-residential

              PLANNING AREA DESCRIPTIONS AND
              MAPS
              As previously discussed in the Land Use Plan Section, there are 16 individual Planning
              Areas as part of the General Plan Land Use Map. The Planning Areas were established
              based on several criteria, including existing, proposed, or approved project boundaries;
              location within the General Plan Planning Area; ownership; type of existing or proposed
              land uses; distinctive issues; and geographic or environmental features. Each Planning
              Area warrants the incorporation of special provisions or consideration as the City
              develops. This Section of the Land Use Element includes information regarding land
              uses, environmental conditions, and development capacity for each of the City’s 16
              Planning Areas.
              Three of the Planning Areas (Countryside/Lincoln Village, Sunrise Boulevard North and
              Sunrise Boulevard South Planning Area) include specific land plans with parcel specific
              General Plan land use designations. In these cases, no additional master planning is
              required. However, subsequent development within those Planning Areas will be required
              to comply with the relevant provisions of the Planning Area description. The remaining
              13 Planning Areas include conceptual land plans that reflect the vision, goals, and policies
              of the General Plan, but rely on more detailed subsequent land use planning (Specific Plan,
              Special Planning Area, or similar planning tool) prior to development to ensure
              implementation consistent with the General Plan. The conceptual land use plans are
              intended to provide an illustrative representation of future land use.
              Conceptual land use plans include general land use categories that reflect the City’s
              Building Blocks Concept of neighborhoods, villages, and districts, taking into
              consideration known site opportunities and constraints (e.g., geographic location,
              environmental conditions, retail strategy). With the exception of a few residential
              categories, the land use designations on the conceptual land use plans are consistent with
              the General Plan land use designations. Exceptions include two broad residential
              categories: Residential – Mixed Density (R-MD) and Residential – Estate/Rural (R –
              E/R). These categories are intended to represent a mix of residential densities with target
              average densities in the medium density and very low density range, respectively.
              Conceptual land use plans also include general locations for retail services in the form of
              Village Centers, Local Town Centers, and Regional Town Centers. These locations were
              plotted consistent with a retail market analysis estimating retail demand for build out of
              the General Plan, along with a retail strategy identifying best opportunity sites for the
              neighborhood serving retail, community or district serving retail, and regional retail.

However, these retail locations are conceptual in nature and may be adjusted, relocated, or
expanded as part of the subsequent land use planning effort. Additionally, where retail sites
are located at intersections on the conceptual land use map, it is not assumed that there
would be four retail parcels on each corner of the intersection. Rather, that the exact
location, scale and design of the retail sites would be evaluated in conjunction with
subsequent land use plans. Finally, the General Plan assumes additional retail capacity and
expects that additional retail sites will be proposed in conjunction with subsequent land
planning projects to respond to local and regional growth, as well as new and changing
market opportunities.
Table LU-5 establishes the development potential in terms of dwelling units, density,
population, and employment for each of the 16 Planning Areas. As explained in the Land
Use Plan section, development capacity assumes the development envelope for the Planning
Area consistent with the General Plan and corresponding environmental analysis. Each of
those Planning Areas will be required to develop more specific land plans consistent with the
General Plan and this table establishes the development capacity for which subsequent plans
must comply to be found consistent with the General Plan and corresponding environmental
evaluation.

AEROJET PLANNING AREA
Note: This Area is OUTSIDE the existing City Limits.
Conceptual Land Uses
The Aerojet Planning Area is the site of the Aerojet/GenCorp
operations. The historic and ongoing uses of the site necessitate
the requirement for soil remediation and other toxic cleanup
activities that will not be completed during the lifetime of this
Plan. Portions of the area are ideal for continued industrial, research and development, and   Development Stats

Planning Area along an extension of Hazel Avenue.                                              Employment: 4,570
If the Aerojet operations ever require less land area, then some portions of the Planning
Area that border onto other Planning Areas where medium to high intensity development is
proposed (e.g. Easton, Westborough, and Rio del Oro) may be developed in a manner
similar to those areas, but at decreased densities. The conceptual land use plan for the
Aerojet Planning area shows the area designated for light and heavy industrial uses.

              Conceptual Circulation and Transit
              An extension of Hazel Avenue will be the primary circulation feature of the Aerojet
              Planning Area. Neighborhood and village developments along the periphery of the Area
              would best be served, from a circulation standpoint, by those areas.
              Environmental Conditions
              The Aerojet Planning Area has been used for rocket testing and operations since the
              1950’s. The majority of the Aerojet Planning Area is constrained by the Aerojet General
              Corp. Superfund site. The Superfund site encompasses groundwater contamination and
              potential soil contamination associated with past operations at Aerojet. Cleanup of the
              area under Superfund would be required before development can occur.
              The Aerojet Planning Area contains mine tailings, vernal pools, Buffalo Creek and Rebel
              Hill Ditch, and the Mather Airport safety zones (Figure LU-9). Impacts to vernal pools
              would require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Impacts to
              streams/creeks may require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or a
              Streambed Alteration Agreement from the Department of Fish and Game.

              Timing
              Because of the ongoing uses of the site, it is foreseeable that intense development will not
              occur within the Planning Area for more than 40 years – outside the timeframe of this
              Plan. Development along the edges of the Area is more likely, in conjunction with
              neighboring development. The Hazel Avenue extension may be completed in the next 15
              years.

Note: This Area is INSIDE the existing City Limits.
Land Use Patterns
Unlike other Planning Areas in the City, this Planning Area is almost
entirely developed and includes primarily residential development.
Existing residential development contains a high concentration of low and
moderate-income households with limited east-west connectivity. This

public uses into the park site on Routier. Along Old Placerville Road and Rockingham
Drives, target land uses include a variety of office and commercial mixed-use developments.
The Land Use Plan for Countryside-Lincoln Village shows a Village Center development on
the northeast corner of Bradshaw and Old Placerville Road. Further north along Bradshaw
Road, there are several commercial mixed-use sites intended for smaller, neighborhood
serving commercial, office, and residential uses. A new Residential Mixed-Use designation is
shown along Routier surrounding the new school site. At the intersection of Routier and
Old Placerville Road, the new office mixed-use designation will allow for existing and new
offices to be developed with commercial and/or residential uses integrated horizontally or
vertically. Finally, the commercial mixed-use designation along Mather Field Road and
Rockingham Drive is intended to expand development opportunities for existing low density
commercial and office sites.
Conceptual Circulation and Transit
Major roadways serving this Planning Area include Bradshaw Road, Old Placerville Road,
Routier Drive, Rockingham Drive, and Mather Field Road. Efforts should be made to
improve existing east-west connections along Old Placerville Road, potentially connecting
International to Old Placerville. Study the potential to establish a pedestrian/bicycle
connection on the existing rail crossing over Highway 50 between Mather Field and Routier
Roads.

              Environmental Conditions
              The Countryside/Lincoln Village Planning Area does not contain any development
              constraints associated with environmental conditions. This Planning Area is already
              urbanized.
              Timing
              The Planning Area has already been urbanized and will require revitalization efforts by
              both the City and landowners to implement the desired change. This process may take
              somewhere between five and fifteen years to accomplish and will require significant

Conceptual Land Uses
The Downtown is the center and “heart” of Rancho Cordova. The area
provides a significant connection between existing residential and commercial
areas in the northern portion of the City with existing employment areas and
future residents to the south. This location in the core of the community will serve to link      Development Stats

level of visual exposure. It is the City’s intent that the Downtown becomes a vibrant place       Employment: 16,000
to live, work, play, and shop. It is a walkable area with wide urban sidewalks that connect to
plazas and other gathering areas that are part of individual projects. The vision is for a
pedestrian-friendly gathering place for both daytime and nighttime activities (e.g., farmers
markets, concerts, and sporting events). The tallest buildings in the City will be located in the
Downtown.
It is anticipated that a Downtown Specific Plan or other similar planning tool will be
prepared for this area to address specific land uses, catalyst projects, design features, and
redevelopment strategies for the Downtown. A significant challenge will be to connect the
two areas currently bifurcated by Highway 50 physically, functionally, and emotionally.
Improved circulation and development patterns in the Olson Drive area will be a priority.
The conceptual land use plan for the Downtown (Figure LU-11) shows a range of
commercial, office and mixed-use areas north of the freeway with a transit-oriented center
located at or near the intersection of Folsom Boulevard and Zinfandel Drive. On the south
side of the freeway, the plan shows office and commercial mixed-use designations along
Zinfandel Drive with the local town center designation on the commercial portion of the
Capital Village project. The local town center will be developed in keeping with the
approved “Main Street” concept.

              Conceptual Circulation and Transit
              The backbones of the Downtown are Folsom Boulevard (east-west connection) and
              Zinfandel Drive (north-south connection). The area is bisected by the Highway 50
              corridor. The existing circulation and traffic patterns will be improved to potentially
              reduce traffic congestion and lessen the impacts of new developments by restructuring
              intersections and creating other necessary traffic calming improvements. Light rail runs

                                 II LAND USE
parallel to Folsom Boulevard along the northern edge of the area and, along with bus service,
connect the Downtown to the rest of the City and the region. Additionally, the City’s
planned Signature transit route is planned to run along International and Zinfandel,
connecting the existing and greenfield areas of the City together. Bus rapid transit and
traditional city-wide bus service will also operate in the Downtown. Local transit service will
also be provided. A bicycle and pedestrian promenade will be developed across Highway 50,
between Zinfandel Drive and the crossing of Folsom Boulevard that will connect the
northern and southern portions of the Downtown.
Environmental Conditions
The Downtown Planning Area does not contain any development constraints associated
with environmental conditions. This planning area is already urbanized.
Timing
As Downtown has already been urbanized, revitalization efforts will need to be undertaken
by both the City and landowners to remake the area into a vibrant “city center.” This
process may take somewhere between ten and twenty years to accomplish and will require
significant investment by various service providers and the demolition, redevelopment, and
enhancement of some of the existing developments.

                               Conceptual Land Uses
                               Since the East Planning Area borders on the County’s Urban Services Boundary
                               and the adopted 100 year flood plain, and contains many vernal pools and critical
                               habitat for various threatened and endangered species, the East Planning Area will
                               have a very dynamic mix of residential densities. Residential development along
                               Grant Line Road and the future loop road should develop at densities similar to
                               Grant Line West and Suncreek/Preserve (8 dwelling units per acre), but will reduce
                               in density as it approaches the eastern boundaries of the General Plan Planning
                               Area (probably averaging four units per acre and as low as one unit per two acres).
                               This land use transition from urban to rural uses will help to define the City’s

                       village center and one local town center. It is also anticipated that the East Planning Area
                       will include additional employment opportunities. Given the number of significant natural
                       resources in this area of the City, the Planning Area should include a regional attraction
                       that can integrate or take advantage of proximity to these natural resources (e.g., zoo,
                       nature preserve with information/training center, natural resource museum, active/passive

              Conceptual Circulation and Transit
              Grant Line Road and Douglas Road are the primary access ways into the East Planning
              Area. An additional connection is proposed as a loop road from the White Rock
              Road/Grant Line Road intersection on the north to the Chrysanthy Boulevard/Grant
              Line Road interchange on the south.
              A trail and open space system will be included in the development of the East Planning
              Area and will connect to the surrounding development.
              Grant Line Road may serve as a potential alignment for a future bus rapid transit. Other
              public transportation services will be included as ridership demand warrants.
              Environmental Conditions
              The East Planning Area contains vernal pools, Sacramento orcutt grass, cottonwood
              woodland habitat, recreation associated with the Prairie City OHV Park, streams/creeks,
              including tributaries to Laguna Creek and Deer Creek, and mine tailings. Impacts to
              vernal pools would require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Impacts to
              Sacramento orcutt grass would require consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
              Service. The cottonwood woodland habitat provides habitat for raptors, migratory
              songbirds and other species. Impacts to streams/creeks may require a permit from the
              U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or a Streambed Alteration Agreement from the
              Department of Fish and Game.
              Note: The Environmental and Physical Constraints map is known to contain some errors
              with regard to the locations of vernal pools within the East Planning Area. This map will
              be updated as more current mapping is received from the Sacramento County Habitat
              Conservation Plan and as Corps-verified wetland delineations are provided to the City.
              Timing
              The East Planning Area will probably be developed outside the time horizon of this Plan.
              However, development within this Planning Area may occur within the General Plan time
              horizon if necessary conditions are met (e.g., infrastructure is provided, annexation is
              approved).

                       mixed-use setting (overall average density assumed is 20 units per acre). Development will
                       take advantage of the proximity and availability of Light Rail to and from the Area. Much
                       of the land within the Planning Area is visible from Highway 50, creating significant
                       opportunity for identifiable project design that contributes to the enhanced character of
                       the City. Utilities in this area should be placed underground and projects shall be designed
                       to enrich the pedestrian environment along the cohesive streetscape corridor.
                       Partially included in the Folsom Boulevard Planning Area is the Downtown, where the
                       City intends to locate its major civic facilities (city hall, police station, performing arts
                       center, etc.). These uses may be located in an area generally designated for office or office
                       mixed-uses, where they would benefit from the location of other, complementary land
                       uses such as retail, restaurants, and entertainment. The Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan
                       will create the land use plan for this vibrant corridor, along with development and design
                       provisions, redevelopment strategies, improvement standards and corresponding cost
                       estimates, and an action plan for change.
                       Conceptual Circulation and Transit
                       Folsom Boulevard is the primary thoroughfare through the site, however several other
                       roadways, including Zinfandel Drive and Sunrise Boulevard connect the Area to the
                       Highway 50 corridor. Light Rail and the other public transit services that exist in the Area
                       should be expanded to accommodate the greater number of people who will live there, as
                       they should become viable alternatives to driving. The City’s planned Signature transit
                       service will also serve the corridor, connecting to the Downtown, Coloma Road, and the

will also serve the Planning Area along Hazel Avenue and Easton Valley Parkway.
Environmental Conditions
The Glenborough Planning Area contains mine tailings and mixed riparian woodland along
Alder Creek. Impacts to Alder Creek may require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and/or a Streambed Alteration Agreement from the Department of Fish and
Game. The mixed riparian woodland serves as habitat and a dispersal corridor for numerous
bird, mammal, amphibian, and reptile species. Impacts to this habitat should be minimized.
The majority of the Glenborough Planning Area is part of the Aerojet land holdings that
were used as buffer lands. However, two small areas near the western edge of the Planning
Area may have been used for operations and are subject to the requirements of the Aerojet
General Corp. Superfund site. The Superfund site encompasses groundwater contamination
and potential soil contamination associated with past operations at Aerojet. Cleanup of the
area under Superfund would be required before development can occur. The remaining
acreage is cleared for development subject to CEQA review.

Note: This Area is OUTSIDE the existing City Limits.
Conceptual Land Uses
The Grant Line South Planning Area, which consists primarily of open space
and abuts areas to the south that are planned to be retained for agricultural
uses, is currently located outside the City limits of Rancho Cordova. Located
                                                                                                   Development Stats

As shown in the conceptual land plan, this area includes one village center shown at the
intersection of Grant Line Road and Jackson Highway consisting of commercial, commercial
mixed-use, and mixed-use residential/multi family units. Land uses may consist of small to
medium grocery stores, drug stores, dry cleaners, coffee shops, and small restaurants. Mixed
uses may feature retail/service at street level with residential uses above, and residential areas
may consist of apartments or town homes. Further, eight and ten neighborhoods could be
developed throughout the planning area, featuring such land uses as public or quasi-public
buildings, elementary or middle schools, and potentially smaller neighborhood commercial
uses. Residential densities, especially along the outlying, southern portions of the Area
would be limited in scale and density (approximately 4 units per acre on average). Most of
the activity centers would be near the major roadway intersections.
Conceptual Circulation and Transit
As noted above, the convergence of three major roadways (Sunrise Blvd., Grant Line Road,
and Jackson Highway) make the planning area an excellent regional location to consider for
office and retail uses. The uses could be clustered along Grant Line Road and Jackson
Highway, which would allow the innermost areas of the planning area to maintain an open
space designation.
Environmental Conditions
The Grant Line South Planning Area contains vernal pools. Impacts to vernal pools would
require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. There is an existing preserve in
the central portion of this Planning Area south of the Jackson Highway/Grant Line Road
intersection.

Timing
The Grant Line South Planning Area will probably not begin developing for 30 years, based
upon its location and proximity to the rest of the urban areas of the City. This places it
outside the timeframe of this Plan. However, development within this Planning Area may
occur within the General Plan time horizon if necessary conditions are met (e.g.,
infrastructure is provided, annexation is approved).

                      Conceptual Circulation and Transit
                      Development within the Grant Line West Planning Area is primarily served by Douglas
                      Road, Grant Line Road, and White Rock Road. All three roadways will need to be
                      expanded and upgraded to accommodate the potential increase in users. Local roadways
                      will serve the individual neighborhoods, connecting them to the larger City and region.
                      A series of trails and bikeways is envisioned for the Planning Area, providing alternative
                      modes of transportation and recreational opportunities for the residents. Public transit
                      would round off the travel options, including bus rapid transit along White Rock Road and
                      Grant Line Road, connecting to El Dorado Hills, Elk Grove, and Downtown Rancho
                      Cordova. Local transit service will also be provided.

commercial. Central portions of the Planning Area contain floodplains, creeks, vernal pools,
and open space. It is anticipated that portions of the eastern edge of the Area will remain in
surfacing mining and heavy industrial use.
As shown in the conceptual land plan, developable portions of this area are expected to be
developed with a wide range of residential, commercial, office, and light industrial uses. The
southern and eastern portions of the Jackson Planning Area will most likely develop as a
series of residential neighborhoods with an average density of four dwelling units per acre.
Village centers serving the Area may be located along the Jackson Highway at Bradshaw
Road and just west of Sunrise Boulevard. There is a possibility that a local town center may
be warranted at the Jackson Highway and Bradshaw location, depending upon the final size
of the buildout.
Conceptual Circulation and Transit
Development within the Jackson Planning Area will necessitate the expansion of all five
major roads serving the area (Bradshaw Road, Kiefer Boulevard, Eagles Nest/Zinfandel,
Excelsior/Douglas Road, and Jackson Highway). Their potential size will be in keeping with
the rural character of the area, yet will need to support the demand placed on them.
The Jackson Planning Area will include various recreational trails and facilities. Public transit
service may be provided as demand can support, including bus rapid transit service along
Jackson Highway, connecting with Downtown Sacramento to the west and Rancho
Murrieta/Amado County to the east.

              The Jackson Planning Area contains vernal pools and several streams/creeks, including
              Frye Creek, Laguna Creek, Morrison Creek, and Elder Creek. This Planning Area contains
              existing preserves and conservation easements south of Jackson Highway between
              Excelsior Road and Eagles Nest Road. This planning area also falls within the 100-year
              floodplain and within the Mather Airport safety zones and noise contours. Impacts to
              vernal pools would require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Impacts to
              streams/creeks may require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or a
              Streambed Alteration Agreement from the Department of Fish and Game. The 100-year
              floodplain, the Mather Airport safety zones and noise contours would restrict the type of

              Area includes an existing rendering plant that has incorporated upgrades to address odor
              issues associated with operations. As urban development continues to expand south,

                      support development of limited on-site residential, office, and commercial uses north of
                      Kiefer Boulevard. Other target uses in the Planning Area include office and light
                      industrial uses west of Mather Field. Existing residential development includes
                      Independence at Mather and all new residential development is assumed for proximity to
                      and association with the college development in the southeast and southern portion of the

                      conceptual land use plan.
                      Mather Field itself is a vital component of the regional transportation system. It will
                      continue to play a key role in bringing goods into Rancho Cordova and the surrounding
                      communities, as well as exporting local services around the world. Operations are likely to
                      expand and their presence could help create a synergy between many industrial and
                      aeronautical services and the activities at the airport. Heavy industrial uses west of Mather

To accommodate development within and surrounding the Mather Planning Area, it is
envisioned that several roadways leading into and around the area will need to be expanded
or extended in some fashion. These include Kiefer Boulevard, Eagles Nest/Zinfandel
Drive, and Excelsior/Douglas Road.
While many of the vernal pools and marshlands within the Planning Area may remain off-
limits to people, the site’s proximity to urban development around the Area encourage the
development of new recreational trails and facilities.
Local transit services may be provided in the Planning Area and a bus rapid transit line
connecting to Elk Grove may be provided along Sunrise Boulevard or Folsom South Canal.

neighborhoods served by neighborhood centers and village centers, as well as neighborhood
and community parks.
The conceptual land use plan reflects the City’s building blocks concept as well as the
pending development application. The Area may be served by as many as three village
centers, which provide for the daily shopping needs of the residents. In addition to the
village centers, the proposed project would support a local town center and town center.
Additional retail opportunities may be appropriately sited in this Planning Area.
Additional land uses in the planning area may include office and light industrial uses
public/quasi-public uses, and open spaces. Light industrial uses would be mainly located
within the Mather Safety Zone, while office may be clustered closer to residential areas to
promote alternative modes of transportation.
Conceptual Circulation and Transit
The Planning Area is bounded on the north by White Rock Road and on the south by
Douglas Road. Two main arterials generally meandering from north to south would bisect
the planning area and serve as collectors for traffic in and out of the neighborhood areas.
One arterial (Rancho Cordova Parkway) would be routed towards the general area of the
Town Center to further promote its use, while the other collector (Americanos Drive) would
serve to connect residential areas to White Rock Road and Douglas Road. International
Drive will also be extended from existing Rancho Cordova into the Planning Area.
Transit will also serve the Planning Area. This includes the City’s Signature transit service
along Rancho Cordova Parkway and International Drive, as well as potential bus rapid transit
service along White Rock Road and either Sunrise Boulevard or Rancho Cordova Parkway.

Environmental Conditions
The Rio del Oro Planning Area is located on a former rocket testing facility. The site is
subject to the requirements of a Consent Order with the California Department of Toxic
Substances Control (DTSC). Approximately 1,114 acres of the Rio del Oro Planning Area
were removed from the Order in 1997, which includes the western edge of the Planning
Area. Approximately 2,800 acres are still under the Consent Order. Currently the areas of
concern and the groundwater are undergoing various levels of review and/or remedial
action. Cleanup of the remaining 2,800 acres would be required before development can
occur in the areas under the Order. The 1,114 acres are cleared for development subject to
CEQA review.
The Rio del Oro Planning Area contains mine tailings, vernal pools, Morrison Creek and the
Mather Airport safety zones. Impacts to the vernal pools would require permits from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Impacts to Morrison Creek may require a permit from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or a Streambed Alteration Agreement from the
Department of Fish and Game. The planning area also contains valley elderberry shrubs,
which host the protected valley elderberry longhorn beetle. Removal of the shrubs requires
consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Mather Airport safety zones would
restrict the type of land uses that could be located within portions of the planning area.

neighborhood and village centers, schools and other public/quasipublic uses.
The Planning Area includes a local town center development south of the intersection of
Chrysanthy Boulevard and Rancho Cordova Parkway. The adopted and proposed plans
also call for two or three commercial mixed-use developments, which are located along the
major roadways of the Planning Area and facilitate use of the area’s transit system. Actual
location and opportunities for additional retail in the Preserve area will be determined with
subsequent land planning.
The Planning Area will also contain wetland preserves and creek/drainage corridors and
provide connections to the City’s open space and trail system, as well as a site for a
combined high school and middle school campus.

Public transit service will be provided and will connect with the existing transit system,
particularly the light rail line to the north. A bus rapid transit line could serve the area via
Grant Line Road and/or Sunrise Boulevard. Additionally, the City’s Signature transit service
runs down Rancho Cordova Parkway through the Planning Area. Commercial, educational,
and higher-density uses are oriented towards the transit corridors to promote transit
ridership.

                     The land use plan for Sunrise Boulevard North shows a village center development on the
                     northwest corner of Coloma and Sunrise. Further south along Sunrise, there is a large
                     commercial mixed-use site intended for general merchandise and neighborhood serving
                     uses. Consistent with existing development patterns, the commercial sites are surrounded
                     by office mixed-use and medium density residential. It is expected that revitalization of
                     this area will occur as the City grows.

                     should be devised for the Area.
                     Bus transit serves the area and will continue to be a major transportation component.
                     The City’s future Signature transit service will connect the Sunrise North Planning Area
                     with the existing areas of the City to the west and the greenfield areas to the south via
                     Coloma Road and Citrus Road. Bus rapid transit service will also be provided along

The Land Plan for this area (shown in Figure LU-31) maintains a heavy industrial
designation east of Sunrise Boulevard for continued industrial use. Land use designations
west of Sunrise Boulevard include Light Industrial, Office Mixed Use, and Commercial
Mixed Use designations, which establish a vision for transition to lighter industrial uses and
conversion of some areas to other uses. The northern portion of the Planning Area is also
designated as Convention Overlay with a vision for a future convention center and related
and supportive uses. The City will develop programs/policies to support the natural
evolution of this area to ensure the continued economic vitality of this area. Non-
conforming provisions for existing uses in this area will allow for the continuation of
industrial uses and conditional expansion of industrial uses where mitigation measures ensure
compatibility with the evolving nature of this area.
The City encourages continued clustering of building materials and home improvement
industries in the northwest portion of the Planning Area. Additionally, the City supports the
creation of a district and/or development of a trade center or trade mart for these businesses
to showcase their wares.

Conceptual Circulation and Transit
Sunrise Boulevard is the primary access to the Area. Increasing travel demands on this
roadway will necessitate some form of reengineering or redesign. A streetscape
enhancement plan should be devised for the Area.
Any new development should be pedestrian oriented in nature and provide amenities of the
walking and cycling public. Public transit, especially the close proximity to light rail, should
be considered as part of the revitalization of the Area. The City’s future Signature transit
service will cross the Planning Area along Folsom Boulevard and the extension of
International Drive. Bus rapid transit service may be provided along Sunrise Boulevard
and/or Folsom South Canal, connecting to regional destinations. Folsom South Canal could
be enhanced as a bicycle transportation facility with several nodes of activity.
Environmental Conditions
The Sunrise Boulevard South Planning Area is predominantly urbanized. The southern half
of the planning area contains developed areas in addition to some mine tailings on a few
undeveloped parcels; whereas and the northern half of the planning area is almost entirely
developed. This planning area also contains the Mather Airport safety zones, which would
limit the types of development that would be permitted in this planning area. The Folsom
South Canal forms the western boundary of this planning area.

Consistent with the pending application and City’s building blocks concept, this Planning
Area will likely include one or two village center(s) to serve the daily commercial needs of the
future residents of Westborough. The Planning Area will probably be made up of five to six
neighborhoods with a wide range of residential densities and corresponding housing types.
Because of the area’s proximity to Highway 50 and light rail the average residential density
for the project will be approximately seven units per acre. See conceptual land use plan.
In addition to the employment opportunities associated with the regional town center and
village centers, the project will include office mixed-use property in the northern portion of
the site along Folsom Boulevard with access to transit and the new Highway 50 interchange.
Development within the Planning Area will take into consideration and build upon the
opportunities presented by the location and route of the Folsom South Canal. Potential
features include bicycle/pedestrian/running trails and commercial paseos.
Conceptual Circulation and Transit
The primary circulation pathways into and around Westborough will be Folsom Boulevard,
Highway 50, and Rancho Cordova Parkway. Light rail and other future public transit
services will play a vital role in moving people at all hours of the day and will provide a solid
alternative to driving, including the City’s future Signature transit service, which will connect
with Light Rail on the north and travel down Rancho Cordova Parkway to other new
development to the south. Bus rapid transit service will also be provided along Rancho
Cordova Parkway and Easton Valley Parkway and may be provided along the Folsom South
Canal.

Environmental Conditions
The Westborough Planning Area contains mine tailings and Buffalo Creek. Additionally, a
portion of the Folsom South Canal runs along the northwestern and western edge of this
planning area. Impacts to Buffalo Creek may require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and/or a Streambed Alteration Agreement from the Department of Fish and
Game. The Folsom South Canal would act as a barrier to development along the western
edge of the planning area. This Planning Area also contains some valley elderberry shrubs,
which host the protected valley elderberry longhorn beetle. Removal of the shrubs requires
consultation with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
The majority of the Westborough Planning Area is part of the Aerojet land holdings that
were used as buffer lands. However, two areas near the eastern edge of the Planning Area
may have been used for operations and are subject to the requirements of the Aerojet
General Corp. Superfund site. The Superfund site encompasses groundwater contamination
and potential soil contamination associated with past operations at Aerojet. Cleanup of the
area under Superfund would be required before development can occur. The remaining
acreage is cleared for development subject to CEQA review.

              The Westborough area will likely be developed in the next five to ten years. Its proximity
              to existing development and it potential for easy integration into the existing urban
              framework make it an ideal candidate for City expansion.

     VISION
       S T A T E ME N T
                              Rancho Cordova will be a vibrant community with a strong sense of
  character and identity. Walkable and livable neighborhoods served by neighborhood, village,
  and town centers will create several districts throughout the community. Individual districts
  will have unique characteristics and dense urban cores designed as vibrant gathering places.
  The line between public and private areas will be blurred, creating a strong sense of public
  space. Uses will be integrated (mixed), both vertically and horizontally, in unique ways that
  make Rancho Cordova a memorable place both locally and nationally. The City will be
  anchored by civic buildings in a Downtown core that promote a shared sense of community
  and pride. Buildings will be of quality design, materials, and colors that add a sense of
  permanence, making them long-lasting features and landmarks.
INTRODUCTION
The way Rancho Cordova looks and feels is a direct statement of the community’s values
and desires. Residents care about how their City looks and feels and want to live somewhere
that they can take pride in calling home. The City also wants to make a positive impression
with visitors, creating interesting places that people remember and want to revisit. Rancho
Cordova will use innovative elements of urban design to create memorable and lively spaces
throughout the community.
PURPOSE
The Urban Design Element provides policies and design concepts relating to the form and
character of new private development and public improvements, along with focused plans
for areas of the City in need of special design attention. The Element also includes policies
and implementation programs aimed at creating Rancho Cordova as a unique place with a
strong, memorable character.
                                                                             RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                       III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
             RELATED PLANS                 AND      PROGRAMS
             Development, adoption, and implementation of urban design policies require consideration
             of several related plans and programs, both local and regional in nature:
                 •   City Zoning Code. The Zoning Code establishes districts throughout the
                     community with allowed use and development standards. These development
                     standards create the framework for the physical form of the community (e.g.,
                     building setbacks, heights).
                 •   Citywide Design Guidelines. The Design Guidelines supplement the Zoning
                     Code development standards with more detailed provisions that direct the look and
                     feel of development. The guidelines and standards govern the site and architectural
                     character of development.
                 •   Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan.               The Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan
                     incorporates past planning efforts for revitalization of the corridor into a single
                     action plan. The Specific Plan will include a detailed land plan with pulse points of
                     activity, development and design provisions, streetscape improvements, economic
                     strategies, cost estimates, and action steps for redevelopment of Folsom Boulevard.
                 •   Open Space Standards. The Open Space Standards will guide the integration of
                     open space features within the community, including greeways, trails, and
                     neighborhood greens. Future interactions of these standards will also consider open
                     space to be integrated within commercial plazas and town centers.
                 •   Pedestrian Design Guidelines and ADA Transition Plan. While primarily aimed
                     at improving the pedestrian circulation system of the City, the Pedestrian Design
                     Guidelines include provisions that help define the character of the City’s streets.
                     The primary purpose of these plans is to optimize the pedestrian experience, to
                     provide safe and usable pedestrian facilities for all pedestrians, and to assure
                     compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations and standards.
                 •   SACOG Blueprint. The SACOG Blueprint is a land use and transportation study
                     of the Sacramento region that focuses on development of the region through
                     walkable, transit-oriented communities that better integrate jobs and housing. Many
                     of the smart growth principles of the SACOG Blueprint have been incorporated into
                     the City’s General Plan.

            III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
RELATIONSHIP               TO    OTHER ELEMENTS
While the Land Use Element describes the location and distribution of uses within the City,
the Urban Design Element emphasizes how development should relate to the user, the
appearance and character of development, and how it should function in the greater context
of the community. It is an optional element of the General Plan and the basis for the
aesthetic regulation of public and private land and structures. The Urban Design Element is
most closely related to the Land Use Element, as describe above. The design of land uses,
including the building blocks and smart growth concepts, directly relate to the quality design
and character of the community. The Urban Design Element is also linked to the
Circulation Element when it addresses streetscape design and pedestrian and bicycle
environments and facilities. The Open Space, Parks, and Trails and Natural Resources
Elements relate to the Urban Design Element in issues of scenic vistas being framed by
trails and open space. Lastly, the Cultural and Historic Resources Elements relates to Urban
Design where it discusses public art and its inclusion in development projects and civic
improvements. Where the overlap can be identified, cross-references are provided to alert
the reader to the other respective elements.
ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
URBAN DESIGN SETTING
Rancho Cordova has historically developed like many other suburban communities in the
United States. There are few distinguishing features that create a sense of character or place
in Rancho Cordova. While Rancho Cordova has a rich history, there are few historic
buildings and no single predominant architectural theme in the community.
Existing neighborhoods in Rancho Cordova were developed at a walkable scale with smaller
neighborhood service areas and centrally located parks and schools. Many of the
neighborhood service areas have been converted to heavier commercial uses and office uses
that do not necessarily meet the daily shopping needs of local residents. However, the basic
development patterns in place are similar to the desired development patterns for the new
growth areas. Rancho Cordova was a leader in the co-location of parks and schools, creating
shared use benefits and good civic spaces for local residents to gather.
There is no unified style to the commercial development within the City. For decades,
projects were developed with large setbacks from the street, limited landscaping, and a lack
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3
                       III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
             of pedestrian features. Commercial “strip centers” are the predominant development pattern
             along Folsom Boulevard and Sunrise Boulevard.
             Development as a whole lacks the pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly features that often add
             character and definition to a community. Sidewalks are frequently narrow or non-existent
             along major roadways, and provide little landscaping or shading. Few private developments
             include gathering places for community activities.
             ISSUES         THIS     ELEMENT ATTEMPTS                      TO    SOLVE
             The Urban Design Element establishes a framework for how the City will look and feel as
             new development and the revitalization of existing development are undertaken. The
             primary issues that this element attempts to solve are listed below and were identified during
             the preparation of this General Plan:
                  •   Redefining Rancho Cordova as a unique place with an identity that distinguishes it
                      from the surrounding community and makes it a distinctive place in the region.
                  •   Establishing mixed-use development that facilitates walking or cycling from to work,
                      stores, restaurants, and parks via pleasant pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly streets.
                  •   Creating high-quality urban design throughout the community that is visually
                      pleasing and inviting.
                  •   Generating district themes with a continuity that helps to establish the district’s
                      identity through the use of common architectural elements, landscaping, lighting,
                      signage, and other features.
                  •   Siting buildings within a project and along the street in pedestrian-friendly ways,
                      along with encouraging high-quality project design.
                  •   Establishing project identities that contribute to the overall City identity in unique
                      ways, including through project features that tie entire districts together and help to
                      establish a sense of place and a unique identity for the project, district, and City.
                  •   Investing in all parts of the City for improved urban design.
                  •   Enhancing the identity of the Riverside Communities and ensuring connectivity of
                      existing and future areas of the City through project and community design.

             III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
THE URBAN DESIGN STRATEGY
The City’s Urban Design Strategy is intended to strengthen the aesthetic, civic, and design
quality of the City, leading to a renewed sense of place and character for the community
from both a project and citywide perspective. It builds upon the guiding principles set forth
in the Land Use Element (smart growth and the City “building blocks”) and takes them a
step further by describing the scale and orientation of buildings and their role in designing
the future City. The Urban Design Strategy describes how the City is connected and how
individual projects contribute to the City’s sense of place. Many of these ideas are further
implemented through the development standards of the City’s Zoning Code, the Citywide
Design Guidelines, and the Pedestrian Design Guidelines.
The Urban Design Strategy is comprised of three important components:
     •    The Building Blocks – neighborhoods, villages, and districts that create a more
          livable, walkable communities throughout the City;
     •    Community Character – the transformation of          Rancho Cordova to a more
          vibrant place with an enhanced image; and
     •    Individual Project Design – the role of individual projects in transforming the
          City into a unique place through quality design.
THE BUILDING BLOCKS
As described in the Land Use Element, the building blocks of the City are neighborhoods,
villages, and districts. Building blocks are more than just a statement about land use
patterns. Each building block component is characterized by its different uses, scale, and
intensity of development, factors which combine to give each component its own unique
character and place in the community. The building blocks concept creates a relationship
between uses and influences the general development quality in a way that makes the City a
more pleasant place to live and work.
Neighborhoods
Neighborhoods are the places we call home. They include a range       Public realm is defined as public spaces, like
of housing types along pedestrian-friendly streets designed for       parks, plazas, open space, community buildings,
                                                                      street frontages, sidewalks, greenbelts, privately-

                        III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
             includes a neighborhood center that is a place for neighbors to gather (e.g., school, park,
             community center, coffee shop).
             Residents can easily walk throughout the neighborhood, which is scaled at approximately
             1/3-mile radius (equivalent to a 10 or 15 minute walk). Neighborhoods are developed on a
             modified grid system with short blocks for ease of mobility. Major streets do not bisect
             neighborhoods. However, neighborhood streets do establish a hierarchy through design that
             helps residents and visitors understand where they are in any given neighborhood.
             Villages
             Villages are made up of three or four neighborhoods, connected by open space trails,
             pedestrian-friendly streets, and activity centers. Villages feature a rich multitude of housing
             types that meet the needs of various lifestyles, including contemporary single-family detached
             and single-family attached homes, multi-family buildings, and mixed-use projects.
             Each village is served by a Village Center, which provides services to meet the daily shopping
             and social gathering needs of village residents. Village centers are designed with the
             pedestrian in mind, without large parking areas separating the development from the street
             and without segregation of residential and commercial uses. Pathways connect uses and the
             development is close to the street, creating active streetscapes that are inviting and attractive.
             Districts
             Districts are the largest component of the building blocks concept, comprised of three or
             four villages. Districts can function as small, self-sufficient communities that may have
             unique characteristics, attributes, and Citywide or regional uses. Collectively, districts work
             together to build the whole of Rancho Cordova that is better than its individual parts. They
             weave the urban framework of the City into a cohesive fabric. Each district is unique and
             districts will have different types of uses and varying design characteristics and style.
             COMMUNITY CHARACTER
             As a new City, Rancho Cordova is redefining itself as a vibrant, livable, and memorable place.
             Community character can be developed and enhanced in a variety of ways, many of which
             are described below.
6 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN
            III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
Community Image/Identity
The City needs a unifying image and identity that respects its history and defines its place in
the region. Rancho Cordova will not be simply a suburb or an employment center – it will
be a City that is a destination place in the region. Neighborhoods will be designed with
unique attributes, centers will be designed as active pedestrian places, and the Downtown
skyline will be visible for miles. Rancho Cordova will focus on quality, mixed-use
developments with meaningful public space. Site, architecture, and streetscape features
should create a unifying theme, such as common light fixtures or benches, landscaping, or
citywide signage.
Streetscape Design
Streets are designed primarily for the safe and efficient movement of
vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Streets should also be designed as
inviting places that communicate to the user where they are within the
community. In urban areas, buildings are sited close to the street, with
access and windows facing onto the street. Landscaping should be provided to enhance the
pedestrian realm. Where pedestrians cross the vehicular right-of-way, features such as
bulbouts, raised medians, special paving and lighting, or other methods can be provided to
reduce pedestrian crossing width, alert vehicles to designated pedestrian crossings, and
encourage pedestrians to walk in a safe and inviting environment.
Gateways
Gateways can be both the entrances into the City and into the individual
districts and design techniques for public spaces that help a user identify
where they are in the community and how to get around. They include a
change in development character and style, as well as help promote a
sense of place and community identity. Gateways should be developed at
key entrances into the City and into districts as a way of establishing City
and district identity. In any case, City identity takes precedence over
district identity, such that entrances into the City are more pronounced than district
entrances. Gateways should reinforce the unique character of the City and greet visitors to
the City and welcome residents home. Wayfinding techniques such as landscaping, street
design, and special signage also help users establish where they are and where they are going.
City Edge
Critical to the development of the City is a clear definition of the City edge, which is the
creation of a boundary between the urban and rural or developed and undeveloped areas of
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 7

                        III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
             the landscape. In part, this is defined by the City’s land use pattern, where less intense uses
             are developed along the boundary of the City and more intense uses are at the core, such as
             in the Downtown. The character of development should recognize this change in intensity,
             with edge neighborhoods and districts along the southern and eastern boundaries of the
             Planning Area transitioning to a more rural character. It is also important to create a defined
             edge where the City meets urban Sacramento County through quality of design and the
             streetscape and gateway features described above.
                                      Scenic Vistas
                                      The City is geographically situated between the Sierra Nevada
                                      Mountain Range and the California Coastal Mountain Range along the
                                      American River. Many of roads in the area are aligned with views of
                                      major peaks and natural landmarks in the region, including, for
                                      instance Mt. Diablo (Grant Line Road). Other points of interest in the
                                      area that qualify as scenic vistas include Pine Hill, Flagstaff Hill,
             Pyramid Peak, Carson Spur, Jackson Butte, Mt. Vaca, and Goat Mountain/Snow Mountain.
             Framing these features when developing trails and open spaces contributes to the City’s sense
             of place and provides a connection back to the natural environment.
                                     Downtown/City Center
                                     Rancho Cordova is a City without a central hub or community core. It
                                     lacks a unifying center that connects the existing and yet undeveloped
                                     areas of the City. For these reasons, the City designated a new
                                     downtown area. Downtown will be the center and “heart” of Rancho
                                     Cordova. It will be the civic center of the community, where City Hall
             and other similar and supporting uses are located. The most intense development will also
             be located in downtown with a wide range of mixed-use and transit-oriented development.
             It is the City’s intent that the Downtown will become a vibrant place to live, work, play, and
             shop. It will be a walkable area with wide urban sidewalks that connect to plazas and other
             gathering areas that are part of individual projects. Because the Downtown is visible from
             Highway 50, the look and feel of future development and redevelopment will establish the
             community image for travelers from throughout the region and State. A subsequent planning
             effort will detail the development plan for Downtown.
             Compatibility of Development
             New development and the revitalization of existing areas should be designed with
             characteristics that contribute to the overall image of the City while respecting the positive
8 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

            III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
attributes of the existing built form. This can be achieved through uniform streetscapes that
connect across property lines; the use of common site features, such as lighting fixtures,
positive architectural style, and good uses of color and materials; and the appropriate scaling
of buildings, which takes into account the neighboring uses.
Revitalization through Design
Some development within the City is not consistent with the City vision (e.g., underutilized
sites, auto-oriented development, separation of uses). These areas should be enhanced and
revitalized with a mix of uses, concentration of activity, redevelopment of centers, and
creation of neighborhood identity. Infill sites and the remodel/reuse of existing
developments throughout the community should be developed/redeveloped in a way that
contributes to the City’s building blocks concept, promotes pedestrian activity, and
contributes to an overall sense of place for the City.
Art in Public Places
The use of art in public places, both in civic locations and as part of private
developments, contributes to City identity and character. Public art can enhance the
landscape and provide focus within public spaces. It improves the visual
environment for all residents, while strengthening community identity and boosting
community pride. The City values the livability and beauty that public art adds to
shared spaces where people live, work, visit, and recreate. Public art should be
meaningful and encourage the free flow of ideas and cultural ideologies.
INDIVIDUAL PROJECT DESIGN
Individual projects are the building blocks that contribute to the overall appearance and
character of the City. Each project should include unique project features and experiences
that relate to the user. Every project should be designed as a unique place that contributes
to the City in the ways described below.
Architectural Style and Character
Architectural styling and detailing adds character to a site and sense of permanence to a
building. The City does not promote a single architectural style for new development.
Rather, the City encourages quality architecture with character and a recognizable
architectural style, articulated on all parts of the project and buildings. The City also
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 9

                         III URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
              encourages the orientation of rooflines and windows to optimize the use of solar power and
              minimize heat transfer through windows.
                        Public Gathering and Open Spaces
                        Effective design of the public realm creates the memorable places that the City
                        desires. Plazas, parks, courtyards, and open spaces help to define these memorable
                        places. They also provide valuable assets and pedestrian amenities that contribute to
                        the overall quality and stability of the site. Public spaces allow people to gather,
                        creating nodes of activity that connect back to their district and City. The proper
                        use and design of public and open spaces presents an opportunity to accent the
              community’s natural scenic viewsheds into the built environment.
              Site Landscaping
                                 Landscaping should soften the built environment and create attractive
                                 places to visit. Landscaping should work to relieve the overall mass and
                                 scale of the structures, frame outdoor spaces, and create a strong sense of
                                 place. It should also be used to reduce the heat-island effect caused by
                                 paved surfaces and minimize the need for irrigation. The use of on-site
                                 landscaping helps to create visual interest and promotes and nurtures the
                                 concept of an “urban forest.”
              Site Design
              Projects should be designed to connect to the streetscape and promote pedestrian activity
              along the street and within the site. Commercial and mixed-use buildings are located close to
              the street, creating “main street” environments. Residential uses connect to the City
              circulation system of streets, pathways, and trails.
              Project Identity through Site Features
              The features of a project can be just as powerful in establishing identity as the architecture of
              the buildings. Projects are encouraged to have hardscapes and streetscapes that unify the
              project. Plazas, lighting fixtures, seating areas, and landscaping all add detail and interest to a
              site when used in attractive ways. Additionally, signs may be used to identify a project and
              should enhance the built environment without contributing to visual clutter.

    VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                             Rancho Cordova will market its strengths, including large office
 centers, an ample supply of housing for employees, a setting safe from seismic and flood
 threats and strategic regional location, to become a first-choice location for businesses and
 residents. Private investment will be stimulated through marketing and incentive provision,
 with the result being economic prosperity for all segments of the community. The City will
 create a vibrant Downtown where the community can live, work, shop, and play.
 Implementation of this Element will result in a balanced mix of businesses that provides jobs
 to community members and ensures the long term fiscal health of the City
INTRODUCTION
Economic development is the enhancement of a community’s productive capabilities,
largely through the creation and retention of jobs and revenue. Concentrating efforts on
economic development will provide more job opportunities for Rancho Cordova residents
and will produce more revenue, allowing the City to provide higher levels of service. The
process of economic development also increases economic opportunity for local businesses
and property owners. Redevelopment and other tools will help form public-private
partnerships to revive existing buildings, stimulate infill and catalyst projects, and upgrade
and replace the City’s aging infrastructure. Rancho Cordova will promote economic
development as a way to improve the City’s regional desirability, revitalize existing
commercial areas, and improve the quality of life for all City residents.
PURPOSE
This Economic Development Element attempts to identify the City’s strengths and
weaknesses as it seeks to provide a full range of employment, housing, retail/service, and
entertainment option to residents. The Element establishes goals, policies, and actions to
improve the City’s prosperity, maintain regional competitiveness, ensure accessibility to
assets, market the City, and, perhaps most importantly, set fair and equitable rules for
development. This Element is also intended to create wealth for the citizens of Rancho
Cordova by providing opportunities to increase property values, fully utilize their properties,
offer continuing education opportunities, and support entrepreneurship.
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                            DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
             RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
             The Economic Development Element is closely related to several plans and programs,
             including the following:
                  •  Highway 50 Corridor Economic Development Study. The Highway 50 Corridor
                     Economic Development Study (50 Corridor Study) was produced by the Sacramento
                     Regional Research Institute in February 2005 to address the economic development
                     potential for the multi-jurisdictional economic area along the Highway 50 corridor,
                     including Rancho Cordova and its Sphere of Influence, Mather Airport, Folsom and
                     its Sphere of Influence, and portions of El Dorado County that are adjacent to
                     Highway 50. The 50 Corridor Study looked at a 50-year buildout of the corridor and
                     measures of economic status (e.g., population, employment, income earnings, labor
                     force, business activity), types and levels of economic activity of businesses along the
                     corridor, and the linkages between the corridor and the Sacramento region in
                     generating economic strategies to achieve the corridor’s development potential. The
                     goals, policies and actions in this Element build upon the economic strategies in the
                     50 Corridor Study.
                  •  Rancho Cordova General Plan Pro Forma (Pro Forma). The Pro Forma is a
                     fiscal impact analysis of the proposed General Plan intended to evaluate the
                     economic viability of proposed land uses and services. The Pro Forma is being
                     prepared concurrently with the General Plan and has been used to determine the
                     right balance of land uses, along with the types and levels of services in the General
                     Plan.
                  •  Rancho Cordova Office Demand Analysis (Bay Area Economics). Phase I of
                     the City’s Pro Forma work included a market demand analysis of office
                     development. Analysts looked at existing conditions, talked to brokers about
                     historic market niches, competition, local strengths and weaknesses, and regional
                     trends to form assumptions regarding national absorption of office development for
                     Rancho Cordova. The Office Demand Analysis shows that the City will maintain
                     between 16 and 25 percent of the regional office market. This information was used
                     in strategic land planning to ensure the right amount office (office mixed-use) land
                     and development potential within the General Plan Planning Area.
                  •  Rancho Cordova Retail Demand Analysis (Bay Area Economics). Phase I of
                     the City’s Pro Forma work included an analysis of retail demand for the General
                     Plan Planning Area. The Retail Demand Analysis evaluated current market
                     conditions, then analyzed spending potential of current and future residents to
                     calculate retail demand in a variety of retail categories through buildout of the
2 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

                        IV ECONOMIC
         DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
  General Plan. The projected retail demand of approximately 9.2 million square feet
  was used in the strategic land use planning to ensure the right amount of retail
  (commercial mixed-use and centers) land and development potential throughout the
  General Plan Planning Area.
• Rancho Cordova Retail Strategy (Leland Consulting Group). Based on the Pro
  Forma Retail Demand Analysis, analysts developed a Retail Strategy for Rancho
  Cordova focused on the location and distribution of retail centers. The location
  analysis looked at retail trends, tested siting criteria, existing conditions, and
  stakeholder interviews. The strategy evaluated two general retail categories (grocery
  anchored centers and general merchandise centers). The Retail Strategy provided
  recommendations for type, scale, and location of retail centers in the General Plan
  Planning Area. This information was used in the City’s land use planning to ensure
  the strategic location and distribution of retail (commercial mixed-use and centers)
  land and development potential throughout the General Plan Planning Area.
• Rancho Cordova Redevelopment Plan. The Rancho Cordova Redevelopment
  Plan, which is planned for adoption in June 2006, will allow the Agency to collect
  tax increment revenue for the purpose of improving and redeveloping commercial
  and residential areas, and supporting the production of mixed-income housing in
  the City. The Redevelopment Plan Area is approximately 2,500 acres in size (see
  Figure ED-1). The proposed project area includes Folsom Boulevard, the Trade
  Center Drive area, the Coloma Boulevard corridor, the Zinfandel Drive corridor,
  the Lincoln Village area, and the area located between Old Placerville Road,
  International Drive, White Rock Road and Highway 50, including the Downtown.
  The Redevelopment Plan will be used as a tool to implement the goal and
  supporting policies and actions of the Economic Development Element related to
  redevelopment.
• Rancho Cordova Draft Economic Development Strategy and Action Plan.
  The City’s Economic Development Department and Economic Development
  Committee, working with consultants, prepared a draft Economic Development
  Strategy and Action Plan for the City. The City evaluated the current economic
  assets and liabilities in Rancho Cordova and came up with an action plan for
  economic development. The final action plan will implement the Economic
  Development Element of the General Plan and will be the City’s blueprint for how
  it uses its economic development resources to achieve its goals.
• Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan. The Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan
  incorporates past planning efforts for revitalization of the corridor into a single
  action plan. The Specific Plan will include a detailed land plan with pulse points of
  activity, development and design provisions, streetscape improvements, economic
                                                                       RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

                                           IV ECONOMIC
                           DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                     strategies, cost estimates, and action steps for redevelopment of Folsom Boulevard.
                     The Specific Plan areas is within the City’s Redevelopment Plan Area and will
                     include economic development provisions consistent with the City’s Economic
                     Development Strategy and Action Plan.
                 •   Mather Redevelopment Plan. Sacramento County adopted the Mather
                     Redevelopment Project Area and Mather Redevelopment Plan in 1995. The Project
                     Area, which is overseen by the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency,
                     includes the Mather Airport, Independence at Mather (1,271 single-family homes),
                     extensive parklands and the Mather Golf Course. The redevelopment strategy for
                     Mather includes converting the former base to productive uses consistent with the
                     Mather Specific Plan and the Mather Infrastructure and Financing Plan. The Mather
                     Redevelopment Plan goals include: Eliminate the Blight; Provide First Class
                     Infrastructure; A Leading Employment Center; Create Job Opportunities and
                     Additional Investment; Fulfill the Vision; and Housing for All Families.
                 •   Mather Field Specific Plan. Sacramento County adopted the Mather Field Specific
                     Plan in May 1997 to provide guidance on the conversion of land uses in Mather
                     Field from military to civilian uses. The Specific Plan establishes specific
                     requirements for private and public development including the location, type,
                     intensity and character of land uses, circulation patterns, necessary infrastructure
                     improvements, and the location and general configuration of parks and open space.
                     The Mather Field Specific Plan only relates to economic development activities in
                     the Mather Planning Area.
                 •   Rancho Cordova Chamber of Commerce “Rush to Rancho” Visitor Attraction
                     Program. The Rancho Cordova Chamber of Commerce developed the “Rush to
                     Rancho” website as a visitor attraction program. The website provides details on
                     accommodations, dining, services/resources, and events.
                 •   Rancho Cordova Regional Economic Development Corporation. The Rancho
                     Cordova Regional Economic Development Corporation is a partnership between
                     the Rancho Cordova Chamber of Commerce and City of Rancho Cordova, which is
                     comprised of representatives from the City, Chamber and the commercial
                     community. They have a grant to market economic development in Rancho
                     Cordova. The Rancho Cordova Regional Economic Development Corporation will
                     work with the City to help implement this Element.
                 •   Rancho Cordova Economic Development Committee. The Rancho Cordova
                     Economic Development Committee was formed as part of the General Plan and the
                     Economic Development Department’s efforts on the Rancho Cordova Economic

         Development Strategy and Action Plan. This Committee will be used to help the
         City implement specific policies and actions in this Element.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
Economic prosperity requires an adequate supply of land and structures, a strong adequately
trained local workforce, trade opportunities, a sound infrastructure system, and financing
mechanisms. The Economic Development Element is tied to the Land Use Element
through policies related to lot coverage, density, intensity, and infill of underutilized
properties, redevelopment and reinvestment, and the creation of a Downtown and
convention district. The Urban Design Element sets forth policy direction about creating
an identity for Rancho Cordova that makes it a distinctive place in the region, which
supports economic development activities. The Infrastructure, Service and Finance
Elements relates to the Economic Development Element through financing the City’s
infrastructure improvements, community services, public facilities, public services, and
establishing a comprehensive infrastructure system. This Element is also closely related to
the Housing Element with its workforce housing policies. The Circulation Element
contains policies related to improving circulation and access that support economic
development. The Open Space, Parks, and Trails Element sets forth policy direction about
creating community amenities, and improving the desirability and marketability of the City.
Where the overlap can be identified, cross-references are provided to alert the reader to
specific sections of the related elements.
ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SETTING
Rancho Cordova has many characteristics that make it a competitive business environment
within the Sacramento region. The City’s has several significant benefits, including the
following:
     •   Central location. Rancho Cordova has a central location in the Sacramento region
         with visibility and accessibility to Highway 50. Rancho Cordova has the advantage
         of being located along the Highway 50 corridor, which provides access to the
         greater Sacramento region and offers visibility, which is desirable to many
         businesses. The City is relatively centrally located in the region, just 10 miles east of
         Downtown Sacramento.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 5

                                          IV ECONOMIC
                            DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                 •   Strong job market. Rancho Cordova has a strong job market with large office and
                     industrial employment centers. Rancho Cordova has a strong job market
                     (approximately 3 jobs to every 1 household) with a significant cluster of office and
                     industrial employment centers in the Capital Center/Prospect Park, Trade Center,
                     Gold Center, Mather Commerce Center, and Sunrise Boulevard areas.
                 •   Airport and transit connections. Mather Airport and Regional Transit provide
                     unique transportation/transit services and connections directly to Rancho Cordova.
                 •   Safe and secure physical setting. Rancho Cordova has become a highly desirable
                     location for businesses and agencies seeking safe and secure sites because the City is
                     located in a seismically stable portion of the Sacramento Valley and outside of areas
                     prone to flooding.
                 •   Infrastructure. Most of the developed areas of the City have infrastructure in place
                     to serve new development and many properties are development-ready.
                 •   Comparatively affordable housing market. Rancho Cordova’s housing market is
                     relatively affordable compared to other major employment communities like Folsom
                     and Roseville.
                 •   Affordable office space. Rancho Cordova has some of the lowest rental rates for
                     office space in the immediate area for Class A, Class B and Class C office space.
                     Rancho Cordova also offers ample free parking and lots of available large floorplate
                     office buildings.
                 •   Quality workforce. Rancho Cordova has a quality, trained workforce that can
                     support business and industry in Rancho Cordova.
                 •   Synergy of clusters of business industries. Rancho Cordova contains synergistic
                     clusters of businesses industries such as home improvement centers, furniture stores,
                     auto dismantlers, insurance and investment, etc.
                 •   Redevelopment Area. A 2,500-acre Redevelopment Area has been selected that
                     encompasses a large portion of Folsom Boulevard. (See Figure ED-1). The
                     Redevelopment Plan will facilitate and help finance redevelopment efforts in the City
                     for maximum economic benefit..
                 •   Downtown. A 363-acre Downtown area has been selected along Folsom
                     Boulevard, Olson Drive, and Zinfandel Drive. The Downtown area will function as
                     a catalyst for redevelopment and infill projects in Rancho Cordova.

                                IV ECONOMIC
                 DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
     •    Convention District Overlay. The Convention District Overlay is the 193-acre
          area located around the Sunrise Boulevard and Folsom Boulevard intersection and
          extending south to Trade Center Drive and following Kilgore Road (see Figure LU-
          7). The overlay designation is intended to supplement any underlying General Plan
          land use designations. Land uses in the Convention District Overlay would include
          uses that foster and support a convention center, including hotels, restaurants,
          meeting spaces, shopping and entertainment. Retail and office uses are not
          excluded from the Convention area, provided they contribute to and support the
          convention center use and environment.
     •    Strong Community involvement. The leadership, businesses, and residents are
          heavily involved in the community’s economy and well-being (e.g., incorporation
          into cityhood).
Despite its generally competitive position within the region, Rancho Cordova faces some
challenges. Although the City is somewhat more affordable than many cities in the region, it
lacks an adequate supply of move-up and executive housing. The City’s existing assets
(including office buildings) are aging, and many will need to be renovated or refurbished in
coming years. Many of the office buildings are large floor plate with outdated interiors. The
challenge of the aging office buildings can often be solved with TI work (e.g., reconfiguring
the interiors, rewiring, etc.). Some of the existing infrastructure in the developed areas of
Rancho Cordova is inadequate and needs to be upgraded. Additionally, the City faces
transportation challenges due to congestion on major roadways and Highway 50 and a lack
of shuttles from light rail stations. The City also currently lacks national brand major
retailers and shopping opportunities. Local businesses are also challenged with the high
cost of doing business in California.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Rancho Cordova incorporated in 2003 as a jobs-rich community with aging
homes and apartments that did not serve the workforce. While quality new construction
ownership units have been added to the City’s housing stock, much of the older multi-family
rental stock is reaching the end of its economic life. Rancho Cordova’s housing and rental
prices are generally more affordable than most areas of the region. The City strives to ensure
that new development will complement existing communities and that the mix of housing in
the future will match the community’s housing needs.
Rancho Cordova is committed to a balanced housing strategy that considers the wide-
ranging issues associated with housing. In pursuing this strategy, we recognize that housing
is many things to many people:
      •   To the individual or family, housing is a safe shelter, a place for family, an
          investment, a sense of identity, a place to play/recreate, and a place to learn.
      •   To the community, housing is neighborhoods, community identity, sense of place,
          history, culture, and diversity, and a reflection of how people live and circulate.
      •   To the City, housing is civic pride, quality of life, diversity and unity, and an
          opportunity to ensure a livable, walkable, and sustainable community.
      •   To Economic Development, housing establishes market conditions, supports a
          diverse workforce, and attracts business leaders.
      •   To the developer, housing is a financial commitment, livelihood, commitment to
          creating built environment, and identity/reputation.
      •   To special needs populations, housing is quality of life, programs to support a
          lifestyle, opportunities, access, and choices.
      •   To schools, housing provides a stable environment for students that supports
          successful educational programs.
This Housing Element reflects the City’s desire to address our unique housing needs in a
manner that creates and sustains a balanced community.
                                                                                  RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                                               V: HOUSING
              PURPOSE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
              The purpose of the Housing Element is to identify housing solutions that solve our local
              housing problems and to satisfy the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA, discussed
              in detail on page 3) requirements. The City recognizes that housing is a need that is met
              through many resources and interest groups. This Element establishes the local goals,
              policies, and actions (programs) the City will implement and/or facilitate to solve our
              identified housing issues.
                              State Housing Element law requires the Housing Element to be consistent and
                              compatible with other General Plan elements. The Housing Element should
                              provide clear housing policy direction for making decisions pertaining to
                              zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital improvements.
                              State law (Government Code Section 65580 through 65589) mandates the
                              content of the Housing Element and requires an analysis of:
                    •   Population and employment trends;
                    •   The City’s fair share of the regional housing needs;
                    •   Household characteristics;
                    •   Land suitable for residential development;
                    •   Governmental and non-governmental constraints on the                  improvement,
                        maintenance, and development of housing for all income levels;
                    •   Special housing needs;
                    •   Opportunities for energy conservation; and
                    •   Publicly assisted housing developments that may convert to non-assisted housing
                        developments.
              The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and
              projected housing needs within the community and to set forth policies and schedules
              promoting the preservation, improvement, and development of diverse housing types
              available at a range of costs in Rancho Cordova.

ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
The Housing Element establishes policies and programs to address the housing concerns
listed below, which were identified during the preparation of this General Plan:
      •   Improving the condition of existing older apartments.
      •   Enhance the livability of existing, older neighborhoods.
      •   Facilitate reinvestment in existing neighborhoods as a catalyst for change.
      •   Incentivize the development of executive housing.
      •   Ensuring that housing is available for and in proximity to the City’s workforce.
      •   Promoting economic vitality through a balance of residential and employment land
          uses.
      •   Providing a range of housing choices that meet the needs of our residents.
      •   Supporting special needs housing – seniors, veterans, and persons with disabilities.
      •   Integrating mixed-income housing throughout the community, but with special
          attention to our newly developing Specific Plan areas.
HOUSING NEEDS
Planning for housing needs is very important at the statewide, regional, and local levels. For
the last 35 years in the United States, the gap between incomes and housing costs has
dramatically widened. Despite the recent fluctuations in the housing market resulting from
the housing boom and bust, housing affordable to low-, very low-, and extremely low-
income is still in critically short supply, as evidenced by the demand for subsidized housing
and housing vouchers that far outstrips the supply. Additionally, the stall in the home
building industry that resulted from the recession that followed the housing bust in 2007-
2008 resulted in fewer new homes built, and many cities are experiencing a housing shortage
as the economy and the housing market recovers.
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
The first step in addressing state housing needs is the Regional Housing Needs Plan
(RHNP), which is mandated by the State of California (Government Code, Section 65584)
and requires regions to address housing issues and needs based on future growth projections
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

                                                  V: HOUSING
              for the area. The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
              allocates regional housing needs numbers to regional councils of governments throughout
              the state. The RHNP for the Sacramento area is developed by the Sacramento Area Council
              of Governments (SACOG) which allocates to cities and the unincorporated county their
              “fair share” of the region’s projected housing needs, also known as the Regional Housing
              Needs Allocation (RHNA). The RHNP allocates the RHNA based on household income
              groupings over the eight-year planning period for each specific jurisdiction’s Housing
              Element.

              The intent of the RHNP is to ensure that local agencies not only address the needs within
              their jurisdictions but also provide for the housing needs for the entire region. Additionally,
              a major goal of the RHNP is to assure that every community provides an opportunity for a
              mix of affordable housing to all economic segments of its population. The RHNP
              jurisdictional allocations are made to ensure that an adequate number of sites with
              appropriate zoning are provided to address existing and anticipated housing demands during
              the planning period and to assure that market forces are not inhibited in addressing the
              housing needs for all facets of a particular community. Table H-2 provides the RHNA
              target for the planning period 2013 to 2021 (also referred to as “basic construction needs”)
              for each of the five household income groups for the City of Rancho Cordova.

Based on the state allocation needs, the City of Rancho Cordova will need to demonstrate
the capacity, based on appropriately zoned land, to accommodate 770 housing units
affordable to extremely low-income households, 770 housing units affordable to very low-
income households, and 1,079 housing units available to low-income households during the
current RHNA period. In addition, the City will have to demonstrate the capacity to
accommodate 1,303 housing units available to moderate-income households and 3,087
housing units available to above moderate-income households.
Since the 2008 Housing Element, the City of Rancho Cordova has added 17 housing units
affordable to extremely low-, very low- and low-income households. The City has also
produced 636 housing units affordable to moderate-income and above moderate-income
households. In order to determine the current land availability to meet the RHNP for the
City, HCD considers the existing land “zoned” for residential single- and multi-family
development.
While the Land Use Element establishes additional opportunities for mixed-use
development including multi-family residential uses, the analysis reflects only those lands
currently zoned for such in the City. Zoning designations include areas within adopted
Specific Plans and Special Planning Areas designated for residential or mixed-use
development. The City of Rancho Cordova currently has 106.82 acres of vacant and under-
utilized land available for multi-family residential development. The acreage would have
capacity for 2,898 units. Development is based on an average of the density range and a
consideration of site constraints. Sites with multiple use designations, such as
commercial/multi-family and office/multi-family, are considered appropriate sites to
accommodate future multi-family uses.

              The City has 713.87 acres of vacant land available for single-family development. The
              majority of vacant land in the City is zoned RD-4, -5, -7, and -10 and can accommodate an
              additional 5,567 single-family homes.
              There are also several development projects in various phases of entitlements that could add
              significant residentially zoned land. In addition to the City’s vacant land area, the adopted
              Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan (FBSP) development strategy will focus efforts on the
              promotion of new infill development, redevelopment of underutilized properties, and the
              revitalization of existing development along the Folsom Boulevard corridor.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
State law requires that “…the general plan elements and parts thereof comprise an
integrated, internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies….” The purpose of
requiring internal consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for
the future maintenance, improvement, and development of housing within the City.
The Housing Element of the Rancho Cordova General Plan spans an eight-year time period
and focuses on the city limits, while the overall Rancho Cordova General Plan includes goals
and policies that will direct the City as well as the Rancho Cordova Planning Area over a 20-
year period or longer. According to HCD, cities and counties located in SACOG’s
jurisdiction were required to submit their adopted Housing Element to HCD by October 31,
2013, for the planning period 2013 through 2021. Pursuant to state law, the Housing
Element will be updated for each subsequent planning period established by the state.
GOALS, POLICIES,                    AND    ACTIONS
The purpose of this section is to provide a plan for meeting the housing needs of the
existing and future residents of Rancho Cordova. The plan includes goals, policies, and
actions directed toward the preservation, improvement, and development of a range of
housing types and choices affordable to all income ranges in Rancho Cordova. Specifically,
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 7

              the goals, policies, and actions are designed to address the housing needs identified in the
              Housing Needs Assessment of this Housing Element. The housing program provides a
              foundation upon which detailed housing activities can be developed and implemented. The
              Housing Element includes the following goals:
                   •    Goal H.1: Balance Employment and Housing
                   •    Goal H.2: Neighborhood Preservation and Rehabilitation
                   •    Goal H.3: Encourage Housing Opportunities
                   •    Goal H.4: Pursue Sustainable Design
                   •    Goal H.5: Pursue Housing Resources
              GOAL H.1 – SEEK         A BALANCE OF HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES APPROPRIATE FOR
              THE RANGE OF JOBS AVAILABLE AND PLANNED IN THE CITY.
              Policy H.1.1 – Improve the City’s jobs-housing balance through ensuring that housing
              development in Rancho Cordova provides opportunities for all income levels in order to
              serve the full range of available and projected jobs in the City.
                  •   Action H.1.1.1 – The City will work with the Economic Development Department
                      to inquire with larger employers in the community to determine salary information
                      and employee preference regarding housing type.
                      Funding Source:             General Fund
                      Responsible Agency:         Economic Development Department
                      Time Frame:                 Inquire with employers once every two years.
              Policy H.1.2 – Maintain adequate sites that support a range of housing types appropriate for
              the City’s housing needs, taking into account employment projections, household growth,
              and the City’s share of regional housing needs.
                  •   Action H.1.2.1 – Residential development projects of 100 gross acres or more shall
                      include a minimum of 5 percent of the total project residential developable acreage
                      (net) for residential uses of 30 units per acre or higher. This minimum high density
                      acreage requirement is calculated to satisfy projected RHNA to the City.
                      Additionally the City will require a minimum of 5 percent for residential uses of 10
                      units per acre or higher. Development projects with a requirement of less than 5
                      acres in either or both categories may opt to designate land off-site, if deemed
8 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

                                    V: HOUSING
        appropriate for the project. If projects propose densities higher than the identified
        density, the required acreage shall be decreased accordingly.
        For example, if a project is required to provide 15 acres at 30 units per acre, that
        project could alternatively provide 11.25 acres at 40 units per acre. Similarly, if the
        project’s requirement for land with density of 10 units per acre was 6 acres, the
        project could alternatively provide 4 acres at 15 units per acre.
        For the purpose of satisfying the 5 percent for land uses at or above 30 units per
        acre, sites must meet the following requirements:
                 Sites must be zoned exclusively residential.
                 Acres used to satisfy RHNA requirements will be required to maintain set
                  minimum densities.
                 Sites must be of sufficient size to accommodate a minimum of 16 units per
                  site.
                 Sites must be proximate to public transportation routes which provide
                  ready access to fixed rail.

        Responsible Agency:         Planning Department, Housing Services Division
        Time Frame:                 Ongoing, as residential applications are received.
Policy H.1.3 – Promote a broader range of housing options for executives.
    •   Action H.1.3.1 – The City’s Zoning Code accommodates and facilitates the
        development of executive housing options in Specific Plans and large subdivisions
        (500+ units) in the Rural Residential (RR) and the Estate Residential (ER) zones.

Policy H.1.4 – Promote higher density housing in close proximity to transit, employment,
and appropriate services, such as transit-oriented development.
                                                                                  RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 9

                               V: HOUSING
• Action H.1.5.1 – The City has established the following guidelines to provide
  direction for the review of Affordable Housing Plans associated with individual
  development projects and to provide direction for the preparation of an Affordable
  Housing Ordinance if one is to be developed.
      o    The Affordable Housing Plan shall be approved in conjunction with the
           earliest stage of project entitlement, typically with the City Council approval
           of the Specific Plan, Development Agreement, or other primary land use
           entitlement.
      o    The Affordable Housing Plan shall specify and include the following:
                    A projection of the number of dwelling units that will be developed

                       to meet a portion of the City’s RHNA. These sites are mixed use sites and require a
                       Conditional Use Permit to allow for residential development. The CUP
                       requirement ensures that the commercial uses are compatible with residential
                       development. The sites already meet the location and environmental requirements
                       of the CUP and therefore applications on these sites will be expedited. The City will
                       monitor the development of these sites and upon consultation with developers
                       should the CUP process pose a constraint to the development of Housing, the City
                       will either change the CUP requirement to a Limited Use permit or find alternative

CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
Rancho Cordova, a city that incorporated recently as a result of the long-term efforts of its
citizens, prioritizes the involvement of its residents in the development of plans aimed at
improving the quality of life in the community, such as the General Plan and Housing
Element.
Therefore, Rancho Cordova welcomes that Section 65583[c][8] of the California
Government Code requires cities and counties to make a diligent effort to achieve
participation by all segments of the community in preparing a Housing Element.
Compliance with that regulation is in alignment with Rancho Cordova’s approach to citizen
participation.
The diligent effort required by state law means that local jurisdictions must do more than
issue the customary public notices and conduct standard public hearings prior to adopting a
Housing Element. State law requires cities and counties to take active steps to inform,
involve, and solicit input from the public, particularly low-income and minority households
that might otherwise not participate in the process. Active involvement of all segments of
the community may include one or more of the following:
      •   Outreach to community organizations serving low-income, special needs, and
          underserved populations;
      •   Special workshops, meetings, or study sessions that include participation by these
          groups;
      •   Establishment of an advisory committee with representatives of various housing
          interests; and
      •   Public information materials translated into languages other than English if a
          significant percentage of the population is not English-proficient.
To meet the requirements of state law, the City of Rancho Cordova has completed the
public outreach and community involvement activities described below.
PUBLIC WORKSHOPS                      AND     MEETINGS
In preparation for the update to the Housing Element, the City initiated broad public
participation to gather input on Rancho Cordova’s housing policies and implementation
strategies. All workshops and meetings associated with the Housing Element update are
listed below. Meetings were attended by residents of the City, developers, housing advocacy
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 27

               representatives, nonprofit housing organizations, and staff from the North State Building
               Industry Association.
                    January 2013 – A public workshop was held on January 10, 2013, to inform and educate
                         the community about the Housing Element update process, and to identify housing
                         issues in the City that informed the update process. Attendees included a variety of
                         stakeholder types, including nonprofits, representatives from the development
                         community, housing advocacy representatives, and residents. During the workshop,
                         attendees were informally surveyed to address: 1) who has the greatest need for
                         affordable housing in the community; 2) what income groups need more affordable
                         housing; and 3) what types of affordable housing are needed in Rancho Cordova.
                    March 2013 – A City Council special meeting was held on March 26, 2013, that served
                         as a general discussion to inform Council Members and the public about the
                         Housing Element update process, and to receive feedback from City Council and
                         attendees on the schedule, update process, and suggestions for topics to include in
                         the updated draft.
                    July 2013– Upcoming City Council meeting to obtain approval of the first updated draft
                         of Housing Element, to be submitted to HCD.
               Public Noticing
               The public workshop and City Council meetings were formally noticed in The Grapevine (the
               City’s local newspaper) and on the City’s website. The public workshop held on January 10th,

    VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                               Rancho Cordova will offer a vast, interconnected network of
 transportation and mobility options that allows for the efficient and effective movement of
 people and goods around the City. The City’s roadway network will be designed to provide
 many route options while discouraging excessive traffic within local neighborhoods. Streets
 will be inviting, multi-modal public spaces. Neighborhood, village, and district design will start
 with the pedestrian and work its way up to the cars. Bikeways and trails will be integrated
 throughout the community connecting residents, jobs, services, activities, and open spaces.
 Public transit will provide a viable transportation option for everyone, with local, Citywide, and
 regional services. Implementation of this Element will result in an improved circulation
 system for all modes of travel within the community.
INTRODUCTION
Circulation refers to the ability of people and goods to safely and efficiently move about the
community. Mobility is essential to a community’s success and quality of life for its
residents. Rancho Cordova faces many circulation challenges with regional congestion on
Highway 50 and Sunrise Boulevard, limited north-south and east-west connections, and
disconnected or uninviting pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The City will build a circulation
system that makes it easier to move throughout the City by focusing on an improved
network of major and connector roadways on a modified grid system, expanding transit
opportunities, and developing a network of pedestrian and bicycle routes throughout the
community.
PURPOSE
The Circulation Element describes existing and future transportation conditions and
systems. The Element establishes goals, policies, and actions that will guide the City’s
circulation system, including the roadway network, transit facilities and services, and bicycle
and pedestrian facilities. The text, maps, and diagrams are a basis for the development of
the City’s transportation network.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

             RELATED PLANS                 AND       PROGRAMS
             The Circulation Element relates closely to several other plans and programs, including the
             following:
                  •  Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) Blueprint Plan. SACOG
                     adopted its Preferred Blueprint Scenario in December 2004, which is a regional
                     vision to accommodate the projected growth and long-term needs of the region over
                     the next 50 years. The Blueprint Plan is intended to guide land use and
                     transportation choices as the region’s population is projected to grow from its
                     current population of 2 million to over 3.8 million and the amount of jobs is
                     projected to double to nearly 1.9 million by 2050.
                  •  The Regional Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP). The MTP is a 23-year
                     long-range plan for transportation improvements in the greater six-county
                     Sacramento region. The MTP establishes goals, policies, programs, and projects that
                     will meet the mobility needs of the Sacramento region. SACOG is the metropolitan
                     planning organization responsible for developing the MTP every three years.
                  •  Sacramento Regional Transit – planning and operational activities.
                     Sacramento Regional Transit is the public transit service provider in Rancho
                     Cordova, the County of Sacramento, and the City of Sacramento. They currently
                     operate a fleet of buses and a light rail network with facilities and services in the City
                     of Rancho Cordova.
                  •  Mather Field Airport Land Use Plan. SACOG develops and maintains the
                     comprehensive land use plan (CLUP/ALUP) for Mather Field, which is developed
                     to protect public health and safety and ensure compatible land uses in the areas
                     around the airport. Mather Airport is owned and operated by the Sacramento
                     County Department of Airports.
                  •  Caltrans standards. Caltrans establishes State minimum standards for several types
                     of transportation facilities including roadways, trails, and bicycle paths.
                  •  Rancho Cordova Transit Master Plan. This Plan designates the City’s preferred
                     transit system and is an implementing plan of the General Plan.
2 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

        VI CIRCULATION ELEMENT
• Rancho Cordova Pedestrian Master Plan. The Pedestrian Master Plan will

  facilities and contributed to the development of the bikeway network for the
  General Plan.
• Rancho Cordova Bicycle Master Plan. The Bicycle Master Plan will guide
  implementation of the bicycle network in the General Plan. This implementation
  document provides additional detail about the existing facilities, planned
  improvements, priorities, phasing, and funding to build the bicycle network.
• Rancho Cordova Street Design Standards. The Street Design Standards
  establish details regarding the design of all types of roadways within the City
  consistent with the General Plan.
• Rancho Cordova Improvement Standards. The Improvement Standards
  establish detailed design and construction requirements for the City’s transportation
  system consistent with the General Plan and Street Design Standards.

             RELATIONSHIP                TO    OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
             The Circulation Element is a mandatory element of the General Plan that is closely related to
             several of the other elements of this General Plan. It addresses the circulation system as
             necessitated by the increase in development described in the Land Use Element. Trails,
             bikeways, and pedestrian paths are discussed in conjunction with the Open Space, Parks, and
             Trails Element. This Element is also related to the Urban Design Element, with regard to
             streetscape design. The Circulation Element also relates to the Safety Element with regard to
             increasing safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists. Issues, goals, policies, and actions
             related to infrastructure (e.g. utilities) as required by the State General Plan Guidelines are
             addressed in the Infrastructure, Services, and Finance Element. Where appropriate, cross-
             references are provided to alert the reader to the applicable policies of actions in other
             elements.
             ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
             CIRCULATION SETTING
             Roadways
             The City of Rancho Cordova straddles U.S. Highway 50, a major eight-lane highway that
             serves local, regional, and interstate commuters. The General Plan Planning Area also
             contains several other major roadways used both by residents of the City and regional
             commuters traveling to and from the greater Sacramento area. These roadways include
             Sunrise Boulevard, a major north-south arterial for the eastern part of Sacramento County
             and Placer County; Zinfandel Drive, another north-south arterial that connects the northern
             residential areas of Rancho Cordova with the commercial and industrial areas south of
4 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

              VI CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Highway 50; Folsom Boulevard, a major east-west arterial running from Folsom to
Sacramento; and Jackson Highway (SR 16), connecting the Planning Area with Amador
County and other areas south-east of the City.
A few of the City’s roadways are currently operating at or near capacity and will see
additional demand as the General Plan Planning Area is built out. Some segments can be
improved or redesigned or have parallel capacity created to offset the demand; however, as
in the case of Highway 50 and Sunrise Boulevard, there are no obvious solutions to
increasing capacity along those roadways with physical roadway improvements, given
current commuter travel patterns. These facilities will continue to be impacted whether or
not any development occurs within the General Plan Planning Area. A limited number of
crossings over the American River connect north and south Sacramento County and no new
crossings are planned. The existing river crossings are already impacted and though
improvements may be made to the roadway, achieving the City’s desired level of service is
likely not possible.
Public Transit
Public transit is provided by the Sacramento Regional Transit District, includes bus service
and light rail. The light rail service parallels Folsom Boulevard, connecting downtown
Sacramento with the City of Folsom, including several transit stations in the City of Rancho
Cordova. Buses connect light rail passengers with the office/ retail and residential areas of
the City. Bus service also connects residents and employees of Rancho Cordova with
surrounding and nearby communities in the region.
Pedestrian and Bicycle Routes
The American River Parkway, the most scenic and heavily used off-street bikeways in the
region, follows the American River in the northern part of the City and provides recreation
opportunities for residents and visitors to the City. The Folsom South Canal, which runs
generally north-south through the center of the Planning Area, includes a bicycle path that is
separated from traffic, with both at-grade and grade-separated crossings at major roads.
This bicycle path is lightly used, most likely due to its limited accessibility.
Existing sidewalks and bicycle facilities throughout the community provide connections to
services and recreational areas. Some of the existing sidewalks, bike lanes, and trails are
disconnected, substandard, or require maintenance.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 5

                          VI CIRCULATION ELEMENT
             ISSUES THIS ELEMENT ATTEMPTS                                TO    SOLVE
             The Circulation Element must address a wide variety of issues in order to improve the
             circulation conditions in Rancho Cordova. The primary issues that this Element attempts to
             solve, which were identified during the preparation of the General Plan, are listed below.
                 •    Creating a complete transportation network that link all parts of the Planning Area
                      together with a variety of interconnected and overlapping modes and travel options.
                  •   Improving east-west and north-south connectivity throughout the City for all modes
                      of transportation.
                  •   Strengthening regional connections, specifically working with Caltrans to identify
                      potential improvements to Highway 50 and working with neighboring communities,
                      the County, and SACOG on development of the Elk Grove-Rancho Cordova-El
                      Dorado Hills connector.
                  •   Developing a road system that is easily navigated and sensible to visitors through
                      intelligent project design, road naming systems, and similar features. Avoid street
                      designs that create meandering roadways that do not have a clear and direct path and
                      “skewed” intersections where roads come together at angles that are not
                      perpendicular to each other.
                  •   Maintaining and improving the ability of employees to reach their jobs. As one of
                      the largest employment centers in the Sacramento region, Rancho Cordova must
                      accommodate major daily influxes of employees. This is key to the long-term
                      economic vitality of the community.
                  •   Providing efficient movement, in addition to employee access, for the City’s business
                      sector so that it may remain competitive and successful.
                  •   Making the City’s streets more pedestrian-friendly by improving sidewalks and
                      corresponding streetscapes.
                  •   Creating bikeways that are more desirable to a wide range of cyclists, especially
                      families with young children.
                  •   Ensuring that local roads through residential neighborhoods are properly designed
                      for connectivity and slower speeds.

             VI CIRCULATION ELEMENT
    •   Reducing vehicle congestion on the City’s roadways by promoting other modes of
        transportation.
    •   Increasing the number and convenience of transit opportunities within the Planning
        Area, by expanding routes, increasing frequency, and reducing safety concerns.
    •   Enhancing the functionality of light rail as an employee commuter option by
        providing convenient transit extensions from light rail to job centers.
    •   Providing better integration or expansion of the existing regional bus transit and
        light rail system that yields opportunities for increased transit use.
    •   Improving pedestrian and bicycle connections between light rail stations and local
        retail uses, especially retail uses along Folsom Boulevard.
    •   Creating safe and convenient freeway crossings for bicyclists and pedestrians
        traveling north-south, especially near the Downtown.
    •   Promoting pedestrian activity along Folsom Boulevard, while balancing the need to
        accommodate some through-traffic.
    •   Implementing appropriate signage and connectivity at access points to the
        American River Parkway and the Folsom South Canal bicycle trails.
    •   Improving traffic flow on existing roadways, possibly by pursuing high-tech
        improvements that maintain the traffic flow and increase safety for both motorists
        and pedestrians/bicyclists (e.g. Intelligent Transportation Systems, signal timing,
        bus priority strategies, and red light cameras).
    •   Managing traffic at the existing American River crossings, with the goal of reducing
        traffic congestion at or near the crossings.
    •   Implementating a Neighborhood Traffic Management Program
THE CIRCULATION PLAN
The future circulation system of Rancho Cordova is comprised of both the text of this
Element and the accompanying circulation maps (Figure C-1, Circulation Plan with
Roadway System and Sizing; C-2, Bikeway and Trails; and C-3, Transit System), which
describe the major roadways, bikeways and trails, and transit plans within the General Plan
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 7

                        implementation plans and studies, the Circulation Element lays the groundwork and defines
                        the role various modes of transportation will play in the movement of people and goods
                        around the City. The Circulation Plan also addresses pedestrian and bicycle mobility in
                        Rancho Cordova.

                        establishes a framework for local roadways and land use planning that respects natural
                        features while connecting neighborhoods, villages, and districts.
                        Table C-1 lists the categories of roadways addressed in this General Plan and describes how
                        these roadway categories relate to the City’s street types. Each of the General Plan roadway
                        categories is explained as part of the Circulation Plan.
                        Figure C-1 illustrates the City’s primary roadway network system, including
                        freeways/expressways, major roads, and connector roads. This figure only shows the major
                        roadways of the City that provide north-south and east-west connectivity. It does not
                        illustrate the many local and smaller connector roads that provide circulation within
                        neighborhoods and villages. These roadways will be designed at the neighborhood/local
                        level with subsequent Planning Area reviews. The roadway system and sizing diagram has
                        been designed in conjunction with the planned land uses and corresponding development
                        capacity identified in the Land Use Element. Grade-separated crossings identified on the
                        map are conceptual in nature only and are further addressed in the Bikeways and Trails
                        section of the Circulation Plan.

Freeways/Expressways
Freeways and expressways are the largest roadway types in the City.
The objective of these roadways is to move the greatest number of
vehicles as efficiently and safely as possible. All freeway crossings
with other roadways are grade-separated, access is limited, and
development does not open directly onto the freeway or expressway.
The only existing freeway in the General Plan Planning Area is U.S.
Highway 50, and no additional freeways are planned. Construction and improvements to
freeways are the responsibility of the State of California.
Limited access expressways within the General Plan Planning Area include Sunrise
Boulevard, Grant Line Road, Jackson Highway, Bradshaw Road, and Grant Line Road.
Limited access expressways are illustrated on Figure C-1 as 6 Lane Expressways.
Major Roads
Major roads provide for cross-town and regional travel and carry
heavy volumes of traffic, typically more than 13,000 average daily
trips. Major roads are four to six lanes wide and may include a
median for landscape buffering and dedicated turn lanes. Their
primary purpose is to connect villages and districts with one another.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 9
                           VI CIRCULATION ELEMENT
              Major roads are spaced approximately one-mile apart. Zinfandel Drive and White Rock
              Road are examples of major roads. Major roads may also include enhanced transit corridors
              as discussed in the Transit component of this Circulation Plan.
                                 Connector Roads
                                 Connector roads link neighborhoods and villages with one another and may
                                 connect neighborhoods and villages to districts. They are usually two to
                                 four lanes in width and include wide sidewalks, bicycle lanes, landscaped
                                 island medians, landscaping between the back of the curb and sidewalk
                                 and/or behind the sidewalk, along with other features that make them
                                 accessible and inviting to pedestrians. Generally, connector roads carry light
              to moderate traffic volumes and have speed limits in the 25 to 35 mile-per-hour range. Their
              average daily trip count is usually less than 13,000 trips. Connector roads are spaced
              approximately one-half mile apart. Coloma Road is an example of an existing connector
              road.
                                Local Roads
                                Local roads are commonly referred to as neighborhood streets. They are
                                small in scale – no more than two lanes wide – and have sidewalks,
                                landscaping, pedestrian-scale lighting, and other features that make them
                                inviting to walk along. Parking is typically provided on both sides of local
              roads and sidewalks may be attached or detached. Speed limits on local roadways usually do
              not exceed 25 miles per hour and traffic volumes are generally less than 5,000 average daily
              trips. The use of cul-de-sacs is highly discouraged; rather, streets should connect with other
              local roads using a “modified grid” system for improved connectivity and way finding.
              In non-residential areas of the City, local roads are used to connect businesses to connector
              and major roadways, much like they do in neighborhoods. Local roads in non-residential
              areas may be larger than their residential counterparts in order to facilitate the larger vehicles
              that may travel down them. Streets are still designed for lower speeds than connector or
              major roads and feature landscaping and vertical curbs. Parking may or may not be provided
              on one or both sides of the street.

             VI CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Intersection Improvements
The Circulation Plan (Figure C-1) shows a series of intersection
improvements (Tier 1 and Tier 2). Tier 1 improvements are
characterized as grade-separation improvements that separate opposing
flows of traffic to better increase throughput. This could be
accomplished by using flyovers that remove one or more direction of
travel from an intersection or by using full “urban interchanges.”
Urban interchanges are freeway-like grade-separated intersections that
feature bridges and on- and off-ramps similar to freeway-type interchanges, and provide for
uninterrupted flow of traffic on the intersecting streets. An example of an urban
interchange in the General Plan Planning Area would be the intersection of Watt Avenue
and La Riveria Drive, where the heaver traffic on Watt Avenue passes, uninterrupted, above
La Riveria Drive. On-ramps connect traffic on La Riveria Drive with Watt Avenue.
Tier 2 improvements are characterized as at-grade enhancements that increase traffic flow
and/or make the intersection safer for pedestrians and bicyclists. This may include adjusting
signal timing, signal preemption, and other Intelligent Transportation Systems
enhancements.
Special Treatments
Figure C-1 includes roadways with “special treatments.”
These are roadways that have been designed or redesigned
to accommodate large volumes of traffic while still
retaining access to adjacent businesses.           Potential
improvements to the corridors illustrated include the
addition of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes or bus-
only lanes, continuous right turn lanes, continuous-flow
intersections where the majority of traffic bypasses the intersection through some form of
grade separation, or other methods that increases the through-put of traffic along the
corridor.
BIKEWAYS            AND    TRAILS
The City’s vision is to become a bicycle-friendly community, where cycling is a viable mode
of transportation. To achieve this goal, the City will provide a safe and convenient network
of bike paths and lanes that connect residential, commercial, transit, and recreational
destinations. The City’s trail network will also link to existing and planned regional trail
                                                                             RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 13

              systems. Grade-separated crossings, such as bridges or under crossings, will be provided
              where necessary to provide a safe, seamless bike network. Regional trails will link the City to
              facilities such as Lake Natoma and Laguna Creek.
              Figure C-2 shows the City’s major network of bikeways and trails. Grade separated crossings
              identified on the map are conceptual in nature will be finalized with development of the
              Bikeway Master Plan, Trails Master Plan, and Pedestrian Master Plan. Neighborhood level
              pedestrian and bicycle planning and design will take place as part of project plan review.
              Special Treatment Facilities, as described on the Bikeways and Trails map, are corridors with
              a variety of unique circumstances that require a range of treatments options and actions that
              remove barriers to efficient bicycle circulation and improve the quality of the facility. The
              identified facilities are important corridors in the community and region, providing major
              connectivity to homes and businesses. Solutions for these corridors will be explored as part
              of the Bikeway Master Plan, but may include the use of both on- and off-street facilities,
              special or additional signalization specifically for bicycles, and other features as deemed
              appropriate as part of subsequent planning activities.

PEDESTRIAN PATHWAYS/WALKABILITY
The City seeks to become a premier walkable community and places a high emphasis on
creating a pedestrian environment. To achieve this, development will provide exceptional
places and paths for people to walk. Neighborhoods, villages, and districts will be inviting
places that allow people to walk from their homes to the village center to buy a carton of
milk. Sidewalks will be provided along streets; where they intersect a major street, special
treatments will be provided to help reduce the potential conflict between vehicles and
pedestrians.
Generally, big, wide streets inhibit pedestrian circulation by increasing the distance the
pedestrian must travel in order to cross the street. Pedestrians are also less inclined to use a
pathway when it is located adjacent to a soundwall. The preferred solution is to orient uses
and buildings close to the street to create an inviting atmosphere that promotes pedestrian
circulation.
As identified in Dan Burden’s Sharpening Our Tools report for Rancho Cordova, at-grade
roadway crossings are the best, most efficient way for pedestrians to circulation throughout
the community. Midblock crossings need to be provided for longer blocks to facilitate
continued, uninterrupted pedestrian movement.
Pedestrian paths are primarily developed as part of the roadway and trail systems of the City
and reflect the interconnected nature of circulation and transportation in Rancho Cordova.
The development of sidewalk standards and provisions for crosswalk and grade separated
crossings will be further defined through the creation of the Pedestrian Master Plan and
Street Design Standards.
TRANSIT
Transit is a key component of the City’s Circulation Plan and it involves moving people
within and through the City and the neighboring communities and connecting to the greater
region. Currently, the primary transit provider is the Sacramento Regional Transit District,
which operates bus and light rail service in and around Rancho Cordova, although the City
may establish transit services in addition to Regional Transit.
As the City grows, new routes will need to be developed to connect residential, commercial,
office, and industrial areas. Potential new transit services include “bus rapid transit,” jitneys,
trolleys/streetcars, and other services that connect to the existing system.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 17

                            VI CIRCULATION ELEMENT
              The Transit Master Plan identifies potential routes and modes for the future transit system(s)
              in Rancho Cordova. The objectives of the Transit Master Plan are to:
                   •    Join exiting and future areas of the City together and create a sense of unity with
                        regard to transit services.
                   •    Foster north/south, east/west connectivity that allows citizens to leave their cars at
                        home and utilize an attractive transit system..
                   •    Simplify current and future transit routes to provide more frequent and efficient
                        services.
                   •    Clarify and identify the system to riders through the use of public awareness
                        campaigns and other communications with the public.
                   •    Make service fun, fast, and frequent so that it attracts riders.
              The Transit Master Plan is partially described through the Transit System Map, Figure C-3.
              It identifies the regional and major citywide services planned for the City, including bus rapid
              transit lines along most of the major roads and a signature transit route. Other, more
              conventional local, city-, and region-wide services are planned but not illustrated on the map.
              The Transit Master Plan will develop these ideas and other transit-related concepts in greater
              detail.

Policy C.1.2 - Seek to maintain operations on all roadways and intersections at Level of
Service D or better at all times, including peak travel times, unless maintaining this Level of
Service would, in the City's judgment, be infeasible and/or conflict with the achievement of
other goals. Congestion in excess of Level of Service D may be accepted in these cases,
provided that provisions are made to improve traffic flow and/or promote non-vehicular
transportation as part of a development project or a City-initiated project. Please see Policy
C.1.3 for additional policy guidance related to this issue.
Examples of system improvements which may be accepted when Level of Service D cannot
be maintained include the following, where the improvement or funding is in excess of
standard City requirements:
    •    Development of on- or off-street bicycle or pedestrian circulation (not including
         sidewalks that are constructed as part of roadway improvements);
    •    Providing or funding public transportation facilities or services;
    •    Other features as determined appropriate by the City.
    •    Action C.1.2.1 - Adopt, and update as necessary, guidelines for the preparation of
         traffic impact analysis for proposed development projects. Items to be addressed
         may include the following:
         −    Guidelines for determining when traffic analysis is required;
         −    Guidelines for the preparation of traffic analysis; and
         −    Significance criteria for use in CEQA analysis of proposed projects.

         including roadway improvements, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and transit-
         related improvements, which the City will accept as offsets for congestion in
         accordance with this policy.
Policy C.1.3 - Recognize that regional traffic beyond the City’s control, as well as circulation
system decisions made prior to incorporation or by other agencies, will make it infeasible to
achieve the City’s desired Level of Service on all roadways. Subject development projects
which affect these roadways to the provisions of Policy C.1.2 to provide offsetting
improvements to the vehicular and/or non-vehicular transportation system.

    VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                            The City of Rancho Cordova will have a premier system of parks and
 open spaces that serve the needs of all residents. Parks of all sizes and types will attract
 residents and regional visitors to enjoy a variety of recreational and cultural programs and
 services. Rancho Cordova will be recognized nationally for its recreational amenities
 including the American River Parkway, Folsom South Canal, and connected open space and
 trail systems networked throughout the community. Open space will compliment both the
 City’s natural assets and the traditional park system, providing accessible lands that support a
 healthy community. The park system will promote a Citywide identity and will become a
 regional destination for recreation.
INTRODUCTION
Open space, parks, and trails are lands and facilities that provide enjoyment and beauty to the
residents of the community. Incorporating each of these elements throughout the City will
provide a place for active and passive recreation, help to preserve natural resources, and
improve air quality. Rancho Cordova will create a system of open space, parks, and trails that is
regionally unique, blending recreation and the natural environment (including natural resource
areas).
The City’s open space network will consist of a wide range of open space improvements
including regional trails, green infrastructure, greenways, neighborhood greens, urban plazas,
and streets.
PURPOSE
This Open Space, Parks, and Trails Element identifies the need to maintain existing open space
and natural recreational areas, as well as to create additional areas for the enjoyment of residents
and the protection of the environment. In combination, the Open Space, Parks and Trails
Element and the Natural Resources Element represent the conservation element of the General
Plan.      The Natural Resources Element identifies the ways in which the City will
                                                                                    RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

             protect, maintain, and enhance its natural resources. The goals, policies, and actions
             provided are intended to achieve the City’s vision of open spaces that are accessible to all
             members of the community. This Element establishes a policy framework and action
             program for the improvement, expansion, and maintenance of the City’s open space.
             RELATED PLANS                 AND      PROGRAMS
             The Open Space, Parks, and Trails Element relates to several other plans and programs,
             including the following:
                  •   Open Space Performance Standards. Under review when Rancho Cordova
                      prepared this General Plan, the Open Space Performance Standards will establish
                      standards for open space, trails, green infrastructure, greenways and
                      neighborhood outdoor gathering places to guide the development of these
                      important community amenities. These standards will serve as the City’s action
                      program for the improvement, expansion, and maintenance of the City’s open
                      space.
                  •   Cordova Recreation and Parks District (CRPD) Master Plan. Under
                      revision when Rancho Cordova prepared this General Plan, the CRPD will
                      establish park requirements, parks plans, and recreation programs for the entire
                      District, including the City of Rancho Cordova. CRPD provides park and
                      recreation services to the City and works with the City in the establishment of
                      parks policies.
                  •   Quimby Act. State legislation allows local jurisdictions to require dedication of
                      land for park and recreation purposes. This Element establishes the City’s
                      parkland dedication requirement.
                  •   American River Parkway Plan. The American River Parkway Plan was adopted
                      by Sacramento County in 1985 to manage the Parkway's natural resources, to
                      allow recreation in a natural environment, and to coordinate Parkway planning
                      and management efforts. The American River Parkway is a celebrated amenity
                      within the community and establishes the framework for the network of trails
                      described in this Element and the Circulation Element. The County is currently
                      updating the American River Parkway Plan and the City of Rancho Cordova is a
                      partner in the planning efforts to preserve and enhance the area and recreational
                      uses adjoining the City’s northern boundary.
                  •   Pedestrian Master Plan. Under review when Rancho Cordova prepared this
                      General Plan, the Pedestrian Master Plan will establish polices, programs, and

         projects to improve the pedestrian system with the City of Rancho Cordova. Many of the
         City’s planned pedestrian facilities are off-street shared trails as outlined in this Element
         and the Circulation Element.
    •    Bicycle Study and Bikeway Master Plan. The Bikeway Study analyzed existing bicycle
         facilities and contributed to the planning of the bikeway network for the General Plan. The
         Bicycle Master Plan will direct the implementation of the bicycle network described in the
         General Plan.
    •    Folsom South Canal Roadmap. Folsom South Canal Partners (including the City) was
         formed to explore ways to enhance the Folsom South Canal and the relationship to its
         surroundings. The Roadmap compiles information about the canal, outlines the goals and
         vision of the Partners, identifies a framework for future partnerships and agreements, and
         informs and guides a more detailed future planning effort.
    •    Upper Laguna Creek Collaborative. The Collaborative is advocating the planning,
         design, and development of a parkway along the Upper Laguna Creek. The City is
         participating in and supporting the effort of the Collaborative to develop a plan for Upper
         Laguna Creek.         Future successes will be incorporated into the General Plan
         implementation documents such as the Trails Master Plan.
    •    Rancho Cordova Design Guidelines. The Citywide Design Guidelines identify
         objectives, standards, and guidelines that are intended to encourage, promote, and require
         high-quality, pedestrian-oriented development while allowing flexibility in the design

             ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
             OPEN SPACE, PARKS,                        AND     TRAILS SETTING
             Rancho Cordova has a variety of open space, parks, and trails resources, and most are
             managed by an independent agency, the Cordova Recreation and Park District (CRPD).
             The City of Rancho Cordova does not provide its own park facilities, but relies instead on
             the CRPD. Providing parks is a cooperative effort, combining the City’s land use
             authority and CRPD’s efforts to build and operate park and recreation facilities. CRPD
             manages numerous parks that provide recreation opportunities, including swimming
             pools, picnic areas, basketball courts, soccer fields, and playgrounds. Hagan Park, a 75-
             acre park near Cordova High School, has a variety of amenities, including swimming
             pools, a petting barn, and a miniature steam railroad.
             The American River Parkway is a regional amenity, with over 20 miles of trails along the
             American River extending from Discovery Park to Folsom Lake. The Parkway abuts the
             City’s northern boundary with miles of river frontage. The Parkway is accessible at
             numerous locations in Rancho Cordova, including Hagan Park.
             Rancho Cordova lacks the creek corridors, ravines, and ridgelines that typically result in
             accessible open space in neighboring communities like the City of Folsom. Additionally,
             parkland in Rancho Cordova has historically not been provided at a rate adequate for first
             class outdoor recreation. Trends in population growth and recreation are projected to
             place additional pressure on park facilities.
             ISSUES         THIS      ELEMENT ATTEMPTS                      TO   SOLVE
             This Element identifies several issues in achieving the City’s open space, parks, and trails
             vision, including the following issues identified during the preparation of the General Plan:
                  •    Establishing additional open space for outdoor recreation, especially in currently
                       undeveloped areas.
                  •    Creating a premier park system, with a variety of facilities, landscaping types, and
                       recreational uses – dispersed throughout the community.

                            dedicate parkland at a rate of five acres of land per 1,000 population. When
                            necessary, provide an in-lieu payment option, which allows the developer to fund
                            the acquisition of acceptable land equal to the dedication requirement. Calculate
                            required parkland dedication exclusive of required open space.

                             Rancho Cordova will be a fiscally solvent community. The City will
 become a regional draw for businesses and cultural activities by providing efficient and well-
 financed infrastructure systems and public services. City leaders will ensure quality public

INTRODUCTION
Creating a successful, healthy community requires good land use planning, development of
sound infrastructure systems, and the provision of services to meet the needs of the
community. As a new City, Rancho Cordova must ensure that the planned land uses,
infrastructure, and services are fiscally viable. The City will prioritize and finance first-rate
infrastructure and services, increasing Rancho Cordova’s regional desirability. City leaders
will search for innovative financing mechanisms to ensure that adequate public services and
infrastructure systems are provided to residents in all current neighborhoods and future
developments. Ultimately, the infrastructure and services will be provided at the time they
are needed and in a manner that ensures the City’s fiscal solvency.
PURPOSE
This Element seeks to identify the ideal level and type of infrastructure and service provision
necessary to achieving the goal of becoming a first-rate city. It also explores possible
mechanisms to finance infrastructure and service improvements. The goals, polices, and
actions contained in the Element set forth methods for ensuring that Rancho Cordova
provide the highest service levels possible.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

              VIII INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVICES,
                             AND FINANCE ELEMENT
             RELATED PLANS                  AND    PROGRAMS
             The Infrastructure, Services, and Finance Element relates closely to several other plans and
             programs, including the following:
                 •   Rancho Cordova General Plan Pro Forma (Pro Forma). The Pro Forma is a
                     fiscal impact analysis of the General Plan that evaluates the economic viability of
                     proposed land uses, infrastructure and services. This corporate business analysis tool
                     will help to ensure that the City achieves and maintains fiscal solvency over the next
                     five, ten to 25 years, and beyond. The Pro Forma evaluates revenue and expenditure
                     relative to land use development and phasing with planned infrastructure and
                     services (including future services). City Finance and Planning staff, along with a
                     team of economic consultants, developed assumptions for the Pro Forma. The Pro
                     Forma relies on land use data from the General Plan Land Use Model (PLACE3S)
                     and economic data and analysis prepared by Bay Area Economics and Leland
                     Consulting including the Rancho Cordova Office Demand Analysis, Rancho
                     Cordova Retail Demand Analysis, and the Rancho Cordova Retail Strategy. The
                     General Plan Pro Forma is not a completed report. Rather, it is an evolving analytical
                     tool that will be updated regularly and used to evaluate the fiscal soundness of future
                     land use decisions.
                 •   Fiscal Impact of New Development (FIND) Model. The FIND Model was
                     designed by Ralph Anderson to assess the fiscal impact of development for a single
                     project or entire communities. The FIND Model is the primary tool used for the
                     City’s Pro Forma analysis of the General Plan. Cost and revenue data for City
                     operations supported by the General Plan was input to the FIND Model along with
                     development assumptions (General Plan land use type and phasing) to determine
                     that General Fund revenues will exceed expenditures with appropriate precautions.
                 •   Rancho Cordova Redevelopment Plan. The City’s Redevelopment Agency is
                     currently preparing a Redevelopment Plan that will allow the Agency to collect tax
                     increment revenue for the purpose of improving and redeveloping commercial and
                     residential areas, and supporting the production of mixed-income housing in the
                     City. The Redevelopment Plan Area is approximately 2,500 acres in size (see Figure
                     ED-1).
                 •   Rancho Cordova Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). The City adopted its first
                     CIP in 2005 establishing the five-year plan for phasing and financing of the City’s
                     roadway improvements. The CIP implements the City’s Circulation Plan as outlined
                     in the Circulation Element.

                  AND FINANCE ELEMENT
    •    Municipal Services Workshop, June 15, 2004. The City hosted a workshop
         focused on determining the scope of existing and future municipal services
         provided or to be provided in the future by the City. The input from this workshop
         was incorporated into the City’s General Plan Pro Forma.
    •    Cordova Recreation and Parks District (CRPD) Master Plan. The CRPD
         Master Plan, under preparation at the time this General Plan was prepared, will
         establish park requirements, parks plans, and recreation programs for the entire
         District, including the City of Rancho Cordova. The CRPD provides park and
         recreation services to the City and works with the City in the establishment of parks
         policies.
    •    Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo). LAFCos are State-mandated
         quasi-judicial countywide commissions. They oversee boundary changes of cities
         and special districts, the formation of new agencies (including the incorporation of
         new cities and districts), and the consolidation or reorganization of special districts
         and cities. Sacramento LAFCo approved the City’s incorporation and will consider
         any subsequent changes to the City’s Sphere of Influence boundary, annexation
         requests, or changes to service districts or boundaries affecting Rancho Cordova.
RELATIONSHIP                TO    OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Infrastructure, Services, and Finance Element relates closely with the Land Use
Element to identify feasible funding options for the provision of infrastructure and public
services to both existing and new development areas. The planned infrastructure for the
circulation network (roadway, trails and transit) are described and mapped in the Circulation
Element. It also relates to the Safety Element, where policies related to police and fire
protection are addressed, and the Open Space, Parks, and Trails Element, which discusses
planning for parks and recreational spaces.
ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVICES,                               AND    FINANCE SETTING
Infrastructure and public services are currently provided and financed in a variety of ways in
Rancho Cordova. Infrastructure typically consists of the transportation network, water and
sewer systems, and utilities systems. Public services generally include municipal services, fire
and police protection, public schools, hospitals, libraries, park and recreation services, as
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

               VIII INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVICES,
                             AND FINANCE ELEMENT
             well as social and cultural services. Currently, local government infrastructure and services
             provided by other entities at no cost or revenue to the City include: fire suppression,
             prevention, and search and rescue; emergency medical service and transport; water, sewer,
             storm drainage, gas and electricity and education. As the City grows, it is likely that the
             services provided by the City will also grow.
             The General Plan Pro Forma identifies potential future services based on background reports
             (e.g., Municipal Services Workshop, Needs Assessment Report) community input, and sound
             fiscal planning. Future services that could potentially receive General Fund support include
             cemetery maintenance, initial upstart for a local museum, supplemental funds for the existing
             library system, and supplemental funding for the recreation programs provided by the
             Cordova Recreation and Parks District (CRPD). Other future services receiving non-general
             fund support may include transit, housing, fine arts, convention center, parking, and
             emerging technologies such as solar power and wireless city.
             Transportation Network
             As outlined in the Circulation Element, the City’s transportation network is comprised of
             streets and sidewalks, trails, light rail and other transit. The City is responsible for planning
             and ensuring proper implementation of the City’s transportation network. Primary funding
             sources for these improvements include federal, state and local funds and grants, as well as
             City transportation fees paid by private development based on a fair-share contribution for
             impact.
             Water Provision
             A safe and reliable water supply, for drinking and for fire protection, is important to the
             health and well being of any community. The Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA)
             provides primary water service to the Planning Area. Other agencies, including the
             California-American Water Company, the Golden State Water Company, and Omochumne-
             Hartnell Water District provide water service to portions of the Planning Area not served by
             SCWA. The water provided by these agencies is diverted from rivers or extracted from the
             underground aquifer system. Properties not connected to the public water system are served
             by private wells. Water Districts are shown in Figure ISF-1.

                   GENERAL PLAN PLANNING AREA
Sewer Service
Sanitary sewer service is provided to the entire Planning Area by the County Sanitation
District 1. This agency operates and maintains the sewer system, which collects wastewater
flows from individual developments within the Planning Area and conveys them to the
Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District Interceptor system. Wastewater is
ultimately delivered to the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant north of Elk
Grove. See Figure ISF-2 for sewer service areas.
                                                                          RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 5

             Utilities
             The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) is the primary of electric service in the
             Planning Area and works closely with the City to ensure a reliable power supply for all
             residents. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides natural gas to all customers
             in the Planning Area. PG&E also owns and maintains some of the City’s electrical facilities.
             Several companies in the Planning Area, including Comcast and AT&T provide cable and
             telephone services.

Public Schools
The City of Rancho Cordova is served primarily by the Folsom Cordova Unified School
District and the Elk Grove Unified School District. A small portion of the existing City
along the western boundary is also served by the Sacramento City Unified School District.
Land outside the City in the Planning Area is also served by San Juan Unified School
District and Sacramento City School District. School district boundaries are shown in Figure
ISF-3. Students within the Planning Area are currently served by 17 elementary schools,
three middle schools and two high schools. Additionally, there are two high schools, two
middle schools, and one elementary school located outside of the Planning Area boundary
that serves students within the Planning Area.

                              AND FINANCE ELEMENT
             Both the Elk Grove and Folsom Cordova School Districts experienced substantial growth
             between 2000 and 2005 and are anticipated to continue to expand due to additional proposed
             development. In order to accommodate new students, both districts will need to construct
             new schools and expand existing facilities. The City will coordinate with the school districts
             on the development of residences and infrastructure with the siting and availability of public
             school facilities.
             Parks and Recreation Services
             The Cordova Parks and Recreation District (CRPD) provides comprehensive park
             development and maintenance services, as well as recreation programming for the City of
             Rancho Cordova. Land outside the City limits, within the Planning area, is served by both
             CRPD and Sacramento County Regional Parks (see Figure ISF-4). The City coordinates
             with CRPD in its land use authority to ensure that parkland dedication requirements are met
             and that parks are provided in accordance with the CRPD Master Plan and City policies on
             parks and open space.
             Financing of Public Facilities
             Public infrastructure systems are typically owned, operated, and maintained by public
             agencies, but may be funded through a variety of public and private mechanisms. The
             majority of public facilities in Rancho Cordova are funded by money from new development,
             specifically connection fees, property tax assessments, and impact fees.
             Prior to the City’s incorporation, public infrastructure funding and financing generally
             adhered to a “pay-as-you-go” strategy, and this often resulted in the construction of interim
             facilities. Permanent facilities were sometimes not constructed in a timely manner, resulting
             in traffic congestion, inadequate water or sewer service, and other problems. It is the City’s
             goal to ensure that public facilities, infrastructure, and services are fully funded and available
             at the time they are needed.

              This Element addresses the following issues, many of which were raised by community
              members during General Plan workshops:
                  •    Ensuring adequate financing for the City’s infrastructure improvements and
                       community services.
                  •    Ensuring that long-term funding sources are available to operate public facilities and
                       provide public services.
                  •    Establishing a comprehensive infrastructure system to meet the needs of existing
                       and future residents, employees, and visitors.
                                 •   Managing new development areas to ensure that roads, water lines,
                                     electrical facilities, and sewer systems are constructed in advance of
                                     residential development.
                                 •   Coordinating with water, sewer, and utility service providers to reduce
                                     incidences of service interruption, improve the quality and
                                     sustainability of services, and reduce per-unit costs.
                                 •   Creating public schools that are at the forefront of educational efforts,
                                     seen as a viable option by all parents, and are safe for children.
                                 •   Designing and providing local services to meet the needs of local
                                     residents.
                                 •   Minimizing visual impacts and physical impediments of utilities.

     VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                             Rancho Cordova will achieve a balance of natural resources and
 urban form through the compatible preservation of natural resources within the man-made
 environment. Natural resources will be protected, conserved, and reflected in the built
 environment. Creek corridors, preserves, trees, and open space areas will enhance
 neighborhoods and public spaces. The community’s water resources will be conserved and
 protected from contamination. All new development will be consistent with stormwater
 regulations and protect against erosion. The community will strive to conserve energy and to
 recycle construction materials, green waste, and consumer goods.
INTRODUCTION
Natural resources connect with urban life in many ways, providing an important relationship
between humans and the natural environment; including biological resources, and water
resources. Ensuring quality management and protection of the City’s numerous natural
resources will contribute to Rancho Cordova’s environmental health as well as to quality of
life for residents. The City will become a leader in natural resource conservation, managing
natural resources to ensure long-term sustainability while evaluating new opportunities and
techniques in conservation.
PURPOSE
The Natural Resources Element identifies the ways in which Rancho Cordova will protect,
maintain, and enhance its natural resources for the betterment of current residents and future
generations. In combination, the Natural Resources Element and the Open Space, Parks and
Trails Element represent the conservation element of the General Plan. The Open Space,
Parks and Trails Element contains details on the City’s Open Space Plan. It also attempts to
balance the present needs of resource users with the need for resource conservation for the
common good. The goals, policies, and actions in this Element will foster the preservation
of Rancho Cordova’s many valuable natural resources, including wildlife, habitat, water
resources, soils, and mineral resources.
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

              IX NATURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
             RELATED PLANS                 AND     PROGRAMS
             The Natural Resources Element relates to several other federal, State and local plans and
             programs, including the following:
                    National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act
                     (NEPA) is a federal environmental review process for projects that have a federal
                     nexus (e.g., impact federal resources or lands, receive federal funding, or require
                     federal approval or permits). NEPA requires federal agencies to integrate
                     environmental values into their decision-making processes by considering the
                     environmental impacts of their proposed actions and reasonable alternatives to those
                     actions. This Element is consistent with the intent of NEPA. It contains a goal and
                     supporting policies and actions related to protecting and preserving diverse wildlife
                     and plant habitat.
                    Federal Endangered Species Act. The Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA) is
                     a federal law that protects species that are endangered or threatened with extinction.
                     FESA prohibits the “take” of endangered or threatened wildlife species. “Take” is
                     defined as harassing, harming (including significantly modifying or degrading
                     habitat), pursuing, hunting, shooting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing, or
                     collecting wildlife species or any attempt to engage in such conduct (16 USC 1532,
                     50 CFR 17.3). Actions in this Element require the City to coordinate with federal
                     agencies on wetland preserves and creek corridors.
                    Vernal Pool Recovery Plan. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service’s Vernal Pool
                     Recovery Plan (Recovery Plan) covers 33 plant and animal species that occur
                     exclusively or primarily within the California and southern Oregon vernal pool
                     ecosystem. As drafted, the Recovery Plan identifies a five-part strategy to ameliorate
                     or eliminate threats to affected species and to preserve intact vernal pools. This
                     Element contains a goal, policies and actions related to preserving wetlands.
                    Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (404 Permits). Section 404 of the Clean
                     Water Act regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the
                     United States (waters of the U.S.), including wetlands and vernal pools. Activities in
                     waters of the U.S. that are regulated under this program include fill for development,
                     water resource projects (such as dams and levees), infrastructure development (such
                     as highways and airports) and mining projects. This Element contains a goal, policies
                     and actions related to preserving and mitigating for the loss of wetlands.
4 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

IX NATURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
  Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (Water Quality Certification). Section 401 of
   the Clean Water Act requires a State Water Quality Certification for all federal permit
   or license applications for any activity that may result in a discharge to a water body
   to ensure compliance with state water quality standards. Most Certifications are
   issued in connection with section 404 permits for dredge and fill discharges. The
   Central Valley Regional Water Quality Board issues Section 401 water quality
   certifications for projects in Rancho Cordova. This Element contains a goal with
   supporting policies and actions related to creeks and a goal with supporting policies
   and actions related to water quality.
  Section 402 of the Clean Water Act (NPDES Permits). Section 402 of the Clean
   Water Act establishes permit programs to authorize discharge of storm water from
   municipal storm sewer systems. Rancho Cordova has a Municipal Stormwater Permit
   under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit
   Program with Sacramento County, Elk Grove, Galt and the City of Sacramento. The
   Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley Region, issues and administers
   the Sacramento NPDES municipal stormwater permit. This Element contains a
   policy and supporting actions related to urban runoff and discharging materials into
   creeks.
  California Environmental Quality Act. The California Environmental Quality Act
   (CEQA) is the State’s environmental review process that requires public agencies to
   identify the significant environmental effects of a project and either avoid the
   significant environmental effects, where feasible, or mitigate the significant
   environmental effects, where feasible. This Element contains an action that
   specifically requires CEQA analysis of projects.
  California Endangered Species Act. The California Endangered Species Act is
   the State’s listing of endangered and threatened species. It requires state agencies to
   consult with the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) when preparing
   CEQA documents to ensure that the state lead agency actions do not jeopardize the
   existence of listed species. This Element contains a goal and supporting policies and
   actions related to protecting and preserving diverse wildlife and plant habitat, and an
   action requiring coordination with CDFG on Swainson’s hawk mitigation.
  California Fish and Game Code. The California Fish and Game Code contains
   laws and regulations relating to California's fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats.
   The Code is administered by the California Department of Fish and Game. This
   Element contains a goal and supporting policies and actions related to protecting and
                                                                           RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 5

              IX NATURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
                     preserving diverse wildlife and plant habitat, and an action requiring coordination
                     with CDFG on Swainson’s hawk mitigation.
                    Surface Mining and Reclamation Act. The Surface Mining and Reclamation Act
                     (SMARA) addresses the need for a continuing supply of mineral resources and to
                     prevent or minimize the negative impacts of surface mining to public health,
                     property and the environment. SMARA’s requirements apply to all surface mining
                     operations in California that disturb more than one acre or remove more than 1,000
                     cubic yards of material including, but is not limited to, prospecting and exploratory
                     activities, dredging and quarrying, streambed skimming, borrow pitting, and the
                     stockpiling of mined materials. This Element contains a goal and supporting policies
                     and actions related to environmentally sensitive extraction of minerals and
                     reclamation.
                    California Integrated Waste Management Act. The California Integrated Waste
                     Management Act (CIWMA) requires each city and county to prepare, adopt, and
                     submit to the California Integrated Waste Management Board a source reduction
                     and recycling element (SRRE) that demonstrates how the jurisdiction will meet the
                     IWMA’s mandated diversion goals. This Element contains a goal and supporting
                     policies and actions related to waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting.
                    California Public Resources Code, Sections 41500-41510. The Public Resources
                     Code (PRC) requires each city and county to prepare, adopt and submit to the Waste
                     Management Board a program for the safe collection, recycling, treatment, and
                     disposal of hazardous wastes that are generated by households. This Element
                     contains a goal and supporting policies and actions related to recycling and a goal
                     and supporting policies and actions related to recycling of hazardous materials.
                    South Sacramento Habitat Conservation Plan (SSHCP).                       The South
                     Sacramento Habitat Conservation Plan (SSHCP) is a mitigation plan being prepared
                     and managed by Sacramento County that seeks strategies that allow commercial,
                     residential, and other development, while balancing the needs of sensitive plant and
                     animal species. The SSHCP covers land within Sacramento County, including
                     portions of the cities of Rancho Cordova, Elk Grove and Galt. The SSHCP is
                     intended to consolidate environmental efforts to protect and enhance wetlands
                     (primarily vernal pools) and upland habitats to provide ecologically viable
                     conservation areas. The SSHCP will also minimize regulatory hurdles and streamline
                     the development permit process for projects that are covered by and consistent with
                     the plan. This Element contains a goal with supporting policies and actions related
                     to protecting and preserving diverse wildlife and plant habitat, a policy about

  IX NATURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
         participation in an HCP, and a goal with supporting policies and actions related to
         preserving natural wetlands.
        American River Parkway Plan. The American River Parkway Plan was adopted by
         the City of Sacramento, Sacramento County and the State Legislature to manage the
         Parkway's natural resources and promote recreation in a natural environment with
         minimal impacts. Sacramento County is currently updating the American River
         Parkway Plan. The ARPP Update is required because the context and usage of the
         three areas has changed considerably since the Plan was adopted. The City of
         Rancho Cordova is participating in the ARPP Update.                     This regional
         resource/amenity passes through the northern portion of Rancho Cordova. This
         Element contains a goal with supporting policies and actions related to protecting
         and preserving diverse wildlife and plant habitat.
RELATIONSHIP               TO    OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Natural Resources Element is closely related to the Open Space, Parks, and Trails
Element and Air Quality Element of the General Plan. The Open Space, Parks and Trails
Element contains goals, policies and actions that establish the open space plan for the City.
Together, the two elements represent the conservation element of the General Plan. The Air
Quality Element contains policies about maximizing air quality benefits through the use of
landscaping and trees, which are directly related to policies in the Natural Resources Element.
Where appropriate, cross-references are provided to alert the reader to information in the
other elements.
ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
NATURAL RESOURCES SETTING
The Planning Area contains many varied natural resources, from
habitats to creeks to water supplies.          Each resource has an
important function within the City and the region. The City does
not contain forests, harbors, or fisheries. Therefore, the Natural
Resources Element does not contain goals, policies or actions related
to such resources.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 7

              IX NATURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
             Plant and Animal Habitat
                                   A variety of unique and valuable habitats are found within the Planning
                                   Area, including, but not limited to, oak and cottonwood woodlands,
                                   various grasslands, vernal pool areas, and open water and rivers. The
                                   habitats of the Planning Area contain numerous special status plant and
                                   animal species. A comprehensive list of the habitats and species in the
                                   Planning Area is provided in the Background Report that accompanies
                                   the General Plan.
             Table NR-1 at the end of this Element includes a current list of special-status species that
             occur within the Rancho Cordova Planning Area.
             Wetlands and Creeks
             Wetlands and creeks in the Planning Area provide a variety of functions to the community.
             Creeks provide important ecosystem functions. The riparian habitat associated with creeks
             supports diverse and abundant plant and animal life and provides movement corridors for
             animals. Wetlands in the project area also have important ecological functions in that they
             support unique assemblages of specially adapted biota. In addition to their ecological
             functions, wetlands and creeks provide important water filtration and treatment, water
             supply, water storage, and recreational functions.
             Water Resources
             The Planning Area contains several surface water and groundwater resources. Major surface
             water resources include the American River, the Cosumnes River, Morrison Creek, Laguna
                                  Creek, Elder Creek, Buffalo Creek, Blodgett Reservoir, and the Folsom
                                  South Canal. Groundwater is found in aquifer zones underneath the
                                  Planning Area.
                                  Former Aerojet and Boeing operations associated with rocket testing
                                  resulted in groundwater contamination in portions of the Planning Area.
                                  The groundwater contamination spread in a plume that extends south
                                  and west within Rancho Cordova, as well as north under the American
                                  River into Carmichael. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
             designated the Aerojet property as a Superfund site. A site is only designated as a Superfund
             site if it has been contaminated by hazardous waste and if the Environmental Protection
             Agency (EPA) has identified the site as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to
             human health and/or the environment. In 2000, the EPA proposed a plan to clean up the
             plume of groundwater contamination to the west of the Aerojet property and to ensure
             continued, safe water supplies for area residents. Aerojet has installed wells, pipelines, and
8 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN
  IX NATURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
treatment systems in the first phase of their effort to remove the groundwater contamination.
Cleaning of the contamination officially began in 1979.
The current groundwater remediation is anticipated to be a long-term commitment, possibly
operating more than 100 years. A significant volume of extracted and treated groundwater,
possibly exceeding 30,000 acre-feet per year, is expected to be discharged to the American
River. After flowing downstream to the Sacramento River and south to the Freeport
pumping station, the water will be introduced into the County’s municipal water system. The
use of this water has been established through legal agreements between Aerojet, Sacramento
County, and affected local water agencies.
Water is provided to the Rancho Cordova’s Planning Area by three water purveyors including
Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA) Zone 40, Golden State Water Company
(GSWC), and California-American Water Company (Cal-Am). The City’s water supply is
currently provided by a combination of ground and surface water resources. Future water
supplies will be provided from a variety of sources, including: water from the Central Valley
Project; appropriate water supplies; water transfer supplies; groundwater; recycled water;
surface water from the American River; SMUD transfer water; and Aerojet replacement
water.
A Water Supply Evaluation was prepared for the General Plan to identify water supply needs
of the proposed General Plan under buildout of proposed land uses in the City’s current
boundaries as well as the Planning Area outside of the City under the State law providing for
coordination between cities and counties and water planning activities of water purveyors and
agencies. This work involved consultation with the current public and private water
purveyors in the Planning Area, as well as requests for formal consultation regarding water
supply availability by the City. Urban Water Management Plans (UWMP) for all water
purveyors were obtained and used in the Water Supply Evaluation. The UWMPs identified
the purveyor’s existing and projected future water supplies and projected water demands
through 2030 within each of their service areas.
Soils/Aggregate Resources
The soils in the Planning Area are largely expansive clay soils, which tend to present
challenges for construction. The Planning Area also contains approximately 10,275 acres of
mine tailings, which are comprised of high-quality aggregate resources and possibly mineral
resources such as gold. There are several existing mining operations within the Planning
Area, some of which may expand in the future. These operations will play an important role
in supplying materials for the build-out of the community.

              The goals, policies, and actions in this Element attempt to solve the following issues, raised
              during discussion of natural resource conservation:
                      Protecting wildlife and wetlands areas.
                      Encouraging the City and various public agencies to work together to establish
                       natural resource protection areas both inside and outside of the City.
                      Ensuring compatibility and mutual benefit, to the maximum extent feasible, between
                       mitigation preserves and urban development.
                      Reducing the impacts of new development on the use of water and mineral
                       resources.
                      Ensuring the availability of aggregate resources to support construction within the
                       City.
                      Maintaining continuous and uninterrupted connections between mitigation preserves
                       providing habitat corridors that allow species migration and minimize habitat and
                       species isolation.
                      Reducing solid waste production and promoting recycling activities that seek to
                       reduce the amount of solid waste to state-mandated levels.
              GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
              The goals of this element are as follows and are listed subsequently with corresponding
              policies and actions. The term “feasible” as used in the Natural Resources Element of the
              City General Plan shall be defined as follows: “Feasible” means capable of being
              accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account
              economic, environmental, legal, social and technological factors.
                      Goal NR1: Protect and preserve diverse wildlife and plant habitats, including
                       habitat for special status species.

        Goal NR.3: Preserve and maintain creek corridors and wetland preserves
         with useable buffer zones throughout the new development areas as feasible.)
        Goal NR.4: Encourage the planting and preservation of high-quality trees
         throughout the City.
        Goal NR.5: Protect the quantity and quality of the City’s water resources.
        Goal NR.6: Support the environmentally sensitive extraction of minerals and
         the subsequent reclamation of mined areas.
        Goal NR.7: Reduce per capita energy consumption.
        Goal NR.8: Promote waste reduction, reuse, recycling,
         and composting efforts.
GOAL NR.1 - PROTECT AND PRESERVE DIVERSE WILDLIFE AND
PLANT HABITATS, INCLUDING HABITAT FOR SPECIAL STATUS
SPECIES.
Policy NR.1.1 - Protect rare, threatened, and endangered species and
their habitats in accordance with State and federal law.
        Action NR.1.1.1 - Incorporate habitat preserves and interconnected wildlife
         corridors in new development areas to allow for animal movement where feasible
         and as necessary for viability of protected species.
                                                                                                   Cross reference:

        Action NR.1.1.2 – Review projects through the entitlement process and CEQA
         analysis to ensure that they comply with this policy if the site contains unique habitat,
         creeks, and/or wooded corridors.
        Action NR.1.1.3 - As part of the consideration of development applications for
         individual Planning Areas containing habitats that support special-status plant and
         animal species that are planned to be preserved, the City may require that these
         preserved habitats have interconnections with other habitat areas where feasible and
         appropriate to promote the viability of the preserved habitat to support the special-
         status species identified. The determination of the design and size of the
         “interconnections” shall be made by the City, with the consideration of a
         recommendation from a qualified professional, after California Department of Fish
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN        11

                      comment.
                     Action NR.1.1.4 - Prior to the approval of any public or private development
                      project in areas containing trees, the City shall require that a determinate survey be
                      conducted during the nesting season (March 1 and August 31) to identify if active
                      nesting by birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is taking
                      place. If all site disturbance is to occur outside this time, the actions described in
                      this mitigation measure are not required. If nesting activity is observed, consultation
                      with the City of Rancho Cordova Planning Department shall be conducted in order
                      to determine the appropriate mitigation, if any, required to minimize impacts to
                      nesting birds. No activity may occur within 100 feet of any nesting activity or as
                      otherwise required following consultation with the California Department of Fish
                      and Game.
              Policy NR.1.2 - Conserve Swainson’s hawk habitat consistent with State policies and
              Department of Fish and Game guidelines.
                     Action NR.1.2.1 – Establish a Swainson’s Hawk Ordinance in coordination with the
                      California Department of Fish and Game to establish the process of mitigating for
                      the loss of Swainson’s hawk foraging habitat based on habitat value lost to
                      development. The ordinance will set forth a process where habitat lost to
                      development will be mitigated through the permanent protection of equivalent or
                      better existing habitat conditions (referred to hereafter as “mitigation lands”). The
                      specific required mitigation ratios (habitat acreage lost versus mitigation lands) and
                      any other provisions to mitigation process shall be established through technical
                      studies as part of the development of the ordinance and will take into account value
                      of habitat to be converted in relation to habitat value of the mitigation lands (e.g.,
                      relation to nesting sites), proximity of the mitigation lands to adjacent conditions
                      affecting habitat (e.g., nearby land uses and already permanently protected lands),
                      and other relevant factors. The ordinance will also establish standards ensuring that
                      mitigation land will be adequately protected and managed in perpetuity (e.g., via
                      conservation easement, deed restriction or other appropriate method), and setting
                      forth the timing of the required provision of mitigation lands in relation with the
                      timing of the loss of habitat in the City (as its boundaries may be changed through
                      subsequent annexations), such that mitigation lands shall be provided no later than
                      prior to ground disturbance.
              Policy NR.1.3 – Promote educational programs that inform the public about natural
              resources.

         The Noxious Weed Ordinance shall include regulatory standards for construction
         activities that occur adjacent to natural areas to inhibit the establishment of noxious
         weeds through accidental seed import.
Policy NR.1.5 - Ensure the protection of wildlife through the establishment of programs to
control feral pet populations.
Policy NR.1.6 – Participate in the development of a habitat conservation plan to address the
unique biological resources in Rancho Cordova.
Policy NR.1.7 – Prior to project approval, the City shall require a biological resources
evaluation for private and public development projects in areas identified to contain or
possibly contain listed plant and/or wildlife species based upon the City’s biological resource
mapping provided in the General Plan EIR or other technical materials.
        Action NR.1.7.1 - For those areas in which special status species are found or likely
         to occur, the City shall require feasible mitigation of impacts to those species that
         ensure that the project does not contribute to the decline of the affected species such
         that their decline would impact the viability of the species. Feasible mitigation shall
         be determined by the City after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the
         California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) are provided an opportunity to
         comment, and may emphasize a multi-species approach. This may include
         development or participation in a habitat conservation plan.

              habitat to be impacted. No net loss may be accomplished by avoidance of the habitat,
              restoration of existing habitat, or creation of new habitat, or through some combination of
              the above.
              Policy NR.1.10 - The placement of new roadways within habitat preserves shall be
              discouraged, but is not prohibited. This Policy shall not apply to roadways shown in the
              Circulation Element or needed to meet goals or policies of the Circulation Element.
                                   Policy NR.1.11 - In such cases where a new roadway crosses a habitat
                                   preserve or separates two adjacent preserves, the roadway shall include
                                   design features, where feasible and appropriate, to allow for the
                                   movement of wildlife across or beneath the road without causing a hazard
                                   for vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians on the roadway.
                                   GOAL NR.2 - PRESERVE                THE   CITY’S    RICH AND DIVERSE
                                   NATURAL WETLANDS.
              Policy NR.2.1 – Require mitigation that provides for “no net loss” of wetlands consistent
              with current State and federal policies.
                      Action NR.2.1.1 - During the environmental review process, evaluate feasible on-
                       site alternatives that will reduce impacts to wetland resources and effectively preserve
                       these resources.
              Policy NR.2.2 - Ensure that direct and indirect effects to wetland habitats are mitigated to
              the extent feasible by environmentally sensitive project siting and design or other measures.
              Policy NR.2.3 – Work with private and non-profit conservation organizations to ensure
              competitive pricing for mitigation bank credits by allowing government agencies, non-profit
              organizations, and private landowners to establish vernal pool preserves, designate mitigation
              areas, create and restore vernal pools, and sell credits to developers for off-site mitigation.
              Policy NR.2.4 - Educate the public on the importance and benefit of wetlands areas.
                      Action NR.2.4.1 - Develop trails and associated educational facilities (e.g.,
                       information kiosks, signage) around wetland and vernal pool preserves where
                       possible while maintaining the integrity of sensitive natural resources.
                      Action NR.2.4.2 – Consider constructing low impact trails interior to preserves,
                       such as elevated board walkways, in coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife

     VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                           Rancho Cordova is a culturally diverse place, made up of people from
 all walks of life, each with their own culture and ethnic history. This diversity is celebrated
 and expressed through cultural art all around the community in a variety of places and
 venues that enhance the overall quality of life in the community. The local history is also
 preserved and available for enjoyment by the community through the identification and
 preservation of locally significant sites, buildings, memorabilia, and oral history.
INTRODUCTION
Cultural and Historic Resources refers to celebration of the people and history of the
community. Rancho Cordova is made up of a wide mix of people, cultures, and ethnic
groups which all contribute to the unique diversity of the City. Preserving the history of the
community and recognizing and celebrating cultural diversity contributes to the City’s sense
of place. Rancho Cordova will protect its historic resources, make them accessible to all
members of the community, and celebrate the community’s cultural diversity.

             RELATED PLANS                  AND     PROGRAMS
             The Cultural and Historic Resources Element relates to several other plans and programs,
             including the following:
                  •  Comprehensive Statewide Historic Preservation Plan for California (2000-
                     2005). The Comprehensive Statewide Historic Preservation Plan for California
                     provides guidance to the Office of Historic Preservation and the preservation
                     community for the identification, registration, protection, and preservation of
                     important historic resources. It encourages both the consideration of historic
                     preservation during planning activities at the local level and public and professional
                     support for historic preservation.
                  •  State Historic Building Code. The State Historic Building Code provides
                     regulations for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, relocation or
                     reconstruction of buildings or structures designated as qualified historic buildings or
                     properties.
                  •  The Sacramento County General Plan, Conservation Element.                          The
                     Sacramento County General includes a Conservation Element that includes a goal to
                     promote the inventory, protection and interpretation of the cultural heritage of the

                     Code development standards with more detailed provisions that direct the look and
                     feel of development. The Guidelines include provisions for the inclusion of
                     meaningful public art in development projects that contributes to the overall
                     character of the site and enhances the quality of life in the City.

RELATIONSHIP               TO    OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Cultural and Historic Resources Element is an optional element in the General Plan. It
relates most closely to the Land Use Element regarding land uses for performing arts
centers and other cultural or civic uses. This Element is also related to the Urban Design
Element in terms of design of public spaces and redefining community identity. Finally, this
Element is related to the Economic Development Element in terms of provisions for fine
arts, cultural, and performance venues in the City. Where the overlap can be identified,
cross-references are provided to alert the reader to specific sections of the related elements.
ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
CULTURAL RESOURCES SETTING
Rancho Cordova is comprised of a diverse mix of people from all walks of life. Rancho
Cordova is one of the most diverse communities in the region. Significant populations of
Russian, Spanish, Ukrainians, Armenians, and other ethnic groups are located within the
City. At least 20 different languages are participating in the English learners program at
Cordova High School. These diverse populations enhance the City by sharing their
traditions and customs with the rest of the community. Their diversity helps to make
Rancho Cordova a true “melting pot” of culture.
There are many existing businesses within the General Plan Planning Area that serve unique
ethnic populations with goods, services, foods, etc. One example of this is that 60 percent
of Korean-owned business in Sacramento County are located in Rancho Cordova. These
businesses contribute to the continued success of the different cultural and ethnic groups in
the community.
Adequately serving a diverse population is a key goal of the General Plan. It includes
providing the services and information necessary to having an informed and engaged public,
including reaching out to different segments of the population. The City is actively engaged
in providing information in a variety of languages that facilitate continued public
involvement in civic activities.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

                         X CULTURAL AND HISTORIC
                                  RESOURCES ELEMENT
             The culture of the community is also established in the visual and performing arts. There are
             no theatres or playhouses in the City; however there has been movement towards create a
             performing arts center. Providing opportunities for the enjoyment of the visual and
             performing arts is a vital component of building a city and helps to establish the quality of life
             in the community.
             HISTORIC RESOURCES SETTING
             The City of Rancho Cordova has a wealth of historic resources, including sites and buildings,
             artifacts, and memorabilia associated with Native Americans, gold mining, historic railroad
             operations, the Pony Express, Mather Field, rocket testing at Aerojet, and other locally
             historic events like incorporation. While there are only a few sites and buildings around the
             Planning Area that meet the basic criteria for designation as a State Historic Resource or
             State Historic Landmark, there are many other buildings that are of a significant historic
             value to the community. The following list includes some of the structures that are
             important to the community. It is intended that this list will be updated with additional sites
             as they are identified by the community.
                  •    A segment of the Sacramento Valley Railroad alignment that extended from
                       Sacramento to Folsom near Folsom Boulevard, which highlights the development of
                       communication and transportation facilities in the Rancho Cordova area and the
                       region.
                  •    The former location of Fifteen-Mile House, a station of the Central Overland Pony
                       Express, which is near the intersection of White Rock Road and Sunrise Boulevard.
                       This site also highlights the development of communication and transportation
                       facilities in the Rancho Cordova area and the region.
                  •    Pfingst Realty Company Building at 9878 Folsom Boulevard, which highlights the
                       economic (commercial and agricultural) development of Rancho Cordova. It was
                       built in 1860 and served as a train station for the area, being called Routier Station.
                  •    The American River Grange Hall at 2720 Kilgore Road, which also highlights the
                       economic (commercial and agricultural) development of Rancho Cordova. This site
                       has been listed on the California Historic Landmarks list.

     VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                             Rancho Cordova will be a community free of natural and manmade
  hazards. The City will emphasize proper planning, innovative design, and extensive
  improvements as a way of ensuring long-term safety for all. Quality design will increase
  actual and perceived safety, allowing residents to enjoy the City at all hours of the day and
  night and improving the City’s image.
INTRODUCTION
Safety is an important aspect in ensuring the general well being of City residents, and it
encompasses the response to many manmade and naturally occurring hazards. Rancho
Cordova currently faces a range of safety issues including traffic hazards, airport safety,
neighborhood policing, and flooding. The City’s response to these issues will determine its
success in maintaining and attracting residents and businesses. Rancho Cordova will create
an enjoyable environment that keeps all residents, employees, and visitors safe from harm.
PURPOSE
This Safety Element seeks to recognize and remedy both present and anticipated concerns
about the on-going well being of City residents, employees, and visitors. The goals, policies,
and actions identify viable solutions to minimize the potential risk of death, injuries,
property damage, and economic hardship and social displacement resulting from fires,
floods, earthquakes, landslides, and other hazards. Additionally, this Element addresses
safety and hazards related to airport land use, groundwater contamination, traffic and
pedestrian accidents at interfaces with rail lines, the potential release of hazardous materials
into the community, and general issues related to police and fire protection services.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                                  XI SAFETY ELEMENT
             RELATED PLANS                 AND     PROGRAMS
             The Safety Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the following:
                 •   Plans and activities of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
                     FEMA is the federal agency charged with preparing the nation for all hazards and
                     effectively managing federal responses and recovery efforts following any national
                     incident (e.g., major flood, earthquake, tornado, hurricane). FEMA also initiates
                     proactive mitigation activities, trains first responders, and manages the National
                     Flood Insurance Program and the U.S. Fire Administration. FEMA will coordinate
                     with the City’s designated emergency responders.
                 •   Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (OES). The OES coordinates overall
                     state agency response to major disasters in support of local government. The office
                     is responsible for assuring the state’s readiness to respond to and recover from
                     natural, manmade, and war-caused emergencies, and for assisting local governments
                     in their emergency preparedness, response and recovery efforts. OES Headquarters
                     is located in the City of Rancho Cordova and they will review and support the City’s
                     adoption of a local Emergency Management Plan.
                 •   California Environmental Quality Act (CEAQ).                    CEQA is the State’s
                     environmental review process that requires public agencies to identify the significant
                     environmental effects of a project, including potential safety hazards, and either
                     avoid the significant environmental effects, where feasible, or mitigate the significant
                     environmental effects, where feasible. All qualifying projects within the Rancho
                     Cordova General Plan Planning Area will be subject to environmental analysis
                     consistent with CEQA.
                 •   Local Emergency Management Plan. As provided for in State law, local
                     jurisdictions are required to establish plans and ordinances addressing emergency
                     management operations. This includes identifying hazards that may pose a major
                     threat to the City and how to address these potential threats should an emergency
                     occur. OES provides requirements and guidelines for such plans.
                 •   Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (SMFD) Master Plan. The SMFD
                     Master Plan provides policy guidance, objectives, and activities in an effort to
                     improve emergency response to the district’s citizens, use existing resources more
                     efficiently, and improve district facilities. Goals for Rancho Cordova include goals to
                     improve emergency response time and address deficiencies of existing fire stations
                     and equipment.
2 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

               XI SAFETY ELEMENT
• Local Floodplain Management Plan (FMP). A local FMP describes how a
  community will deal with its flooding problems. The current FMP for Rancho
  Cordova was approved by Sacramento County in 1999 and was adopted by the City
  at the time of incorporation.
• Mather Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP/ALUP). The Mather
  Airport CLUP/ALUP establishes planning boundaries for height, noise and safety
  around the airport.        The CLUP/ALUP also determines compatibility of
  surrounding land uses based upon noise levels associated with the airport
  operations and exposure of persons to crash hazards associated with aircraft and
  height restrictions. While Mather Airport is not located within the City’s current
  boundaries, the policies are incorporated into the City’s General Plan for land
  within the City and larger Planning Area.
• Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (1972). This legislation establishes
  a series of earthquake fault zones along and around surface traces of active fault
  lines. Local agencies are required to regulate development within these zones to
  prevent the construction of buildings used for human occupancy on surface trace of
  active faults. While there are no active faults within the Planning Area, the General
  Plan must evaluate the potential.
• Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (1990). This legislation addresses non-surface
  fault rupture earthquake hazards, including liquefaction and seismically induced
  landslides. It includes specific criteria for approving development projects that
  occur within a seismic hazard zone. While there are no seismic hazards identified
  within the Planning Area, the General Plan must evaluate the potential.
• Plans and Actions of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
  The EPA regulates cleanup of groundwater contamination and other pollutants that
  may be unsafe to humans and the natural environment. There are cleanup sites
  within the City and Planning Area, which must comply with the regulations of the
  EPA.
• Restoration Advisory Board (RAB). The EPA and the Department of Defense
  (DoD) developed a joint RAB for public involvement at military installations that
  require environmental restoration, including Mather. The RAB serves as an
  oversight committee for Superfund sites and operates under a set of
  Implementation Guidelines with the purpose of ensuring that all stakeholders have
  a voice and can actively participate in a timely and thorough manner in the review
  of restoration documents.
                                                                       RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

                                  XI SAFETY ELEMENT
             RELATIONSHIP                 TO    OTHER ELEMENTS
             The Safety Element works in conjunction with several of the other elements of the General
             Plan. Most specifically, it relates to the Infrastructure, Services, and Finance Element with the
             mutual goal of timely public service and infrastructure provision, and to the Land Use and
             Urban Design Elements, which promote safety through appropriate land use planning and
             site design. Portions of this element also relate to the Circulation Element when addressing
             safety at interfaces between different modes of travel.
             ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
             SAFETY SETTING
             Rancho Cordova is a safe community. The vast majority of the community is located outside
             of the 100-year floodplain, no active earthquake faults are known to exist in the region, and
             few existing structures pose a significant hazard to the community. Additionally, there are
             few likely targets for terrorist activities. For these reasons, Rancho Cordova is one of the
             safest communities in the region and is an attractive place to live, work, and recreate. The
             following discussion summarizes the safety issues for Rancho Cordova. Additional details
             can be found in the General Plan Environmental Impact Report.
             FLOODING             AND      DRAINAGE
                                      The General Plan Planning Area’s northern boundary follows the
                                      centerline of the American River and the southeastern boundary
                                      coincides with the 100-year floodplain of the Cosumnes River. Both
                                      rivers are considered potential flood hazards. The Elder Creek,
                                      Laguna Creek, and Morrison Creek floodplains are also located within
                                      the Planning Area. These waterways consist mostly of natural
                                      channels or small ditches, but they may be inundated during large
                                      storm events. The majority of the Planning Area is outside of the
                                      100-year floodplain, as illustrated in Figure S-1.

                      Regional Seismic Activity/Geological Hazards
                      Based on the soil characteristics and depth to groundwater in the Planning Area, the potential
                      for seismic activity and related damage is considered to be low. There are no known active
                      faults or Alquist-Priolo earthquake hazard zones in Rancho Cordova or Sacramento County.
                                                  Traffic and Pedestrian Accidents at At-Grade
                                                  Railroad Crossings
                                                  Several at-grade railroad crossings exist within the Planning Area.
                                                  They are primarily located along the light rail and heavy rail lines that
                                                  parallel Folsom Boulevard. All light rail crossings and the majority
                                                  of all heavy rail crossings are signalized with crossing arms, lights,
                                                  and bells that alert drivers and pedestrians to oncoming rail traffic.
                                                  Most crossings feature stop light preemption, which activtates a
                                                  green traffic light for vehicles crossing the rail lines in advance of
                      arriving rail traffic. This allows crossing traffic to clear the rail crossing in a safe and timely
                      manner.
                                              At-grade crossings are generally considered safe; however the planned
  Note: At-grade crossings are also discussed
  as part of the Noise and Circulation        growth of the community, and the associated increase in traffic, has the
  Elements.                                   potential for increasing the number is accidents that occur next to at-
                                              grade crossings within the Planning Area.
                                                Potential Release of Hazardous Materials
                                                Several businesses and industrial land uses in the Planning Area use
                                                and transport hazardous materials as a part of their operations.
                                                Existing land uses that may have a hazardous material component
                                                include mining operations, heavy and light industrial uses, propane
                                                tanks at Bradshaw and Folsom Boulevard, and commercial and retail
                                                operations. Additionally, US 50 and several major surface routes are
                                                used for the transportation of hazardous materials throughout the
                      region and State. As traffic and population increase, the potential for accidents involving
                      hazardous materials also increases.

                      XI SAFETY ELEMENT
Mather Airport Operations
Mather Airport is a full-service airport with 24-hour air traffic
control and an 11,300-foot runway, one of the longest in
California. The airport, a fixed base operator, offers aircraft
rentals, fueling, pilot services, and aircraft maintenance services
and facilities. Over 200 acres of land are available for new
construction at Mather Airport.
The Mather Field Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) establishes the airport’s planning
area boundaries and provides land use guidelines to determine compatible uses. The
policies of the CLUP place additional development conditions on new residential uses
within the General Plan Planning Area’s geographic boundaries. These policies provide
additional protection to the airport and the surrounding land uses. The three components
of the Mather Airport CLUP are:
     •   Airport Height Restrictions (Federal Airport Regulations Part 77), which limit the
         height of structures based on the distance from the runway through a series of
         imaginary surfaces (Figure S-2). In most cases, the height limitations established in
         the Land Use Element are less than the restrictions as prescribed by the imaginary
         surfaces, with the exception of the Downtown area. While the Land Use Element
         does not provide a height maximum for uses in the Downtown, Federal regulation
         limits the height as defined by the Imaginary Surface. Figure S-3 illustrates the
         imaginary surfaces for the Downtown.
     •   Airport Noise Compatibility (Airport Noise Contours and land use compatibility
         guidelines for noise), based on the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 150
         Noise Compatibility Study. This identifies appropriate uses for land surrounding
         the airport.
     •   Airport Safety Restriction Area (Clear Zone, Approach-Departure Zone, and Over
         flight Zone), which is the area around the airport that is exposed to the possibility
         of aircraft accidents. The safety zones are depicted on the Land Use Map in the
         Land Use Element and as Approach Surface (0 to 150 feet) in Figure S-2.

              Groundwater Contamination
              Due to groundwater contamination issues, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
              has designated two Superfund Sites in the Planning Area that contain hazardous waste likely
              to affect local ecosystems or people. These sites include Aerojet property and Mather Air
              force Base. Regulated cleanup activities are underway on both sites.
              Law Enforcement
              The Rancho Cordova Police Department is contracted through the Sacramento County
              Sheriff’s Department to provide patrol, traffic enforcement, investigations, and
              administrative services to the City. Portions of the General Plan Planning Area outside the
              current City limits are within the Sacramento County Sheriff Department’s jurisdictional
              boundaries.
              Fire Protection
              The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (SMFD) provides fire protection and prevention,
              fire safety education, and emergency medical response services to the citizens of Rancho
              Cordova. The City cooperates with SMFD to ensure adequate service levels for the City’s
              residents.
              In addition to fire related hazards from structures in urbanized areas, the main source of
              wildland fire in the Planning Area occurs where natural resource and habitat areas interface
              with urbanized development (e.g., along the American River Parkway and northern boundary
              of the Planning Area). Additionally, several of the new and proposed developments in the
              Planning Area contain large wetland preserves with natural vegetation, which have the
              potential to ignite and pose safety risks to adjacent and surrounding developments.

                       XI SAFETY ELEMENT
   •    Action S.6.1.2 – Site new land uses consistent with the CLUP for noise impacts and
        safety restrictions.
GOAL S.7 - DESIGN            NEIGHBORHOODS AND BUILDINGS IN A MANNER THAT
PREVENTS CRIME AND PROVIDES SECURITY AND SAFETY FOR PEOPLE AND
PROPERTY.
 Policy S.7.1 - Use Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles
 in the design of projects and buildings.
   •    Action S.7.1.1 – Adopt and periodically update development standards and design
        guidelines consistent with current Crime Prevention through Environmental Design
        (CPTED). Specifically, incorporate provisions to address the following:
         −    Natural Surveillance. Intended to keep intruders easily observable, natural
              surveillance provisions maximize visibility of people, parking areas, and
              building entrances (e.g., doors and windows that look out on to streets and
              parking areas, pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and streets, front porches, adequate
              nighttime lighting).
         −    Territorial Reinforcement. Physical design can create or extend a sphere of
              influence. Users then develop a sense of territorial control while potential
              offenders, perceiving this control, are discouraged. This design concept is
              implemented by features that define property lines and distinguish private

              treatments, and fences.
         −    Natural Access Control. A design concept directed primarily at decreasing
              crime opportunity by denying access to crime targets and creating a perception
              of risk for offenders. This design concept is achieved by designing streets,
              sidewalks, building entrances, and neighborhood gateways to clearly indicate
              public routes, and also by discouraging access to private areas with structural
              elements.
         −    Target Hardening. This is accomplished by adding features that prohibit entry
              or access, including window locks, dead bolts for doors, and interior door
              hinges.

     VISION
       S T A T E ME N T
                             Rancho Cordova will achieve cleaner skies, visible scenic corridors, a
  healthy community, and improved air quality. Residents, industries, and community leaders
  will actively promote innovative land use patterns, new modes of transportation, the use of
  alternative fuels, improved construction equipment, and widespread air quality efforts.
  Residents will be able to exercise and play outdoors year-round without being exposed to
  health risks.
INTRODUCTION
Air quality is measured by the level of certain pollutants in the air, and is a significant factor
in health, comfort, and well being within a community. Improving the air quality in Rancho
Cordova will enhance the quality of life of the City’s residents and employees and improve
the scenic visibility of the foothills and sierras. Rancho Cordova will approach air quality
issues comprehensively, leading to a noticeable improvement in both local and regional air
quality.
PURPOSE
This Air Quality Element establishes a framework for how the City will improve air quality
in the Planning Area and work with other communities in the region and the Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) to improve air quality in the
Sacramento Valley Air Basin. This Element also underscores the effects that land use
patterns and the resulting transportation behavior have on air quality. The goals, policies,
and actions outlined in this Element focus on improving air quality through embracing
regional coordination, “smart growth” land use concepts, transportation demand
management, energy conservation, cleaner industries and vehicles, and public education.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                         XII AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
             RELATED PLANS                 AND       PROGRAMS
             The Air Quality Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the following:
                 •   California Clean Air Act. The California Clean Air Act requires nonattainment
                     areas to achieve and maintain the state ambient air quality standards by the earliest
                     practicable date and also requires local air districts to develop plans for attaining the
                     state ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide standards. The
                     Air Quality Element contains policies that support attainment of air quality
                     standards.
                                     •   1994 Sacramento Area Regional Ozone Attainment Plan. The
                                         Clean Air Plan was developed cooperatively with all the air quality
                                         districts in the Sacramento Region. Because the region could not
                                         demonstrate compliance with federal ozone standards, the region
                                         accepted a designation of “severe nonattainment” for the federal
                                         one-hour ozone standard, and additional emission requirements
                                         were placed on stationary sources. The Air Quality Element
                                         contains policies that support attainment of air quality standards.
                 •   Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)
                     Rules and Regulations. The rules are comprised of 10 regulations, including:
                     General Rules; Permits; Fees; Prohibitory Rules; Agricultural Burning; Hearing
                     Board; Emergency Episode Plan; New Source Performance Standards; National
                     Emission Standards For Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESAPs); and Mobile Sources.
                     The Air Quality Element contains policies related to new pollution sources, emission
                     standards and mobile sources.
                 •   Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)
                     Guide to Air Quality Assessment in Sacramento County. SMAQMD has
                     developed the Guide to Air Quality Assessment in Sacramento County for
                     calculating a project’s air quality impacts during the environmental review process.
                     SMAQMD recommends that this Guide be used by lead agencies at local, State, and
                     federal levels for projects that are likely to result in emission impacts in Sacramento
                     County. The Air Quality Element contains policies related to coordinating with
                     SMAQMD on environmental documents for projects.
                 •   California Air Resources Board’s “Air Quality and Land Use Handbook: A
                     Community Health Perspective”. The California Environmental Protection
                     Agency and the California Air Resources Board released the “Air Quality and Land
                     Use Handbook: A Community Health Perspective” (handbook) in April 2005. The
2 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

        XII AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
  handbook recommends specific buffers between heavily traveled roadways (e.g.,
  freeways) and land uses for sensitive populations. The Air Quality and Land Use
  Elements contain policies related to buffers between incompatible land uses.
• Sacramento Transportation and Air Quality Collaborative. The Collaborative is
  a consortium of 48 regional and local organizations developed to address air quality,
  transportation, land use, and governance issues in the greater Sacramento area. The
  Collaborative seeks to increase public participation through education, evaluation of
  transit systems, land use developments, jobs/housing balances, and encouragement
  of regional planning efforts to achieve and maintain clean air quality as measured by
  federal and state ambient air quality standards. The Air Quality, Land Use, and
  Housing Elements contain policies that are support the Collaborative’s efforts in
  land planning, jobs-housing balances, and achieving air quality standards.
• Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP). The MTP is a 23-year long-range
  plan for transportation improvements in the greater six-county Sacramento region.
  The MTP establishes goals, policies, programs, and projects that will meet the
  mobility needs of the Sacramento region while satisfying federal air quality
  standards. SACOG is the metropolitan planning organization responsible for
  developing the MTP every three years. The Circulation and Air Quality Elements
  contain policies for mobility and attainment of air quality standards.
• Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Program (MTIP). The MTIP is
  the short-term implementation plan for the MTP. The current MTIP is the
  2005/07 plan. The MTIP contains two separate documents, 1) Sacramento Ozone
  Non-Attainment Area and 2) Yuba Sutter Ozone Non-Attainment Area. The Air
  Quality Element contains policies that support attainment of air quality standards.
• Caltrans publications and guidance on air quality. The Caltrans Division of
  Environmental Analysis Headquarters Air Quality Coordination Branch manages
  regional and project-level air quality issues, consults and coordinates with State,
  federal, and regional air and transportation planning agencies, and builds and
  maintains air quality analysis tools and procedures related to transportation air
  quality issues, including model and guidance documents. The Circulation and Air
  Quality Elements contain policies for transportation and attainment of air quality
  standards.
• Rancho Cordova Pedestrian Master Plan. The Pedestrian Master Plan
  establishes polices, programs, and projects to improve the pedestrian system with
  the City of Rancho Cordova. An improved pedestrian system will allow more
  people to use walking as a method of transit, reducing automobile emissions and
                                                                         RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

                          XII AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
                      thus improve air quality. This Element contains policies and actions related to
                      encouraging all modes of transportation, including walking.
             RELATIONSHIP                TO     OTHER ELEMENTS
             The Air Quality Element an optional element chosen for inclusion because it addresses
             significant local needs and issues. The Air Quality Element directs policy on air quality in
             Rancho Cordova and is closely related to other General Plan Elements. This element is tied
             to the Land Use Element through policies related to land use patterns and density. The
             Circulation Element is related to this element through policies related to supporting multiple
                                               forms of transportation to improve air quality. The Air
                                               Quality Element relates to the Urban Design Element
                                               through policies pertaining to landscaping, and
                                               walking/bicycling to services and shopping. The Economic
                                               Development Element contains policies related to
                                               encouraging infill to reduce air pollution. Where the overlap
                                               can be identified, cross-references are provided to alert the
                                               reader to the other elements.
             ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
             SETTING
             The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board
             established ambient air quality standards for common pollutants. These standards represent
             the safe levels of contaminants that avoid the specific adverse health effects associated with
             each pollutant. The most common air pollutants with known harmful effects are listed below.
                 •    Ozone, commonly referred to as smog, is a respiratory irritant that increases
                      susceptibility to respiratory infections and diseases and harms lung tissue at high
                      concentrations.
                 •    Fine particulate matter is produced by fuel-burning vehicles and industries and
                      affects health because it can bypass the body’s natural filtration system more easily
                      than larger particles, lodging deep in the lungs.

                XII AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
     •    Carbon monoxide is produced mainly by motor vehicle emissions and at low
          concentrations reduces the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream and may
          aggravate cardiovascular disease.
     •    Toxic air contaminants may be released as emissions from normal operations, or
          during accidental releases of hazardous materials. Adverse health effects of toxic air
          contaminants include cancer, birth defects, neurological damage, and death.
Rancho Cordova is located within Sacramento County, which is located at the southern end
of the Sacramento Valley Air Basin. At the time this General Plan was prepared,
Sacramento County was designated nonattainment of national and state ambient air quality
standards (AAQS) for ozone and PM10, as well as the state AAQS for PM2.5. The County
was designated attainment or unclassified for all remaining pollutants.
Rancho Cordova Air Quality Monitoring Data
The SMAQMD and ARB maintain several air quality monitoring sites in the Sacramento
area, however, none are located in the City of Rancho Cordova and not all monitoring sites
measure all air pollutants. For instance, the Sloughhouse monitoring site, which is the site
nearest to the City, only measures ozone. The nearest monitoring site for carbon monoxide,
PM2.5, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Sulfur Dioxide is at Del Paso Manor at 2701 Avalon Dr. in
Sacramento. The nearest monitoring site for PM10 is the Sacramento Branch Center Road
site, located near Bradshaw Road south of U.S. 50, within the Planning Area. Based on
these monitoring sites, all federal ambient air quality standards have been met in the City,
with the exception of ozone, which exceeded the eight-hour average on ten occasions in
2005. Also, California standards for PM10 and ozone were exceeded in the City in 2005.
Table AQ-1 shows monitoring data on Rancho Cordova’s air quality.
Air quality is a regional issue that rarely affects just one city. Regional growth patterns and
other jurisdictions’ contributions to pollution will continue to contribute the City’s air
quality issues.
Sources of Air Pollution in Rancho Cordova
Stationary sources of air pollution in Rancho Cordova include A. Teichert & Son Aggregate,
AeroJet, Puente Wood Products, Sacramento Rendering Company, Teledyne Mec, Granite
Construction, and concrete recycling. Mobile sources of air pollution in Rancho Cordova
include cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, off-road equipment, construction activities, and
consumer products, as well as gas-powered lawn tools and mowers, farm and construction
equipment, recreational vehicles, planes, and trains. Sources of toxic air contaminants in
Rancho Cordova include manufacturing facilities, the Kiefer Landfill, and diesel exhaust
from auto body shops, auto machine shops, dry cleaners, and gas stations. Indirect sources
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 5

                           XII AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
             of air pollution are predominantly from vehicle trips along major thoroughfares through and
             adjacent to Rancho Cordova.
             Air Quality Emissions Under Buildout
             Increases in operational air impacts with implementation of the proposed General Plan
             would generally consist of stationary and mobile sources.
                 •    A stationary source of air pollution refers to an emission source that does not move
                      (e.g., utilities and chemical and manufacturing facilities). Often, stationary sources are
                      defined as large emitters that release relatively consistent qualities and quantities of
                      pollutants. The term “area source” is used to describe the many smaller stationary
                      sources located together whose individual emissions may be low, but whose
                      collective emissions can be significant. Typically, area sources are those that emit less
                      than 25 tons per year of any combination of hazardous air pollutants, or less than 10
                      tons per year of any single hazardous air pollutant.
                 •    A mobile source of air pollution refers to a source that is capable of moving under
                      its own power. In general, mobile sources imply on-road transportation, but there is
                      also a non-road or off-road category that includes gas-powered lawn tools and
                      mowers, farm and construction equipment, recreational vehicles, boats, planes, and
                      trains.
             Increases in industrial, commercial, and office uses as well as services that provide for an
             increasing population, intensify stationary source air emissions. According to this analysis,
             under buildout conditions, uses in the Planning Area may produce 14,296.66 tons of ROG,
             3,168.86 tons of NOx, and 8,420.85 tons of PM10 per year. The projected air quality

ISSUES THIS ELEMENT ATTEMPTS                                TO    SOLVE
The primary issues that the Air Quality Element attempts to solve, many of which were
raised during General Plan workshops, include the following:
     •   Reversing increases in regional air pollution and achieving attainment for ozone
         levels at both the federal and state standards.
     •   Reducing or eliminating residents’ health concerns that are attributable to air quality
         impacts.
     •   Improving visibility of scenic vistas.
     •   Creating incentives to decrease the number of vehicle miles traveled, length of trips,
         and traffic congestion.
     •   Improving air quality through land use and circulation patterns to discourage fuel-
         powered transit.
     •   Creating more choices for multiple forms of transportation and strengthening
         pedestrian and bicycle mobility.
While the focus of this element is on improving our local air quality, it is important to
recognize that this element cannot change regional growth patterns or contributions to air
pollution from other jurisdictions.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
The goals of this element are as follows and are listed subsequently with corresponding
policies and actions.
     •   Goal AQ.1: Ensure a healthy community by participating in local and
         regional efforts to meet or exceed all state and federal air quality standards.
     •   Goal AQ.2: Support land use patterns and densities that lessen air quality
         impacts.
     •   Goal AQ.3: Support multiple forms of transportation and a circulation system
         design that reduces vehicle trips and emissions.
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 9

                            XII AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
                  •    Goal AQ.4: Support energy conservation, the use of alternative fuels, clean
                       vehicles and industries to reduce air quality impacts.
                  •    Goal AQ.5: Promote educational efforts to inform the community about the
                       significance of air quality.
              GOAL AQ.1 - ENSURE A HEALTHY COMMUNITY BY PARTICIPATING IN LOCAL AND
              REGIONAL EFFORTS TO MEET OR EXCEED ALL STATE AND FEDERAL AIR QUALITY
              STANDARDS.
              Policy AQ.1.1 - Coordinate with responsible agencies and other jurisdictions to improve air
              quality within Rancho Cordova and the greater Sacramento region.

                       Resources Board, SMAQMD, and SACOG to ensure that City facilities and
                       operations comply with mandated measures.
                                       •   Action AQ.1.1.2 - Support SMAQMD in the development of
                                           improved ambient air quality monitoring capabilities, as well as
                                           the establishment of standards that more adequately address the
                                           air quality impacts of proposed project plans and proposals.
                                       •   Action AQ.1.1.3 – Support intergovernmental efforts directed at
                                           adopting stricter standards related to lowest emission technology
                                           vehicles, and more efficient burning engines and fuels (e.g.,
                                           HVAC, generators, construction equipment, stricter tailpipe
                                           emissions standards, etc.).
                  •    Action AQ.1.1.4 - Update the General Plan as necessary if updates to the
                       Sacramento Area Regional Ozone Attainment Plan would create inconsistencies
                       between future buildout of the General Plan Planning Area and the Attainment Plan.
              Policy AQ.1.2 – Evaluate projects for compliance with State and federal ambient air quality
              standards and the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District’s (SMAQMD)
              thresholds of significance. (Refer to Table AQ-3 in this Element for ambient air quality
              standards.)
                  •    Action AQ.1.2.1 - Coordinate with SMAQMD through the environmental review
                       process to ensure that proposed projects would not significantly affect the region’s
                       ability to meet State and federal air quality standards.

     VISION
      S T A T E ME N T
                          The City will strive to create a community free of noise disturbances. All
 City residents and visitors will be able to enjoy indoor and outdoor spaces without the intrusion
 of harmful levels of noise. Noise mitigation efforts that emphasize site and project design will
 encourage attractive and natural spaces across all land uses.
INTRODUCTION
Noise is any unwanted sound that interferes with an individual’s ability to perform a task or
enjoy an activity. While there are sounds that are considered desirable, this element is
intended to address unwanted sounds for the health, safety, and welfare of the community.
Removing or reducing the impact of significant sources of noise will improve quality of life
for Rancho Cordova’s residents, employees, and visitors. The City will remove major
sources of noise when possible and mitigate the impacts of all other noise-producing
activities.
PURPOSE
The goal of this Noise Element is to identify the major sources of noise within the City and
discuss the City’s role in ensuring comfortable and safe noise levels throughout the
community. The goals, policies, and actions provided will, when implemented, improve the
noise environment in the Planning Area.
                                                                             RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                                 XIII NOISE ELEMENT
             RELATED PLANS                 AND     PROGRAMS
             The Noise Element relates to several other plans and programs, including the following:
                 •   Mather Field Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP/ALUP). The Mather
                     Field CLUP/ALUP includes regional policies to ensure land use compatibility with
                     respect to aircraft noise. For all development occurring near the Mather Airport, the
                     Plan requires affected cities and counties to evaluate the impact of aircraft noise on
                     proposed development and to consider requiring noise reduction measures, aviation
                     noise easements, and buyer or renter notification.
                 •   Regional Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP). The MTP incorporates land
                     use planning to transportation improvements throughout the six-county region.
                     Traffic modeling estimates traffic volumes and data used in acoustical analysis of
                     transportation noise.
                 •   Planning and Operational Activities of Sacramento Regional Transit. RT
                     provides details about planned transit facilities and operations used in acoustical
                     analysis of transportation noise. Regional Transit’s light rail operations represent a
                     significant noise source that the City will seek to minimize and will be considered in
                     land planning decisions.
                 •   California Noise Control Act and Guidelines. The legislature enacted the Noise
                     Control Act to address unwanted and hazardous noise as a public health and welfare
                     issue through noise control, prevention, and abatement. The State Office of Noise
                     Control in the Department of Health Services established criteria and guidelines for
                     use in setting standards for human exposure to noise. This Element is consistent
                     with those provisions.
                 •   California Department of Transportation (Cal Trans) Standards. Cal Trans
                     standards establish construction specifications associated with Cal Trans facilities
                     and rights-of-way related to transportation noise.
                 •   Rancho Cordova Design Guidelines. The Design Guidelines identify Citywide
                     standards to promote high-quality, pedestrian-oriented development. The guidelines
                     also address compatibility of uses and design of noise attenuation features.

                      XIII NOISE ELEMENT
RELATIONSHIP                 TO   OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Noise Element relates to several other elements in the General Plan, including the Land
Use Element, Urban Design Element, Circulation Element, and Safety Element. The Land
Use and Urban Design Elements establish land use patterns and development/design
policies to ensure land use compatibilities including potential noise issues. The Circulation
Element identifies the City’s roadway network that is used in projecting transportation noise
sources. Finally, the Safety Element includes information about airport safety and planning
documents, including noise impact. Where the overlap can be identified, cross references
are provided to alert the reader to specific sections of other elements.
ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
NOISE SETTING
Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. Sound levels are measured and expressed in
decibels (dB), with 0 dB corresponding roughly to the threshold of hearing. Forty decibels
would correspond with the sound of soft music, 80 decibels would correspond to freeway
traffic noise at 50 feet, and 110 decibels would correspond to a commercial jet takeoff at 200
feet away. Continued exposure to sound levels over 85 dB may cause hearing loss.
The City’s existing noise ordinance, which is based on the County noise ordinance,
establishes maximum allowable exterior and interior noise levels for affected land uses. The
ordinance generally limits exterior noise levels (measured at residential land and agricultural
land uses) to a maximum of 55 dBA during any cumulative 30-minute period during the
daytime hours (7:00 a.m.–10:00 p.m.), and 50 dBA during any cumulative 30-minute period
during the nighttime hours (10:00 p.m.–7:00 a.m.). The ordinance sets somewhat higher
noise limits for noise of shorter duration; however, noise shall not exceed 75 dBA during
the day and 70 dBA at night. Activities generally considered to be exempt from the noise
standards include construction activities (provided that they occur between the daytime
hours of 7:00 a.m.– 6:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and 9:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m. on
Sunday), school athletic and entertainment events, activities conducted on public parks and
playgrounds, and transportation noise.
There are generally two types of noise sources: transportation and stationary.
Transportation noise is produced primarily by traffic on public roadways, railroad line
operations, and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from transportation-related sources is
regulated at the federal and state levels. Stationary noise encompasses a wide range of fixed
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 3

                                    XIII NOISE ELEMENT
             sources of noise, including industrial operations, power-generating stations, outdoor
             recreation facilities, quarries, construction sites, and restaurant drive-through speaker boxes.
             The major noise sources in the Planning Area consist of transportation noise associated with
             traffic on highways and major roadways, light rail, and airport noise and stationary noise
             including commercial and industrial uses, active recreation of parks, outdoor play areas of
             schools. Each of these noise sources is discussed individually below. Refer to Draft
             Environmental Impact Report Section 4.7 (Existing and Future Noise Conditions) for both
             transportation and non-transportation noise sources existing and projected at build out of the
             General Plan. Mitigation Measures have been incorporated into the General Plan.
                                  Roadway Traffic
                                  Major roadways within the City of Rancho Cordova include State Routes
                                  50 and 16, Sunrise Boulevard, Folsom Boulevard, White Rock Road,
                                  Zinfandel Drive, Bradshaw Road, and others. The Federal Highway
                                  Administration Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-RD-77-
                                  108) was used to predict existing and cumulative traffic noise levels for
                                  major roadways in the Planning Area. The General Plan EIR includes
             tables showing the roadways, traffic volume, and distance from the centerline of each
             roadway to three specified noise levels (70, 65, and 60 dB).
             Railroads
             The City is served by Regional Transit Light Rail along the Folsom Boulevard/ Highway 50
             corridor. Based on survey information and Sacramento Regional Transit (RT) data,
             approximately 137 train pass-bys occur per day along the double tracks west of Hazel Avenue
             and approximately 59 train pass-bys occur per day along the single tracks east of Hazel
             Avenue. The Sound Exposure Level (SEL) of individual trains at a distance of 100 feet is
             approximately 90 dB with usage of the warning horn, and approximately 86 dB without the
             usage of the horn. Trains are generally required to sound warning horns as they approach at-
             grade crossings located within the City of Rancho Cordova. The General Plan EIR includes
             a table of average noise levels at a distance of 100 feet from the tracks and 500 feet from the
             at-grade crossings.
             Airport
             Mather Airport (formerly Mather Air Force Base) has been open as a public-use air cargo and
             general aviation airport since May 5, 1995. Managed by the County Department of Airports,
             the airport, which operates 24 hours per day, consists of two primary runways, one 11,300
             feet long and the other 6,100 feet long, generally aligned in a northeast-to-southwest
4 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN
                     XIII NOISE ELEMENT
direction. Mather Airport is a joint-use facility, supporting both military and commercial
operations, and is rapidly developing as an air cargo depot.
Portions of the Planning Area are located within the currently adopted 60- and 65-dBA
CNEL noise contours of the Mather Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP). At the
time of General Plan preparation, the CLUP is being revised to account for existing and
projected changes in aircraft operations that have occurred since development of the CLUP
for Mather Airport. As would be expected, single-event noise levels (SEL) for aircraft
overflights within the plan area would be greatest and most frequent near the airport’s
primary flight paths.
General Service Commercial and Light Industrial Uses
Noise sources associated with service commercial uses such as automotive repair facilities,
wrecking yards, tire installation centers, car washes, loading docks, etc., are found at various
locations within the City of Rancho Cordova. The noise emissions of these types of uses
are dependent on many factors, and are therefore, difficult to quantify precisely.
Nonetheless, noise generated by these uses contribute to the ambient noise environment in
the immediate vicinity of these uses, and should be considered where either new noise-
sensitive uses are proposed nearby or where similar uses are proposed in existing residential
areas.
Parks and School Playing Fields
There are several park and school uses throughout the
Planning Area. Noise generated by these uses depends on
the age and number of people utilizing the respective facility
at a given time, and the types of activities they are engaged in.
School playing field activities tend to generate more noise
than those of neighborhood parks, as the intensity of school
playground usage tends to be higher. At a distance of 100
feet from an elementary school playground being used by 100
students, average and maximum noise levels of 60 and 75 dB,
respectively, can be expected. At organized events such as high school football games with
large crowds and public address systems, the noise generation is often significantly higher.
As with service commercial uses, the noise generation of parks and school playing fields is
variable.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 5

                                   XIII NOISE ELEMENT
             Aerojet General
             Aerojet, a GenCorp Inc. company, is a major space and defense contractor specializing in
             missile and space propulsion, and defense and armaments. It is located south of Highway 50
             between Hazel Avenue and Prairie City Road. Although much of the manufacturing/
             production which takes place at Aerojet occurs within insulated buildings, there are several
             noise producing activities/types of equipment which occur or are used in outdoor areas of
             the facility (e.g., compressors, cooling towers, fluid pumps, alarms, rocket testing, PA system,
             and construction/demolition and operation of a wastewater treatment facility). Because of
             the wide range of noise generation associated with these sources and activities, proposals for
             development of noise-sensitive land uses in the general vicinity of this use should be carefully
             evaluated for noise impact.
             Cordova Shooting Center
             The Cordova Shooting Center is located on Douglas Road west of Sunrise Boulevard. The
             facility is used for small arms, rifle and shotgun firing and is open seven days a week with
             hours beginning as early as 9:00 am and ending as late as 7:00 pm. Firearms used at this
             facility and similar shooting ranges generate maximum noise levels ranging from
             approximately 95 dB to 115 dB at a distance of 50 feet. Due to the impulsive nature of the
             noise generated at this facility, and the fact that impulsive noises have been found to be more
             annoying than steady state noises, proposals for development of noise-sensitive land uses in
             the general vicinity of this use should be carefully evaluated for noise impact.
             Aggregate Facilities
             There are various aggregate mining and processing facilities within the Planning Area.
             Operations at aggregate facilities typically consist of the excavation of aggregate material
             using front-loaders and or self elevating scrapers, the transfer of that material via truck or
             conveyor to the processing plant, where it is crushed and screened into various sized
             products, and the load out of the material via heavy trucks. The noise generation of such
             facilities varies by size, type of equipment, and hours of operation, but processing plant
             equipment normally ranges from 80 to 90 dB Leq at a distance of 100 feet from the
             processing plant equipment. Because of the early startup hours normally associated with
             these types of uses, and the high noise generation of the mining and processing equipment,
             proposals for development of noise-sensitive land uses in the general vicinity of this use
             should be carefully evaluated for noise impact.

                      XIII NOISE ELEMENT
Sacramento Rendering Company
The Sacramento Rendering Company is located along Kiefer Boulevard, west of Douglas
Boulevard. Activities at this facility consist of the recycling of byproducts from the meat
and poultry industries. The facility normally operates six days a week, 24-hours per day.
Most of the noise-generating processes are located within the facility, and the principal noise
source is heavy truck traffic associated with approximately 90 deliveries per day. When the
noise levels were measured in 2001/2002 as part of the Sunrise Douglas Community
Plan/Sunridge Specific Plan EIR, the plant entrance on Kiefer Road had a noise
measurement of 50 dBA.
Kiefer Landfill
Sacramento County operates the Kiefer Landfill at 12701 Kiefer Blvd. Noise sources
associated with this facility consist primarily of trucks arriving and departing the site, and
heavy earthmoving equipment used in day-to-day landfill operations. Typical hours of
operation at this facility are from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm. The landfill is surrounded by
undeveloped rolling terrain. Significant noise sources at this location include bulldozers,
backup warning devices, garbage trucks, and private and commercial traffic using the
landfill. Noise measurements conducted at the landfill in 1989 yielded an average noise level
of 71 dBA at a distance of 100 feet from the main dump activity area. Due to historic
conflicts which arise from the development of noise-sensitive land uses in the vicinities of
landfills, proposals for development of noise-sensitive land uses in the general vicinity of
this use should be carefully evaluated for noise impact.
Noise Associated with Construction Activities
During construction and demolition associated with projects
within the Plan Area, noise from construction activities would
add to the noise environment in the immediate project vicinity.
Activities involved in construction would generate maximum
noise levels typically ranging from 85 to 90 dB at a distance of
50 feet. Impulsive construction activities such as pile driving
would generate even higher noise levels.                 Although
construction activities can very in duration, they are nonetheless
temporary in nature and typically occur during normal daytime working hours.
Sacramento Raceway
The Sacramento Raceway is located on Excelsior Road north of Jackson Highway. The
Raceway facilities include a quarter mile drag strip, and a midget car and motocross dirt oval
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 7
                                 XIII NOISE ELEMENT
             track. Racing typically takes place on Wednesday and Friday nights with occasional large
             events on weekends. According to the Sacramento County General Plan Noise Element, a
             focused EIR was prepared for the Sacramento Raceway in 1981. The conclusions of that EIR
             state that the cumulative noise impacts of the raceway operations are significant. Bollard &
             Brennan Associates conducted noise measurements at the Sacramento raceway during the
             Governor's Cup races on September 22-23, 1989. Maximum noise levels of 130 dBA were
             measured at a distance of 100 feet from the dragstrip during Top Fuel Funny Car races.
             Maximum noise levels measured during Pro- Gas, Door-Slammer and Alcohol Dragster races
             registered between 100 and 120 dBA at the same location.
             ISSUES        THIS      ELEMENT ATTEMPTS                      TO   SOLVE
             The Noise Element establishes a framework for how the City will address noise concerns in
             the Planning Area, with a specific emphasis on issues raised by the public, including those
             listed below:
                  •   Reducing noise from vehicle traffic, especially in residential areas.
                  •   Mitigating aircraft noise from Mather Field.
                  •   Controlling noise from industrial uses and aggregate operations.
                  •   Maintaining livability within dense neighborhoods.
             GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
             The goals of this element are as follows and are listed subsequently with corresponding
             policies and actions.
                  •   Goal N.1: Ensure that all new development will be free of noise disturbances.
                  •   Goal N.2: Mitigate Existing Noise Disturbances.
             GOAL N.1 - ENSURE            THAT ALL NEW DEVELOPMENT WILL BE FREE OF NOISE

GOAL N.2 - REDUCE            NOISE DISTURBANCES IN EXISTING DEVELOPMENT
AND ENSURE THAT ALL MITIGATION METHODS POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO
THE CITY’S LIVABILITY.
Policy N.2.1 - Strategically locate grade separations on existing or future light rail
lines so that they will not result in adverse noise impacts to adjacent residential areas.
     •    Action N.2.1.1 - Encourage placement of light rail lines below the grade of
          the roadway in order to reduce noise impacts.
Policy N.2.2 - Ensure that operational noise levels of new roadway projects will not result
in significant noise impacts.
     •    Action N.2.2.1 - Assess the significance of the noise increase of all roadway
          improvement projects in existing areas according the following criteria:
          − Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 60 dB Ldn at the
               outdoor activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +5 dB Ldn increase
               in noise levels due to roadway improvement projects will be
               considered significant; and
          − Where existing traffic noise levels range between 60 and 65 dB Ldn
               at the outdoor activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +3 dB Ldn
               increase in noise levels due to roadway improvement projects will
               be considered significant; and
          − Where existing traffic noise levels are greater than 65 dB Ldn at the
               outdoor activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +1.5 dB Ldn
               increase in noise levels due to roadway improvement projects will be
               considered significant.
Policy N.2.3 - Emphasize mitigation methods other than soundwall installation to reduce
noise to acceptable levels in residential areas originally constructed without soundwalls.
     •    Action N.2.3.1 - Adopt a Citywide noise reduction program to reduce traffic noise
          and other noise levels.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 11

              Types of Uses
              The types of uses which may typically produce the noise sources addressed below include,
              but are not limited to, industrial facilities including pump stations, trucking operations, tire
              shops, auto maintenance shops, metal fabricating shops, shopping centers, drive-up
              windows, car washes, loading docks, public works projects, batch plants, bottling and
              canning plants, recycling centers, electric generating stations, race tracks, landfills, sand and
              gravel operations, and athletic fields.
              Stationary Noise Performance Standards
              These noise level performance standards apply to new projects that are affected by or include
              non-transportation noise sources, with the exception of residential units established in
              conjunction with industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
              Typical noise sources are considered to be infrequently interrupted sources of noise, such as
              HVAC systems, cooling towers, fans, and blowers. Some examples of noise sources that are
              tonal, impulsive, repetitive, or consist mostly of speech or music include pile drivers, drive-
              through speaker boxes, outdoor speaker systems, punch presses, steam valves, and
              transformer stations.

INTRODUCTION
This General Plan Implementation Program provides a guide to implement adopted General
Plan policies and actions for City’s elected officials, staff and the public. The purpose of the
Implementation Program is to ensure the overall direction provided in the General Plan to
build a City is translated from general terms to specific actions.
Each implementation measure is a program, procedure, or task that requires additional City
action. Actions generally apply Citywide or to a specific area or project. In adopting this
Implementation Program, the City Council recognizes the importance of long-range
planning considerations in day-to-day decision making and budgeting. Implementation of
the specific programs will be subject to funding constraints.
This chapter explains key components of implementing the General Plan and includes a
comprehensive implementation matrix of General Plan actions and corresponding
responsibilities, timelines, and funding sources to carry them out.
IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN
The Implementation Program will serve as the basis for the preparation of the Annual
Report to the City Council on the status of the City’s progress in implementing the General
Plan, as required by California Government Code Section 65400. Because some of the
individual actions described in the Implementation Program serve as mitigation for
significant environmental impacts resulting from planned development identified in the
General Plan, the annual report can also provide a means of monitoring the application of
the mitigation measures as required by State CEQA Guidelines Section 15097. This
Implementation Program may be updated annually with the budget process and whenever
the City’s General Plan is amended or updated to ensure continued consistency and
usefulness.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 1

                               XIV IMPLEMENTATION
             PRIMARY IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENTS
             One of the primary implementation tools for the General Plan is the City’s Zoning Code,
             which establishes zoning district and corresponding allowed use and development provisions
             for all property within the City. By law, the Zoning Code text and map must be consistent
             with the General Plan. In particular, zoning will need to implement the new land use
             designations and locations as outlined in the Land Use Element and Land Use Map. A
             comprehensive update to the City’s Zoning Code will be required to ensure consistency and
             implementation of the General Plan.
             Other important implementation tools include, but are not limited to the City Street
             Standards, Improvement Standards, Open Space Performance Standards, Pedestrian Master
             Plan, Bikeway Master Plan, Redevelopment Plan, Economic Development Strategy, and
             Emergency Management Plan. Specific Plans will also be prepared to implement the General
             Plan for City identified special project areas (e.g., Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan,
             Downtown Specific Plan) and for master planning of private developments.
             FUNDING
             The City’s General Fund is the primary source of funding for General Plan and
             implementation. A General Plan fee is collected to cover the cost of General Plan adoption,
             implementation, and amendment over time. Several other fees and funding sources are used
             to implement the General Plan and to build the envisioned City. These funding sources are
             listed in the implementation matrix of this chapter.
             SUBSEQUENT PROJECT REVIEW
             With the exception of individual single-family homes, all new development in Rancho
             Cordova requires discretionary Design Review approval from the City. Additionally,
             modifications to non-residential structures that increase square footage by more than 5,000
             square feet also require discretionary Design Review approval from the City. Thus, the City
             will be evaluating development projects for consistency with the General Plan and other
             adopted plans and policies. These development projects will also be subject to evaluation
             under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

                  XIV IMPLEMENTATION
PLANNING TIMEFRAME
General Plans in California typically plan for a 20 or 25-year horizon. As described in the
Introduction Chapter, the Rancho Cordova General Plan looks to a planning horizon for
both a 25-year period (2030) and to full buildout of the City and Planning Area (estimated at
year 2050). The implementation matrix outlines timelines for each of the actions, many of
which are ongoing for the life of the General Plan.
ADOPTING AND AMENDING THE
GENERAL PLAN
Adoption of this General Plan is completed by resolution. The process for adopting this
Plan includes hearings and presentations with the Planning Commission and the City
Council, and final adoption is the responsibility of the City Council, as defined by California
Government Code Section 65350, et. seq.
It may be necessary, from time to time, to amend this General Plan. While most of these
changes may be in the form of land uses changes, others will involve changes to the text of
the plan. All amendments must also be adopted by resolution and require public hearings
by the Planning Commission and City Council and evaluation of the environmental impacts
as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Consistent with State law
(Government Code Section 65358), the City may only amend the General Plan four times
per year. Amendments may be proposed and acted upon at anytime during the year and one
action may include multiple amendments.
THE IMPLEMENTATION MATRIX
The implementation matrix below (Table IMP-1) lists all of the Actions in each of the
twelve General Plan Elements, along with the responsible parties, funding sources, and
methods to be used to implement the actions. The matrix is designed to be a general road
map to implementing the General Plan and may be updated as new tools become available
and new goals and policies are adopted by the City.
The following legend of terms and corresponding acronyms are used throughout the
implementation matrix when referring to responsible parties:

        deemed appropriate for the project. If projects propose densities
        higher than the identified density, the required acreage shall be

        For example, if a project is required to provide 15 acres at 30 units per                Ongoing, as

        For the purpose of satisfying the 5 percent for land uses at or above
        20 units per acre, sites must meet the following requirements:
        -   Sites must be zoned exclusively residential.
        -   Sites must be of sufficient size to accommodate a minimum of 16
            units per site.
        -   Sites must be proximate to public transportation routes which
            provide ready access to fixed rail.
        Annually review the amount of land zoned for various residential uses
        in conjunction with the amount and type of housing produced in the

        below represent a varied strategy to mitigate potential loss of “at-risk”
        units due to conversion to market-rate units. These local efforts utilize
        existing City and local resources. They include efforts to secure
        additional resources from the public and private sector should they
        become available.
        Monitor owners of at-risk projects on an ongoing basis, at least every
        six months, in coordination with other public and private entities to
        determine their interest in selling, prepaying, terminating, or
        continuing participation in a subsidy program.

                               identify if active nesting by birds protected under the Migratory Bird
                               Treaty Act (MBTA) is taking place. If all site disturbance is to occur

                               to determine the appropriate mitigation, if any, required to minimize
                               impacts to nesting birds. No activity may occur within 100 feet of any
                               nesting activity or as otherwise required following consultation with

                               mitigating for the loss of Swainson’s hawk foraging habitat based on
                               habitat value lost to development. The ordinance will set forth a
                               process where habitat lost to development will be mitigated through

                               -   Natural Access Control. A design concept directed primarily at
                                   decreasing crime opportunity by denying access to crime targets
                                   and creating a perception of risk for offenders. This design
                                   concept is achieved by designing streets, sidewalks, building
                                   entrances, and neighborhood gateways to clearly indicate public
                                   routes, and also by discouraging access to private areas with

                      one or more persons. The concept of household is important because the formation
                      of new households generates the demand for housing. Each new household formed
                      creates the need for one additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing
                      unit be shared by two households. Thus, household formation can continue to take
                      place even without an increase in population, thereby increasing the demand for
                      housing.

          ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Housing Needs Assessment analyzes population and housing characteristics, identifies
special housing needs among certain population groups, evaluates housing conditions, and
provides other important information to support the goals, policies, and programs that will
meet the needs of current and future Rancho Cordova residents.
The data used to prepare this analysis was collected from 2000 and 2010 US Census reports
including both the Decennial Census and the 2006–2010 American Community Survey
(ACS), California Department of Finance and Sacramento Area Council of Governments
(SACOG) publications, City documents, and various other sources. Since the 2000 Census
data was not aggregated for the City of Rancho Cordova’s boundaries, the 2000 figures taken
from Census data were based on a tabulation of the data that most closely matched the
City’s boundaries.
The 2010 Census marked a change in the way that the U.S. Census Bureau collected data.
The 2010 Census forms were much shorter and collected a fraction of the data previously
collected. To supplement the shorter form, the American Community Survey (ACS) was
utilized to create sample based data sets. While the ACS provides a much larger range of
data, it also comes with a margin of error. There are a few data sets referenced in this table
that do not perfectly match totals or percentages. Those inconsistencies are the results of
variable margins of error inherent in the ACS data source.
For the sake of consistency and completeness of data, City staff chose to work exclusively
with the 2010 Census and the 2006-2010 ACS. This was to reduce confusion about different
estimates and to improve overall document consistency. However, there are more current,
though less complete, data sets available. In many of the other reports that City staff provide
to Council and to the public, best efforts are made to provide the most current and up-to-
date information. This is particularly true when data is used to compare the City of Rancho
Cordova to other regional cities or to Sacramento County. As the 2006-2010 ACS and the
2010 Census has already aged at the time of this update, the comparisons between the City
of Rancho Cordova and the County of Sacramento have been removed from this document
to prevent confusion between this report and other reports on the same topics based on
more current data. For current comparisons, please see the annual Growing Strong
Neighborhoods reports or the Annual City Council Retreat Demographics reports.
The Housing Needs Assessment comprises four sections. The first section focuses on
demographic information, including population, ethnicity, age, income, employment, and
housing characteristics. The demographic background is followed by an outline of the
general characteristics of the community and an identification of those characteristics that
may have significant impacts on housing needs in the community.
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 5

                     APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
                     ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
              The second section describes the City’s resources, historic development patterns, and
              housing opportunities. It also discusses the City’s existing housing stock and potential areas
              for future housing development.
              The third section centers on the governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing
              development in Rancho Cordova. The City established planning, zoning, and building
              standards that guide residential development patterns and influence housing availability and
              affordability. There are also numerous non-governmental constraints, such as environmental
              and housing market conditions, that affect the location, availability, affordability, and type of
              housing that is constructed in Rancho Cordova. Non-governmental constraints include such
              factors as the availability and cost of preparing and developing land for housing, as well as
              the business decisions of individuals and organizations in the home building, finance, real
              estate, and rental housing industries.
              The final section of the Housing Needs Assessment covers energy conservation
              opportunities that may reduce costs to homeowners and infrastructure costs to the City. A
              reduction in basic living costs through energy savings will allow more households to afford
              adequate housing.
              HOUSING NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES
              POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
              Rancho Cordova became an incorporated city on July 1, 2003. It is the seventh community
              in Sacramento County to incorporate and is also California’s 478th city. A part of the greater
              Sacramento region, Rancho Cordova lies on the Highway 50 corridor between Sacramento
              and Folsom, and is situated between Mather Field and the American River.
              Population by Age
              The City of Rancho Cordova continued to grow in population despite the recession that
              followed the 2006–2007 housing market collapse. Table A-1 identifies the population
              distribution in the City of Rancho Cordova by gender and age. The age groups that
              experienced the largest population increase are people aged 45–54, followed by 25–34 and
              55–59. The median age in the City increased from 31 to 33. The 2000 population count was
              derived from a census block by block population count that best aligned with the City’s
              boundaries. This is because the City incorporated in 2003 and was a Census Designated
              Place (CDP) in the 2000 Census. The CDP and City boundaries did not quite align, so extra
              efforts were made during the 2006 Housing Element creation to ensure that the 2000
              Census counts recorded in this document are accurate.

INCOME CHARACTERISTICS
Household Income
Household income is one of the most significant factors affecting housing choice and
opportunity. Income largely determines a household’s ability to purchase or rent housing
while balancing housing costs with the costs of other necessities. Income levels vary
considerably among households, affecting preferences for tenure, location, and housing type.
While higher-income households have more discretionary income to spend on housing,
lower- and moderate-income households are limited in the range of housing they can afford.
Typically, as the income of a household decreases, the incidence of housing cost burdening
and overcrowding increases.
For the purpose of evaluating housing affordability, housing need, and eligibility for housing
assistance, income levels are defined by guidelines adopted each year by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). For Sacramento County, the
applicable median income for a family of four in 2013 is $76,100. HCD has defined the
following income categories for Sacramento County, based on the median income for a
household of four persons:
     •   Extremely low income: 0 to 30 percent of median income ($0 to $22,850)
     •   Very low income: 31 to 50 percent of median income ($22,851 to $38,050)
     •   Low income: 51 to 80 percent of median income ($38,051 to $60,900)
     •   Moderate income: 81 to 120 percent of median income ($60,901 to $91,300)
     •   Above moderate income: Above 120 percent of median income ($91,301 or more)
HCD does not estimate median income for cities, but information provided by SACOG
based on the 2006–2010 ACS indicates that the median four-person household income for
Rancho Cordova is approximately $61,860. Table A-4 illustrates the income distribution in
2010 by tenure. As shown in Table A-4, approximately 3,139, or 14%, of the total
households are considered extremely low income.

               Poverty
               The poverty threshold is set nationally and is based on a federally defined level of income for
               minimum subsistence. The dollar threshold for poverty is adjusted for household size and
               composition. Poverty rates and income are greatly affected by economic conditions and job
               availability. Table A-5 shows the poverty distribution for the City of Rancho Cordova as
               tabulated in the 2006–2010 American Community Survey.

               The City has a very strong employment base with an estimated jobs/housing balance of
               approximately 2:1 meaning there are two job opportunities in Rancho Cordova for every
               household.1 While these estimates support the impression of Rancho Cordova as a strong
               jobs center, it is important to remember that these are estimates, and that the number
               fluctuates with the economy.
               Table A-7 shows employment by industry for civilians in the City of Rancho Cordova,

               SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
               Household groups with special needs include seniors, mentally and physically disabled
               persons, large families, female-headed households, agricultural workers, and homeless
               persons. Households with special housing needs often have greater difficulty finding decent
               and affordable housing. As a result, these households may more frequently experience cost
               burdening, overcrowding, and various other significant housing problems.
               SENIOR HOUSEHOLDS
               Senior households have special housing needs, primarily as a result of physical disabilities or
               limitations, reduced incomes, and increased health care costs. Senior households may also
               need in-home support services, assistance with personal care and financial affairs, and
               networks of care to provide a wide variety of services and daily assistance. According to the
               2010 Census, 6,634 persons in Rancho Cordova are 65 years and older, as shown in Table
               A-8, and these seniors account for 10 percent of the City’s total population.

SENIOR HOUSING
Rancho Cordova has one major skilled nursing facility and 10–12 smaller licensed residential
care homes, which provide care and assistance to elderly residents who are partially self-
sufficient. Assisted living is provided mainly in smaller facilities, although Eskaton Lodge in
nearby Gold River offers a total of 94 apartments or rooms to seniors with moderate
impairments and Alzheimer’s disease.
The assisted living costs listed below (Table A-10) are the monthly prices for a private room,
where available. Shared rooms are generally around $500 less expensive per month. The
actual cost of care at many homes varies widely and is based on the amount of care that an
individual resident requires.

               Seniors needing less care than that offered by an assisted living facility may choose to live in
               a senior-oriented rental complex. As of July 2013, Coloma Woods was the only age-
               restricted affordable complex for seniors age 62 and older in Rancho Cordova. Coloma
               Woods has 28 one-bedroom units. The project is federally financed and therefore the rents
               are 30 percent of each tenant’s income, the common standard of affordability.

DISABLED PERSONS
Disabilities, as defined by the California Government Code, include, but are not limited to,
physical and mental disabilities. A mental disability involves any mental or psychological
disorder or condition, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or
mental illness, or specific learning disabilities that limit a major life activity. Some mental
disabilities are commonly referred to as developmental disabilities. A physical disability
covers any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical
loss that affects body systems. Possible physical disabilities include those that are
neurological, immunological, or musculoskeletal in nature, as well as those which involve the
respiratory, cardiovascular, reproductive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, or digestive
systems, and those involving the special sense organs, speech organs, skin, or endocrine
system. A mental or physical disability limits a major life activity, such as a physical, mental,
or social activity, including working, by making the achievement of such activities difficult.
Some physical, mental, or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working,
restrict a person’s mobility, or make caring for oneself difficult. Therefore, disabled persons
often have special housing needs related to their potentially limited earning capacity, their
need for accessible and affordable housing, and the higher health costs associated with their
disabilities. Additionally, people with disabilities require a wide range of housing choices,
based on the type and severity of their disability. Housing needs can range from institutional
care facilities to facilities that support partial or full independence (e.g., group care homes).
Supportive services such as living skills training and employment assistance may need to be
integrated into the housing situation. Housing may need to be physically accessible as well,
to accommodate people with physical disabilities. Examples of accessible features in housing
include widened doorways and hallways, ramps, bathroom modifications (e.g., lowered
countertops, grab bars, adjustable showerheads), and special sensory devices including
smoke alarms and flashing lights.
The 2010 Census defines a disability as a mental, physical, or health condition that lasts over
six months. Table A-11 shows the total number of disabilities by disability type and
employment group. Many of these persons have more than one disability, which is why there
are a higher number of disabilities than there are disabled persons.
The City of Rancho Cordova incorporates the Federal Fair Housing Act, the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act of 1964, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as
supported in Title 24 of the California Government Code, as part of its building
requirements. These three statutes address the fair housing and building standards for
persons with disabilities adhered to by the City.

               An analysis of the City’s codes and development procedures was completed to identify any
               constraints to the development of housing for persons with disabilities. No specific
               governmental constraints to the development of disabled housing were identified. This
               Housing Element includes programs to monitor the City’s development procedures and
               remove constraints if any become apparent.
               In order to accommodate persons with disabilities, residential care facilities for six or fewer
               adults or eight or fewer children are allowed in the City’s residential zones by right.
               Residential care facilities with more than six adults or eight children are permitted in all land
               use zones in the City by obtaining a conditional use permit. Additionally, mobile homes used
               as an accessory dwelling for persons in need of care and supervision are allowed in all zoning
               designations with a conditional use permit. Other than the requirement of obtaining a
               conditional use permit, no special design or permitting standards have been established for
               residential care facilities. The conditional use permits do not have any special provisions
               required for the development of a residential care facility.
               Developmental Disabilities
               Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires the City to include in the special housing needs analysis the
               needs of individuals with a developmental disability within the community. According to
               Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, “developmental disability” means a
               disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues or can be
               expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual
               which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.

        APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
        ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living
environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may
require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are
provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services currently provides community-based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. The Alta Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers in
California that provide point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities.
The center is a private, nonprofit community agency that contracts with local businesses to
offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their
families.
The Alta Regional Center designs programs according to age, specialization, and geographic
location. The following information (Table A-12) from the Alta Regional Center provides a

There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a development
disability: rent-subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary
housing, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB
962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and
transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of
considerations that are important in serving this need group. Incorporating “barrier-free”
design in all new multi-family housing (as required by California and federal fair housing
laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents.
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 19

                      ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
               Special consideration should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with
               disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
               In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the City
               will implement programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with the Alta
               Regional Center and encourage housing providers to designate a portion of new affordable
               housing developments for persons with disabilities, especially persons with developmental
               disabilities, and pursue funding sources designated for persons with special needs and
               disabilities. Policy H.3.3 and Action H.3.3.1 implements state and federal requirements to
               not exclude persons with physical and developmental disabilities from participating in
               housing programs.
               FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
               Single-parent households are male- or female-headed households with children under the age
               of 18 living at home. Single-parent households generally have lower disposable incomes than
               two-parent households, meaning that their necessary expenses are a larger portion of their
               total incomes. Therefore, finding affordable, decent, and safe housing is often more difficult
               for single-parent households and especially female-headed households, who show a generally
               higher rate of poverty than single-parent male-headed households according to the 2006-
               2010 ACS. Single-parent and female-headed households may also have special needs
               involving the availability of daycare or childcare, health care, and other supportive services.
               According to data from the 2010 Census, 3,815 households, or 17 percent of all households
               in Rancho Cordova, are female-headed households. Female-headed households comprise the
               overwhelming majority of all single-parent households. Of households headed by a female,
               64 percent (2,448 households) have related children under 18 present. Of the 2,448 female-
               headed households with related children under 18, 34 percent are classified as below the
               poverty level.
               LARGE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS
               Large family households are defined as households containing five or more persons. They
               are considered a special needs group because there is a limited supply of adequately sized
               housing to accommodate their needs. Generally, as the number of household members
               increases, the number of bedrooms needed to accommodate the household also increases.
               For example, a five-person household would require three or four bedrooms, and a six-
               person household would usually require four bedrooms. According to the 2010 Census, 12
               percent of all households in Rancho Cordova (11 percent of owner households and 13
               percent of renter households) include five or more persons (totaling 2,711 households). Of
               the large households, 52 percent (1,416 households) are owners and 48 percent (1,290
               households) are renters. According to the 2010 Census, 62 percent of the housing units in
20 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

       APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
       ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
the area have three or more bedrooms. Approximately 87 percent of the owner-occupied
housing units and 31 percent of the renter-occupied housing units have three or more
bedrooms, according to the 2010 Census. This means there are approximately 11,310 owner-
occupied housing units and 3,008 rental-housing units with three or more bedrooms.
As the majority of three-bedroom or larger units in the City are owner-occupied, rental
housing for large family households may be far more difficult to find. There are currently at
least 13 apartment complexes with three-bedroom units and 2 apartment complexes with
four-bedroom units suitable for larger families. In apartment complexes, there are a
minimum of 312 rental units with three or more bedrooms.
AGRICULTURAL WORKERS
Agricultural workers earn their primary income through permanent or seasonal agricultural
labor. According to the 2006–2010 ACS, less than 1 percent of all employed persons in
Rancho Cordova work in the farming, forestry, and fishing occupation. The types of
agricultural production in the City do not require large numbers of migrant and seasonal
farm laborers, and a large influx of farm labor does not occur. It is assumed that the housing
need for the limited number of farmworkers in the City is met through existing housing.
Employee housing serving six or fewer employees is considered a single-family residence and
is allowed in all residential zones. Any application for farmworker housing is treated in the
same way as other affordable housing projects, and the resources the City has to offer for
affordable housing are available for the development of the project. Incentives such as
expedited permitting process, streamlining, and modification of development standards are
available for the production of farmworker housing.
HOMELESS PERSONS
Homeless individuals and families have the most immediate housing need of any special
needs group. They also have one of the most difficult housing needs to meet, because of the
diversity and complexity of the factors that led to their homelessness and as a result of
community opposition to facilities serving homeless clients. However, California state law
requires that Housing Elements estimate the need for emergency shelter for homeless
people.
Due to the transitional nature of homelessness, it is difficult to get a concrete count of
homeless persons in the City of Rancho Cordova or of homeless persons in the Sacramento
area who identify Rancho Cordova as their place of origin. Every two years, Sacramento
County’s Continuum of Care does a point-in-time count of homeless persons. While this
number fluctuates over the year, the count provides some basis for evaluating the needs for
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 21

               The only food bank located in the City, Cordova Community Food Locker at 10479 Coloma
               Road, provides a walk-in food service program and maintains a one- to three-day supply of
               emergency food.
               With the exception of one large countywide-serving transitional housing project located
               within City boundaries (Mather Community Campus), the City of Rancho Cordova has few
               resources for homeless persons and has not yet identified any homeless shelters. An effort
               involving the City, County, and Mather Veterans Hospital is under way to develop
               permanent supportive housing and additional transitional living resources to disabled and
               homeless veterans. The majority of other shelters and services for homeless individuals and
               families are located in the city of Sacramento.
               The Mather Community Campus in Rancho Cordova is a transitional housing project that
               provides housing, job training, and employment to individuals and families on the former
               Mather Field Air Force Base. Residents are referred either from emergency shelters or from
               residential substance abuse treatment facilities. The Mather Community Campus has
               permission to house up to 200 singles and 55 families. Singles are housed in studio units with
               a bedroom and bathroom, and they share a dining hall area for meals. The family housing
               contains a kitchen and bathroom, and can be converted to have anywhere from one to four
               bedrooms, although the most common configuration is three-bedroom units. Currently, the
               Mather Community Campus is operating at full capacity.

EMERGENCY SHELTERS
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing
with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
months or less by a homeless person. No individual or households may be denied
emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.” Current zoning allows emergency shelters
in the Office/Industrial/Mixed Use (OIMU) and the Light Industrial Business Park (LIBP)
zones without a conditional use permit. The City does have development and managerial
standards that will be consistent with Government Code Section 65583(a)(4).
These standards include such items as:
     •   Lighting.
     •   On-site management.
     •   Maximum number of beds or persons to be served nightly by the facility.
     •   Off-street parking based on demonstrated need.
     •   Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
TRANSITIONAL               AND      SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
Transitional housing is defined in Section 50675.2 of the Health and Safety Code as rental
housing for stays of at least six months but where the units are recirculated to another
program recipient after a set period. It may be designated for a homeless individual or family
transitioning to permanent housing. This housing can take many structural forms such as
group housing and multi-family units and may include supportive services to allow
individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent living.
Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code as housing
with linked on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length of stay and occupied by a
target population as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 53260 (i.e., low-income
person with mental disabilities, AIDS, substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or
persons whose disabilities originated before the age of 18). Services linked to supportive
housing usually focus on retaining housing, living and working in the community, and/or
health improvement.
Pursuant to Senate Bill (SB) 2, the current Zoning Code allows transitional housing and
supportive housing as a residential use without the requirement of a conditional use permit
and subject to the same restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in
the same zone.
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 23

               EXTREMELY LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
               Assembly Bill 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the quantification and analysis of existing and
               projected housing needs of extremely low-income households. Elements must also identify
               zoning to encourage and facilitate supportive housing and single-room occupancy units
               (SROs).
               Extremely low-income households typically comprise persons with special housing needs,
               including but not limited to persons experiencing homelessness or near-homelessness,
               persons with substance abuse problems, and farmworkers. As previously mentioned in
               Table A-4, approximately 3,139, or 14%, or the City’s households are considered extremely
               low-income households (CHAS 2009). The City’s Zoning Code allows for SROs with a
               conditional use permit in the RD-20, RD-25, and RD-30 zones.
               HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
               HOUSEHOLD TENURE
               According to the 2010 Census, there is a higher percentage of owner-occupied households in
               Rancho Cordova (57 percent) than renter-occupied households (43 percent). According to
               the 2010 Census, single-family homes in Rancho Cordova comprised 55 percent of the
               housing stock (Table A-14). Multi-family housing units in complexes of five or more units
               accounted for 23 percent of the housing stock. Subsequent to the 2010 Census and as a
               result of the large number of mortgage foreclosures and speculative purchases, a significant
               number of single family home have been converted to rental units. Staff estimates that the
               total current number of rented single family detached homes is approximately 2,700 units;
               Table A-14 provides the 2010 Census count of housing units by structure and the 2012

               OVERCROW DED HOUSEHOLDS
               Overcrowding occurs where there is more than one person per room (excluding bathrooms)
               in an occupied housing unit. Overcrowding is often the result of an inadequate supply of
               affordable and decent housing. Households that are unable to afford larger housing units
24 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

      APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
       ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
may be forced to rent or purchase housing that is too small to meet their needs. According
to the 2006–2010 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data derived by
the US Census for HUD, 4 percent of households in Rancho Cordova were overcrowded
and another 2 percent of households were severely overcrowded. There were 1,195
households living in overcrowded situations in the City, which equates to approximately 5.3
percent of the households.
HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION TRENDS
According to the City of Rancho Cordova Building Department, a total of 1,077 single-
family homes were permitted between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2012. During that
same period, 18 apartment units were constructed, of which 17 units were affordable to
households with incomes below 50 percent of area median income (AMI).
HOUSING VACANCY
Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using the “vacancy rate,” an indicator of housing
supply and demand. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the supply, the
vacancy rate is likely low and the price of housing is increasing. According to “Raising the
Roof, California Housing Development Projections and Constraints, 1997–2020,” the
desirable vacancy rate in a community is considered to be 5 percent, which accounts for
normal turnover in owner-occupied and rental housing. Generally, when the vacancy rate is
less than 5 percent, the demand for housing exceeds the supply, and both buyers and renters
may see an increase in housing costs. The lack of competition associated with very low rental
vacancy rates may have a tendency to reduced incentives for reinvestment and maintenance
and may have the potential to result in a rise in the incidence of Fair Housing abuse.
The 2010 Census notes that the vacancy rate in Rancho Cordova was 1.92 percent for
homeownership and 4.58 percent for rental housing. These vacancy rates would generally be
considered low to very low.
AGE      OF    HOUSING STOCK
For many communities, the age and condition of housing stock provide an additional measure
of housing adequacy and availability. Although the age of housing does not always indicate
substandard conditions, neighborhoods with many homes over 30 years old are more likely
than recently built neighborhoods to have many homes in need of maintenance, utility and
amenity updates, rehabilitation, or replacement. Homes with deferred maintenance usually
exhibit signs of aging, such as peeling or faded paint, cracked siding, or missing or broken
shingles or shakes, suggesting a need for repair or replacement of those components in the
near future. Homes in need of rehabilitation require immediate repair or replacement of
components in disrepair to avoid health and safety problems. Homes in need of replacement
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 25

               require repair or replacement of so many components that it may be more cost-effective to
               demolish the home and construct a new dwelling. While Rancho Cordova has some newer
               neighborhoods and some newly developing areas, a great deal of the City’s existing housing
               stock is 35 or more years old. The 2006–2010 CHAS data suggests that as many as 5,205 or 23
               percent of the City’s housing stock need either extensive repair or replacement (Table A-15).

               CONDITION OF HOUSING STOCK
               Without performing a physical inspection, it may be assumed that overcrowded units, units
               lacking complete plumbing, and units constructed before 1940 exhibit substandard
               conditions. According to the 2010 Census, all of the occupied housing units in Rancho
               Cordova had adequate plumbing facilities and less than 1 percent were built before 1940.
               REDEVELOPMENT AREA
               The City of Rancho Cordova had one of the youngest redevelopment agencies and areas in
               California when the legislature eliminated redevelopment in June 2011. The blight
               assessment for the City’s redevelopment area was only 6 years old, and the collapse of the
               housing market contributed to the blighted conditions facing many of the City’s
               neighborhoods. The assessment showed that a great deal of housing in the City was in need
               of some level of repair. The 2005 assessment suggested that 20 percent of single-family
               homes, 41 percent of duplexes, 68 percent of apartments, and 24 percent of mobile homes
               needed some to extensive repairs. While the City has aggressively worked at rehabilitating the

multi-family complexes in need of extensive repairs, there are still a significant number of

HOUSING COSTS                   AND     OVERPAYMENT
FOR-SALE HOUSING COST                           AND     OVERPAYMENT
The residential real estate market had enjoyed an increase in prices resulting from low
mortgage rates, decreasing home sales inventory, and a steadily growing labor market
through 2005. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the housing market collapsed, resulting in a dramatic
drop in housing prices, a very high foreclosure rate, and a large number of abandoned and
foreclosed homes. During 2012 and the first half of 2013, the housing market began to
stabilize and even grow; however, prices are still well below the 2005 and 2006 highs. The
median home value in the City of Rancho Cordova was $215,900 in May 2013, according to
Zillow.com.
Overpayment compares the total cost of shelter with a household’s ability to pay for that
shelter. Shelter cost is defined as the monthly cost of owning or renting a home, including
the mortgage or rent, property taxes, insurance, and utilities. Specifically, HUD’s definition
of overpayment is a monthly shelter cost in excess of 30 percent of a household’s gross
income, and does not include utilities, transportation costs, or other living expenses outside
rent or mortgage payments.
Table A-16 shows the estimated monthly housing cost for Rancho Cordova homeowners
with and without a mortgage, based on 2006–2010 ACS data. Approximately 39 percent of
owner-occupied households are overpaying for housing according to 2006–2010 CHAS data,
and 22 percent of households who are overpaying are either low, very low, or extremely low
income.

      ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
MOBILE HOME PARKS
Mobile homes are often a source of affordable housing in communities where stick-built
homes are beyond the price range of low- and moderate-income households. In the
Sacramento area, there are currently many mobile homes for sale, and they vary considerably
in price, quality, and age. Very inexpensive mobile homes are generally those built before
1980, some of which may have structural problems. Newer mobile home models can be
quite large, with more than 2,500 square feet and four bedrooms. Amenity upgrades similar
to those found in new stick-built homes are offered by many mobile home dealers, and
interiors are now comparable in appearance to those of homes in new subdivisions.
Although mobile homes have often been stigmatized for their poor construction and lack of
appreciation, all new mobile homes now must meet or exceed construction standards set by
the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mobile home owners generally
rent a lot in a mobile home park and pay separately for their utilities. New mobile home
buyers usually choose a park in which to locate their home, while most purchasers of used
mobile homes leave their home in the park where it was originally located. Rancho Cordova
has nine mobile home parks with approximately 1,400 units (Table A-18). Lot rents have
been increasing almost annually in the City, which has put most of the lot rents, paired with
a mortgage and utility costs, out of reach for very low-income families, but lot rents may be
affordable to low- and moderate-income households.

               CORDOVA
               The high foreclosure rates that stemmed from subprime mortgages have resulted in
               tightened lending standards. Fewer households qualify for market-rate financing, though the
               for-sale market is beginning to rebound and low interest rates have helped stabilize the
               market-rate mortgage market. However, the number of households requiring affordable
               rental and owner housing opportunities will continue to grow. Therefore, the need to plan
               for affordable housing in Rancho Cordova will remain important through 2021.

       ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
A Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) is mandated by the State of California
(Government Code Section 65584), and it requires regions to address expected housing
issues and needs, which are based on future growth projections for the area. The RHNP is
developed by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) and allocates to
cities and counties their “fair share” of the region’s projected housing needs or growth. A
fair share of housing units is calculated for each of four income groups based projected
population growth, and on the jurisdiction’s amount of available vacant land. Fair share
needs are allocated over the eight year planning period for every jurisdiction’s Housing
Element. The RHNP, which covers a span of 8 years, also identifies and quantifies the
existing housing needs for each jurisdiction. SACOG’s current Regional Housing Needs
Plan schedule is from July 1, 2013, through January 1, 2021.
The intent of the RHNP is to ensure that local jurisdictions address not only the needs of
their immediate areas but also fill the projected housing needs for the entire region.
Additionally, a major goal of the RHNP is to ensure that every community provides an
opportunity for a mix of affordable housing to all economic segments of its population. The
RHNP jurisdictional allocations are made to guarantee that adequate sites and zoning are
provided to address existing and anticipated housing demands during the planning period
and that market forces are not inhibited in addressing the housing needs for all populations
within a particular community.
Table A-19 provides the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) target for the
planning period 2013 through 2021 (also referred to as “basic construction needs”) for each
of the four household income groups for the City of Rancho Cordova.

               Based on the above projections, the City of Rancho Cordova will need to provide an
               additional 2,618 affordable housing units, or 37.4 percent of all new housing units, to people
               in the very low- to low-income groups in order to comply with SACOG’s RHNP allocation
               targets for these income levels. Of the 1,539 very low-income need, 50 percent (770 units)
               are presumed to be needed for extremely low-income households (households with incomes
               below 30 percent AMI). In addition, the City will have to provide 4,390 housing units
               available to moderate and above moderate income-households. SACOG anticipates a total
               of 7,008 new housing units for the City of Rancho Cordova by 2021.
               There are 1,135 buildable lots currently approved and approximately 28,800 units that are
               currently being proposed in Specific Plan projects and Special Planning Areas.
               FUTURE DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL
               An important component of the Housing Element is the identification of sites for future
               housing development and evaluation of the adequacy of these sites. The identification of
               these sites will help in fulfilling the City’s share of regional housing needs as determined by
               SACOG. Tables A-20, A-21, and A-22 show a detailed analysis of the residential
               development potential for multi-family and single-family development. The sites listed in
               Tables A-20, A-21, and A-22 are opportunity sites. The City is working with developers and
               property owners to ensure that sufficient sites will be available through the end of the
               planning period (2021).
               The City of Rancho Cordova currently has 56 acres of vacant infill land, 21 acres of
               underutilized land, and approximately 655 acres of vacant greenfield land available for
               residential development. An additional 4,000-plus acres of greenfield land in the City has
               been identified for residential development but is not currently zoned residential located.

       APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
       ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This section provides the inventory of vacant land that is available in the City of Rancho
Cordova for both multi- and single-family residential development. Tables A-20, A-21, and
A-22 provide the development information for the vacant, underutilized, and greenfield
acreage in the City’s land inventory.
AVAILABLE MULTI-FAMILY SITES
The City of Rancho Cordova currently has approximately 53.12 acres of vacant and
underutilized infill sites that are currently zoned to accommodate multi-family development.
These sites are located adjacent to existing residential developments, indicating that
infrastructure is available, and the sites do not have other known constraints to
development. The total number of multi-family units that could be developed is based on a
holding capacity of 80 percent of the maximum number of units allowed by each zoning
designation or by a specific planning area. Sites with residential densities of at least 30 units
per acre are anticipated to accommodate housing units affordable to low-income
households.
Sites with multiple use designations, such as commercial/multi-family and office/multi-
family, are considered appropriate sites to accommodate future multi-family uses. Multi-
family development is allowed on sites with Limited Commercial (LC), Shopping
Commercial (SC), and Business Professional (BP) zoning based on the same standards and
approval process as multi-family development in the RD-20 and RD-40 zones. RD-20
standards apply to LC and SC sites, while RD-40 standards apply to BP sites. Therefore, the
City considers these sites both appropriate and adequate for multi-family development. Area
Maps A–N found in Appendix C identify the sites listed in the vacant land inventory.
REALISTIC CAPACITY
To demonstrate realistic capacity and that multi-family housing can be accommodated in
commercial zones which allow for residential development, the following projects have been
or are being processed through the Planning Department. Many projects have been
approved and are waiting for developers to move forward.
     •   Terra Loma. This 11-unit (20 units per acre) zero lot line single-family home project
         was rezoned from GC (General Commercial) to RD-20. The project is being
         developed on a .83-acre site and has been approved, but construction has not yet
         begun.
     •   AshGrove Apartments. This 203-unit (20 units per acre) housing project was
         completed in 2006 on a 10.98-acre site. It consists of one-, two-, and three-bedroom
         apartments that are affordable to moderate-income households.
                                                                                RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 33

                      ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
                    •   Trinity Gardens. This 20-unit infill (10 units per acre) apartment project (all three-
                        bedroom units) is being developed on a 2.1-acre SC (Shopping Commercial)
                        designated site. The entitlements on this project have been approved, but
                        construction has not yet begun.
                    •   Capital Village. This 827-unit project on approximately 34 acres ranging in densities
                        from 7 to 17 units per acre was rezoned from MP (Office Park Industrial) to Capital
                        Village Special Planning Area. The project is under construction and is in phase
                        three of development. Planning staff processed the application for this project,
                        which consisted of a rezone and development of a master planned community and
                        included complex environmental issues, in six months.
                    •   Sundance-Mather East Project. This 128-unit (10 units per acre) housing project
                        consisting of 104 detached, zero lot line single-family homes and 14 halfplexes is
                        located on an 11.9-acre LC (Limited Commercial) site.
               In addition to the vacant land available for multi-family development, the City’s adopted
               Folsom Boulevard Specific Plan (FBSP) establishes policy guidance and regulatory
               provisions for the development and redevelopment of the FBSP project area. The FBSP area
               spans a stretch of land along the Sacramento Regional Transit light rail line and includes four
               existing transit stops. The FBSP contains transit-oriented development (TOD) overlay zones
               with a maximum residential density of 80 dwelling units per acre
               Table A-20 details the vacant infill sites available for multi- and single-family residential
               development. Table A-21 details the underutilized infill sites potentially available for single-
               and multi-family residential development. Table A-22 details the greenfield development
               currently working through the planning process. Some of the plans identified in Table A-22
               are expected to break ground during the 2013–2021 Housing Element cycle. There are a
               number of finished lots ready for development spread throughout the area. Table A-22 also
               includes the housing estimates for greenfield development that is not expected to break
               ground during the 2013–2021 Housing Element cycle.

Capitol Village Special Planning Area
The Capitol Village Special Planning Area is almost fully developed. The final phase
includes single-family residential town-homes along the southern side of International Drive
and a commercial/loft development located on the western side of Bridgeway Drive. The
2013-2021 Housing Element cycle will likely see full build-out of the Capitol Village Special
Planning Area. The Capitol Village Special Planning Area does not include an affordable
housing requirement. However, the median price of the Capitol Village townhomes will be
affordable to moderate income households.
Villages of Zinfandel Special Planning Area
The Villages of Zinfandel Special Planning area is also mostly developed. There are finished
lots ready for building along the south-eastern segment of Baroque Drive. There are also
some commercial lots, as identified in the Vacant Greenfield Sites list of the above land
inventory. These lots would require a Conditional Use Permit to develop as multi-family
residential projects. Analysis has indicated that the CUP requirement does not pose a
constraint to multi-family development. The single-family residential component of the
Villages of Zinfandel Special Planning Area will most likely be fully developed during the
2013-2021 Housing Element Cycle. The commercial segment will develop as viable projects
are presented. The Villages of Zinfandel Special Planning Area did not include an affordable
housing requirement. However the commercial sites that may be developed residential with
a CUP pose unique opportunities for high density multi-family residential development and
have been previously considered for a condominium development.
Suncreek Specific Plan
The proposed Suncreek Specific Plan is near Sunrise Boulevard and Douglas Road.
Proximity to Sunrise Boulevard and Grant Line Road make the area ideal for public transit.
Current proposals include several residential neighborhoods, with some office and
commercial development. Mixed-use commercial, recreational parks, trails, and schools are
also planned. Presently, the project is in development agreement negotiations with the City.
The first phase of actual development is expected to be on the Shalako property, located at
the south west end of the plan area, and which has submitted a tentative map for
consideration as soon as the development agreement negotiations are complete.
The Suncreek Specific Plan includes an Affordable Housing Plan that will require the
dedication of three sites, with the purchase option of a fourth site to the City, as well as a
per-door residential in-lieu fee that the City will use to sponsor the development of
affordable housing in the planning area. It also includes a significant amount of acreage that
has been deemed RHNA obligated, with a development floor of 26 units per acre. The
tentative map for the Shalako property includes one of the dedicated sites, and sufficient
                                                                              RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 51

               development. It is realistic that the Shalako multi-family acreage, including the property
               dedicated to the City for affordable housing will develop during the 2013-2021 Housing
               Element cycle.
               Rio del Oro Specific Plan
               The Rio del Oro Specific Plan (“Plan”) was adopted by the City Council on September 7,
               2010. At the same time, the City Council approved a “Tier One Development Agreement”
               that vested the Specific Plan, land use designations, development densities, and intensity of
               uses (among other things). The Plan encompasses approximately 3,828 acres of land south
               of White Rock Road, east of Sunrise Boulevard, and north of Douglas Road. Currently, the
               area remains mostly undeveloped with dredger tailings, but development is anticipated to
               begin in phases during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle. As approved, the Rio del Oro
               project area would contain approximately 11,600 residential units at a variety of densities,
               with several village centers, a local town center, and two regional commercial sites. Future
               adjustments to the land use plan resulting from amendments to the City’s Open Space
               policies may result in small increases in total residential units. Approximately one-third of
               the land area would be retained as natural wetland preserve and improved open space. A
               network of major roadways, connector streets, and local streets integrate into the City’s
               planned roadway system and create walkable neighborhoods. The project area also includes
               both office and light industrial uses, primarily within the Mather Field Noise Contours.
               Prior to commencement of development, additional “Tier Two” entitlements will be
               completed, including but not limited to the approval of large lot maps, a financing plan, a
               phasing plan, and affordable housing plans. The City has begun the affordable housing plan
               negotiations with the Rio del Oro project as part of their next entitlement phase. The City
               expects the affordable housing plan to include a residential per-door in-lieu fee with some
               potential for dedicated land, should it be appropriately located. The affordable housing plan
               will also indicate a minimum development density for 98 acres of High Density (HD) zoned
               land. Consistent with the assumptions of this Housing Element, a minimum development
               density of 26 units per acre will be required for up to 98 acres of land zoned HD with Rio
               del Oro.
               Table A-22 also identifies development density and production assumptions for Medium
               Density (MD) zoned land within Rio del Oro. The MD assumptions are based on generic
               formulas that were used to indicate that some portion of the Rio del Oro project is expected
               to develop during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle. These assumptions do not
               indicate minimum development density floors, nor are they to be referenced as restrictions
               on the development densities available in the MD range as approved in the Rio del Oro
               Specific Plan.

The Ranch at Sunridge Special Planning Area
The Ranch at Sunridge is in the Suncreek Planning Area, but will be developed separately
from the rest of the planning area. Formerly used for agriculture, The Ranch is close to
several major roads. The Ranch at Sunridge is proposed to be primarily residential, but will
incorporate open space and commercial uses, as well as preserve some wetlands on the site.
The initial phase of development in the Ranch will most likely include the north west corner
and move east to tie into infrastructure that either exists currently, or will be under
construction on a concurrent time scale. The most logical second phase of development will
include the southern portion of the site.
Arboretum Specific Plan
The proposed Arboretum Specific Plan is located at the southernmost border of the City’s
undeveloped incorporated land. It is not expected to break ground during this housing
element cycle. When development does begin in the Arboretum, it will most likely be
phased from the south-western corner and move east and north as infrastructure is
completed. The proposed Arboretum Specific Plan will most likely include a negotiated
affordable housing plan that will provide for the development of multi-family and affordable
housing in the specific planning area.
Sunridge Specific Plan
The Sunridge Specific Plan was approved prior to the City’s incorporation and did not
include an affordable housing plan or any requirements for multi-family or affordable
housing performance. There are some sub-developments in the Sunridge Specific Plan that
include RHNA obligated properties or have a multi-family obligation that was negotiated
after the City’s incorporation.
Sunridge Park
The approved Sunridge Park development is mostly complete with less than 100 unbuilt
finished lots still available. The Sunridge Park project did not include a multi-family or
affordable housing component at approval and will be almost exclusively single family
homes on low-density parcels.
Anatolia II
Anatolia II has several multi-family parcels remaining to be built. Only one of these parcels
has a Low-Income RHNA obligation placed on it. The proposed affordable housing project
for that parcel would yield 66 low- and very low-income units. The City is in negotiations
with the land-owner to evaluate the viability of an affordable housing project on that site.
                                                                             RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 53

               Anatolia III has 286 low density single family parcels remaining for build-out. The project
               area is expected to reach build-out during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle. The
               project will have no affordable or multi-family housing components.
               Anatolia IV
               This project is approved by the City, creating 203 single-family lots, a 2.6-acre park, and four
               landscape corridor lots. The lots are finished and ready for construction. It is expected that
               the Anatolia IV project will reach build-out during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle.
               Montelena (located within the Sunridge Specific Plan)
               The approved Montelena project is in the Sunridge Specific Plan Area. The project site is
               generally bounded by Jaeger Road to the east, the Anatolia I subdivision to the west,
               Douglas Road to the north, and the Anatolia II subdivision to the south. The Montelena
               project comprises 251.9 acres and proposes the construction of 721 dwelling units.
               Although the area will be primarily residential, plans also include a community park area,
               detention basin, fire station, and wetland preserve. The approved project does not include
               an affordable housing plan, and has not designated multi-family development planned. It is
               expected to start construction during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle, and may reach
               build-out within the next eight years.
               Arista del Sol
               The Arista del Sol project is located on an approximately 158 acres. The project site is
               remote from existing infrastructure and is not expected to be developed during the 2013-
               2021 Housing Element cycle. The project does not include an affordable housing plan or a
               multi-family housing obligation.
               SunRidge Lot J
               The Lot J project is located on an approximately 81.1-acre parcel and would include a
               Tentative Subdivision Map to create 342 residential lots, one park site, and three landscape
               corridor lots. It is expected to be partially developed during the 2013-2021 Housing
               Element cycle. The project does not include an affordable housing plan or a multi-family
               housing obligation.

is expected to reach build-out during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle. The project
does not include an affordable housing plan or a multi-family development obligation.
During the 2006–2013 Housing Element cycle, development in the City’s greenfield areas
ground to a halt. With the exception of projects that had already begun construction prior to
the collapse of the housing market in 2008, no new entitlements or large-scale housing
developments were approved. During the first half of 2013, the resurgence of the housing
market has brought several of the dormant greenfield developments back online. Some of
these developments were further in the planning process than others, and some have the

               family homes. There is potential for 5,567single-family dwelling units on 547.83 vacant and
               underutilized acres in the City. These units are split between the moderate and the above
               moderate affordability levels, with 2,393 units expected to be affordable to households at a
               moderate income and 3,174 units available for households with above moderate income.
               Some development projects have reacted to the changes in the housing market that resulted
               from the market collapse in 2007 by introducing smaller units on smaller lots that will
               generally be more affordable. These housing products are generally zoned at 10 to 20
               dwelling units per acre. For the purpose of moderate and above moderate housing, land
               zoned or planned for RD-10 to RD-20 is identified as affordable to households with a
               moderate income, while land zoned or planned for densities lower than RD-10 are identified
               as affordable to households with an above moderate income.
               LAND INVENTORY ANALYSIS
               Table A-23 compares the RHNA requirements to the City’s capacity for new housing. The
               table is broken into affordability ranges and developing areas comparable to the land
               inventory tables above.

                   ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
               RHNA requires that the City show capacity for a range of housing choice and housing
               affordability. According to the City’s projections, there will be surplus capacity of 280
               housing units affordable to very low- and low-income households. Much of that capacity is
               in the infill areas where infrastructure and access to transportation and services already
               exists. The City also expects to have surplus capacity of 1,169 units affordable to moderate-
               income households and 9 surplus units to above moderate-income households. The housing
               product for moderate- and above moderate-income households does not necessarily have a
               clear delineation, and the City’s projections are based on proposed densities.

                  APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
                  ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
               AT-RISK HOUSING
               Housing element law in the California Government Code (Section 65583) requires
               jurisdictions to include a study of all low-income housing units which may at some future
               time become unaffordable upon the expiration of affordability restrictions. Three general
               cases create the opportunity for the conversion of affordable units to market rate:
                    •    Prepayment of HUD mortgages Section 221(d)(3), Section 202, and Section 236
                    •    Opt-outs and expirations of project-based Section 8 contracts
                    •    Other cases
               A prepayment of HUD mortgages Section 221(d)(3) involves a privately owned project with
               HUD providing either below-market-interest-rate loans or market-rate loans with subsidy to
               the tenants. In a Section 236 complex, HUD provides assistance to the owner to reduce the
               costs to tenants by paying most of the interest on a market-rate mortgage. Additional rental
               subsidy may be provided to the tenant. With Section 202, HUD provides a direct loan to
               nonprofit organizations for project development and rental subsidy for low-income tenants.
               All Section 202 handicapped units (Section 202) are designed for physically handicapped,
               mentally disabled, and chronically mentally ill residents.
               In a Section 8 contract for new construction or substantial rehabilitation, HUD provides a
               subsidy to the owner for the difference between a tenant’s ability to pay and the contract
               rent. The likelihood for opt-outs increases when the market rents exceed the contract rents.
               Other cases that create the opportunity for the conversion of affordable housing include the
               expiration of low-income use periods of various financing sources, such as Low Income
               Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC); bond financing; density bonuses; CHFA, CDBG, and HOME
               funds; and redevelopment funds.
               As shown at the bottom of Table A-24, three of the federally assisted multi-family housing
               complexes in Rancho Cordova are at risk of losing their affordability restrictions during the
               Housing Element planning period.
               COST ANALYSIS
               The cost of maintaining the assisted units is estimated to be significantly less than the cost
               required to replace the units through new construction. Conserving assisted units generally
               requires subsidizing the difference between market-rate and assisted rents.
60 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

      APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
       ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The cost of acquiring an apartment complex on the market for use as assisted housing
ranges from $52,100 per dwelling unit to $100,000 per dwelling unit (sales data of
comparable rental housing taken from loopnet.com and realtor.com, June 2013). Based on
this information, the acquisition cost of an individual 28- to 34-unit multi-family rental
complex in Rancho Cordova would range from $1.5 to $3.4 million. The cost to acquire all
71 of the rental units at risk is estimated to be between $3.7 and $7.1 million.
Since land prices and land availability are generally the limiting factors to development of
low-income housing, it is estimated that subsidizing rents to preserve assisted housing is
both more feasible and more economical than constructing new units.
RESOURCES               AND        INCENTIVES FOR AFFORDABLE
HOUSING
Efforts by the City to assist in the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of
affordable housing would utilize organizational and financial types of resources. The
following programs include local, state, and federal housing programs that are valuable
resources in assisting in the development of affordable housing, preserving “at-risk”

                                    In 1986, Congress created the federal Low
                                    Income Housing Tax Credits to encourage
                                    private investment in the acquisition,

                                    rental housing. Because high housing costs in
                                    California make it difficult, even with federal
                                    credits, to produce affordable rental housing,
                                    the California legislature created a state low-
                                    income housing tax credit program to
                                    supplement the federal credit. The state credit is

                                    for the credit, rental housing developments
                                    have to reserve units at affordable rents to

Local Program and Private Sources
                      The City of Rancho Cordova has a Local
                      Housing Trust Fund (LHTF) (originally
                      adopted under Sacramento County, funded
                      through the Housing Development Impact
                      Fee), which provides a linkage between the
                      demand for very low-income housing and the
                      development of commercial, office, industrial,
                      and other nonresidential uses that create lower-
                      paying employment opportunities that generate
                      a demand for very low-income housing.
Local Housing Trust   Nonresidential developments in Rancho              New Construction
Fund                  Cordova are required to pay into the LHTF on
                      a square footage basis at building permit. The
                      housing fee is in effect at the time the building
                      permit is to be issued. The fees are as follows:
                                 Office $.97 per square foot
                                 Hotel $.92 per square foot

                      manages housing and community development
                      activities including conventional or low rent
                      public housing and Housing Choice Vouchers
                      program (Section 8 certificate). The
                      conventional housing program involves housing
                      developments that are managed and maintained
                      by SHRA. The Housing Choice Vouchers
                      program involves a tenant-based rental subsidy
                      administered by the agency. Qualified families
                      are selected and certified from a waiting list. A

                      gross income. SHRA subsidizes the difference
                      between the tenant’s portion and the contract
                      rent. However, Fair Market Rents (FMR)
                      restricts the actual contract rent as determined
                      by the US Department of Housing and Urban
                      Development (HUD). The Section 8 voucher
                      program is similar to the certificate program,

               HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
               GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL
               CONSTRAINTS
               Various interrelated factors may constrain the ability of the private and public sectors to
               provide adequate housing that meets the housing needs for all economic sectors of the
               community. These constraints can be divided into two categories: governmental and non-
               governmental. Governmental constraints consist of land use controls, development
               standards, processing fees, development impact fees, code enforcement, site improvement
               costs, development permit and approval processing, and provision for a variety of housing.
               Non-governmental constraints include land availability, environment issues, vacancy rates,
               land cost, construction costs, and availability of financing.
               Governmental Constraints
               Land Use Controls
               The Rancho Cordova General Plan establishes policies that guide all new development,
               including any residential development. These policies, along with zoning regulations, control
               the amount and distribution of land allocated for different land uses in the City. The land use
               designations established by the General Plan that allow single-family and multi-family

               Residential Development Standards
               The City of Rancho Cordova Zoning Code is the guiding document for residential
               development policies. The policies establish and control the type, location, and density of
               residential development in Rancho Cordova. The zoning regulations serve to protect and
               promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the community residents and also
               implement the goals and policies of the General Plan. The specific residential land use zones
               used in Rancho Cordova and the respective maximum densities are shown in Table A-27.
               In addition to zoning and minimum lot sizes, the City of Rancho Cordova further controls
               residential development through development standards. Table A-28 details the
               development standards that are applied to residential development in the City. The City’s
               parking requirements for residential projects are dependent on the housing type. Parking
               requirements may be reduced or negotiated through the entitlement process. Table A-28
               also provides the parking requirements for residential developments. Single-family residential
               units are required to have two off-street spaces per unit. The number of parking spaces
               required for multi-family residential units ranges from 1.5 off-street spaces for one-bedroom
               units to two spaces for units with two or more bedrooms. An additional 0.6 parking spaces
               per unit are required to accommodate guests in multi-family residential projects. Actual

proximate to transit hubs and after completing Design Review are considerably less than the
normal standard. Residential lots with a habitable accessory structure must provide two off-
street spaces for each dwelling unit. The Zoning Code allows the required off-street parking
spaces to be provided in a garage, under a carport, on an open dust-free surface, or any
combination of these.
Building setbacks, maximum height limits, and open space requirements are also compulsory
for all housing developments in the City. The requirements are minimal and none of these
requirements are considered to constrain development, as evidenced by the amount of
housing development occurring in the City, and are used to ensure an aesthetically pleasing
project that allows for recreational uses and open space areas.

Notes:
1. These development standards address overall development of a mobile home park. Standards for individual mobile home lots within a park or mobile home subdivision can be found in RCMC 23.901.050 (Mobile homes and mobile home parks).
2. Setback standards may be amended during the design review process to accommodate innovative housing types or adjust for unique site conditions.
3. Common open space includes all landscaped areas outside of the required landscape corridors along adjoining streets, active and passive recreation areas, other outdoor amenities, and natural open space areas. Reductions in the required open space area to a minimum of 20 percent of the gross area for exceptional architecture design may be granted by the designated
approving authority.
4. The required minimum rear setback for lots less than 125 feet in depth in RD-1 to RD-10 is 20 percent of minimum lot depth.
5. Residential developers are encouraged to avoid the monotonous use of similar lot sizes on adjacent parcels. This code does not require minimum lot sizes to avoid monotonous lot configurations and home sizes.
6. Encroachments are permitted into the rear yard according to Chapter 23.704 RCMC.
7. Second dwelling units (attached or detached) may be constructed up to the maximum height limit of the primary structure
8. Specific Plan Areas and SPAs may incorporate different development standards

       ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Specific Plan and Special Planning Areas
Rancho Cordova has Specific Plan (SP) and Special Planning Areas (SPA) that are each
distinguished by their location and unique development characteristics. Once adopted, SPs
and SPAs replace the zoning of the property with zoning unique to the project area. While
SPs rely on the existing development standards in the Zoning Code, SPAs may establish
development standards for minimum lot area, building setbacks, lot width and depth, and
building height that differ slightly from citywide development standards. Specifically, SPAs
are designed to protect certain resources of the City from incompatible land uses and to
preserve areas with unique social, architectural, or environmental characteristics not
otherwise adequately protected by regular zoning. In general, the intent of an SPA is to allow
flexibility in development standards and existing zoning. Developers are encouraged to vary
housing designs and densities in these areas, including such types as mixed-use
commercial/residential developments and carriage houses. Developers are required to
maintain minimum densities based on the established zoning for the area.
In many cases, SPs and SPAs allow unique uses and development standards for the planning
area. These unique zoning provisions may increase flexibility for subsequent development
within the planning area. All SPs and SPAs must be consistent with the City’s General Plan.
The SPAs and SPs are not considered to hamper housing development and, in reality, may
promote housing development through the easing of some standards.
Overall, the Rancho Cordova residential development standards do not constrain the
development of new housing or affordable housing. Significant constraints to the
development of affordable housing are generally non-governmental, including high land and
construction costs, lack gap financing for affordable projects, and a variety of other market
factors.
Design Guidelines
The City of Rancho Cordova recently adopted Design Guidelines that apply to all new
development within the City and may apply to modifications within existing developments.
The Design Guidelines do not pose a constraint on the development of housing in the City
of Rancho Cordova but represent the City’s guiding policies with respect to the quality of
design expected for all projects within the City. Experience with projects funded by the Low
Income Housing Tax Credit demonstrates that well-designed multi-family low- and very
low-income apartment complexes contribute to community acceptance and improved living
conditions for the residents of such rental housing. These guidelines are intended to:
     •    Create an integrated community framework.
                                                                               RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 75

                   ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
                    •   Promote a mix of uses, both at the street level and within individual structures, that
                        capture the essence of the community and contribute to the health and vitality of
                        the City.
                    •   Respect the existing uses and environment while maximizing opportunities for
                        smart, vibrant development that shapes a new identity for the City.
                    •   Encourage pedestrian-oriented development that is successful and attractive to
                        residents and visitors.
               The designated approving authority for design review in Rancho Cordova is the City
               Council. The City Council will review and approve, conditionally approve, or deny design
               review applications using the guiding principles and design concepts described in the Design
               Guidelines.
               The Design Guidelines allow flexible alternative standards for streets, bikeways, open space,
               parks, and streetscape design. They encourage many pedestrian-oriented design aspects,
               including sidewalks separated from the street by landscaping, landscape medians, tree
               preservation within the right-of-way, traffic circles, curb extensions to slow traffic, and other
               approved traffic calming devices. To promote the incorporation of separated sidewalks,
               minimum front and street side yard setbacks may be modified. Street systems are required to
               be designed to improve traffic circulation in and through the site.
               Parks and open space should be consistent with current open space plans adopted by the
               City. The specific location of parks and open space are to be determined by the Planning
               Department and the City Council in conjunction with area plans or subdivision map review.
               Bikeways are required throughout each project and may be incorporated into the street
               design or as separate bike/pedestrian pathways.
               Streetscape design includes landscaping, lighting, and the use of street furniture to make the
               street more inviting to the pedestrian.
               The City’s Design Guidelines would have minimal financial impact on the development of
               housing and promote sustainable housing by encouraging quality of design and pedestrian-
               friendly neighborhoods. No specific materials or building techniques are required in the
               Design Guidelines, and a multitude of designs are acceptable to the City.
               The City encourages neighborhood design patterns to utilize a mix of densities and lot sizes
               to create a diversity of housing products.
               By adopting special standards that allow for flexibility in design and an increase in density,
               the Design Guidelines promote the development of housing affordable to lower-income

households. The following standards have been incorporated into the Design Guidelines to
increase densities and promote affordability:
     •    On corner lots, the minimum lots sizes and widths in the underlying zoning district
          shall apply to combined lots for duplexes and halfplexes.
     •    Minimum building setbacks in the RD-7 zoning districts have been reduced to 18
          feet for the front yard, and the rear yard setback was reduced to 10 feet for one-
          story structures and 15 feet for two-story structures.
     •    Minimum lot sizes and widths have been eliminated in the RD-10 and RD-15
          zoning districts to allow for greater densities and design flexibility.
Provision for a Variety of Housing
The Housing Element must identify adequate sites that are available for the development of
housing types for all economic segments of the population. Housing types include single-
family residential housing, multi-family residential housing, residential accessory dwelling
units, mobile homes, duplexes and halfplexes, and residential care homes. Table A-29 below
identifies allowed uses and corresponding permit requirements for the residential zoning
districts, and Table A-30 identifies allowed uses and permit requirements for mixed-use
districts of Rancho Cordova.
Reasonable Accommodations
The City provides housing for special needs populations, including housing accessible for
persons with disabilities (including veterans as a primary target group), large households, the
homeless, and single-parent households. The City provides accessibility in housing for
persons with disabilities by implementing state and federal requirements by undertaking the
following actions: (1) review regulations and procedures for City-funded or operated housing
programs to ensure that they do not exclude participation by persons with disabilities; and
(2) include accessibility considerations in the preparation of the City’s capital improvement
plan and the allocation of funding for capital improvements in support of housing and
residential neighborhoods.

Notes:
1 Use regulations in the table are shown with representative symbol by use classification listing: “P” symbolizes uses permitted allowed by right, “L” symbolizes uses
    that require approval of a limited use permit, “C” symbolizes uses that require approval of a conditional use permit, and “N” symbolizes uses that are not permitted.
2 Duplexes/halfplexes are permitted (P) on corner lots by right. On interior lots, a limited use permit (L) is required. In such instances, duplexes/halfplexes are
    exempt from the density requirements of the zoning district, provided that the overall neighborhood or subdivision has an average density within the allowable range.
3 Emergency Shelters are permitted without a conditional use permit in the OIMU and LIBP zones; transitional housing shall be treated like similar uses as required
    by state law (e.g., a single-family home used for transitional housing is subject to same requirements as a typical single-family home).
4 Senior independent living facilities are required to meet provisions in Chapter 5.1.

               1      Subject to development plan review by Planning Director. Projects of 80–150 units are subject to development plan review by
               the City Council. Projects of more than 150 units are subject to development plan review by the City Council.
               Density Bonus
               State law requires that cities and counties provide a density increase of up to 35 percent over
               the otherwise maximum allowable residential density (or bonuses of equivalent financial
               value) when developers agree to construct housing with units affordable to low- or
               moderate-income households. Adopted in 2008 and updated in 2012, Section 23.710 of the
               City’s Municipal Code provides density bonuses up to 35 percent, consistent with
               Government Code Section 65915.
               Site Improvements, Development Impact Fees, and Processing Fees
               Costs associated with site improvements are often a significant part of the total cost of new
               residential development. Site improvement costs are usually charged for the provision of
               sanitary sewer and water service and for necessary transportation improvements, as well as
               to provide any other necessary infrastructure or services to the project. In addition, the City
80 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

        APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
        ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
may require payment for various off-site improvements as a part of project mitigation
measures (e.g., payment for an off-site traffic signal).
Developers of new residential projects are also required to construct all on-site streets,
sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and any necessary additions to affected off-site arterials.
Generally, new residential streets are to comply with the City’s street standards as outlined in
Title 22 of the Municipal Code and as adopted in the current improvement standards. A
minor residential street is required to have a right-of-way of 40 feet, with pavement width
being 32 feet and two sidewalks each 4 feet (Table A-31). Minor residential streets are used
when serving fewer than 100 single-family residential units. Primary residential streets are
required to have a 50-foot right-of-way, including the pavement width of 42 feet, and may
serve up to 400 single-family and duplex units. These standards are considered necessary in
order to sustain and improve the quality of life in Rancho Cordova. However, alternative
designs to improve the aesthetics, pedestrian experience, or circulation are encouraged with
the condition that minimum pavement width for both public and private streets shall be
consistent with the City’s adopted residential street standards. Examples of alternative
designs may include sidewalks separated from the back of curb by a landscape planter strip,
landscape medians, traffic circles, and other approved traffic calming devices.

Rancho Cordova collects fees from new development projects to cover the costs of planning
review and permit processing, which include plan checks and inspection fees. A more
detailed discussion of the development permit and approval processing is provided in the
next section.
A variety of development impact fees are often assessed on new residential projects that
include City-controlled fees (e.g., development application fees, building permit fees) and
                                                                                 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 81

               non-City-controlled fees (e.g., school impact fees, utility connection fees). Other
               components of total project costs are the utility service connection fees (e.g., sewer and
               water connection fees).
               The various planning review and processing fees, development impact fees, and utility
               service connection fees collectively can add significantly to the cost of new housing. The
               City of Rancho Cordova has adopted citywide impact fees for all developments including
               those of single-family and multi-family projects. A breakdown of the community facility fee
               for single-family and multi-family projects is shown in Table A-32. Table A-33 provides a
               listing of planning fees charged by the City of Rancho Cordova. The breakdown of the total
               fee for a 100-unit single-family residential development, as well as the per-unit fee, is
               provided in Table A-34. Development fees, including building, planning, and impact fees,
               for a 1,600-square-foot home are estimated to be $78,204 (Table A-34). Table A-35
               provides development fees per multi-family unit and for a multi-family project. The
               estimated development fees for a 900-square-foot multi-family unit are $68,416 (Table
               A-35).

               Second Dwelling Units
               Second dwellings units are a viable option for providing affordable units in some
               communities. However, in Rancho Cordova, little interest has been expressed in
               constructing such units, and therefore the costs are not easily estimated. No second units
               have been constructed since the City’s incorporation, and the amount of undeveloped land
               existing indicates that affordable housing need may be met through other means.
               The City is currently allowing accessory dwelling units by right in single-family residential
               zones in compliance with Government Code Section 65852.2. However, the City’s Zoning
               Code requires a conditional use permit for the development of accessory units.
               Specific Plan Areas
               Specific Plan areas in the City of Rancho Cordova (e.g., Sunridge, Villages at Zinfandel)
               address land distribution, open space availability, infrastructure, and financing mechanisms
               for portions of the community. Development costs differ between Specific Plan areas and
               are dependent on the cost of infrastructure, public services, and other associated
               improvement requirements. Table A-34 shows the estimated development costs for a
               single-family home in a Specific Plan area. The estimated development fees including
               planning, building, and impact fees per unit for a 1,600-square-foot single-family home are
               $78,204. Development fees for proposed Specific Plans, such as Rio del Oro and the
               Suncreek Specific Plan, will be based on infrastructure financing plans that will be developed
               as the specific plans go through the entitlement process.
               Development Permit and Approval Process
               Applications for development projects are submitted to the City’s Planning Department. The
               application process varies depending on the type of entitlement that is being requested. In
               most cases, the planning application process requires a public hearing before the City
               Council. In case of design review for multi-family or commercial projects, a public hearing
               will be required before the City Council. The permitting process in Rancho Cordova does
               not create any unnecessary delays or increases to the cost of housing. In addition, City staff
               accelerates the application process by allowing concurrent review of the following
               entitlements:
                    •   Tentative map reviews
                    •   Design review
                    •   Special development permits
                    •   Rezones
                    •   Development agreements

      APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
      ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The steps in the approval process for housing developments differ with the type and
conditions of the development. Single-family subdivisions that do not require any change to
the zoning are submitted to the Planning Department, reviewed by staff for their
conformance to the Design Guidelines, and presented at a public hearing before the City
Council for approval.
Multi-family projects are processed in the same manner, but are subject to design review by
the City Council. Specific plans, rezoning requests, subdivisions, and variances require staff
and City Council review for approval. Multi-family development in commercial and business
zones requires the same procedure as in residential zones. As previously stated, City staff
allows concurrent review of entitlements to process multi-family projects in a timely manner,
and the City’s Design Review process has minimal financial impact on the development of
housing and promotes sustainable development by encouraging quality of design and
pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.
Many other factors, such as public sentiment, may also affect the determination of approval
of a project. The time frame for processing an application in the City of Rancho Cordova is
no longer than that of the majority of jurisdictions in the region and may be considerably
shorter. A complete listing of the lengths of estimated application-processing times is given
in Table A-36.

                   1    Estimates are given for time after the City receives the application. Projects with environmental review generally take
                        around one year in total.
               Design Review
               In 2012, the City Council dissolved the City of Rancho Cordova Planning Commission. The
               Council’s goal was to remove barriers to development and improve the speed and efficiency
               by which development applications and projects were processed. The responsibilities of the
               Planning Commission were split between City Planning staff and the City Council. Most of
               the minor or routine development decisions are made at the staff level, while design review
               and major project decision are brought before the City Council.
               The City Council’s design review process for multi-family housing follows a straightforward
               and efficient path to approval, and worst case scenario would add no more than two weeks
88 RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN

       APPENDIX A – DRAFT HOUSING
       ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
to the review process. Prior to construction of multi-family developments, the City requires
approval of a Design Review package for the project. Such projects are considered by the
City Council and the approval or denial of the project is based on the following four criteria:
     •   Consistency with the General Plan, any applicable Specific Plan, and the City’s
         design guidelines;
     •   Project design (architecture and site improvements) that enhance the character of
         the neighborhood;
     •   Architecture, scale and design details that are compatible with adjoining or nearby
         properties; and,
     •   Project circulation design that will not create conflicts with vehicular, bicycle or
         pedestrian transportation modes.
Since adoption of the City design guidelines and the establishment of the design review
process, the City has never denied a project based on findings that the project design did not
meet the required findings established within the Zoning Code. Therefore, the design review
is not seen as a constraint to the development of housing.
Code Enforcement
The City of Rancho Cordova Code Enforcement Division enforces a broad range of federal,
state, and municipal codes and standards designed to maintain a healthy, safe, and clean
environment and preserve the quality of life standards that residents and businesses enjoy in
Rancho Cordova. These codes include the 2010 California Building Code, 2010 California
Plumbing Code, 2010 California Mechanical Code, 2010 California Electrical Code, 1997
Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, 2000 Uniform Swimming Pool
Spa and Hot Tub Code, and all appendices thereof, and the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) included as a part of CCR, Title 24. The City has not adopted local amendments to
these codes. Enforcement of development and building standards does not constrain the
production or improvement of housing in the City. The presence of an active code
enforcement effort serves to maintain the condition of the City’s housing stock.

               Water Supply and Infrastructure
               Buildout of the General Plan is estimated to occur around the year 2030 with the addition of
               53,480 housing units. The General Plan EIR has determined that buildout of the General
               Plan will require additional treatment, capacity, storage capacity, and other conveyance
               facilities to meet the projected water demands. In addition, new development under the
               General Plan will not proceed without verification and determination that adequate water
               supply and adequate water supply infrastructure exists, and does not contribute to service
               area shortfalls.
               Wastewater Treatment
               The Sacramento Regional Water Treatment Plant currently has permitted capacity of 181
               million gallons per day (mgd) for Average Dry Weather Flows (ADWF) and 400 mgd of
               Average Wet Weather Flows (AWWF). Currently, the Sacramento Regional County
               Sanitation District is in the process of expanding the water treatment plant to accommodate
               250 ADWF and maintaining the 400 mgd for AWWF. The ADWF at the water treatment
               plant is expected to be 218 mgd in the year 2020, approximately 32 mdg under capacity with
               proposed expansion improvements in place. These expansions are projected to
               accommodate all projected regional growth through the year 2020.
               Environment
               The City of Rancho Cordova incorporates various environmental qualities that require
               protection and therefore constrain residential development. The most notable environmental
               constraint is the presence of wetlands. There are no significant portions of the City located
               in the 100-year floodplain, but much of the newly developing area has significant wetlands.
               The City is relatively flat and does not incorporate any significant geologic features like hills
               or ridges.

NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Land Cost
The cost of raw, developable land creates a direct impact on the cost for a new home and is
considered a non-governmental constraint. A higher cost of land raises the price of a new
home. Therefore, developers sometimes seek to obtain City approvals for the largest number
of lots allowable on a parcel of land.
Table A-38 shows vacant land for sale and properties with development potential in
surrounding communities as of June 2012. There were no sites listed in the City of Rancho
Cordova at the time. Depending on the size and location of the parcel, the vacant single-
family residential parcels located in areas surrounding Rancho Cordova range from $9,150 to
$46,000. There were no comparable vacant multi-family zoned parcels currently for sale in
the Sacramento area during the preparation of this Housing Element to use in determining
per unit parcel costs; however, property prices have depreciated significantly over the last
seven years. The range of single-family per-unit parcel costs is about 80 percent lower than
the range of costs in 2008. Applying the same discount to the multi-family per-unit land
costs would result in a range between $5,300 and $13,750 per unit.

               Construction and Labor Costs
               Many factors affect the cost of building a house, including the type of construction,
               materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration. The cost
               of raw land is estimated to be $100,000 per unit. Once a vacant parcel is purchased, the
               contractor has to make certain site improvements to prepare for building on the property.
               Such improvements include connections to existing utility systems and rough grading, plus
               installation of water and sewer lines. The estimated costs for these types of improvements
               are $40,000 per unit.
               An Internet source of construction cost data (www.building-cost.net), provided by the
               Craftsman Book Company, estimates the per square foot cost of a single-story home in the
               Rancho Cordova area to be approximately $86 per square foot. This cost estimate is based
               on a 2,000-square-foot house of good-quality construction including a two-car garage and
               small porch. The total construction costs are estimated at $241,151, excluding land costs.
               If labor or material costs increased substantially, the cost of construction in Rancho Cordova
               could rise to a level that impacts the price of new construction and rehabilitation. Therefore,
               increased construction costs have the potential to constrain new housing construction and
               the rehabilitation of existing housing.
               Availability of Financing
               The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a house
               affects the amount of affordably priced housing in Rancho Cordova. Fluctuating interest

rates can eliminate many potential homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing
project that could have been developed at lower interest rates infeasible. When interest rates
decline, sales increase. The reverse has been true when interest rates increase. Over the past
decade, there has been a dramatic growth in alternative mortgage products, including
graduated mortgages and variable or adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). These types of loans
allow homeowners to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and to qualify for larger
home loans.
Nevertheless, the fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially
during periods of low, stable interest rates. Most governmental programs that seek to
increase homeownership among low- and moderate-income households rely on loan
products which provide fixed interest rates below prevailing market rates, either for the
principal loan or for a second loan that provides part of the down payment for home
purchase. Many programs offer deferred second loans to facilitate homeownership. Table

OPPORTUNITIES                          FOR         ENERGY CONSERVATION
Energy-related costs could directly impact the affordability of housing in Rancho Cordova,
particularly with California in the midst of an energy crisis. Title 24 of the California
Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new development and
requires the adoption of an “energy budget.” Subsequently, the housing industry must meet
these standards and the City is responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations.
Alternatives that are available to the housing industry to meet the energy standards include:
     •    A passive solar approach that requires suitable solar orientation, appropriate levels
          of thermal mass, south-facing windows, and moderate insulation levels.
                                                                                             RANCHO CORDOVA GENERAL PLAN 93

                  ELEMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT
                    •    Higher levels of insulation than what was previously required, but not requiring
                         thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
                    •    Active solar water heating in exchange for less stringent insulation and/or glazing
                         requirements.
               The utility companies serving Rancho Cordova, including SMUD and PG&E, offer various
               programs to promote the efficient use of energy and assist lower-income customers.
               The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) provides electricity to the Sacramento
               metropolitan area. SMUD has a free shade tree program where homes with eastern, western,
               or southern exposure that heats up during the day could receive free trees from SMUD. In
               addition, SMUD provides rebates and financing assistance for the replacement and
               installation of energy-efficient equipment and materials. Examples of the programs and
               rebates include the installation of central air conditioning, installation of Energy Star sun
               reflecting coating, duct improvements, installation of insulation, and installation of a solar
               water heater.
               Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides natural gas to consumers in Rancho
               Cordova and provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents. In addition,
               PG&E offers energy assistance programs for lower-income households to help them
               conserve energy and control utility costs. These programs include the California Alternate
               Rates for Energy (CARE) and the Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help
               (REACH).
               The CARE program provides a 15 percent monthly discount on gas and electric rates to
               households with qualified incomes, certain nonprofit organizations, homeless shelters,
               hospices, and other qualified nonprofit group living facilities.
               The REACH program provides one-time energy assistance to customers who have no other
               way to pay their energy bill. The intent of REACH is to assist low-income households,
               particularly the elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and the unemployed, who experience
               hardships and are unable to pay for their necessary energy needs.
               In addition, the California Department of Health and Human Services funds the Home
               Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), which provides financial assistance to eligible low-
               income persons to offset the costs of heating and cooling their housing unit.
               State law requires that “…the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an
               integrated, internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies…” The purpose of
               requiring internal consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for
               the future maintenance, improvement and development of housing within the City.

        California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC), HUD, State HCD, and California Tax Credit Allocation
        Committee).
        Take all necessary steps to ensure that a project remains in or is transferred to an organization capable of
        maintaining affordability restrictions for the life of the project, including proactively ensuring notices to qualified
        entities, coordinating an action plan with qualified entities upon notice, and assisting with financial resources or
        supporting funding applications.
        Semi-annually coordinate with HUD to monitor projects approved to convert to ensure that any required
        assistance (or assistance that the owner has agreed to provide) to displaced tenants is carried out in a timely
        manner. Ensure projects are monitored to see if they are subject to other State or local requirements regarding the
        provision of assistance to displaced tenants.

        that properties are well managed and maintained and are being operated in accordance with the City’s property
        rehabilitation standards.
        Work with owners, tenants, and nonprofit organizations to assist in the nonprofit acquisition of at-risk projects to
        ensure long-term affordability of the development.
        Annually contact property owners, gauge interest, and identify nonprofit partners and pursue funding and
        preservation strategy on a project basis.
        Annually meet with stakeholders and housing interests to participate and support, through letters and meetings and
        technical assistance, local legislators in federal, state, or local initiatives that address affordable housing preservation
        (e.g., support state or national legislation that addresses at-risk projects, support full funding of programs that
        provide resources for preservation activities).
        Use available financial resources to restructure federally assisted preservation projects, where feasible, in order to
        preserve and/or extend affordability.
        Annually identify funding sources for at-risk preservation and acquisition rehabilitation and pursue these funding
        sources at the federal, state, or local levels to preserve at-risk units on a project-by-project basis.
Policy  Encourage mobile home park maintenance and improvement, including conversion to resident ownership when appropriate.
