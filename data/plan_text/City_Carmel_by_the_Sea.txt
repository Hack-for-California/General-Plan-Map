                                                                                         Section 1: Introduction
1      INTRODUCTION
       The Housing Element documents the existing and projected future housing needs
       in the community, particularly the availability, affordability, and adequacy of
       housing. Policies and programs in the Element serve as strategies to address
       housing needs across the full economic and social spectrum of the community.
1.1    Purpose of the Housing Element
       The Housing Element is designed to achieve the following:
                   Identify adequate sites for a range of housing types;
                   Assist in the development of adequate and affordable housing;
                   Address constraints to meeting the City’s housing needs;
                   Conserve and improve the condition of existing housing; and
                   Promote fair housing opportunities for all persons.
       This Housing Element contains goals, policies, and programs that cover the
       planning period of December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2023 as established
       by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
1.2    State Law and Local Planning
1.2.1 Consistency with State Law
       The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan Elements mandated by the
       State of California, as articulated in Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the California
       Government Code. State Law requires that each jurisdiction’s Housing Element
       consist of “an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs
       and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled program
       actions for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.” The

Section 1: Introduction
          Housing Element plans for the provision of housing for all segments of the
          population. Section 65583 et seq. of the Government Code sets forth specific
          requirements regarding the scope and content of the Housing Element. Table 1-1:
          State Housing Element Requirements summarizes these requirements and
          identifies the applicable sections in the Housing Element where these
          requirements are addressed.

                                                         City of Carmel-by-the-Sea 2015-2023 Housing Element
                                                                                         Section 1: Introduction
1.2.2 General Plan Consistency
       According to State planning law, the Housing Element must be consistent with
       other General Plan Elements. While each of the Elements is independent, they
       are also interrelated. Certain goals and policies of each Element may also
       address issues that are primary subjects of other Elements. This integration of
       issues throughout the General Plan creates a strong basis for the implementation
       of plans and programs and achievement of community goals. The Housing
       Element is most closely tied to the Land Use and Community Character Element.
       Residential locations and densities established in that Element are consistent with
       the policies and programs incorporated into this Housing Element.
       This Housing Element builds upon other General Plan Elements and is consistent
       with the policies and programs set forth by the General Plan. Whenever any
       Element in the General Plan is amended, the Housing Element will be reviewed
       and modified, if necessary, to ensure continued consistency between Elements.
1.2.3 Relationship to Other Plans and Programs
       The Housing Element identifies goals, policies, action programs and objectives
       that directly address the housing needs of Carmel-by-the-Sea. There are a number
       of City plans and programs that work to implement the goals, policies, action
       programs and objectives of the Housing Element.
1.2.4 Organization of the Housing Element
       The Housing Element is organized into the following sections:
                    Introduction (Section 1) – describes the purpose of the Housing
                     Element, community context, and public participation process;
                    Housing Resources (Section 2) - evaluates land, financial, and
                     administrative resources to address housing needs in the community;
                    Goals, Policies and Programs (Section 3) - identifies the City’s housing
                     goals, policies, programs and objectives to achieve those goals.
                    Housing Needs Assessment (Appendix A) - describes the City’s
                     population characteristics, housing characteristics, and existing and
                     projected housing needs;
                    Housing Constraints (Appendix B) - assesses potential market,
                     governmental, and environmental constraints to the development,
                     maintenance, and improvement of housing;
                    Housing Accomplishments (Appendix C) - reviews and analyzes
                     progress made in achieving housing goals in the 2007-2014 Housing
                     Element; and
                    Workshop Summary and Comments (Appendix D) – contains comments
                     received during the public outreach process.

City of Carmel-by-the-Sea 2015-2023 Housing Element
Section 1: Introduction
1.3       Community Context
          Carmel-by-the-Sea is a small coastal community located on the Monterey
          Peninsula near the cities of Monterey, Pacific Grove, and the unincorporated
          communities of Pebble Beach and Carmel Valley. Compared to surrounding
          cities, Carmel is relatively young, incorporated in 1916. A strong residential
          character and centralized business district took hold during a period of rapid
          growth during the 1920s and 1930s. In addition to Carmel’s abundant natural
          resources and amenities, this developmental period was critical in establishing the
          unique character of the community that attracts residents, visitors, and businesses
          to Carmel today.
          By 1940, the City had a population of about 2,800 persons in 1,575 housing units.
          Housing and population growth slowed after the 1940s, increasing in population by
          only 1,400 in 50 years, to a height of 4,239 persons in 1990. The City, with an
          estimated population of 3,747 in 2015, is one of the least populated of the
          Peninsula cities.
          Carmel-by-the-Sea supports a wide variety of housing types and sizes in its
          residential and commercial districts. Most of the housing stock is comprised of
          single-family detached homes located in the R-1 zoning district. Multi-family
          developments are scattered throughout the R-4 and Commercial zoning districts
          and represent the second largest segment of the housing stock.
          Due to existing land use patterns, high housing demand and costs, limited vacant
          land, and environmental constraints, the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea is faced with
          several obstacles to providing a variety of housing types, including affordable
          housing. Opportunities for development of housing, including infill development,
          conversion of commercial uses to residential, and addition of new residential uses
          above existing commercial space, will be actively identified and pursued.
1.4       Public Participation
          Public participation played an important role in the formulation of this Housing
          Element. Community outreach and activities are described in more detail in
          Appendix D.
          Study sessions were held by the Planning Commission and City Council in August
          2015 at the City Hall City Council Room. The purpose of these meetings was to
          receive comments from the Commission and Council as well as the public on the
          Draft Housing Element, prior to submittal to the HCD.
          During these meetings, the Planning Commission, City Council and the public
          were provided with an overview of the Housing Element Update process and
          content. The focus of the meeting was on the Goals, Policies, and Programs
          proposed in the Draft Housing Element.
          During the 60-day review by the California State Department of Housing and
          Community Development (HCD), the Draft Housing Element was available for
          review at the library and on the City’s website. Notifications were mailed out to

       those individuals and organizations that expressed interest in the Housing
       Element.
       In addition, public hearings were held before both the Planning Commission and
       City Council prior to the adoption of this Housing Element. Notifications were
       published in the local newspaper in advance of each hearing.
       The following agencies and interested parties were individually invited to
       participate during the Housing Element update:

                                                                      Section 2: Housing Development Resources
2      HOUSING DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
       This section of the Housing Element describes and analyzes the resources
       available to the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea for the development, rehabilitation, and
       preservation of housing.
2.1    Adequate Sites Analysis
       State Housing Element Law requires that cities demonstrate they have adequate
       sites to meet their housing obligations. An analysis of land resources must be
       completed and take into consideration zoning, development standards, and the
       availability of public services and facilities to accommodate a variety of housing
       types. The City must demonstrate that it has capacity or adequate sites to
       accommodate the projected need for housing.
       The State Department of Finance (DOF) is responsible for projecting the total
       statewide housing demand, with the State Department of Housing and Community
       Development (HCD) apportioning this demand to each of the state’s regions. This
       demand represents the number of additional units needed to accommodate the
       anticipated growth in the number of households, to replace expected demolitions
       and conversions of housing units to non-housing uses, and to achieve a future
       vacancy rate that allows for healthy functioning of the housing market.

Section 2: Housing Development Resources
          The Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) in cooperation with
          the local jurisdictions is tasked with the responsibility of allocating the region’s
          projected new housing demand to each jurisdiction. The allocation is further
          divided into four income categories:
                           Very-Low Income – 0% to 50% of the median income;
                           Low Income – 51% to 80% of the median income;
                           Moderate Income – 81% to 120% of the median income; and,
                           Above-Moderate Income – more than 120% of the median income.
          This process is known as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), and the
          goals are referred to as either the RHNA goals or the “regional share” goals for
          new housing construction. The allocation takes into account factors such as
          market demand for housing, employment opportunities, the availability of suitable
          sites and public facilities, commuting patterns, type and tenure of housing need,
          and others. In determining a jurisdiction’s share of new housing needs by income
          category, the allocation is adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower-income
          households in any one jurisdiction.
          The AMBAG has adopted a Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plan for its
          member jurisdictions. For Carmel-by-the-Sea, the plan establishes the City’s
          share of regional housing growth needs as 31 additional units for the period of
          2014 to 2023. Table 2-1: Regional Housing Needs Allocation displays the
          breakdown of this housing need by income group based on the median family
          income (MFI).
          Cities must also analyze and plan for the growth needs of the extremely-low-
          income category (30 percent or less of the median income). The extremely-low-
          income growth need is assumed to be 50 percent of the very-low-income
          allocation.

                 the total construction need.

2.1.1 Capacity to Meet Regional Housing Goals
       Vacant Land
       There is limited vacant land in Carmel available for residential development. While
       the City is primarily built out, scattered vacant sites can be found throughout the
       City. These sites are primarily zoned for single-family residential development.
       The vacant residential land in Carmel has the realistic capacity to accommodate
       74 dwelling units. Seventy units could be accommodated on parcels zoned for
       single-family residential use. Based on the densities permitted in these areas, the
       units would be affordable to above-moderate income households. Four units could
       be accommodated on vacant parcels zoned SC or RC. However, these parcels are
       relatively small and multifamily development is unlikely. Therefore, these units
       would likely be affordable to above-moderate income households. Estimated
       capacity of vacant sites is based on the maximum allowable units on each parcel,
       which is consistent with development patterns and the very high land cost in the
       City.
       Table 2-2: Vacant Land Permitting Residential Development summarizes the
       vacant parcels permitting residential development while Exhibit 2-1: Vacant
       Residential Parcels shows the locations of these properties.

                                                                     Section 2: Housing Development Resources
       Underutilized Mixed Use Sites
       The City permits by-right multifamily development with densities up to 22 du/ac in
       the commercial (CC, SC and RC) zoning districts. The units may be in stand-alone
       multifamily projects or within mixed use developments. The City’s zoning code
       does not establish a minimum density requirement for these zones. Densities up to
       44 du/ac are permitted, subject to a conditional use permit, when the development
       includes affordable housing. The development standards in the CC, SC and RC
       zoning districts are designed to provide maximum flexibility for development to
       achieve the maximum density standards. There are setback requirements only
       when the property faces the RC or a residential zone. The maximum lot coverage
       is designed to allow projects to achieve and exceed densities of 22 du/ac. Only
       one parking space per unit is required in the SC and CC zones and 1.5 spaces per
       unit in the RC zone regardless of the unit size.
       To prevent the loss of existing residential units within the commercial zoning
       districts and to encourage the construction of new residential units, the City
       prohibits the conversion of existing second-floor residential floor space to
       commercial use and requires newly constructed floor space on the second floor to
       be used as residential units.
       There a number of opportunities for redevelopment of existing commercial uses to
       mixed use projects in the CC, SC and RC zoning districts. Redevelopment may
       occur through demolition and construction of new buildings or through conversion
       of upper floor commercial uses to residential uses.
       Table 2-3: Underutilized Mixed-Use Parcels provides a comprehensive list of the
       parcels in the commercial districts that have capacity for residential development
       either through construction of additional building space for residential use or
       conversion of upper floor commercial uses to residential. The locations of these
       parcels are shown in Exhibit 2-2: Underutilized Parcels. Parcels unlikely to
       redevelop due to existing hotel/motel uses (which are protected under the City’s
       Local Coastal Program) or that are too small to accommodate additional
       residential units were excluded from the list. Parcels with existing historic
       resources or in areas where an increase in floor area or height would be
       incompatible with surrounding buildings were also excluded. For these reasons,
       the City has identified the parcels on this list as having the greatest potential to
       redevelop during the planning period. The parcels within the SC, CC and RC
       zoning districts have a redevelopment capacity for approximately 78 additional
       dwelling units. Based on the density permitted by-right in these districts, these
       opportunities would provide for housing for lower- and moderate-income
       households.

          Staff analysis of the sites with capacity for residential units in the CC, SC and RC
          zones identified the following sites that have the greatest potential to redevelop
          with residential uses within the planning period. While the estimated units shown in
          Table 2-3 are based on the by-right permitted density of 22 du/ac, all of the sites
          have the potential to be developed up to a density of 44 du/ac if affordable housing
          is provided.
            • APN 010-191-004. The property is currently significantly underdeveloped. The
                 building was originally constructed in 1950 (approximately 60 years old) and

                                                                          Section 2: Housing Development Resources
              has a floor area ratio of approximately 47 percent, compared to the maximum
              allowed of 80 percent. Much of the site is developed with a surface parking lot.
              The building is currently used as an office space, but as there is little demand
              for commercial space in Carmel, it is likely that the site will be redeveloped with
              stand-alone housing as opposed to mixed-use.
         • APN 010-145-008. The property is currently significantly underdeveloped. The
              building was constructed in 1938 as a drive-in market. The use was
              discontinued and currently operates as office space. The existing floor area
              ratio is approximately 44 percent, compared to the maximum allowed of 80
              percent. Much of the site is developed with a surface parking lot.
         • APN 010-142-003. The property is currently vacant and has water credits,
              making it highly likely that the property will be purchased and developed within
              the near future.
         • APN 010-141-003. The property is a 16,000-square-foot site developed with
              one-story retail spaces. The property owner has expressed interest to add
              second-story residential uses to the site. At 22 units per acres, 8 units could
              be constructed. At 44 units per acre, 16 units could be constructed.
         • APN 010-142-013. Property is currently underdeveloped and contains a
              building originally constructed in 1937.           The property owner has had
              discussions with the City about adding at least two apartments on the second-
              story.
         • APN 010-148-011. The site is currently developed with a small one-story
              single-family residence. The property is surrounded by multi-family units and
              commercial space. The highest and best use would be multi-family residential
              on the site.
         • APN 010-142-010. The site is currently contains a small office building and is
              underdeveloped. The building has a floor area ratio of approximately 40
              percent compared to the maximum allowed of 80 percent. The building was
              constructed in 1927 and is need of rehabilitation. Residential would be the

       Underutilized R-4 Sites
       The R-4 zone permits multi-family development by-right up to 33 du/ac. Projects
       providing affordable housing may be allowed to develop up to 44 du/ac through the
       City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. The R-4 zone encompasses 5.81 acres. The
       City has identified three opportunity sites for residential development within the R-
       4 zone. City staff has identified these sites as having the greatest potential to
       redevelop with housing units during the planning period. The location of these
       sites is shown in Exhibit 2-3: R-4 Opportunity Sites.                                                     These sites total
       approximately 0.44 acres. Detailed information on these sites is provided in Table
       2-4: R-4 Opportunity Sites.

       Source: City of Carmel-by-the-Sea Planning Department
       All three sites are developed with non-conforming commercial uses with potential
       to be redeveloped with housing units. The sites are within a residential
       neighborhood and do not have any known environmental constraints that would
       render residential development unfeasible.
       The City is nearly built-out and there is a limited opportunities to provide for new
       residential construction. As demand for housing in the City will continue, sites in
       residential neighborhoods with commercial uses such as those listed in Table 2-4
       have been determined to have the greatest potential of being redeveloped with
       housing. The limited availability of vacant land, current market conditions for
       residential and commercial development and current development trends provide
       conditions that favor redevelopment of commercial uses with residential units in
       Carmel. The limited availability of raw land for residential development has
       increased the demand and feasibility of infill development. These conditions are
       attractive to investors interested in redeveloping existing properties with for-sale or
       rental multifamily buildings. Long-time property owners are provided additional
       opportunities to increase the value of their property through developing new or
       additional residential units.
       The first site in Table 2-4 (Block 49, Lots 9 and 11) contains one building
       constructed in 1948. The building in good condition, but is exclusively used as
       office space (a non-conforming use) in a multi-family residential district. The
       development trend has been to increase residential uses instead of commercial
       uses in Carmel. No new office buildings have been proposed in within the area in
       approximately 10 years, while numerous housing developments have been

          proposed. Non-conforming uses within residential neighborhoods such as this
          provide opportunities for redevelopment by property owners to maximize their
          improvement value.
          The second site (Block 37, Lots 21, 22, 24 and 26) contains one building
          constructed in 1961. The building is in good condition, but is significantly smaller
          than what is presently allowed in the R-4 District. Redevelopment with residential
          units would maximize the use of the property. The property owner has informally
          approached the City with interest in redeveloping the property with residential
          uses.
          The third site in Table 2-4 (Block 36, Lot 14) contains structures built in the 1920s
          that have exceeded the useful lifespan of the building materials and are prime
          candidates for replacement. The City has demonstrated a successful track record
          of working with housing providers such as those listed in Section 2.2: Financial
          and Administrative Resources to provide affordable housing on sites of similar size
          and with similar characteristics. These projects include the recently completed
          Trevett Court which provides 14 affordable units on 0.18 acres and the Oliver
          White building which includes a moderate income unit on a small site (4,000
          square feet). Carmel is a built-out city and all of the residential lots in the city are
          small in size. The City utilizes partnerships with housing providers to develop
          affordable housing on these small sites. The City has not found small lot size to
          constrain the ability to provide for affordable housing as all of the affordable
          housing projects listed in Table A-22 are projects with less than 25 units.
          The City recognizes the physical limitations of small sites in providing for
          affordable housing. The City’s current development standards are consistent with
          small lot development standards and address this potential constraint by allowing
          the parcels to be developed to maximize the number of units on the site. For
          example, affordable housing projects are required to have only 0.5 parking spaces
          per unit, allowing for less space to be dedicated to parking and more space to be
          dedicated to the living spaces. The maximum base density within the R-4 zone is
          33 du/ac and the City’s Density Bonus allows for development up to 88 du/ac. The
          required setbacks are flexible and in some cases there are no required setbacks.

2.2       Financial and Administrative Resources
          Due to the City’s relatively high per capita income and lack of blighted conditions,
          the City is not generally competitive in applying and receiving state and federal
          housing funds. Instead, the City uses other methods of financing to provide
          housing programs and services in the community.
          The City cooperates with non-profit organizations to encourage and facilitate
          assisted housing and housing services to the community. Public and non-profit
          agencies that serve as resources in the implementation of housing activities in
          Carmel are described below. These agencies play an important role in meeting
          the housing needs of the City. In particular, they are critical in the provision of
          affordable housing and the preservation of at-risk housing units in Carmel.
                             Carmel Foundation – The Carmel Foundation is a non-profit
                              organization for seniors located in Carmel-by-the-Sea. Through a
                              long-term (30-year) lease of City-owned land at $1 per year and
                              private donations, the Carmel Foundation constructed and operates
                              the 24-unit Norton Court Apartments, which provide affordable
                              housing for seniors. The City has waived all application fees for the
                              Carmel Foundation’s recently-completed Trevett Court Project, which
                              expanded an existing affordable senior housing development from 9
                              units to 14 units.
                             Alliance on Aging - The Alliance on Aging is a multi-service,
                              nonprofit, community-based organization that has been serving the
                              needs of seniors and their families since 1970. The following describe

                   some of the services the Alliance provides to Carmel-by-the-Sea
                   residents:
                  Information and Referral – provides a “one-stop shopping” experience
                   for senior services, matching seniors and caregivers to appropriate
                   services and public benefit programs and providing assistance with
                   form/application completion.
                  Senior Homesharing - Brings unrelated adults together in shared
                   living arrangements to solve a variety of housing-related problems
                   faced by seniors in Monterey County. The program serves as a
                   registry for both "home seekers" and "home providers." Staff provides
                   guidance and assistance to potential housemates as they go through
                   the process of identifying, screening and negotiating the terms of
                   shared living arrangements with potential "housemates." Seniors who
                   need affordable housing and seniors who want to provide free or
                   reduced-cost housing in exchange for various kinds of assistance are
                   the program's target clientele, but single parents, students, disabled
                   adults and others in need of affordable housing or in-home services
                   are also eligible.
                  Friendly Visitor Program – links volunteers with seniors, providing
                   telephone reassurance, respite for caregivers, grocery shopping, and
                   limited escort services to medical appointments.
                  Habitat for Humanity - Habitat for Humanity is a community service
                   organization that renovates and builds homes with the goal of
                   eliminating poverty and providing decent shelter for all. Through
                   volunteer labor and tax-deductible donations of money and materials,
                   Habitat for Humanity constructs or rehabilitates homes in partnership
                   with the families that will become the owners of the properties.
                   Rehabilitated or newly constructed homes are sold to the families for
                   the cost of materials through a mortgage that does not include interest
                   or profit. Since 1976, Habitat for Humanity has built, rehabilitated or
                   conserved more than 800,000 houses around the world. Habitat for
                   Humanity, Monterey County is located in Seaside and actively
                   continues to work with jurisdictions to find and acquire appropriate
                   properties for residential development and redevelopment.
                  Seniors Helping Seniors - This volunteer program establishes daily
                   contact with seniors living alone. Seniors volunteer to phone other
                   seniors on a daily basis to check in on how they are doing and identify
                   any concerns.
       Due to developers’ ability to earn a high profit margin on projects built in Carmel-
       by-the-Sea, City staff is also able to negotiate with for-profit developers to provide
       affordable units as a component of and/or in addition to the primary project the
       developer is proposing. The City may offer incentives, such as reduced fees or
       parking standards, and/or a density bonus in order to facilitate development of

2.3       Opportunities for Energy Conservation
          In recent years, California has experienced significant price escalation for energy
          use. In recognition, Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth
          mandatory energy standards and an “energy budget” that developers must
          prepare for new residential developments. The City continues to require and
          enforce compliance with Title 24 in construction activities requiring a building
          permit. The City has adopted energy conservation standards in new
          developments, and local utilities also offer energy conservation programs for
          Carmel-by-the-Sea residents.
          Carmel-by-the-Sea residents receive electric and gas service through the Pacific
          Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). PG&E offers a number of programs to
          financially assist lower-income and special needs customers. These programs are
          outlined below.
                           CARE (California Alternate Rates for Energy) provides discounted
                            rates for low-income households and housing facilities by providing an
                            ongoing 20 percent discount on monthly energy bills. The CARE
                            program is available for single-family households, multi-family and
                            mobile home park residents, group quarter facilities, and employee
                            and farm worker housing.
                           REACH (Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help) is a
                            one-time energy assistance program sponsored by PG&E and
                            administered through the Salvation Army. REACH helps low-income
                            customers, who have experienced severe, uncontrollable, or
                            unplanned hardship and need assistance with their energy bills. In
                            general, recipients receive REACH assistance only once per year, but
                            exceptions are made for seniors, persons with disabilities and the
                            terminally ill.
                           Energy Partners Program provides free assistance for home
                            insulation and energy efficiency improvements for low-income
                            individuals. Assistance includes window weather stripping, insulation,
                            and furnace improvements.

3         GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
          The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea has always been proud of its residential character
          and heritage. All of the General Plan Elements and the Housing Element in
          particular, strive to preserve, promote, and strengthen this unique residential
          character. This section of the Housing Element contains goals, objectives,
          polices and programs intended to meet the following objectives: 1) Conserve and
          improve existing housing and maintain the character and stability of Carmel’s
          residential neighborhoods; 2) Identify adequate sites for a range of housing
          opportunities; 3) Assist in the development of affordable housing; 4) Promote
          housing opportunities for all persons and provide housing and services for
          special needs groups; and 5) Address constraints to meeting the City’s housing
          needs.
3.1 Goals, Policies and Programs
Goal G3-1:          Preserve the existing housing stock.
                Policy P3-1.1: Continue and expand programs to assist homeowners in
                maintaining and improving existing housing units.
                        Program 3-1.1.a: Housing Rehabilitation Information.                       To increase
                        awareness and use of housing rehabilitation programs and funds and
                        City Residential Inspection Services, the City will continue to distribute
                        information on the Inspection Services and Housing Rehabilitation
                        programs available through Monterey County, and alternative ways of
                        financing home repairs. Information will be provided to housing
                        providers, community groups, homeowners and the building trades.
                        The City will continue to disseminate housing assistance informational
                        materials in public buildings (City Hall, Libraries, Post Office) and on
                        the City’s website. Information may also be disseminated through
                        workshops and public service announcements.
                        Objective:               Provide information on rehabilitation programs,
                                                 inspection services and home repair financing on a
                                                 continuous basis in City Hall and other public offices

Section 3: Goals, Objectives, Policies and Programs
                              Implementation
                                                       Throughout the planning period.
                              Timeline:
                              Program 3-1.1.b: Residential Inspection Services. The City's Building Official
                              will continue to inspect residences in the community for structural
                              deficiencies and repair needs at the request of the property owner.
                              This program assists the property owner in deciding if structural
                              repairs are needed and what repairs should be prioritized.
                              In conjunction with this program, the City will provide information on
                              housing rehabilitation as described in Program 3-1.1.a.
                              Objective:               Provide residential inspection services to residents to
                                                       facilitate preservation of 5 units.

                              Timeline:
                              Program 3-1.1.c:      Housing Maintenance Information. The high quality of
                              life in Carmel-by-the-Sea and the elevated standards for housing
                              design have resulted in few violations that threaten the health and
                              safety in the community. Since the City's housing stock is aging,
                              however, code violations will likely increase without an active program
                              informing the community of property maintenance techniques and
                              rehabilitation assistance for homeowners who do not have the means
                              to update their residences.
                              To encourage maintenance of the housing stock and reduce the
                              likelihood of code violations and substandard units, the City will
                              disseminate informational materials identifying techniques used to
                              upgrade property consistent with health and safety standards. The
                              informational materials will continue to be disseminated at public
                              buildings, through the City’s website, and in conjunction with Program
                              3-1.1.a.
                              Objective:               Provide housing maintenance information to facilitate
                                                       preservation of 5 units.

Goal G3-2:          Preserve existing residential units and encourage the development of new multi-
                    family housing in the Commercial and R-4 Districts.
                Policy P3-2.1: Continue to encourage mixed-use developments (second-floor
                housing over first-floor commercial uses) as a preferred development form
                contributing to the village character in all Commercial Districts.
                         Program 3-2.1.a: Incentives for Mixed-Use Development. The City's Zoning
                         Code allows for the development of new residential units on the
                         second floor of all development in the commercial district. As an
                         incentive, the Code will continue to provide floor area bonuses of up
                         to 15 percent for projects that include housing for moderate-, low- and
                         very-low-income households (see Table B-5).
                         To promote awareness of the incentives and further encourage
                         affordable housing in mixed-use development, the City will distribute
                         informational materials outlining the floor area and other applicable
                         incentives. The information will be provided to developers and
                         property owners in the commercial district on a continuous basis at
                         City Hall.
                                                  Encourage affordable housing in mixed-use

                         the City will continue to prohibit the conversion of existing second-
                         floor residential floor space to commercial use. The City will also
                         continue to require newly constructed floor space at the second floor
                         to be used as residential units.

                               requires a conditional use permit for all multi-family residential
                               development with densities exceeding 22 du/ac, consistent with the
                               adopted Local Coastal Program. To ensure the provisions of the
                               Municipal Code do not have an undue negative impact on the supply
                               and cost of multi-family housing, the City will continue to monitor
                               multi-family residential development applications to assess whether
                               the CUP requirement is posing an unreasonable development
                               constraint. If it is determined that the CUP requirement is negatively
                               affecting the cost and supply of housing, the City will initiate Zoning
                               Code and LCP amendments to revise permit requirements for
                               residential projects with densities greater than 22 du/ac to ensure
                               permits are granted based on objective criteria.

                 Implementation           Ongoing through 2023
                 Timeline:
                  Program 3-3.1.b: Surplus Sites. City-owned surplus land may provide
                  additional sites for new affordable and senior housing, exclusively or
                  in combination with another public use. The City shall investigate the
                  feasibility of utilizing surplus sites for housing development and
                  partnering with housing providers to develop housing for lower-income
                  households and/or senior housing on appropriate surplus sites.
                 Objective:               Identify surplus sites that may be suitable for residential
                                          development

                  Program 3-3.1.c: Development on Small Sites
                  The City will continue incentives and provisions in the City’s Municipal
                  Code that facilitate development on small sites including reduced
                  parking requirements for affordable housing projects (0.5 parking
                  spaces per unit), density bonuses that allow for development up to 88
                  du/ac and flexible or in some cases no required setbacks in the R-4
                  zone.
                  The Lot Merger Program currently provides for two types of owner-
                  initiated lot mergers. First, a property owner may request a merger to
                  consolidate lots and/or lot fragments as defined by this code to create
                  a single parcel that meets the requirements for a legal building site in
                  the district where the property is located. The Director may approve a
                  request for merger without public notice or a hearing.
                  The City also currently encourages the merger of small R-1 lots into
                  larger lots to promote diversity in design and housing size and to
                  preserve open space. Two or more contiguous lots, each of which
                  would individually meet the standards for development as a building
                  site, may be merged through the filing of a voluntary merger request
                  by the owner(s). Upon approval of such a merger by the Department
                  of Community Planning and Building, and recording of merger
                  documents or maps with the County Recorder, certain incentives
                  become available to the property owner.
                   The City will review its Lot Merger Program to determine if any
                   refinements should be made, including a requirement that mergers
                   be approved by the Planning Commission rather than the Director.
                   The City may also consider incentives for commercial lot mergers
                   when lower-income units are provided, and eliminating any

                                provisions of this program that have the unintended effect of
                                restricting housing opportunities.

                                                       changes are determined to be necessary, initiate a
                                                       Zoning Code amendment.
                  Policy P3-3.2: Continue to monitor and work cooperatively with regional
                  agencies to augment infrastructure in a manner that provides adequate
                  capacity for existing and new housing needs while preserving and improving
                  the unique visual character of the City.
                               Program 3-3.2: Address Infrastructure Constraints. The primary constraint to
                               housing production in Carmel is the lack of water. Few sites have
                               available water credits sufficient to accommodate construction of
                               additional residential units. The City will continue work cooperatively
                               with the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (MPWMD)
                               and other regional agencies to address infrastructure limitations (e.g.
                               sewer, water, roads) that affect the ability to serve new housing
                               development.
                               The City will also continue to grant water allocation priority to those
                               projects that assist the City in meeting its share of the regional
                               housing need for lower- and moderate-income households.
                               Objectives:             Address regional and local infrastructure constraints to

Goal G3-4:              Protect the stability of residential neighborhoods by promoting year-round
                        occupancy and neighborhood enhancement.
                  Policy P3-4.1: Maintain and encourage expansion of permanent residential
                  housing stock in the R-1 District.
                               Program 3-4.1.a: Permanent Housing. A substantial percentage of the
                               City's housing stock lies vacant much of the year as second homes
                               occupied for weekends, vacations or on a seasonable basis. This has
                               the effect of reducing the number of permanent, year-round residents
                               in the City.
                               To encourage an increase in full-time residential occupancy and use
                               of the housing stock for permanent housing, the City will continue to

                         District. No additional motel units are permitted in the R-1 District.
                         Objective:              Continue to implement City ordinances on the prohibition
                                                 of short-term, transient rentals and timeshares of

                         Program 3-4.1.b: Conversion of R-1 Motels. Pursuant to coastal zone
                         requirements, the City has recognized existing R-1 motels as an
                         important coastal visitor asset and economic base in the community.
                         However, conversion or redevelopment of these units as permanent
                         residential dwellings provides additional housing and can improve the
                         integrity of residential neighborhoods. The City will continue to allow
                         conversion of R-1 motel units into permanent residences with the
                         transfer of vacated rooms to the commercial district.

                         enforce height, coverage and floor area standards to ensure that new
                         construction and remodels do not present excess visual mass or bulk
                         to public view or to adjoining properties. The City will continue to
                         enforce design standards which ensure that buildings relate to a
                         human scale and that they avoid use of oversize design elements that
                         make them appear dominating or monumental.
                         The City will continue to require that projects not meeting adopted
                         design guidelines be reviewed by the Planning Commission. Diversity
                         in architecture is encouraged as long as proposed designs perpetuate

                         programs for seniors in Monterey County that assist seniors in
                         locating roommates to share existing housing. This program often
                         enables seniors to live independently for a longer time period. To
                         expand participation in both of the available programs the City shall
                         distribute informational materials to the Carmel Foundation and

                         implement its condominium conversion policy, which restricts the
                         conversion of apartments to condominiums to preserve the lower-cost
                         rental housing options, typical of apartments, within the City.
                         Apartments cannot be converted to condominiums unless a new
                         apartment is being created to offset the conversion.

                               To further encourage the creation of subordinate units, the City will
                               investigate potential amendments such as permitting subordinate
                               units on smaller lots. In addition, the City will implement incentives
                               which may include waiver/reduction of certain fees, priority
                               processing, and reduced parking and setback requirements.
                               The City will provide informational materials on incentives and

                               A number of housing developments within the City provide affordable
                               housing, but are not deed-restricted. The City shall continue to
                               monitor the affordable housing projects and work with the owners to
                               preserve affordability through identification of funding sources and/or

                         processes have the potential to increase the cost of development. To
                         help mitigate the cost of development, the City will continue to offer
                         expedited review procedures for residential projects that include
                         affordable housing units. This program is helpful in reducing holding
                         costs incurred by project applicants while processing entitlements,
                         plan check and building permits. The specific procedures for fast-
                         track processing of affordable housing projects are included in the
                         City's Municipal Code.
                        Objective:               Expedited review and processing for projects with an
                                                 affordable housing component

                the consumption of these resources in housing and to reduce housing costs.
                         Program 3-5.6.a: Energy Conservation and Green Building. Energy
                         conservation in the home has the potential to bring about
                         considerable savings in the overall cost of housing. The City will
                         continue to review applications for new construction and substantial
                         alterations taking into consideration solar orientation and access to
                         sunlight. Additionally, the City will continue to require compliance with
                         current state building standards for energy efficiency in all new
                         homes.

                        Timeline:
                         Program 3-5.6.b: Water Conservation. The City recognizes a need to
                         conserve and manage its water resources to accommodate the
                         regional housing need. The City has adopted a Water Management
                         Program, which in part seeks to reduce unnecessary water
                         consumption in existing and new development. The Program requires
                         the use of water-conserving plumbing fixtures in all new construction,
                         replacement of non-compliant fixtures in remodeling projects with
                         substantial construction and water-conserving landscaping. The City
                         shall continue to enforce the Water Management Program and
                         provide information to the community on water conservation retrofits
                         and best practices. In addition, the City will provide information on and

                               Center of Monterey County provide fair housing services and
                               information. These agencies advise persons in need of information on
                               housing and employment, mediate landlord/tenant disputes and
                               research complaints about discriminatory housing practices. The City
                               shall coordinate with these agencies to provide printed information
                               about fair housing services at City Hall, on the City’s website, and in

         Notes:
         * The City has approximately 3,400 residential units, 55 (or about two percent) of which are affordable
         units. Each year the City process approximately 100 building permits for remodels, additions, and
         other construction, which rehabilitates the existing housing stock. For the lower-income categories
         rehabilitation goals, the City assumes that two percent of the total permits processed will be for
         affordable units. Under these assumptions, the City would rehabilitate two units of affordable housing
         a year or approximately 16 units throughout the 2015-2023 planning cycle. This represents
         approximately 30 percent of the City’s existing affordable housing inventory. While the Above
         Moderate Income level rehabilitation goal is fairly large, it is consistent with the historic data on
         rehabilitation work for market-rate housing in Carmel.
         ** The City does not have any existing units that would qualify as an extremely low income category
         units.
         *** The City has no units at risk of converting to market rate during this planning cycle.

A      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
       When preparing the Housing Element, jurisdictions must evaluate both existing
       and future housing needs for all income groups.
       This section analyzes demographic and housing characteristics that influence the
       demand for and availability of housing. The analyses form a foundation for
       establishing programs and policies that seek to address identified housing needs.
       Housing needs are identified according to income, tenure and special needs
       groups.
       Primary data sources include the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Department of
       Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the California Department of Finance
       (DOF) and the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG). These
       data sources are the most reliable for assessing existing conditions and provide a
       basis for consistent comparison with historical data and the basis for forecasts.
A.1 Population Characteristics and Employment Trends
       Housing needs in a community are largely determined by population growth and
       various demographic variables such as age distribution. This section provides a
       summary of the changes to the population size and age and racial/ethnic
       composition of Carmel-by-the-Sea.

A.1.1 Population Growth Trends
         The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea (City) was incorporated in 1916 and by 1940 had a
         population of 2,837. Today, the City, which is one square mile in area, has one of
         the smallest populations in the Monterey Peninsula. According to the U.S.
         Census, the City had a population of 4,239 in 1990. From 1990 to 2015, the
         population has declined by 11.6 percent compared to an increase of nearly 20
         percent for the county as a whole (Table A-1: Population Trends – Carmel-by-the-
         Sea and Monterey County).

A.1.2 Age Characteristics
         A community’s age characteristics can help identify its housing needs and project
         the distribution of demand for future housing types. According to the 2010 U.S.
         Census, about two-thirds of the City’s population was age 50+ and the median age
         in the City was 59 years. By comparison, in Monterey County, the population
         median age was about 33 years.

A.2 Household Characteristics
        The U.S. Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit.
        This may include families related through marriage or blood, unrelated individuals
        living together, or individuals living alone. The U.S. Census defines a family as
        related persons living within a single housing unit.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
         Household type and size, income levels, the presence of special needs
         populations, and other household characteristics influence the type of housing
         needed by residents. This section details the various household characteristics
         affecting housing needs.
A.2.1 Household Composition and Size
         As shown in Table A-5: Household Size Distribution, one-person households made
         up the largest segment of the City’s renter-occupied households and two-person
         households made up the largest segment of owner-occupied households.

         With a majority of one- or two-person households, smaller sized units (1 to 2
         bedrooms) would meet a significant portion of the City’s housing needs. However,
         some households may desire larger living spaces.
A.2.2 Household Income
         Household income relates directly to the household’s ability to acquire adequate
         housing. While above-moderate-income households have more disposable
         income to spend on housing, low- and moderate-income households are more
         limited in the range of housing that they can afford. Typically, as the income of
         households decreases the incidence of overpayment and overcrowding increases.
         The Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) establishes
         housing affordability criteria for five income categories based on the 2015
         Monterey County median income of $68,700 (see Table A-6: Income Range by
         Affordability Category, 2015).

A.3 Housing Stock Characteristics
         This section evaluates housing stock characteristics including tenure and vacancy
         rates, housing age and conditions, and housing costs and affordability.
A.3.1 Housing Stock
         According to the U.S. Census and the DOF, housing stock in Carmel-by-the Sea
         showed a net increase of only 83 units from 2000 to 2015. The City is nearly built
         out and is also constrained by the lack of water to serve new development.
         Residential construction in recent years involved mostly demolition and
         replacement of older units with new, larger units. With very few vacant lots in the
         City and limited water available to new projects, infill is the primary method of
         residential construction.
         Eighty-two percent of the housing stock is comprised of single-family detached
         homes, while multi-family developments of five or more units represent the second
         largest segment of the housing stock (see Figure A-2: Housing Stock
         Composition).

        The City’s average household size is 1.79, which suggests that units with three-
        bedrooms or less could adequately house most of the City’s population. As shown
        in Table A-8: Unit Size by Tenure, about 85 percent of owner-occupied housing
        units and about 75 percent of rental units had three bedrooms or less.

A.3.2 Housing Tenure and Vacancy
        Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. Vacancies can also be
        an important housing market indicator in that the vacancy rate influences the cost
        of housing and may reflect the match between housing demand and availability.
        Tenure
        Recent Census estimates showed that 62.5 percent of Carmel-by-the-Sea
        residents owned the units they occupied, while 37.5 percent rented. This
        ownership rate is significantly higher than for Monterey County as a whole, which
        had just under 50 percent owner-occupied units (Table A-9: Occupied Units by
        Tenure).
                                           Table A-9: Occupied Units by Tenure

        Vacancy
        A vacancy rate of 5 to 6 percent is generally considered optimal to balance the
        demand for and supply of housing. A certain level of vacancy is needed to
        moderate the cost of housing, allow sufficient choice for residents, and provide an
        incentive for unit upkeep and repair.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
         As shown in Table A-10: Vacancy Rates, over 31 percent of Carmel-by-the-Sea’s
         housing stock was vacant due to seasonal, recreational, or occasional use. This
         high percentage is not unusual for scenic coastal communities due to the
         popularity of second homes in such areas.
                                                        Table A-10: Vacancy Rates

      Source: U.S. Census 2010, Table DP1
         In 2010, 2.6 percent of units were vacant and for rent while 2.0 percent of units
         were vacant and for-sale.
A.3.3 Housing Stock Age and Conditions
         Age of Housing Stock
         The age of a housing unit is often an indicator of housing conditions. In general,
         housing that is 30 years or older may need repairs based on the useful life of
         materials. Housing over 50 years old is more likely to need major repairs.
         According to recent Census estimates, 79 percent of housing units in the City were
         built before 1980 and 64 percent were built before 1960 (Table A-11: Age of
         Housing Stock).

                                                        City of Carmel-by-the-Sea 2015-2023 Housing Element
                                                                       Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
       Housing Conditions
       Housing is considered substandard when conditions are found to be below the
       minimum standard of living conditions defined in Section 1001 of the Uniform
       Housing Code. Households living in substandard conditions are considered to be
       in need of housing assistance, even if they are not seeking alternative housing
       arrangements, due to threat to health and safety.
       In addition to structural deficiencies and standards, the lack of infrastructure and
       utilities often serves as an indicator for substandard conditions. According to
       recent Census estimates, none of the housing units in the City lacked kitchen or
       plumbing facilities.
       In 2008, a City-wide windshield survey was conducted as part of the Housing
       Element update to evaluate general housing conditions. The survey focused on
       identifying housing units in need of substantial repair or rehabilitation. Properties
       were evaluated from the public right-of-way and the surveyors did not enter onto
       private property.
       Approximately 3,000 properties in the residential and commercial districts were
       visually inspected, although a survey form was not completed for every property.
       The exterior condition (siding, roofing, windows and doors, foundation, electrical)
       of the properties was visually evaluated to determine if moderate or substantial
       improvements were needed or if the property was in a dilapidated condition. The
       vast majority of units in the City are in good condition with either no or moderate
       repairs needed. According to the windshield survey, approximately 77 units were
       determined to need substantial repairs and approximately 16 were determined to
       be in a dilapidated condition. Due to high property values and strong housing
       demand, it is unlikely that housing conditions have declined significantly since the
       2008 survey was completed.
A.3.4 Housing Costs and Rent
       Home Prices
       Recent Census estimates reported a median value for all owner-occupied units in
       Carmel-by-the-Sea of over $1 million (Table A-12: Value of Owner-Occupied
       Housing Units). Only about 5 percent of homes were valued at less than
       $500,000.

A.3.5 Housing Affordability
       Housing affordability can be determined by comparing the sales prices and rents
       for housing in Carmel-by-the-Sea to the affordable payment for households at
       each income level.
       Housing affordability is defined as paying no more than 30 percent of household
       income on housing expenses. Table A-15: Affordable Rent and Purchase Price by
       Income Category summarizes affordable rents and purchase prices by income
       categories based on the 2015 median family income of $68,700 for Monterey
       County.

       Based on the very high market prices and rents in the City, it is clear that low- and
       moderate-income households have a very difficult time finding suitable affordable
       housing without subsidies.

A.3.6 Overpayment and Overcrowding
         Overpayment
         Overpayment is defined as households paying more than 30 percent of their gross
         income on housing related expenses, including rent or mortgage payments and
         utilities. High housing costs can cause households to spend a disproportionate
         percentage of their income on housing. This may result in repayment problems,
         deferred maintenance or overcrowding.
         Lower-income households with a disproportionate housing cost burden are more
         likely to have difficulty finding suitable housing. In general, a larger proportion of
         renter-households have disproportionate housing cost burdens than owner-
         households because of their typically lower incomes.
         Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) estimates published by
         HUD (Table A-16: Overpayment by Tenure and Income) showed that 77 percent of
         renters and 75 percent of homeowners in the extremely-low-income category
         spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing. All renters and about 38
         percent of homeowners in the very low-income category were overpaying, while all
         renters and about two-thirds of homeowners in the low-income category
         experienced overpayment.                         Even in the above-moderate-income category,
         overpayment was experienced by about 31 percent or renters and 25 percent of
         homeowners.

         Overcrowding

         room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches.                                               A severely

       Recent Census estimates reported that no owner-occupied units and only 1.6
       percent of rental units in Carmel-by-the-Sea were overcrowded, while no units
       were severely overcrowded (Table A-17: Overcrowding by Tenure).
A.4 Special Needs Populations
       Certain population groups may have a more difficult time finding decent affordable
       housing due to their special circumstances or needs. These “special needs”
       populations include elderly persons, large households, female-headed
       households, persons with disabilities, homeless, agricultural/farm workers,
       extremely-low income households, and students.
A.4.1 Elderly Persons
       Elderly persons are considered a special needs group because they are more
       likely to have fixed incomes. Elderly persons often have special needs related to
       housing location and construction. Because of limited mobility, elderly persons
       typically need access to facilities and services (e.g., medical and shopping) and
       public transit. In terms of housing construction, elderly persons may need ramps,
       handrails, elevators, lower cabinets and counters and special security devices to
       allow for their reduced mobility.
       Carmel-by-the-Sea has a large proportion of senior households. According to
       recent Census estimates, approximately 55 percent of the City’s owner
       households were headed by persons age 65+, with over 30 percent headed by
       persons 75 or over. On average, renters tended to be younger than owners, with

         The Zoning Ordinance gives some incentives for providing Senior Housing: 1) A
         density bonus of up to 25 percent if 50 percent or more of all units in a
         development are reserved for Senior Citizens; and 2) Reduced on-site parking
         requirements. 1/3 space is required per senior unit.
A.4.2 Large Households
         Large households, defined as those with five or more persons, are considered a
         group with special housing needs due to the limited availability of adequately sized
         affordable housing units. Unavailability of housing units with larger bedroom
         counts can result in overcrowding and accelerated unit deterioration. As shown in
         Table A-19: Large Households by Tenure, large households represent only 4
         percent of the City’s owner households and no renter households.

A.4.3 Female-Headed Households
         Female-headed households are a special needs group due to comparatively low
         rates of homeownership, lower incomes and high poverty rates experienced by
         this group. According to recent Census estimates, about 16 percent of owner
         households and 8 percent of renter households were female-headed households
         in Carmel-by-the-Sea.

A.4.4 Persons with Disabilities
       According to recent Census estimates, approximately 7 percent of non-
       institutionalized City residents reported some type of disability (see Table A-21:
       Disabilities by Age Group). As might be expected, those aged 65 and over
       generally reported the highest disability rates, although a high percentage of young
       children also reported disabilities. Approximately 15 percent of seniors reported
       some type of disability, compared to only 2 percent for persons between age 18
       and 64. The most frequently reported disability for seniors was an ambulatory
       difficulty (10 percent of the senior population). Housing opportunities for those with
       disabilities can be maximized through housing assistance programs and providing
       universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered countertops,
       single-level units and ground floor units.
       Developmental Disabilities
       As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic
       disability of an individual that:
         •     Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and
               physical impairments;
         •     Is manifested before the individual attains age 18;
         •     Is likely to continue indefinitely;
         •     Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
               areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language;
               c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g)
               economic self-sufficiency; and
         •     Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
               interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
               assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually
               planned and coordinated.

             Note: Totals may exceed 100% due to multiple disabilities per person
         The Census does not record developmental disabilities as a separate category of
         disability. According to the U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an
         accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be defined as
         developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally disabled persons
         can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More
         severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision
         is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
         environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
         developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive
         housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
         situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
         The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
         community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
         disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers,
         four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The San Andreas
         Regional Center (SARC) located in Campbell (http://www.sarc.org/) provides

       services for people with developmental disabilities in Monterey, San Benito, Santa
       Clara, and Santa Cruz counties. The SARC is a private, non-profit community
       agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to
       individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. As of 2014, SARC
       served a small number of clients 1 living in Carmel-by-the-Sea (zip code 93921).
       There is no charge for diagnosis and assessment for eligibility. Once eligibility is
       determined, most services are free regardless of age or income. There is a
       requirement for parents to share the cost of 24-hour out-of-home placements for
       children under age 18. This share depends on the parents' ability to pay. There
       may also be a co-payment requirement for other selected services.
       Regional centers are required by law to provide services in the most cost-effective
       way possible. They must use all other resources, including generic resources,
       before using any regional center funds. A generic resource is a service provided
       by an agency that has a legal responsibility to provide services to the general
       public and receives public funds for providing those services. Some generic
       agencies may include the local school district, county social services department,
       Medi-Cal, Social Security Administration, Department of Rehabilitation and others.
       Other resources may include natural supports. This is help that disabled persons
       may get from family, friends or others at little or no cost.
A.4.5 Homeless
       An accurate assessment of the homeless population is difficult because of the
       transient nature of the population. Many individuals are not visibly homeless, but
       move around in temporary living conditions.
       The County conducted a point-in-time count and prepared a series of independent
       homeless peer interviews as part of the 2015 Monterey County Homeless Census
       and Survey. This survey used two methods for data collection: a point-in-time
       count on January 28, 2015 and a series of independent homeless peer interviews,
       as recommended by HUD. The 2015 Monterey County Homeless Point-in-Time
       Census and Survey 2 counted 1,630 unsheltered homeless people and an
       additional 678 people living in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and
       domestic violence shelters. The final estimate of the 2015 Monterey County
       Homeless Census and Survey is 2,308 persons. Of those, 6 unsheltered persons
       were identified as living in the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea.
       While no homeless shelter is located in Carmel, the Police Department refers
       homeless persons found within the City to Peninsula area shelters, including the
       Salvation Army/Monterey Peninsula Corps in Sand City and I-HELP, located in

         the existing shelters will accept homeless persons if there is capacity.
A.4.6 Agricultural/Farm Workers
         Agricultural workers are defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
         through seasonal agricultural work. Agricultural workers have special housing
         needs because they typically earn lower incomes than other types of workers and
         move throughout the season from one harvest to another. According to recent
         Census estimates 3, 12 persons, comprising less than one percent of Carmel-by-
         the-Sea’s labor force, were employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and
         hunting, and mining industries. It is assumed that only a small percentage of
         persons employed in this industry are involved in active agricultural production and
         harvest. Therefore, there is no apparent or recognized need for farmworker
         housing in the City.
A.4.7 Students
         The college student population in the area is another significant factor affecting
         housing demand. Recent Census estimates reported that 249 residents of
         Carmel-by-the-Sea were college students, representing about seven percent of the
         City’s population. 4 Near Carmel, the Middlebury Institute of International Studies
         at Monterey (MIIS) is located in the City of Monterey and the California State
         University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) is located in the cities of Marina and Seaside.
         According to the CSUMB website, the student population has grown from 654 in
         1995 to over 6,600 in 2015. Forty-five percent of the CSUMB students live in on-
         campus apartments, residence halls, and family housing.
         According to the MIIS website, the student population consists of approximately
         725 students. The MIIS does not have dormitories or on-campus housing.
         However, the school’s student services provide exclusive short-term & long-term
         rental databases to help students find housing.
         It is anticipated that some of Carmel’s college students attend CSUMB and MIIS,
         while others may commute to UC Santa Cruz or attend other universities or
         colleges located in the region.
A.5 Affordable Housing
A.5.1 Affordable Housing Inventory
         As of 2015, a total of 59 units provided affordable housing through a variety of
         local programs (Table A-22: Inventory of Assisted Rental Housing). Each of these
         projects serves as an example of the methods and incentives used by the City to
         achieve production of affordable housing units.

                                                                         Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
       Oliver White Building and Viejo Carmel
       In 1987, the City granted a use permit to the private property owner of a small site
       (4,000 sq. ft.) known as the Oliver White Building (Dolores northeast of Eighth).
       This permit authorized the construction of a mixed-use development with four
       residential units in the Residential and Limited Commercial (RC) District.
       Originally this site was developed with a single-story commercial building. The
       owner and the City worked together through the permit process to achieve a
       second story of residential apartments at a density of 44 units per acre. Since the
       project exceeded the base density of 33 units per acre, the applicant was required
       to provide one moderate-cost rental unit. As part of the conditions of approval, the
       City did not permit the affordable unit to be converted to above-market-rate
       housing.
       The Viejo Carmel project (northwest corner of Junipero and Fourth Avenues) is a
       large example of infill development that provides affordable housing. This 20,000-
       square-foot site was occupied by semi-industrial uses and offices (welding shop,
       repair services, contractor’s office, etc.). The City approved permits authorizing
       the site to be razed and redeveloped with ten condominiums and ten apartments
       at a density of 44 units per acre. Without density bonuses, the site could only
       achieve 15 residential units. With density bonuses, the developer gained three
       additional market rate units in exchange for providing 2 apartments reserved for
       low-income households. In addition to the density bonus, the City reduced the
       parking requirement for the low-income housing units. The applicant was required
       to preserve in perpetuity two rental units for low-income households
       Norton Court Apartments
       In 1986, the City adopted a Specific Plan for Norton Court and granted a use
       permit to the Carmel Foundation (a key non-profit community organization for
       seniors) to construct Norton Court Apartments for seniors. As part of this
       development, the City entered into a 50-year agreement to lease the property for
       one dollar per year to the Carmel Foundation. This amounts to a substantial land
       subsidy provided by the City that offsets part of the cost of developing housing.
       While the Specific Plan does require all the units to be occupied by seniors it did
       not specify that the units be restricted as low- and moderate-income housing.
       Rents are maintained as affordable to lower-income seniors strictly through private
       donations raised by the Carmel Foundation. No direct public funding is involved.
       Trevett and Hazeltine Courts
       Trevett and Hazeltine Courts were developed with funding from the Carmel
       Foundation. Rents are maintained as affordable to lower-income seniors with
       private donations raised by the Carmel Foundation. No public funding is involved.
       San Carlos Lodge
       This site, located on San Carlos Street north of Fifth Avenue, was granted a use
       permit for a major addition and allowing the conversion of some existing
       apartments to transient motel units. As a condition of permit approval, the
       applicant retained two of the existing apartments as affordable housing for

            The City is required by the California Coastal Act to track information regarding
            affordable housing units within the coastal zone. This analysis must include:
                        • The number of housing units approved for construction after January
                              1, 1982;
                        • The number of units for persons and families of low and moderate
                              income that have been required to be included in new housing
                              developments within three miles of the coastal zone;
                        • The number of existing units occupied by low- or moderate-income
                              residents; and
                        • The number of low- and moderate-income residential units that have
                              been replaced, demolished or converted.
         The City’s housing stock is entirely located within three miles of the coastal zone.
         As shown in Table A-22: Inventory of Assisted Rental Housing, the City has a total
         of 64 affordable housing units, all constructed after 1982. No affordable housing
         units have been replaced, demolished or converted.

A.5.2 Potential Loss of Assisted Housing Units
       Housing units developed with public subsidies are an important source of
       affordable housing to lower-income households.                  Preserving the long-term
       affordability of such housing units is the most cost-effective means for providing
       decent and affordable housing to lower-income households in a community.
       Recognizing this important resource, State Housing Element law requires that a
       jurisdiction examine the potential loss of publicly subsidized multi-family rental
       housing for lower-income households due to expiration of deed restrictions,
       affordability covenants, and/or subsidy contracts.
       Norton Court, Trevett Court, and Hazeltine Court are owned and operated by the
       Carmel Foundation, a non-profit organization which does not intend to convert the
       units to market rate housing within this Housing Element cycle. Trevett Court and
       Hazeltine Court did not receive any public assistance and have no deed
       restrictions or affordability covenants. While Norton Court receives a subsidized
       property lease, no use restriction was ever placed on the property to maintain the
       units as affordable housing. Units in the Oliver White Building, Viejo Carmel, and
       San Carlos Lodge are restricted as affordable housing in perpetuity. Therefore, no
       housing in Carmel-by-the-Sea that meets the State’s definitions of affordable
       housing are at-risk of losing affordability controls over the next ten years.

B      CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION
       Market, governmental, infrastructure, and environmental factors may constrain the
       provision of adequate and affordable housing. These constraints may result in
       housing that is not affordable to lower- and moderate-income households, or may
       render residential construction economically infeasible for developers.
B.1 Governmental Constraints
       Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and
       in particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site
       improvement requirements, fees and exactions, and permit processing procedures
       may present constraints to the maintenance, development and improvement of
       housing. This section discusses potential governmental constraints in Carmel-by-
       the-Sea.
B.1.1 Land Use Controls
       The Land Use Element of the Carmel-by-the-Sea General Plan sets forth policies
       for development Citywide, including residential development. These land use
       policies, coupled with zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of
       land for different uses. Housing supply and costs are affected by the amount of
       land designated for residential use, the density at which residential development is
       permitted, and the standards that govern the character of development.

         General Plan
         Every city in California is required to have a General Plan, which establishes its
         goals and policies for land use and development. The General Plan is the
         foundation of all land use controls in a jurisdiction. The Land Use Element of the
         General Plan identifies the location, distribution and density of the land uses within
         the City. Residential densities are expressed in dwelling units per acre (du/ac).
         The Carmel-by-the-Sea General Plan identifies two residential land use
         designations and two designations that include both commercial and residential
         uses. Table B-1: General Plan Residential Land Use Designations summarizes
         Carmel-by-the-Sea’s residential land use designations and their associated
         acreages and density ranges.

         Depending on land costs, certain densities are needed to make a housing project
         economically feasible for people at various income levels.
         In 2004, Assembly Bill (AB) 2348 established “default” density standards. If a local
         government has adopted density standards consistent with the established
         population criteria, sites with those density standards are accepted as appropriate
         for accommodating the jurisdiction’s share of regional housing need for lower-
         income households. For jurisdictions such as Carmel-by-the-Sea in suburban
         counties, the “default” density is 20 dwelling units per acre.
         Zoning Code
         The Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. It is
         designed to protect and promote public health, safety and welfare, as well as to
         promote quality design and quality of life. The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea’s
         residential zoning designations control both the use and development standards of
         each residential parcel, thereby influencing the development of housing.

       The Carmel-by-the-Sea Zoning Code provides for a variety of residential
       development types. Table B-2: Residential Land Use Controls summarizes the
       zoning districts that permit by-right residential development or residential
       development subject to a conditional use permit.

       The City has adopted a Subordinate Unit Ordinance that allows second units to be
       built in the R-1 district. Two classes of new subordinate units can be constructed.
       Class 3 subordinate units are designed to facilitate the housing needs of persons
       with disabilities who find it necessary to live with or near a companion, but where
       separate, self-contained facilities are important to both parties.                                           Class 4
       subordinate units are established to provide affordable housing to low- or very-low-
       income households as defined by California statutes. (Class 1 and Class 2
       subordinate units apply to 271 existing units that pre-dated adoption of the
       ordinance).
B.1.2 Residential Development Standards
       The largest zoning district in the City is the Single-Family Residential (R-1) District.
       Approximately half of the parcels in this zone are 4,000-square-foot lots. The
       remaining lots reflect a wide diversity of larger sizes. The Zoning Code
       establishes the maximum amount of residential floor area that can be developed
       on a single-family lot. For the typical 4,000 square foot lot, the maximum above-
       ground floor area with garage is 1,800 square feet with maximum site coverage of
       2,400 square feet. Additional floor space is allowed in basements through an
       incentive program. For parcels over 4,000 square feet in area, the City uses a
       sliding scale to determine maximum floor area and site coverage. Housing units
       within this district may contain up to two stories, plus a basement. The maximum
       roof height of buildings is 18 feet for a single-story unit and 24 feet for a two-story
       unit. Front and rear yard setbacks are generally established at 15 feet. A variety
       of side yard setback combinations can be used to ensure that at no point will any
       structure occupy more than 75 percent of the lot width.

Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
         Carmel’s Zoning Code also allows for development of multi-family dwelling units.
         The R-4 District allows apartments and attached housing at a base density of up to
         33 units per acre, and up to 44 units per acre when affordable housing is provided.
         Residential uses are also allowed within each of the City’s commercial land use
         districts at a maximum density of 33 units per acre, with a bonus density of up to
         44 units per acre when a development includes affordable housing. Buildings
         within this district may have up to two stories plus an underground garage.
         Floor area bonuses of five to ten percent may be granted to projects that include
         permanent apartments reserved for senior citizens and/or low- or very-low-income
         households. Sites abutting or across the street from an R-4 or RC district require
         at least a five-foot front yard setback, while sites abutting or across from the R-1
         district require a front yard setback of 7.5 feet. Sites abutting an R-1 or R-4 district
         require a rear setback of 10 feet. Sites in other locations do not require a rear
         setback. Buildings within this district may have up to two stories plus an
         underground garage.

         8,000 square feet or less in area and two parking spaces per dwelling on sites
         larger than 8,000 square feet in area. One parking space must also be provided
         for each guesthouse. Requirements for other districts are listed below in Table B-

B.2 Provisions for a Variety of Housing
         Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify sites to be made
         available through appropriate zoning and implement development standards to
         encourage and facilitate the development of housing for all economic segments of
         the community.                   This includes single-family homes, multi-family housing,
         manufactured housing, transitional and supportive housing, farm worker housing,
         and emergency shelters.
         Table B-4: Residential Uses Permitted in Major Zones summarizes the housing
         types permitted by-right, conditionally permitted or prohibited in the City by zone.
         In addition to single-family and multifamily houses, the City also permits or
         conditionally permits subordinate units, senior citizen housing, community care
         facilities, community social service facilities, residential care facilities, and
         transitional and supportive housing in many of the residential and non-residential
         zones. The City permits mobile homes as a single-family residential use, subject
         only to the design review requirements as any other single-family residential use in
         the same zone.
         A conditional use permit is required for multi-family projects with densities greater
         than 22 du/ac. The conditional use permit review process is concurrent with the
         City’s design review process so no additional time is needed. The following
         standard findings are required for all conditional use permits:

                                                                     Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
         • That the proposed use will not be in conflict with the City’s General Plan.
         • That the proposed use will comply with all zoning standards applicable to the
              use and zoning district.
         • That granting the use permit will not set a precedent for the approval of similar
              uses whose incremental effect will be detrimental to the City, or will be in
              conflict with the General Plan.
         • That the proposed use will not make excessive demands on the provision of
              public services, including water supply, sewer capacity, energy supply,
              communication facilities, police protection, and fire protection.
         • That the proposed use will not be injurious to public health, safety or welfare.
         • That the proposed use will be compatible with surrounding land uses and will
              not conflict with the purpose established for the district within which it will be
              located.
         • That the proposed use will not generate adverse impacts affecting health,
              safety, or welfare of neighboring properties or uses.
       Based on the number of projects that have been approved with densities above 22
       du/ac (see Section A.5.1. Affordable Housing Inventory), the City has not found the
       conditional use requirement to negatively impact the cost or supply of multi-family
       housing. The conditional use permit allows the City to permit development of
       higher-density multi-family projects while ensuring negative impacts to the
       surrounding neighborhood are minimized or eliminated.

                                                                    Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
B.2.1 Facilitating Special Needs Housing
       Carmel-by-the-Sea has adopted policies to proactively facilitate and encourage
       special needs housing throughout the community. These policies are designed to
       ensure that all persons have the opportunity to find suitable housing. The
       following details provisions of the Zoning Code allowing for special needs housing.
       Agricultural/Farm Workers Housing
       The City does not have any land zoned for agriculture or housing exclusively for
       farmworkers. However, recent Census data estimated that only 12 residents of
       Carmel-by-the-Sea were employed in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations.
       Therefore, no specific policy or program is currently needed to address farm
       worker housing.
       Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
       Emergency shelters for the homeless is defined as a residential facility, lodging
       house, or dwelling, where no rent is paid, that provides temporary accommodation
       to homeless persons and/or families. Pursuant to State law (SB 2), jurisdictions
       with an unmet need for emergency shelters are required to identify a zone(s)
       where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without a conditional
       use permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone must have sufficient
       capacity to accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity for
       at least one year-round shelter. Permit processing, development and management
       standards for emergency shelters must be objective and facilitate the development
       of, or conversion to, emergency shelters.
       As described in Appendix A - Needs Assessment, the Police Department
       estimates there are three transient residents in the City. There are no emergency
       shelters located in the City. However, the Zoning Code allows siting of emergency
       shelters as community social service facilities, which are defined as “Any
       noncommercial housing facility, such as homeless shelters or emergency shelters,
       which may also provide meals, showers, and/or laundry facilities. Specialized
       programs and services related to the needs of the residents may also be provided.
       This classification excludes transitional housing facilities that provide long-term
       living accommodations.” Community social service facilities are permitted by-right
       in the CC, SC, and RC districts as well as with a CUP in the R-1 and R-4 districts.
       In addition, shelters for families and single women with children are permitted at all
       churches in the community as a part of their social outreach functions. Religious
       facilities are conditionally permitted in the R-1 district (only on existing quasi-public
       use sites established prior to December 1, 1980, or added as an accessory use to
       such existing uses) and allowed with a conditional use permit (CUP) in the RC
       district.
       The Zoning Code allows supportive and transitional housing subject only to the
       same standards and procedures as apply to other dwellings of the same type in
       the same zone consistent with the provisions of SB 2.

         Senior Housing
         Senior Housing refers to housing provided for senior citizens as defined by the
         State of California. Senior housing is permitted in the CC, SC, RC and R4 districts
         and permitted by CUP in the R-1 district.
         Community Care Facilities
         Community care facilities refers to facilities providing non-medical care and
         supervision under license from the California Department of Social Services. This
         classification excludes hospitals, residential care facilities, family day care homes,
         day care centers, and transitional housing. Community care facilities are permitted
         in the CC, SC, and RC districts as well as by CUP in the R-4 district.
         Residential Care Facilities
         Residential care facilities include facilities that are licensed by the State of
         California to provide living accommodations and 24-hour, primarily non-medical
         care and supervision for persons in need of personal services, supervision,
         protection, or assistance. Living accommodations are shared living quarters with
         or without separate kitchens or bathrooms for each room or unit.                     This
         classification includes facilities that are operated for profit as well as those
         operated by public or nonprofit institutions.
         Residential care facilities include three subgroups discussed below.
         General
         “General” refers to a residential care facility providing 24-hour non-medical care for
         more than six persons in need of personal services, supervision, protection, or
         assistance. This classification includes hospices, board and care homes, and
         similar establishments that are licensed by the State of California. General
         residential care facilities are permitted with a CUP in the CC and RC districts.
         Limited
         “Limited” refers to a residential care facility providing 24-hour non-medical care for
         six or fewer persons in need of personal services, supervision, protection, or
         assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living. This classification
         includes only those facilities licensed for residential care by the State of California.
         Limited residential care facilities are permitted subject to the same standards as
         apply to other dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
         Senior
         “Senior” refers to a residential care facility providing 24-hour medical or non-
         medical care for more than six persons 60 years of age or older in need of
         personal services, supervision, protection, or assistance for sustaining the
         activities of daily living. This classification includes nursing homes for the elderly,
         life care or continuing care homes, and similar facilities licensed for residential
         care by the State of California. Senior residential care facilities are permitted with
         a CUP in the SC, RC, and R-4 districts.

                                                                      Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
       Single-Room Occupancy
       The City’s Zoning Code does not explicitly define single room occupancy housing,
       although section 17.8.5(E) allows multifamily units as small as 400 square feet.
       The Code also requires that all multifamily projects of three or more units include a
       mix of unit sizes, and at least 25 percent of all units are required to be 400 to 650
       square feet in size.
       Group Homes
       The Zoning Code defines group residential as “Shared living quarters without
       separate kitchens or bathrooms for each room or unit, including boardinghouses,
       dormitories, and private residential clubs, but excluding guesthouses.” As
       described above, state-licensed group homes are permitted under the regulations
       for Community Care Facilities and Residential Care Facilities. Unlicensed group
       homes are not currently identified as a permitted use in any zoning district.
       Program 3-5.4.b includes a commitment to process a Zoning Code amendment to
       identify appropriate locations and standards for unlicensed group homes.
       Manufactured Housing
       Pursuant to State law, the City allows manufactured housing on a permanent
       foundation in all residential zones. Such housing is subject to the same
       development standards and design review criteria as wood-frame housing.
       Housing for Persons with Disabilities
       The U.S. Census Bureau defines persons with disabilities as those with a long-
       lasting physical, mental or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult
       for a person to perform certain activities such as seeing, hearing, talking, walking,
       climbing stairs, lifting or carrying, or difficulty with certain social functions. This
       condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone
       or to work at a job or business.
                   Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
       Council Policy C11-01 establishes procedures for providing reasonable
       accommodation in the application of zoning and building regulations for persons
       with disabilities in conformance with state law.
                   Zoning Regulations
       The City has not identified any zoning or other land-use regulations that could
       discriminate against persons with disabilities or impede the availability of such
       housing for these individuals.
       Examples of the ways in which the City facilitates housing for persons with
       disabilities through its regulatory and permitting procedures are:
                      As discussed above, the City Zoning Code allows residential care
                       facilities for six or fewer persons subject to the same standards and
                       procedures as apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in
                       the same zone.

Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
                            The City has also adopted reduced parking requirements (0.33-space
                             per unit or bed) for Senior Housing, Cooperative Housing, Group Care
                             Facilities, Nursing Homes and Other Residential Care Facilities.
                             Retrofitting of dwellings to meet the needs of persons with disabilities
                             is also an eligible activity under the City’s Housing Rehabilitation
                             Program. Construction and rehabilitation activities are also subject to
                             the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act requirements and the City
                             is active in promoting ADA compliance.
                            The City defines family as “an individual or two or more persons living
                             together as a single nonprofit housekeeping unit and sharing common
                             living, sleeping, cooking, and eating facilities,” which is consistent with
                             State law.
B.2.2 Flexible Development Standards
         Carmel-by-the-Sea’s Zoning Code includes provisions for flexible development
         standards. This flexibility can be an important means to address important goals
         and objectives of the City, such as providing affordable housing for all income
         groups.
         Mixed-Use Development
         The R-4, CC, SC, and RC zoning districts allow for residential development in
         conjunction with office and/or commercial uses; otherwise known as mixed-use
         development. This form of development has been used successfully to combine
         apartments with retail and offices throughout Carmel’s downtown area.
         Subordinate Units
         The Zoning Ordinance implements State law by providing guidelines for provision
         of second units on single-family lots as a source of affordable housing while
         preserving the existing residential character of the neighborhood. Subordinate
         units are allowed on lots of 8,000 square feet and larger. Owners of lots
         developed with both a primary dwelling and a subordinate unit can live in either
         unit or can rent both units. Program 3-5.3.c includes the review of current
         subordinate unit regulations to evaluate whether changes are needed to better
         facilitate the production of additional units.
         Reduced Parking Requirements
         The City provides five options for meeting parking requirements: (1) on-site
         surface parking; (2) on-site underground parking; (3) off-site parking if surplus
         parking on some nearby site is dedicated to a development project; (4) payment of
         fees in-lieu of parking if site conditions make on-site parking difficult; and (5)
         shared parking for mixed-use projects. In addition, the City requires 0.5 spaces
         per unit for affordable housing compared with 1 to 1.5 spaces per unit for market-
         rate units.
         In summary, the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea provides flexible tools in its Zoning
         Code to facilitate and encourage infill development and housing opportunities in
         single-family, multi-family, and commercial zones. These tools can be used to
         help reduce the cost of housing.

                                                                    Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
B.2.3 Programs to Achieve Housing Affordability
       Carmel-by the Sea provides several tools to encourage the production of
       affordable housing. These programs help achieve diversity and balance of
       housing types that are affordable to all economic segments of the community. The
       primary tools Carmel uses to ensure affordable housing are:
       Density Bonus Program
       The City has adopted a 33 percent density bonus for projects that include
       affordable housing units.
       For residential projects at densities between 33 and 44 units the Zoning Code
       requires that at least one of the following three standards be met:
                   At least 20 percent of all units on the site will be used as housing for
                    “lower-income households;” or
                   At least 10 percent of all units on the site will be used as housing for
                    “very low-income households;” or
                   At least 50 percent of all dwellings units on the site will be used as
                    housing for “senior citizens” as established in California Housing
                    Statutes.
       Due to lack of water, the City has processed very few multi-family projects over the
       past five years. However, most of the projects the City has approved in recent
       years have included affordable units to qualify for a density bonus. While there
       have been no significant problems in implementation, certain aspects of the
       program may not encourage the development of very low-income units as well as
       low-income units, which may conflict with the intent of State law. The last update
       to the Housing Element provided a program that would reflect the provisions and
       intent of State law by altering the way that density bonus units are calculated.
       However, this program was not implemented. Therefore, the fractions of units
       continue to be rounded down, creating disparities between lots of different sizes.
       A Zoning Code amendment is being processed concurrently with adoption of this
       Housing Element to revise the City’s density bonus regulations consistent with
       state law.
       Mixed-Use Development Floor Area Bonuses
       The Zoning Code provides for floor area bonuses for mixed-use projects in all
       commercial districts and the R-4 district that include housing for lower-income
       households.       Table B-5: Affordable Housing Bonuses summarizes the
       requirements and bonuses awarded to projects based on affordability level.

                                                        At least 20 percent of units   Up to 10 percent
                Low Income

                                                        At least 10 percent of units   Up to 15 percent
                Very Low Income
                                                       reserved for very low income
                Notes:
                1 The Zoning Code uses AMBAG’s definitions of the income levels.
                Source: City of Carmel-by-the-Sea Zoning Code, 2015.
         Reduced Development Fees
         The City’s fee schedule discounts planning and building fees proportional to the
         percentage of the development devoted to affordable units. For example, a project
         including ten percent affordable units, receives a ten percent discount on
         development fees.
         Expedited Permit Processing
         Little backlog exists in the City's development review process. However, the City
         moves projects with affordable housing ahead of other projects in the development
         processing queue when setting development review agendas. Due to Permit
         Streamlining law, this incentive is less powerful than it once was. However, it may
         reduce review time by as much as a month. Even this minor benefit attracts
         developer attention during pre-application meetings.                                Projects that include
         affordable housing are also expedited through the plan check process.
         Reduced Parking Requirements for Affordable Housing
         The City has adopted a reduced parking requirement for developments that
         include affordable housing (refer to Table B-3: Parking Standards). Parking costs
         contribute significantly to the cost of development in Carmel-by-the-Sea and this
         flexibility often makes affordable housing more feasible.
         The combined effect of programs in the Carmel-by-the-Sea Zoning Code facilitates
         the production of affordable housing and encourages developers to include
         affordable units in new development projects.
B.3 Building Codes and Enforcement
         Building and safety codes are adopted to preserve public health and safety, and
         ensure the construction of safe and decent housing. These codes and standards
         also have the potential to increase the cost of housing construction or
         maintenance.

                                                           City of Carmel-by-the-Sea 2015-2023 Housing Element
                                                                     Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
B.3.1 Building Codes
       Carmel-by-the-Sea has adopted the 2013 California Building Codes, which
       establish construction standards for all residential buildings. The Building Codes
       are designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The City amends the
       Building Codes as needed to further define requirements based on unique local
       conditions.
       The City’s adopted amendments to the 2013 California Building Code provide for
       the following:
                   In cases where structures are abandoned, they will be abated in the
                    interests of public health, safety and welfare. A building or structure is
                    deemed abandoned if such damaged building or structure is unusable
                    for any permitted use as it existed prior to damage, for four
                    consecutive months.
                   Buildings or structures relocated or moved within the City limits do not
                    need to comply with the requirements of a new building.
                   A certification of occupancy cannot be issued until the driveway,
                    approach, planning, zoning and Fire Department requirements have
                    been completed and approved.
                   Openings in Exterior Walls located opposite the following groups and
                    commercial zones are not permitted if there is less than 3 feet from
                    the property boundary (Group A, E, I, B, M, and R) and protected
                    (Group A, E, I, B, and M) if that distance is less than 6 feet.
                    (“Protected” openings mean wire glass non-operable windows and
                    solid core one and three-quarter-inch rated self-closing fire doors.
                   When there is a change in ownership of any Group R, Division 3
                    occupancy (dwellings and lodging houses), a smoke detector
                    installation is required.
                   For all buildings in the City, any new roof covering, or any roof
                    covering in the event of re-roofing of 25 percent or more of any
                    existing roof, is required to be of a fire-retardant material.
                   All sites where grading and/or excavation are conducted are required
                    to adhere to the latest edition of the California Building Code. In
                    addition, the following requirements have to be met:
                                 o   When the fill or excavation exceeds 50 cubic yards a
                                     bond of $1,000 has to be obtained to ensure the public
                                     way and property is maintained clear and in a clean
                                     manner.
                                 o   Tree protection, drainage and erosion controls are
                                     required to be in place prior to, and during, all work,
                                     until completion of the project.

Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
         Code compliance is a division of the Community Planning and Building
         Department and is managed by the Planning Director. The City employs two part-
         time code compliance officers who make a proactive effort to educate property
         owners and local contractors on the City’s regulations. In addition, code
         compliance officers operate on a reactive basis. When a violation on a property is
         either reported or discovered, a violation notice is sent to the property owner. The
         property owner is given the option to apply for a permit, if applicable, to correct the
         violation or to remove the violation.
         Based on its analysis, the City finds that the adopted Building Code and Zoning
         Code enforcement activities are not constraints to the development, maintenance
         or preservation of housing.
B.3.2 Americans with Disabilities Act
         The Fair Housing Act of 1998 (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
         are federal laws intended to assist in providing safe and accessible housing. ADA
         provisions include requirements for a minimum percentage of units in new
         developments to be fully accessible for persons with physical disabilities.
         Compliance with these regulations may increase the cost of housing construction
         as well as the cost of rehabilitating older units, which may be required to comply
         with current codes. However, the enforcement of ADA requirements is not at the
         discretion of the City, but is mandated under federal law.
B.4 Planning and Development Fees
B.4.1 Planning Fees
         The City charges fees and assessments to cover the costs of processing permits.
         Table B-6: Typical Residential Planning Fees summarizes these costs. The City
         does not charge any development impact fees.

       Table B-7: Typical Total Planning, Development and Impact Fees summarizes the
       costs for a typical single-family project, small multi-family project and large multi-
       family project. The single-family and small multi-family project fees are based on
       recent projects that are typical examples of the size and scale of projects in
       Carmel. The single-family fees assume demolition of an existing unit and
       construction of a 1,800-square-foot house. The small multi-family fees assume
       conversion of a second floor commercial space to two residential condos. The
       large multi-family project is based on demolition of a 9-unit building and
       replacement with a 14-unit building with a total of 8,700 square feet and a
       underground garage. This larger project is less common in Carmel.

B.5 Local Processing and Permit Procedures
       Given the water constraints and lack of vacant land, proposals for development in
       the City, particularly for residential development, have been limited. Therefore, the
       local processing time is not delayed by backlog. Typically, the City's processing
       time is approximately three to four months for the development of a single-family
       home and six to eight months for a multi-family or mixed-use development, which
       includes projects requiring design studies, use permits, or coastal development
       permits. Table B-8: Review/Approval Requirements and Processing Times
       summarizes the types of permits the City requires for various types of projects and
       the typical time required for permit review and approval.

         A preliminary site assessment (PSA) for the property on which the project will
         occur is required prior to application submittal. The PSA is prepared by the City
         Forester and Planning staff and identifies the opportunities and constraints of the
         site. By designing a project that responds to the PSA, the applicant has the
         opportunity to expedite the application process by mitigating potential project
         impacts prior to submitting an application.
         New residential development requires approval of a Design Study. A Use Permit
         and Coastal Development Permit (CDP) may also be required and are processed
         concurrently with the Design Study.
         Design Study applications are required to achieve consistency with residential
         zoning standards and are evaluated using the City’s Residential Design
         Guidelines. Early in the development review process, the City makes available to
         applicants the Residential Design Guidelines as codified in the Zoning Code, a list
         of required application materials, applicable zoning standards, and a list of
         required findings for approval. These materials clearly delineate the standards and
         guidelines by which each project is measured. As explained in the Design
         Guidelines, the primary purpose of the design review process is to ensure that

       projects enhance and maintain the City's residential village character. The
       following are examples of issues considered during the Design Review process:
                   Site and building design with respect to topography, vegetation, public
                    and private views, site drainage and erosion, and solar access;
                   Compatibility with adjacent uses in terms of bulk, scale, massing,
                    architecture, and privacy; and
                   Landscaping that is drought tolerant, consistent with the neighborhood
                    character, and consistent with the City's Urbanized Forest objectives.
       A Track 2 Design Study requires two hearings: Concept Review and Final Review.
       At Concept Review, the reviewing body analyzes the project in terms of its impact
       on the urban forest; neighborhood character; topography; open space; privacy,
       views, light and air; parking and access; and building mass and scale. The Final
       Review measures the project’s consistency with the building and landscape design
       guidelines. Required findings and standard conditions are attached to each Design
       Study approval. A volume study is also required, which is completed by one of the
       City’s consulting architects. The study begins after the Concept Review phase and
       typically takes two weeks to complete. The Track 2 Design Study application
       requires at least two to three months to process. Track 2 Design Study is a
       discretionary review process for projects that require a public hearing. Projects that
       require a Track 2 Design Study, demolition permit, use permit, variance, or other
       land use permit or environmental review are reviewed by the Planning
       Commission. All Track 2 projects are subject to the coastal development permit
       requirements of the certified LCP, and a Track 2 Design Study approval
       constitutes a coastal development permit. All Track 2 projects require public notice
       and a hearing.
       A Use Permit or CDP requires review by the Planning Commission. These permit
       applications are processed concurrently with the Design Study and do not add to
       the total process timeframe. Additional findings are required for approval of a Use
       Permit and CDP, including consistency with General Plan and Local Coastal Plan
       policies. These required findings are listed in the Zoning Code and focus on
       physical design, configuration, bulk, architecture, placement on the lot, impacts on
       trees, compatibility with the size and scale of surrounding buildings, etc. and do
       not consider the use itself.
       The City has adopted a Local Coastal Program/Land Use Plan (LCP) that sets
       goals and policies for development within the Coastal Zone. The California
       Coastal Commission has certified that the LCP meets the coastal zone
       requirements, which enables the City to issue Coastal Development Permits. This
       allows the City to process projects more quickly than would occur with Coastal
       Commission review.
       The permit processing and approval process may increase the cost of
       development.      To reduce constraints to the production, maintenance and
       improvement of housing, the City uses expedited review for projects that include

         affordable housing units and offers incentives such as and reduced planning fees
         to offset costs.
B.5.1 Environmental Review Process
         State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects
         (e.g., subdivision maps, use permits, etc.). Costs resulting from fees charged by
         local government and private consultants needed to complete the environmental
         analysis, and from delays caused by the mandated public review periods, are also
         added to the cost of housing and passed on to the consumer. However, the
         presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure
         environmental safety to residents of Carmel-by-the-Sea.
B.6       Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
B.6.1 Environmental Constraints
         Environmental constraints affecting housing include geologic and seismic
         conditions and fire hazards, which are a threat to the built environment. However,
         the primary environmental constraint to the development of housing in Carmel-by-
         the-Sea is the limited water supply. These constraints are discussed in detail
         below.
         Fire Hazard
         Carmel-by-the-Sea is often referred to as
         a “Village in the Forest,” due to its
         extensive urban forest. The high density
         of structures within the Carmel residential
         areas and business district among
         numerous trees increase the fire hazard.
         In addition, the Pescadero Canyon, Del
         Monte Forest, and Mission Trails Park
         located adjacent to the City, introduces
         the possibility of a wildland fire. The
         California Department of Forestry and Fire
         Protection Fire Hazard Severity Zone
         Local Responsibility Areas (LRA) map for
         Carmel-by-the-Sea, identifies a large area
         encompassing northern and eastern
         portions of the City as a Very High Fire
         Hazard Severity Zone. In such zones,
         roofs and exterior walls of new buildings
         must be made of noncombustible
         materials.
         The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea is part of a regional coordination effort with other
         Monterey County cities, including Pacific Grove and Monterey. These neighboring
         agencies provide aid to each other on an as-needed basis.

                                                           City of Carmel-by-the-Sea 2015-2023 Housing Element
                                                                     Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
       Geologic and Seismic Hazards
       The entire California Coast and Coast Range area is prone to earthquakes. Based
       on history, the probability of a moderate or high magnitude earthquake occurring in
       the greater Monterey region in the next few decades is quite likely. Faults that
       could present hazards to Carmel-by-the-Sea during an earthquake event include
       the following active or potentially active faults: San Andreas, San Gregorio-Palo
       Colorado, Chupines, Navy, and Cypress Point. The San Andreas and San
       Gregorio faults are two dominant faults within the Monterey County region that are
       considered active with evidence of historic or recent movement.
       While the seismic hazards cannot be eliminated, there are a number of regulations
       that reduce the impact of these hazards. The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
       Zoning Act was passed in 1972 to mitigate the hazard of surface faulting to
       structures for human occupancy, by preventing the construction of buildings used
       for human occupancy on the surface trace of active faults. The California Building
       Code includes provisions associated with engineering design and building
       requirements that address seismic hazards. In addition, the City of Carmel-by-the-
       Sea General Plan includes policies addressing hazards from seismic activity.
B.6.2 Infrastructure Constraints
       Water Supply
       The primary infrastructure constraint to the development of housing in Carmel is
       the lack of water. The lack of an available water supply continues to limit growth in
       Carmel and throughout the Monterey Peninsula region.
       Carmel is under the jurisdiction of the Monterey Peninsula Water Management
       District (MPWMD) and receives its water from the California-American Water
       Company (Cal-Am). The MPWMD has permit authority over the production and
       distribution of all water supplies within the Monterey Peninsula region, and
       allocates water supplies to cities and County areas within its jurisdiction. Water
       service by Cal-Am is constrained by State Water Resources Control Board
       (SWRCB) Order WR 95-10, which determined that approximately 70 percent of
       Cal-Am supply is based on unlawful diversion from the Carmel River. Order 95-10
       requires that any new water supply be used to reduce diversions from the Carmel
       River prior to allowing new users. Furthermore, SWRCB issued a Cease and
       Desist order to Cal-Am in 2008 to further restrict water use, up to an additional 50
       percent, if upheld.
       Since 1993, MPWMD has been given a single, lump-sum supply of Cal-AM water
       to allocate proportionately to the jurisdictions within its boundaries. As of February
       2008, 121 of the 342 acre feet of water remain. Some jurisdictions, like the City of
       Del Rey Oaks, has used up its allocated amount of water, while Carmel-by-the-
       Sea is close to expending its respective allocation.
       There are five projects currently under discussion as options for providing a new
       water supply, including desalination, groundwater replenishment, aquifer storage
       and recovery in the Seaside Basin, and potential expansion of the Los Padres
       Reservoir to meet the existing and future water needs of North Monterey County.
       However, though these water projects may be able to accommodate planned
December 1, 2015                                                                                        Page B-21

Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
         growth, they would not be in place during the current Housing Element planning
         period due to the required technical studies, environmental review, and concurrent
         financing issues.
         With regard to more immediate water supply, there is currently a project proposed
         by the Eastwood Trust that would provide Carmel-by-the-Sea with approximately
         80 acre-feet annually (AFA) of water for potable use. The Eastwood Trust was
         approved to amend its Water Right License (License 13868), which originally
         authorized the diversion up to 0.45 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water from the
         subterranean stream of the Carmel River, for a maximum of 131.8 AFA of water.
         Water was diverted under License 13868 from two wells, and authorized to be
         used for the purpose of irrigation in a place of use consisting of 99 acres of land
         located within the Carmel River watershed on a property known as the
         Eastwood/Odello Ranch, part of the original Coast Ranch. In July 2015, the State
         Water Board split License 13868 into two new licenses: Licenses 13868A and
         13868B. License 13868A authorizes the municipal use of 85.6 acre feet per year
         for existing lots of record within the parts of Cal-Am’s service area that are within
         the Carmel River watershed or the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea. After adjustment for
         system losses, License 13868A will allow a Water Entitlement of 80 AFA. License
         13868B dedicates the remaining portion of the existing water rights to in-stream
         uses.
         On July 3, 2015, the State Water Board certified the final EIR for the project. On
         August 17, 2015, the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District Board
         adopted Ordinance No. 165, establishing a Water Entitlement, which would allow
         Carmel-by-Sea residents to potentially purchase water rights in order to develop
         legal lots of record that are currently vacant. Table 2-2 of the Housing Element
         identifies vacant lots that could potentially be developed with 74 new residential
         dwelling units.
         Although water scarcity and provision of new supply is ultimately beyond the
         control of the City, the City supports efforts by the MPWMD and other agencies to
         expand the water supply and has a representative on both the Technical Advisory
         Committee and the Policy Advisory Committee. The City also cooperated with the
         District in developing projected water demand needs at build-out for use in the
         planning of future water projects.
         In 2009, the City Council passed a resolution which states Carmel-by-the-Sea’s
         support for the Water for Monterey County Coalition and continued collaboration of
         political and quasi-political entities in Monterey. Based on the understanding that
         Monterey Peninsula’s water supply projects require a focused technical and
         political effort to be resolved, the Coalition is set to provide regional projects and
         water management programs that focus on sustainable and cost effective water
         supply solutions.
         State law mandates the prioritizing of water for affordable housing. The City's
         share of water resources is internally allocated to land use categories based on
         policies in the Land Use and Community Character and Housing Elements of the
         General Plan. These policies affirm the City's commitment to housing by
         establishing residential uses (new homes, apartments, and remodeling) as one of

                                                           City of Carmel-by-the-Sea 2015-2023 Housing Element
                                                                     Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
       the highest priorities with the largest water allocation. In particular, existing
       subdivided lots zoned for housing should always be considered "first in line" for
       limited water resources except when this would preclude development of essential
       public services, recreational uses/facilities, or visitor serving uses consistent with
       the Coastal Act. New subdivisions of land are limited until existing subdivided lots
       have a secure water supply. The concept of spreading this limited resource
       across many properties should be retained so that no single project consumes a
       disproportionate share of this limited resource. This will maximize the number of
       units that can be built or approved.
       The City has approximately 3.251 acre-feet of available water, of which
       approximately 1.67 acre-feet are in the City’s reserves. The remaining 0.589 acre-
       feet is only available for affordable housing projects. In the past 5 years the City
       has allocated approximately 0.308 acre-feet to affordable housing projects. This is
       the only water available until the District supplies increase and new allocations are
       made to each city in the District. Based on current supplies, sufficient water may
       not be available to fully accommodate additional development commensurate with
       the City’s total RHNA allocation (31 units). The City will continue to work with local
       and regional agencies to explore options for additional water supplies (see
       Program 3-3.2).
       In addition, the City's Municipal Code includes specific requirements for water
       conservation in existing and new developments such as landscaping, plumbing
       fixtures, irrigation, and the use of free-flowing water conveyances, such as hoses.
       New development projects and existing structures needing a building permit for
       substantial proposed construction must meet the City's water conservation
       requirements.
       Section 3: Goals, Policies and Programs of this Housing Element includes policies
       to continue to prioritize water allocation for affordable housing.
       Wastewater
       The Carmel Area Wastewater District provides sewer service to the City and
       outlying areas including the mouth of the Carmel Valley, Carmel Views, a portion
       of Rancho Rio Vista, Carmel Woods, Mission Fields, Hatton Fields, Quail
       Meadows and a small portion of the Highlands (Highlands Inn, Tickle Pink Inn and
       the Highlands Sanitary Assoc.). It also provides wastewater treatment and
       disposal service, by contract, to the Pebble Beach Community Services District
       and Point Lobos Reserve.
       The District’s facilities consist of approximately 80 miles of gravity sewers,
       interceptors, and force mains, six remote sewage pump stations, and a
       wastewater treatment plant with secondary treatment for ocean discharge and
       tertiary (microfiltration and reverse osmosis) treatment to reclaim water for
       irrigation of golf courses in the Del Monte Forest. The District’s permitted capacity
       is 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD) and their current average daily dry weather
       flow is 1.8 MGD.
       The City is required to plan for additional 31 residential housing units in this
       planning cycle. Based on discussions with the District and the remaining capacity

City of Carmel-by-the-Sea 2015-2023 Housing Element
Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
         of approximately 40 percent, the District has adequate treatment capacity to serve
         these units.
B.7 On-Site and Off-Site Improvements
         Another factor that can add to the cost of new construction is the cost of providing
         adequate infrastructure (major and local streets; water and sewer lines; and street
         lighting) required to be installed in new residential development. Since Carmel-by-
         the-Sea is primarily built-out and future development will primarily occur on in-fill
         sites, the costs associated with developing raw land and improving infrastructure
         systems usually do not arise in the City. Typical infrastructure costs in the CC,
         SC, RC, and R-4 districts are limited to sidewalk, curb, and gutter improvements,
         undergrounding of utility wires, stormwater drainage improvements, and
         landscaping.
         Off-Site Improvements
         The City’s Municipal Code does not contain requirements for subdivision off-site
         improvements. However, the Code includes a chapter on requirements related to
         streets, sidewalks, and public places.
         Sidewalks
         Construction of sidewalks is not required in residential areas of the City. If sidewalk
         construction is proposed, a permit is required. The proposal must show that the
         construction of the sidewalk or walkway will preserve public safety, health or
         welfare, resolve a serious drainage problem, or that it would otherwise benefit the
         general public. The construction of the sidewalk or walkway must follow the natural
         contours of the land, and no less than 50 percent of the sidewalk area in front of
         any building site must be retained in planting. There are no specific requirements
         regarding the width of the sidewalks.
         Driveways
         Construction of a driveway requires a permit from the Department of Community
         Planning and Building in conjunction with the Director of Public Works and the
         Director of Forest, Parks and Beach.
         Landscaping
         Sidewalk street trees are encouraged by the City, with the City Forester
         determining number of trees, species, and exact location. Sidewalk street trees
         should be located near the head of, and adjacent to, parallel parking spaces with
         the trunk of the tree located 4.5 feet back from the head of the parking space. For
         trees at the curb line there should be at least four feet between the trunk and the
         facing building or planters in front of the building. All tree planters are encouraged
         to be as large as possible so that additional landscaping can be incorporated into
         the planters.
         The City also encourages including “mini-parks”, which is a park that protrudes into
         the street from the curb line or is in the street. The design of mini-parks must be
         consistent with the standards in the Forest and Beach Management Plan. All new

                                                         City of Carmel-by-the-Sea 2015-2023 Housing Element
                                                                   Appendix B: Constraints on Housing Production
       mini-park installations require a review by the Staff Traffic Committee and approval
       by the Planning Commission.
       Streets
       The streets in Carmel are narrow in width, 26 to 34 feet, with no gutters or
       sidewalks. This lack of formal development of streets throughout Carmel (with the
       exception of some of the downtown thoroughfares) has been a conscious effort on
       the part of residents to maintain a “village in a forest” atmosphere. The City has
       not established standardized street widths requirements. As Carmel is a built-out
       city and new development will occur as infill or redevelopment on parcels within
       the established street grid, construction of new streets is not anticipated.
       Therefore, street standards will have no impact on the cost and supply of housing.
B.8 Non-Governmental Constraints
       Land costs, construction costs, and market financing contribute to the cost of
       housing reinvestment, and can potentially hinder the production of new affordable
       housing. Although many constraints are driven by market forces beyond the City’s
       control, Carmel retains some leverage in instituting policies and programs to
       address the constraints.
B.8.1 Land and Construction Costs
       Land costs in Carmel-by-the-Sea are elevated due to the high demand for
       housing, lack of vacant land, and shortage of water for development. The location
       of a parcel has a significant impact on its value. As a result, land costs in the
       community vary significantly depending on location, especially proximity to the
       coast. City policies have no effect on land cost. As of October 2015, a vacant
       0.09-acre R-1 lot was listed for sale (Carpenter Street/6th Avenue) at a price of
       $529,000.
       Another major cost associated with building a new house is the cost of building
       materials and labor, which can comprise up to 50 percent or more of the sales
       price of a home. Construction costs for a typical wood frame single-family house
       is at minimum $175 to $200 per square foot, while custom homes and units with
       extra amenities are higher. Given the high land and construction costs, homes
       built in Carmel-by-the-Sea have been primarily high-end custom homes.
B.8.2 Availability of Mortgage Financing
       The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a
       home. Interest rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions,
       and local governments can do little to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can,
       however, offer interest rate write-downs to extend home purchasing opportunities
       to a broader economic segment of the population. In addition, government insured
       loan programs may be available to reduce down payment requirements.
       Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are
       required to disclose information on the disposition of loan applications and the
       income, gender, and race of loan applicants. This information is available for the
       Salinas Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which encompasses Monterey

         County.            Carmel-by-the-Sea includes Census Tracts 118.01 and 118.02.
         According to the latest available HMDA data (2013), the percentage of home loan
         applications denied in these two tracts combined was 6.7 percent compared to
         18.6 percent for the Salinas MSA as a whole, therefore homebuyers in Carmel-by-
         the-Sea do not appear to experience discrimination in mortgage lending.
         Carmel-by-the-Sea is similar to other communities in California with regard to
         private sector home financing programs. The recent crisis in the mortgage industry
         has affected the availability of real estate loans, although the long-term effects are
         uncertain. For buyers with good credit histories, mortgages can be obtained at
         very favorable interest rates.

C      HOUSING PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS
       In order to develop an effective housing strategy for the 2015-2023 planning
       period, the City must assess the achievements of its existing housing programs.
       With this assessment the City can determine the effectiveness and continued
       appropriateness of the existing programs and make necessary adjustments for the
       next eight years.
C.1 Evaluation of Accomplishments under the Previous Housing Element
       State Housing Element law requires cities to assess the achievements under their
       adopted housing programs as part of the Housing Element update. These results
       are quantified where possible (e.g. the number of units rehabilitated), but may be
       qualitative where necessary (e.g. mitigation of governmental constraints). The
       results are compared with projected or planned goals from the previous Housing
       Element. Where significant shortfalls exist between what was planned and what

         was achieved, the reasons for such differences are discussed and appropriate
         revisions should be made in order to achieve the City’s objectives.
         Carmel-by-the-Sea has established the following goals to guide future policies and
         program actions related to housing:
         Goal G3-1. Preserve the existing housing stock.
         Goal G3-2. Preserve existing residential units and encourage the development of new multi-
                          family housing in the Commercial and R-4 Districts.
         Goal G3-3. Provide adequate sites for the development of a wide range of housing types for
                          all citizens.
         Goal G3-4. Protect the stability of residential neighborhoods by promoting year-round
                          occupancy and neighborhood enhancement.
         Goal G3-5. Preserve and increase the supply of housing for lower- and moderate-income
                          households, senior citizens and other special needs groups. Prohibit
                          discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.
         This section reviews the City’s progress in implementing the housing programs
         since 2010, and their continued appropriateness for the 2015-2023 Housing
         Element. Table C-1: Existing Program Accomplishments summarizes the City’s
         housing accomplishments since 2010 as well as future actions that should be
         taken.

Should the City offer incentives for lot mergers?            Lot mergers can create more viable building sites for
                                                             housing, although incentives would be most effective
                                                             when used where multi-family or affordable units may be
                                                             built.
Is there any surplus City property that could be used for    No City property has been determined to be surplus at
affordable housing?                                          this time, although staff will continue to monitor this
                                                             option.
Does the City require “green” building standards?            Yes, the City has adopted the latest state building codes,
                                                             which include green building techniques for energy and
                                                             water conservation.
Affordable housing is needed for seniors and tourism         Many coastal areas face the problem of low-wage jobs
service workers.                                             and high housing costs. The City has been proactive in
                                                             providing regulations and incentives to encourage the
                                                             production of affordable housing to the extent feasible.
Are there other things the City could do to encourage        Small cities like Carmel don’t have the resources many

                                                             provide affordable units, but small lot sizes, topography
                                                             and other constraints limit the potential number of units.
                                                             The City has regulations that encourage housing in
                                                             commercial zones and could also explore ways to create
                                                             more housing units within existing neighborhoods.
What about water supply?                                     Water supply is a major limiting factor on all types of
                                                             development, and the City is working closely with public
                                                             and private entities to seek additional sources.
Could the City use rent control to create more affordable    Under state law (Costa-Hawkins) there are limitations on
units?                                                       the use of rent control, including landlords’ ability to set
                                                             rents at any level when a unit becomes vacant and

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Introduction and Purpose
The Circulation Element is a required element of the City’s General Plan. Government Code
Section 65302(b) states that a circulation element shall consist of: “…the general location and
extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other
local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.”
The overall purpose of the Circulation Element, as outlined by the State of California General
Plan Guidelines is to:
         Coordinate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses;
         Promote the efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective movement of all
          segments of the population;
         Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities;
         Protect environmental quality; and
         Promote the wise and equitable use of economic and natural resources.
This Element provides goals, objectives and policies that will help to control traffic volume and
reduce traffic congestion in Carmel. Because the City is largely built-out, the focus of these
policies is to maintain a safe environment for vehicle and non-motorized transportation (e.g.
pedestrians and bikes) and encourage alternative modes of transportation to help minimize the
adverse affects associated with single cars. Many of the policies in this Element are also part of
the Local Coastal Land Use Plan and are noted as such (LUP).
This Element also includes supporting information that describes existing traffic volumes, traffic
safety, parking, and alternate modes of transportation as well as findings gathered through the
Community Survey (Survey). The Survey was prepared as part of the public outreach process to
gain a broader response from the community, property owners, and businesses on issues facing
Carmel. The complete Survey report can be found in Appendix A.
Issues of Local Significance
Traffic in the City of Carmel is unique in that it experiences heavy peak periods during weekends
and over the summer when there are a high number of tourist. Many of the visitors can be
considered short-term or “day visitors,” who travel by car from other bay areas to Carmel and the
Monterey Peninsula for the day. This “day visitor” phenomenon often places a burden on
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                          January 2010

Goals, Objectives and Policies
G2-1 Provide and maintain a transportation system and facilities that promotes the orderly and
       safe transportation of people and goods while preserving the residential character and
       village atmosphere of Carmel. (LUP)
       O2-1      Preserve the traditional grid pattern and two-way flow of most streets and ensure
                 that street projects enhance pedestrian circulation in the community while
                 minimizing the impact of motorized vehicles. (LUP)
                  P2-1     Maintain the current street configurations. Maintain or reduce paving
                           widths in the residential areas to maintain safe speeds compatible with
                           pedestrian safety and circulation and to preserve the residential
                           character. Ensure that changes to street configurations do not conflict
                           with emergency vehicle access requirements and/or the requirements
                           of the Emergency Operations Plan. (LUP)

                 P2-2     Continue the City policy of not developing residential streets to full
                          width.
                 P2-3     Prohibit the construction of formal sidewalks and concrete curbs in the
                          R-l district.       Allow informal pedestrian paths and drainage
                          improvements where needed. Control other construction (e.g.,
                          retaining walls, pavement, etc.) in the City’s public rights-of-way.
                          (LUP)
                 P2-4     Implement road maintenance and reconstruction practices that will
                          preserve the hand-made appearance of City streets (e.g. meandering
                          alignments, non-uniform surfaces, variable contours and informal
                          edges). (LUP)
                 P2-5     Continue to restrict street signs and only permit those signs that are
                          necessary and essential for public safety. (LUP)
                 P2-6     Maintain and encourage informal landscaped median strips and natural
                          landscaped areas within public rights-of-way. (LUP)
                 P2-7     Discourage high volume through-traffic. (LUP)
                 P2-8     Prohibit the removal of significant trees within public rights-of-way
                          except when required for health and safety. (LUP)
                 P2-9     Review the traffic patterns on Scenic Road.
                 P2-10    Continue to maintain the designated bus, truck, and bicycle routes as
                          shown on Figure 2.2.
       O2-2     Ensure safety improvements are undertaken in response to the changing travel
                environment.
                 P2-11    Establish a program to collect and evaluate traffic collision data at
                          critical collision locations for automobiles, bicycles, and pedestrians.
                 P2-12    Improve traffic safety by installing and maintaining traffic signs,
                          pavement markings, traffic calming measures such as pedestrian
                          islands, and other pedestrian-friendly features, where necessary.
                          Speed humps may be considered on a limited basis.

       O2-3     Preserve and enhance the qualities that contribute to the residential character of
                the community, including quiet neighborhoods, low levels of illumination, lack
                of nighttime activity, safe environment, pedestrian use of streets, and
                maintenance of property values by mitigating the adverse impacts of high
                volume through-traffic. (LUP)
                 P2-14    Design and construct, where appropriate, roadway improvements
                          which eliminate the adverse impacts of high volume through traffic.
                          (LUP)
                 P2-15    Recognize that the impact of a large number of non-resident vehicles
                          including tourist buses is not consistent with the residential character
                          of Carmel. Mitigate impacts on visual quality, circulation and
                          ambience to the extent possible. (LUP)
                 P2-16    Limit the distribution, character and intensity of land uses that
                          generate increased levels of traffic beyond the capacity of the existing
                          street system.
                 P2-17    Consider ways to improve air quality as part of the review of land use

                 P2-18    Evaluate opportunities to improve parking and congestion near quasi-
                          public land uses in the R-1 District, such as the Forest Theater and the
                          Golden Bough Theater.
       O2-4     Recognize that it is not practical to provide sufficient parking that meets total
                demand at every location; but that it is desirable to provide, where practical,
                alternate parking where it could be removed from public view and in a scale
                appropriate to Carmel. (LUP)
                 P2-19    Benefit to and impact on residents of Carmel-by-the-Sea and its

Supporting Information
Historical Background
The first streets in Carmel were unpaved paths between scattered structures. For many years
after incorporation in 1916 the streets of Carmel remained unpaved although streets were
ultimately developed in accordance with the original City plat as proposed by S.J. Duckworth.
Early photographs of the village reveal Ocean Avenue as an unpaved road extending through
what would become the center of the commercial area. At that time, there was little need for
sophisticated management of a circulation system. Automobile, pedestrian and equestrian traffic
was low in volume and generally meant to serve the residents and the few occasional and
seasonal visitors. During those early years of the twentieth century, gradual growth was
encouraged by local realtors and merchants, but in keeping with a truly village atmosphere;
paved streets, gas and electric service and plumbing were nonexistent. The paving of streets was
considered “destructive” (Orth, 1970).
Regional transportation accompanied settlement of the Monterey Peninsula and the Carmel
Valley area. The original highways were wagon trails. In the 1920s, several years after Carmel's
incorporation, the Monterey Highway (now State Highway 1) was constructed.
In 1931, Ocean Avenue was paved for the first time. Median parking was provided in the now
planted median strip. During the late thirties and early forties, median parking was removed from
Ocean Avenue and by 1968, diagonal parking along both sides of Ocean Avenue was replaced
by parallel parking (Askew, Department of Public Works, 1981). This transition greatly altered
the appearance of Ocean Avenue; its present paved condition is in sharp contrast to the original
unpaved road bisecting the sparsely settled village.
The streets are narrow in width, 26 to 34 feet, with few gutters or sidewalks. This lack of formal
development of streets throughout Carmel (with the exception of some of the downtown
thoroughfares) has been a conscious effort on the part of residents to maintain a “village in a
forest” atmosphere.
Traffic and Circulation Background
Carmel-by-the-Sea is a fully developed community with a distinct “village” character. The
City’s charm along with cultural and recreational amenities attract many visitors to Carmel. As a
developed community with a centralized commercial core surrounded by residential land uses,
Carmel experiences many unique situations relating to traffic, circulation, parking and pedestrian
safety.
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                      January 2010

            General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                  Circulation Element
The City has approximately 30 miles of paved roadway, the majority of which are narrow and
with the exception of some thoroughfares in the downtown commercial district, the streets have
no gutters or sidewalks. This design was intentional, to preserve the small village character
desired by the residents and sought after by visitors. Contributing to the village character, streets
are rarely paved to their full width and often meander around trees and landscaped areas.
Traffic Congestion/Circulation Patterns
The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea traffic volumes are somewhat variable, depending upon the
season, day of the week, or even time of the day. In summer and on most weekends throughout
the year large numbers of tourists and smaller numbers of employees cause traffic volumes to
increase on the major thoroughfares, particularly on Ocean Avenue.
Traffic Volumes
Table 2.1: Traffic Volumes on Selected Carmel Streets, provides traffic counts for various
locations within the City, including areas within the commercial district, beach, and truck route.
The traffic counts were performed during the months of June and July to record the highest
traffic volumes experienced in the City.
As shown in Table 2.1: Traffic Volumes on Selected Carmel Streets and Figure 2.1: Traffic
Counts, the highest volumes were recorded along the truck route (Carpenter Street, Junipero
Avenue, and Rio Road) and Ocean Avenue. These roadways act as gateways into central Carmel
and the Pebble Beach gate located on San Antonio Street and are the principal roadways within
the City. In addition, traffic volumes on Ocean Avenue are partly due to motorists who make a
scenic loop through Carmel by driving down Ocean Avenue to the beach, turning southbound
onto Scenic Road and exiting on Santa Lucia Avenue/Rio Road back to Highway 1.

                     The reduction in daily traffic volume at the Carpenter and Valley Way intersection, was verified by comparing RBF Consulting’s 2007 counts
                   to 2008 Higgins Associates counts. The 2008 counts for this intersection were prepared as part of a Traffic Impact Analysis for the Villas de
                   Carmelo EIR. Counts were performed in August 2008. Based on the data provided in the Higgins Associates report, the daily traffic volume at
                   Carpenter Street and Valley Way intersection is approximately 9,045 vehicles. This is consistent with the reduction of daily vehicle trips
                   observed between 2003 and 2007.

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                                 Circulation Element
Commercial District Traffic
As a result of externally generated traffic associated with visitors and tourists, many of the
downtown streets and intersections in the commercial district carry traffic volumes that exceed
their design capacity, especially during the peak season and peak hours of use in the downtown
area. Most of the visitors have destinations in the central six square block area of the downtown
business district. This extremely heavy volume of traffic traveling into Carmel's small central
business district was never anticipated many years ago.
There are two aspects to congestion downtown. One is congestion caused by too many cars; the
other is the conflict between motorists and pedestrians. High vehicular travel counts are closely
related to high pedestrian counts. The intersection most directly affected by vehicular/pedestrian
conflicts is the San Carlos Street/Ocean Avenue intersection. Often, cars must wait for several
pedestrians to cross before proceeding. This situation is compounded by the fact that there are
no traffic signals in Carmel. The lack of traffic controls has been a specific directed action over
the years in Carmel in order to preserve the residential character; although additional stop signs
have been added in some locations to improve safety.
In addition, the flow of auto traffic is often impeded by the presence of trucks double parking on
downtown commercial streets. On some streets two-way traffic is channeled into a single lane,
resulting in traffic constrained by truck double parking. On Ocean Avenue, the problem of two-
way traffic being channeled into a single lane is avoided due to the two-lane roadway in each
direction. However, the higher traffic volume on Ocean Avenue, eliminates any benefits that the
two lane layout provides.
Beach Traffic
During most of the year there is not enough vehicular traffic at the beach to cause congestion;
but during the summer or on sunny weekends, there is congestion at the western terminus of
Ocean Avenue at the Del Mar Parking lot. During peak periods the parking at the Del Mar
parking lot and along Scenic Road is inadequate, and causes an intrusion of beach parking into
nearby residential neighborhoods. However, much of the time there is more than adequate
parking along Scenic Road, even when parking areas in the commercial districts are congested.
In addition, the visual qualities of a drive on Scenic Road and the fact that it is a one-way street
encourage low speeds and keeps traffic moving at all times.
Bus and Truck Routes
The width constraints due to design and topography affect not only residential streets, but also
the access routes into the commercial district that serve larger vehicles such as trucks and buses.
The City-designated truck and bus route forms a circular route from Highway 1 via Carpenter
Street, Second Avenue, Santa Fe Avenue, Junipero Avenue, Eighth Avenue, San Carlos Street,
Thirteenth Avenue, and Rio Road back to Highway 1 (see Figure 2.2: Bus, Truck, and Bike
Routes).

Vehicular Pedestrian Conflicts/Safety
Monterey Peninsula’s unique location, history, and cultural and recreational events attract as
many as 10 million visitors each year and Carmel is one of the most popular tourist destinations
(Carmel 2003b). The popularity of Carmel’s specialty shops, restaurants, and walkable
downtown result in a significant number of pedestrians, particularly during the summer months.
These large numbers of pedestrians, coupled with heavy traffic, often results in vehicle-
pedestrian conflicts. A 2003 City-Wide Safety Study identified areas within the City which
experienced accidents involving pedestrians. A majority of these incidents occurred within the
commercial district area. Roadways in the vicinity of the ocean (Scenic Road, San Antonio
Avenue, Ocean Avenue west of Carmelo Street) also experienced some accidents (Carmel
2003b).
As shown in Table 2.2: Traffic Accident Record for Carmel (2004 to 2008), the number of
injury and non-injury accidents have been decreasing over the last five years. The highest
number of incidents was recorded in 2004 and the lowest number of incidents was in 2007. The
highest number of collisions with injury was recorded in 2004 and 2006, where 15 of the total
incidents for each respective year resulted in an injury.

Table 2.3: Vehicular-Pedestrian Conflicts for Carmel (2004 to 2008), provides the traffic
accident records for incidents involving pedestrians. Of all the incidents reported between the
2004 and 2008, 14 were conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. The highest number of
vehicle-pedestrian incidents were recorded in 2004 and 2007. The only fatality resulting from
traffic accidents over the past five years occurred in 2007 at the intersection of Junipero and
Ocean Avenues.

The Survey performed by the City as part of the General Plan update process (2008) revealed
that most respondents perceived a majority of the City’s neighborhoods as being safe for
pedestrians. Areas identified as potentially unsafe included the intersections along Ocean
Avenue within the commercial district (particularly Ocean and Junipero Avenues), as well as
some areas around the beach and along Scenic Drive. Because these areas experience higher
vehicular and pedestrian traffic, the chances of conflict increase.

Off-Street Parking Requirements
The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea Zoning Code defines parking requirements for each zoning
district. Requirements for different land uses within residential and commercial zoning districts
are listed below in Table 2.4: Parking Standards. No on-site parking is required for residential
apartments in the Central Commercial District.

Existing developments are exempt from these requirements. However, if a development
proposes remodeling or expansion, the new development would be required to comply with the
above defined parking standards. In cases when unique circumstances such as site topography,
shape or size, prevent a development from meeting the parking standard, City regulations allow
for some flexibility, such as parking at another location.
The City also allows for payment of in-lieu of parking fees, as long as a development is not a
hotel or a motel. The money goes into the City’s In-Lieu Parking Fund and is used only for the
acquisition and development of off-street parking in or near the commercial district. The amount
of the fee is determined based on current construction costs of a 400 square foot parking space,
plus 50 percent to reflect the cost of land. This fee is required for each full in-lieu parking space.

Parking Supply On-Street
In addition to off-street parking, the City also includes a substantial number of on-street parking.
As shown in Graph 2.2: Commercial District Area Parking Supply, the number of parking
spaces provided within the City’s core has increased significantly over the years. As of 2007,
about 1,790 parking spaces exist throughout the business district. 1,284 of these spaces are
timed curbside stalls. The remaining spaces are scattered throughout the City including Sunset
Center, Del Mar, Scenic Drive, Vista Lobos, the Park Branch Library, and City Hall. Of the
1,284 timed spaces in the business district there are 773 public curbside parking spaces
designated as 2-hour timed zones. In addition, there are 113 thirty minute (green) zones, many
of which are located on Ocean Avenue or on side streets that run north and south of Ocean
Avenue.

                    Residential Parking Permit
                    Two factors contribute to heavy use of the residential area surrounding the commercial district
                    for parking by nonresidents. First is the minimal number of long-term parking spaces within the
                    commercial district itself, which forces the all day parker into surrounding areas. Second, the
                    consistent use of short-term spaces within the commercial district by all-day employee parkers
                    perpetuates the practice of visitors being forced to park in the commercial periphery.
                    To limit tourist and visitor parking in the residential areas, the City established a residential
                    parking permit program in the R-1 and R-4 residential zoning districts in 1981. The permit can
                    be issued to persons residing in either of these zones, who can prove ownership of the residence
                    and vehicle subject to the permit. The residential permit also allows residents to park in the
                    downtown area for extended periods (three hours in parking spaces marked for 120-minute
                    parking and double time in green parking spaces, with the exception of 10-minute timed zones).

Parking for Individuals with Disabilities
The City of Carmel has a total of 54 parking spaces in downtown marked as handicapped zones.
Twenty six of these spaces are either on public streets or publicly owned/maintained parking
lots. The remaining 28 spaces are on private lots with commercial uses such as banks and
shopping center parking lots.
In addition to these pre-designated spaces, the City is subject to the California Vehicle Code.
Section 22511.5(a) allows disabled persons to park for unlimited periods of time in any metered
parking space without being required to pay a parking meter fee. This requirement allows all
persons with handicapped license plates and/or tags to park in any time-enforced parking zone
within the City for unlimited periods of time.
Community Opinion on Parking
Based on the Survey, residents do not perceive parking in the commercial district as a problem in
their daily lives. The respondents reported finding adequate parking in the commercial district
without much frustration. However, the respondents recognize that this is not often the case for
the tourist and visitors to the commercial district, who often have a hard time finding parking.
As illustrated in Graph 2.3: Commercial District Parking Needs, over 50 percent of respondents
agreed that the City needs more parking serving the commercial district. However, only slightly
over 40 percent agreed that the City should build a parking structure (see Graph 2.4: Parking
Structure Opinion).

Most respondents felt that a parking structure built either at Sunset Center or Vista Lobos would
primarily serve shoppers and visitors to Carmel’s commercial district, and therefore, those users
should pay for the parking structure while residents and employees should park for free (see
Appendix A).
Public Transit and Alternate Modes of Transportation in Carmel
Bus Service
The Monterey/Salinas Transit (MST) serves a 280 square-mile area of Monterey County and
Southern Santa Cruz County, including Carmel-by-the-Sea. The MST has 37 bus routes, five of
which travel through Carmel (Routes 4, 5, 7, 11, and 22). Three of the routes (Routes 5, 7, and
11) travel to Ocean Avenue and return north, to Highway 1 and other Peninsula cities. The
remaining two bus routes (Route 4 and 22) service more extensive areas within the City, which
include the neighborhoods south of Ocean Avenue and west of Junipero Avenue. These two
routes exit on Highway 1 south of the City and travel to the Crossroads Center (Route 4) and
then further south down the coast (Route 22). Figure 2.2: Bus, Truck, and Bike Routes, shows
the location of the bus routes within the City of Carmel.
In cooperation with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, MST also offers the
MST RIDES ADA program. The MST RIDES ADA program offers curbside-to-curbside
transportation service to eligible passengers as a ride-share program.

Bike Route
The bike routes within the City of Carmel are designated Class III bike paths. Class III bike
paths require signage identifying the bike route. However, no pavement markings are required.
Figure 2.2: Bus, Truck, and Bike Routes, shows the location of bike routes within the City
(Carmel 2000).
Scenic Road is considered a prime bike route in the City. However, as cyclists cannot legally
ride north on Scenic Road, riders in this direction are directed onto Carmelo Street. San Carlos
Street provides a good north-south route in the uphill and downtown areas due to its
convenience, good pavement and wide shoulders, medium levels of traffic, and visual quality
(Carmel 2000).
Shuttle Service
The City continues to evaluate a possibility for a local shuttle, which would service the areas
within the City limits. The most probable shuttle route would likely commence at the Vista
Lobos parking lot, travel through the commercial district, west to the beach, then back east to the
Sunset Center, ending at the Mission.
Community Opinion on Public Transportation
Based on the findings of the Survey, most of Carmel residents do not currently use public
transportation and would not use a bus, even if it becomes more convenient. While most of the
residents don’t see themselves using public transportation, there is support for introducing a local
shuttle that would serve visitors, tourists, and shoppers in the City (see Graph 2.5: Carmel-by-
the-Sea Local Shuttle).

COASTAL ACCESS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
Introduction
This Element of the General Plan is an optional element not required by California’s
General Plan statutes. However, the subjects addressed in this element are central to an
effective Local Coastal Land Use Plan. Protecting and enhancing public access to the
coast is mandated by the California Coastal Act and was accepted as an essential part of
Carmel’s development long before the Coastal Act was adopted.
Carmel-by-the Sea is a popular visitor destination, known as much for its spectacular
coast as for its unique community character. Carmel Beach is owned and maintained by
the City of Carmel and includes over 22 acres of white sand beach. Carmel Beach sits on
the northern half of Carmel Bay, which stretches from Cypress Point on the north to the
outer tip of Point Lobos to the south. The beach is used year round and represents an
important recreational resource. (LUP)
One of the shoreline’s outstanding features is the sand itself, with the texture and bright
appearance of granulated sugar. Beaches composed of such fine white sand are very rare
along the central coast of California. At about one mile in length, the beach’s white sands
extend out below translucent blue waters into Carmel Bay. Wind-sculpted Monterey
Cypress trees line the bluffs. Views to the north are of the rocky headlands of Pebble
Beach. The south vista is of Abalone Point and Point Lobos beyond. Together, the beach,
ocean, trees and views combine to create one of the most scenic landscapes in California.
(LUP)
Scenic Road and the Beach Bluff Pathway are also owned and maintained by the City of
Carmel. The pathway offers a unique pedestrian experience as it meanders along the
bluffs. The decomposed granite pathway passes between the tree-dotted, vegetated bluff
outcrops and the rock curb that defines the edge of Scenic Road. The bluff top area is
maintained by the City and is complemented by nine beach access stairways and a series
of benches and overlooks. This pathway is heavily used, providing a complementary
experience to the sandy beach. From the bluff top one can see different vistas, relax on
benches, and stroll along a path that is perfect for jogging or pushing strollers or for those
whose physical condition makes walking on the beach difficult or impossible. Over the
years, Carmel has maintained a balance between preserving the beauty of the shoreline
environment and adding the physical improvements that make the Carmel shoreline
accessible and enjoyable to the public. (LUP)

Coastal Act Policies
One of the key objectives of the California Coastal Act is to maximize public access to
and along the coast. This is evidenced in the Coastal Act’s statement of goals, in the
resource policies, and in the requirement for the preparation of a public access component
within the local coastal program. (LUP)
Coastal Access and Recreation Background
Beach Access
Implementation of Coastal Act public access requirements focuses on two types of
access: vertical and lateral. Vertical access provides routes from the “nearest public
roadway to the shoreline.” Lateral access is along the shoreline, typically immediately
adjacent to a sandy beach or rocky inter-tidal zone, at the top of a bluff or otherwise
above the high tide line, where pedestrians may walk along the coast without being
affected by waves or any safety hazards presented by bluff edges. Parking facilities near
the beach also is a local access issue. (LUP)
Carmel is among a limited number of California coastal communities where nearly the
entire shoreline from the first public road to the sea is open to the public and easily
accessible. The entire beach and bluff is dedicated as a City park and is kept as natural
appearing as possible consistent with public access, habitat protection, safety and
provision of limited recreational support facilities. (LUP)
The City has a highly evolved access system that integrates several types of facilities and
regulatory programs to maintain the natural character of the beach and bluffs. The City
provides vertical access at one to two block intervals along its entire coastline. (LUP)
      • The west end of Ocean Avenue has long provided the principal vertical access
            point to Carmel Beach for visitors. This area has approximately 124 parking
            spaces freely available to the public and the main public restroom facilities are
            located here. (LUP)
      • Access north of Ocean Avenue is provided via a dedicated easement through the
            Sand and Sea subdivision. Scenic Road and its Beach Bluff Pathway provide
            continuous lateral bluff-top access from Eighth Avenue to the south City
            boundary. Scenic Road also provides 127 parking spaces and twelve vertical
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                     Page 4-2

            access points (stairways or sand ramps) from the bluff top to the beach below (see
            Figure 4.1). (LUP)
      • Pedestrian easements provide convenient access to additional beach parking
            located along San Antonio Avenue. Pedestrian easements connect San Antonio
            Avenue to the Scenic Road corridor at the ends of 9th through 12th Avenues.
            Where possible, beach stairways are located near the outlet of these pedestrian
            easements to ensure a convenient, safe route to the beach. This minimizes foot
            traffic on the fragile bluffs, which would destroy landscaping and increase erosion.
            (LUP)
      • Support facilities such as viewing benches, trash containers, sand wash-off
            stations, informational and safety signage, public restrooms, curbside parking and
            rustic guard railings complete the access system. (LUP)
Figure 4.1 shows a map of public access points to the beach. (LUP)
Access issues discussed at community workshops include means to provide improved
access for the disabled, improved lateral access between Ocean Avenue and Eighth
Avenue and restoration of the vertical access near Twelfth Avenue that was lost during
the storms of 1982-83. This Plan assumes that the number and general distribution of
existing vertical access facilities will be retained as long as bluff erosion and engineering
feasibility allows. Improving vertical access to the beach for neighborhoods north of
Ocean Avenue also is supported in this plan. (LUP)
Recreation and Support Facilities
Recreation is another fundamental component of the Coastal Act. The City’s public
beach is an important recreational resource both for the City’s residents and visitors. The
City limits structural improvements and prohibits commercial activity at the beach to
protect its informal, natural character. While there are a variety of physical improvements
such as public parking, the Beach Bluff Pathway, seawalls, stairways, restrooms and an
irrigation well, the City always strives to keep these facilities low in scale, and designed
to be simple and rustic in character using natural materials such as stone and wood.
(LUP)
The winter storms of 1982/83 severely damaged the bluffs, roadway, and public access
points along the shoreline. In some places the bluff retreated 30 to 40 feet inland
destroying beach stairways, drainage facilities and vegetation. In response, the City
embarked on a beach restoration project to restore and armor the bluff, rebuild damaged

drainage and access facilities and make improvements to recreation facilities along
Scenic Road and the beach. The project was funded in part with grant monies from the
California Coastal Conservancy and included such amenities as the pathway, construction
of new vertical access points along the beach, viewing platforms, public parking spaces,
benches, signs, and shoreline armoring. In order to accommodate the new pedestrian path
as well as maintain a 20’ road width, the western edge of Scenic Road was realigned and
approximately 22 parking spaces were eliminated. Prior to this project, there was no
separate pedestrian path along the beach bluff--cars and people intermixed creating a
public hazard. Even with the loss of parking, the project was found to be consistent with
Coastal Act because it provided significant public benefits of improved lateral access
along the bluff and vertical access to the beach. (LUP)
Today, the public continues to enjoy the benefits of the Beach Bluff Pathway and
convenient access to the beach. It is estimated that more than 2.5 million people each
year visit Carmel, and many of these come to see the beach. (LUP)
The Beach Bluff Pathway is a scenic trail that currently extends from Eighth Avenue
south to the City limit. This Pathway runs parallel to Scenic Road and provides excellent
views of Carmel Bay and the sandy beach. This pathway is a recreational amenity that is
used by members of the public from the early morning hours until twilight. Since use of
this pathway is a pedestrian activity members of this group are more likely to arrive on
foot, making the pathway part of a longer walk through Carmel’s neighborhoods. Some,
however, do arrive by car and need a convenient place to park. For someone who desires
to walk the full length of the pathway the most convenient place to park would be near
one of the ends of the pathway. Within the program area there are over 100 parking
spaces south of Thirteenth Avenue and 95 parking spaces located between Ocean and
Eighth Avenues, making this requirement easy to satisfy. Very few use this pathway at
night. There is some seasonality evident with peak use during the summer months. (LUP)
Parking demand exceeds supply especially on busy weekends days and during the
summer season. During these times, competition for parking at the Ocean Avenue/Del
Mar Avenue beach lot and the public parking spaces along Scenic Road reaches a peak
and spills over into the on-street parking in adjacent residential neighborhoods. Demand
for public parking and access to the beach typically wanes in the late afternoon. The City
controls beach parking through design, dispersal and by regulating parking time limits. In
public workshops the congestion at the Del Mar parking lot was identified as a problem
that should be addressed. Polices in this land use plan support development of a master
plan that includes a redesign of this area to improve circulation, reduce congestion,
protect sensitive resources and enhance visual character. (LUP)

Among the most difficult facilities to site are public restrooms. The City provides a main
restroom facility at the foot of Ocean Avenue/Del Mar parking area. This facility is often
crowded and could be expanded to improve capacity on busy weekends. With more than
a mile of coastline this single facility is often too distant to serve public needs and the
City has long recognized the desirability of establishing a second or even a third smaller
facility south of Eighth Avenue. Public demand is seasonal and this could allow for one
or more nonpermanent restrooms to meet peaks in demand. Siting a permanent facility
must account for the full cycle of storm activity, beach aesthetics, public and private
views and service/maintenance needs. (LUP)
Other identified needs include an improved signage program, emergency response
telephones and the development of educational materials for visitors and residents. Each
of these will improve the enjoyment of recreational users of the beach and aid in the safe
and effective management of this resource. (LUP)
Figure 4.2 shows a map of parks and open space, including Carmel Beach. (LUP)
Visitor Accommodations and Recreation Services
Visitor accommodations provide an opportunity for overnight visitors to stay in the City
and is an important supporting aspect of coastal access and recreation for the City.
Carmel-by-the-Sea is a popular visitor destination and accommodates a large supply of
hotel and motel rooms. Based on a review of permits, there are 948 authorized
motel/hotel rooms within City limits. Approximately 50 percent of the land area of the
business district is occupied by motel uses, primarily in the RC (Residential/Commercial)
and R-4 (Multifamily) districts. A large percentage of the land zoned for retail
commercial activity also is occupied by visitor-oriented uses. With a resident population
of less than 5,000, this represents a significant proportion of resources devoted to
providing visitors with recreational opportunities and access to Carmel’s coast. (LUP)
For these reasons, this Coastal Plan does not establish policies encouraging additional
motel or visitor uses. Instead it recognizes the importance of these uses to the community
and incorporates policies that will maintain and enhance the existing motel and visitor-
serving uses. Policies that encourage local-serving uses and a balanced mix of uses seek
to moderate the impacts of tourism on the residential community. These policies will
benefit both the residential community and the visitor experience. Avoiding over-
commercialization and preserving the uses necessary for local community life will
enhance the charm and quality of life that makes Carmel so interesting to visit. (LUP)

         General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan           Coastal Access and Recreation Element
Many visitor accommodations are older and the City should expect renovations and
replacement of these buildings over the next few decades. Coastal policies need to guide
this natural recycling to accommodate visitor needs while retaining the scale and
character of the downtown. One opportunity that would aid in mitigating the impacts of
motels while preserving the existing motel stock is the transfer of R-1 Motels out of the
single-family neighborhoods and into the commercial area. Land use and water policies
address this opportunity. (LUP)
Additionally, there is some evidence that the City may be losing market share of
overnight visitors to other regional facilities that provide conference facilities. Policy
options to encourage expansion of small-scale conference facilities, and/or the
development of a central conference facility that can be shared by all hotels/motels
should be considered as a means of protecting the City’s economic base. (LUP)

Goals, Objectives and Policies
Beach Access
G4-1 Provide for maximum public access to, and recreational use of, the shoreline
            consistent with private property rights and environmental protection. (LUP)
            O4-1 Maintain frequent and safe points of access along the beach. (LUP)
                     P4-1  Development shall not interfere with the public’s right of access to
                           the sea. (LUP)
                     P4-2  Continue to provide vertical access along the Carmel shoreline at
                           approximately one or two block intervals. (LUP)
                     P4-3  Improve and sign the vertical access at Fourth Avenue. Consider
                           development of a pedestrian path from the foot of Jane Powers
                           walkway to the Fourth Avenue beach access through Sand and Sea.
                           Investigate and implement opportunities to establish or reestablish
                           additional vertical access from North San Antonio to the beach to
                           the extent feasible. (LUP)
                     P4-4  Periodically reestablish the sand dune at the foot of Ocean Avenue,
                           to provide convenient beach access from the Ocean Avenue/Del
                           Mar parking lot. Reestablish and regularly maintain a vehicle and
                           disabled-access ramp south of Eighth Avenue. (LUP)
                     P4-5  Enhance pedestrian access to the shoreline from San Antonio
                           Avenue using existing pedestrian access easements /drainage ways
                           that connect San Antonio Avenue with Scenic Road located at
                           Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Avenues. Redirect
                           surface storm water flows in these easements drainage ways to
                           underground culverts to improve pedestrian safety, access, and
                           aesthetics. (LUP)
                     P4-6  Keep the vegetation on San Antonio Avenue near pedestrian access
                           easements pruned for safe visibility of pedestrians by motorists.
                           (LUP)
                     P4-7  Protect the public’s historic right of unrestricted access to the entire
                           beach in Carmel-by-the-Sea from the southern to the northern city
                           limit by prohibiting development that interferes with such rights
                           and by actively defending established prescriptive rights. Complete
                           the City’s acquisition of the sandy beach along the entire Carmel
                           shoreline. (LUP)

COASTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
Introduction
This element of the General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan includes policies for protection
of the City’s coastal environmental resources including the character of its forest, beach
and bluffs, water quality and Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas (ESHAs). As
noted in the previous element (Access and Recreation), there is little private land located
between the first public road and the shoreline. The City owns nearly the entire beach.
This eliminates many of the potential conflicts that other communities face between
development and resource preservation objectives along the immediate coastline.
However, the City’s biological resources are found in a variety of other locations, and
require protection under the Coastal Act. (LUP)
Coastal Resource Management Background
Environmental Setting
The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea is located in a region of California’s central coast that is
known for its diversity of plants and plant communities. The region surrounding the city
supports several different climatic, topographic, and soil conditions, resulting in a wide
variety of habitats. This diversity of conditions supports many native plants and wildlife
species. As an example of this diversity, 146 plant species reach their most southern and
156 plant species reach their most northern distributional limits in Monterey County, and
at least 34 plant species are found only in Monterey County. (LUP)
Residential development occurs on almost all land in the city, except for seven parks,
several mini-parks, a compact centralized commercial area and some privately owned
parcels in Pescadero Canyon. Approximately 68 acres of public open space and
approximately 10 acres of privately owned undeveloped land are under the City’s
jurisdiction. Most of the parks in the City are developed to support passive and active
recreational activities. Of the City’s public lands, Carmel Beach, Mission Trail Nature
Preserve, and the proposed Rio Park (outside City boundaries), support the most intact
and highest quality natural resources. The lower portion of Forest Hill Park also supports
natural habitat but has been substantially altered by past activities and continues to be
maintained for public recreational uses. The privately owned properties in Pescadero
Canyon are part of a larger watershed for Pescadero Creek that extends into Del Monte
Forest and supports Monterey Pine forest. (LUP)
The landform of the Monterey Peninsula is an ascending staircase or series of six marine
terraces of increasing geologic age, rising inland from the seashore. These marine
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                  Page 5-1

terraces reflect the changes in sea level and the general uplift of underlying bedrock along
the central coast in roughly the last half-million years or more. The city is built on the
first five of the six marine terraces. The marine sediment of the first four terraces is
covered by sand dunes, which also are of increasing age with ascending elevation and
distance from the ocean. The greater degree of soil development in the older dunes, such
as organic matter accumulation, and clay and iron weathering and translocation to the
subsoil, reflect the age of the dunes. (LUP)
Drainages have cut through the dunes and marine terraces of Pescadero Canyon and
Mission Trail Nature Preserve to expose the underlying bedrock. Shale from marine
deposits is exposed in Pescadero Canyon, and granitic bedrock is exposed in the lower
slopes and stream channel in Mission Trail Nature Preserve. Uplifted alluvial terraces
formed by the Carmel River are found along the southern boundary of the City. (LUP)
Carmel Bay is a 2.8-mile-wide open bay between Cypress Point on the north and the
outer tip of Point Lobos, on the south. Its sands are very white, extending out below its
clear waters. The deep Carmel Offshore Canyon is located in the southeast part of the
bay, with depths of 300 feet less than 0.2 miles from San Jose beach, a part of Carmel
River State Beach. The public beach of Carmel-by-the-Sea is on the more gently sloping
northeast shore of the bay, north of Carmel River and the promontory now known as
Carmel Point. Gentle as Carmel Beach is, it is still considered by coastal geologists to be
in the category of "steep" beaches. Ten-foot breakers are not unusual. About one mile in
length, covering about 22 acres it is under the jurisdiction of the City. The beach is a
commons held in public trust and wholly devoted to public access and the enjoyment by
residents and visitors alike. The lower beach near the water is managed as a natural
environment. The sand builds 200 feet seaward during summer when waves are small,
then retreats toward the bluff, almost to the vanishing point as the large waves of winter
storms strip sand from the beach. (LUP)
The sand supply within Carmel Bay may be a closed system. One study suggests that
Carmel Beach does not receive any significant sand transport northward from Carmel
River beach around Carmel Point within the bay7. Sediment also does not appear to be
transported with the northwest drift around the Monterey Peninsula from the southern
part of Monterey Bay. Carmel, like many other small embayments along the West Coast,
appears to derive most of its sand, not from rivers, but from the erosion of adjacent
headlands and shoreline bluffs. (LUP)

Cypress Point, the western-most point of the Monterey Peninsula, extends about 2 miles
beyond the general trend of the coast. South of it, enclosing the anchorages and beaches
of Pebble Beach and Stillwater Cove, is Pescadero Point. Since the prevailing swell and
long shore currents come from the northwest, it is the Santa Lucia granodiorite of these
headlands that is slowly eroded and transported by waves to line the Carmel shoreline
with white sands. This quartz sand is so fine that it was mined in earlier days for use in
the making of glass. (LUP)
The shale, sandstone, and lava rock of the bay bluffs, being softer and less resistant than
the granite rocks, also contribute material to the sandy beaches. Since these bluffs are so
vulnerable, the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea began in the 1950s to build seawalls to protect
them. When heavy winter storms combine with the year's highest tides, the beach is
sometimes completely inundated. Waves crash against the bluffs and seawalls, and debris
has at times been thrown into the air and across Scenic Road. Figure 5.1 shows public
coastal protection structures to be maintained. These include seawalls and engineered
revetments that protect the bluff from wave attack and storm water outfalls that direct
runoff away from fragile bluff soils to prevent erosion. Figure 5.2 shows the location of
sand redistribution activity historically undertaken by the City. In each of the areas shown
on the map, sand is moved upslope from just above mean high tide line toward the base
of the bluffs to cover exposed revetments and to restore beach sand levels worn down
from wave activity and from daily use by the public. (LUP)
Beach Maintenance and Shoreline Protection
Public access to Carmel Beach is primarily from the parking area at the foot of Ocean
Avenue as well as from numerous sites along Scenic Road. But from these locations,
access to the tide line requires a descent that ranges between 12 and 50 feet, depending
on location and season. During several months of the year, high-energy (storm) waves
scour sand from the beach, exposing an underlying base of large sandstone outcroppings.
These conditions often make beach access difficult. During some periods, storm-
generated waves strike directly against the dunes, bluffs and beach access stairways,
making beach access dangerous. And, like nearly all open-coast locations, the Carmel
shoreline appears to be facing a future of rising sea levels and unpredictable weather
patterns. (LUP)
If left unmanaged, the bluffs surrounding Carmel Bay would progressively erode from
the impact of winter storm waves, surface drainage and other steady and episodic erosion
processes. This natural process would eventually erode the bluffs up to the City’s beach
access stairways and the Beach Bluff Pathway. Eventually, Scenic Road and the adjacent
homes would be threatened as well. Erosion of Carmel’s bluffs is quite variable along the
shoreline and includes both steady erosion and episodic events. Large, unprotected

sections of the bluff subject to wave attack can slough away during heavy surf and winter
storms. The same area of bluff may not retreat again for decades. Estimates of the long-
term average rate of bluff retreat were performed in 1984 by reviewing old surveys and
old aerial photographs. Based on data from 1908 to 1983, bluff retreat rates along Carmel
Beach were estimated at between 4” and 8” per year depending on location. Much of this
retreat occurred during the single winter of 1982-83 when twenty to forty feet of land
between Scenic Road and the bluff’s edge were lost to the sea. (LUP)
Carmel has forestalled this process by modifying the bluffs to resist erosive forces
thereby protecting public access as well as public and private improvements. This began
with construction of the first seawalls in about 1958. Additional seawalls were added in
1976, 1978, 1982 and 1984, and 2001. By the end of the twentieth-century nearly the
entire coastline south of Ocean Avenue was armored by a combination of vertical
seawalls, vertical or stepped retaining walls or engineered rock revetments (see Figure
5.1). Drainage improvements also have been installed to divert storm water away from
the fragile bluffs. The City has avoided the use of unconsolidated rip-rap which is
unsightly and less effective. Through its beach management program, the City annually
moves thousands of yards of sand to cover its engineered revetments and maintain ramps
to improve beach safety, access, and aesthetics for beach-users. (LUP)
As Carmel has built seawalls, retaining walls, and engineered rock revetments in a
continuing program to protect the City’s shoreline bluffs and public amenities along its
bluff tops, including the Beach Bluff Pathway, the City has worked to mitigate negative
impacts (structural, functional, and visual) that often result from the use of hard
protective structures along the shore:
      • Seawalls and Retaining Walls – These are vertical walls that hold the bluff in
            place and are exposed to waves on the seaward side. To reduce the visual impact
            of these structures, the City has covered them all with a facing of “golden granite”
            rock, giving the walls a more “natural” look. It is unclear whether the accelerated
            loss of beach sand that is often associated with seawall construction is occurring
            along Carmel Beach. Further long-term study of beach levels is warranted to
            provide the best management for Carmel’s beach. When new protective structures
            are proposed in areas not previously armored, seawalls are generally considered
            the preferred alternative unless site-specific engineering reasons dictate otherwise.
            This is because seawalls take up less beach area and typically do not require
            annual sand redistribution to cover their bases. (LUP)
      • Revetments – These are engineered assemblies that begin with an underlayment of
            filter fabric placed against the slope of the exposed bluff. This is then covered by
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                        Page 5-4

            core-stones (400 to 600 lbs. each) faced with interlocked armor-stones (5 to 6 tons
            each). These engineered assemblies are sloped back along the inclined bluffs to
            shield them from wave attack. To mask any intrusive impact, nearly all engineered
            revetments installed since 1983 have been covered with local soils, then with
            beach sand, and then, replanted with vegetation. During the beach’s peak visitor
            period (mid-Spring through mid-Fall), most of the revetments are so well covered
            that they are virtually indistinguishable from other portions of Carmel’s beach and
            bluffs. Further, the City’s beach management program directs the Forest and
            Beach Department’s personnel to annually contract sand bulldozing from the
            lower beach to the upper beach, thoroughly covering exposed revetment
            structures. (LUP)
Most visitors to Carmel’s picturesque beach are unaware of this armoring because of the
care taken to disguise the structures with soil, sand and landscaping. Policies in this plan
support these past practices that combine engineered structures, sand management, and
the preservation of beach aesthetics. (LUP)
The City’s Shoreline Management Plan includes a monitoring program to gauge the long-
term effect of shoreline structures and directs the Forest, Parks and Beach Department’s
personnel to evaluate the impacts to marine and terrestrial resources of annually
bulldozing sand from the lower beach to the upper beach. In the future, when existing
structures fail and need to be replaced or substantially rebuilt, the data collected through
the monitoring program will aid the City in determining the best design approach, to take
in balancing protection of coastal resources, public access, public safety, aesthetics and
engineering. (LUP)
The Shoreline Management Plan serves as a comprehensive document that will guide
future management of the City’s shoreline area, including beaches, dunes, bluff,
landscaping, and associated infrastructure. Updates to the Shoreline Management Plan
will be made periodically as new information and our understanding of shoreline
processes, marine and terrestrial resources, and the coastal environment evolve. (LUP)
Urbanized Forest, Parks and Open Spaces
Since the early 1900s Carmel’s forest has been carefully nurtured and enhanced.
Monterey pines, Coast Live oaks and other trees were often planted when lots were first
sold or developed in an effort to extend the forest cover and range. Over time, the
resident’s ongoing interest in the forest and natural environment resulted in the adoption
of ordinances, resolutions, policies and a Master Plan relating to trees. Taken together,
these documents have successfully guided the City's tree program over the years.
However, since the measures were adopted at different times to address separate
concerns, they lacked a sense of overall cohesion. In order to meld these documents
together, the first Forest Management Plan for the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea was
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                       Page 5-5

adopted in 1971. In early 2001, the City updated the Forest Management Plan and
incorporated it into the Local Coastal Program. (LUP)
Carmel's forest is an “urbanized” Monterey pine forest rather than an “urban” forest.
“Urban” forests are planted after development and typically consist of single species,
regularly spaced trees planted in a row between the sidewalk and the street. An
“urbanized” forest exists before development and is characterized by its diversity in
species, age and randomness in tree location resulting in meandering streets of varying
width. (LUP)
To many, the “urbanized” forest is the character-defining feature that makes Carmel-by
the-Sea so unique. The forest, along with the beach and ocean, is the City’s largest and
most visible natural resource. Homes are nestled into the native Monterey pine and Coast
Live oak on a grid of streets that yields to trees more than to engineering expediency.
Upper canopy trees impart a distinctive ambiance and identity to the City. Lower canopy
trees soften and provide screening of development. Together the mix of upper and lower
canopy trees establishes a powerful sense of place. (LUP)
In a city with few formal street improvements or drainage systems, the “urbanized” forest
also serves to convey runoff from the watershed to the beach and Carmel Bay through a
variety of natural drainages, swales, and creeks. The forest performs the important
functions of absorbing water from the soil, reducing runoff, filtering pollutants, and
minimizing erosion. As such, the “urbanized” forest reduces the amount of polluted
runoff and in large part, helps the City comply with the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Storm Water permit regulations. (LUP)
In recent years, the Monterey Pine forest has suffered from a severe outbreak of pitch
canker disease spreading throughout much of the City. The initial findings of a survey of
the east side of town (east of Junipero Avenue) revealed that 50% of Carmel’s pines were
infected with pitch canker and 2% of the standing trees were dead. The City has
responded in the past by removing dead and dying trees and disposing of the infected
materials. During the years of 1999 to 2001, the Forestry Department removed roughly
180 pitch canker-infected pines. Roughly 70% of those trees (125) were young trees
12”or less in diameter. Up to 70% of the younger trees east of Junipero Avenue now
appear to be infected. Older trees are less susceptible to infection and only 30% of these
are infected. (LUP)
The City’s Forest, Parks and Beach Department has an ongoing program of replacing
dead and diseased pines on public property. The City also has been working on
developing a disease-resistant pine and has been successful in planting 15 pines that have
so far proved to be completely resistant to the disease. However, the loss of Monterey
Pines due to pine pitch canker and other causes on private property continues to be an
issue. (LUP)

The City of Carmel maintains an ongoing survey of trees by species and size, started in
1971. Since that time, the numbers of Monterey pines on public property declined
roughly 2%, while the decline on private property has reached 10%. It is unclear whether
pine pitch canker is entirely responsible for the decline on private property; there are
many other factors including disease, development impacts, and old age. Though many
large mature trees can probably survive pitch canker, given the age of the City’s
Monterey pine forest, coupled with the susceptibility of young trees to the disease, the
overall health of the City’s pine forest may be in jeopardy. As the number of Monterey
Pines declined since 1971, the number of Coast Live Oaks increased 17% on private
property and 40% on public property. The increase in oaks, dramatic as it may be, cannot
offset the loss of Monterey pines, which impart a very different sense of place for the
village. (LUP)
Steps must be taken to minimize the threat to existing healthy Monterey pines and new
seedlings to ensure continued diversity in species, age, and location. This document
includes policies to respond to this issue. Disturbance and/or removal of mature and
disease resistant trees during construction or other development activities should be
avoided. Permit conditions requiring replacement trees for those removed from private
land should be monitored and enforced to ensure that the trees are healthy and reach
maturity. Replacements should also be in like kind. It is essential that these and other
policy directives be carried out to ensure that the Monterey pine forest landscape is
protected so that the forested character of this unique coastal village is preserved. (LUP)
Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas
In addition to the urbanized Monterey pine forest, the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea has
other environmentally sensitive habitats including wetlands, riparian forest, wet meadow,
and coastal terrace prairie. In 1995, the City completed a detailed study of
environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHAs) (Jones & Stokes, 1995), which includes
specific recommendations for City policies and practices. Relevant policies and
recommendations derived from this document are incorporated into this section of the
Land Use Plan. Figure 5.3 shows a map of the currently designated ESHA’s. The location
and types of ESHAs found in Carmel include:
      • Pescadero Canyon supports Monterey pine forest that provides watershed
            protection and a buffer for Pescadero Creek and is part of an important local
            wildlife habitat corridor, wetland drainage (Pescadero Creek), central coast arroyo
            willow riparian forest, and wet meadow. (LUP)

            including Hickman’s onion, and Monterey dusky footed woodrat, which are state
            and/or federal species of special concern, as well as potential habitats for other
            special-status species. (LUP)
      • Carmel Beach supports dune scrub; un-vegetated dunes; a known occurrence of
            Tidestrom’s lupine, a state- and federal-listed endangered species, black legless
            lizard, a state species of special concern and other potential habitat for other
            special-status species. (LUP)
A brief description and management guidance for these resources follows:
Pescadero Canyon. Pescadero Canyon, located along the northern boundary of the City,
supports two undeveloped segments referred to as Pescadero Canyon East and Pescadero
Canyon West. These two segments are part of the larger Pescadero Canyon that extends
to the northeast beyond the City’s jurisdiction. Pescadero Canyon supports Monterey pine
forest along its slopes and riparian and wetland habitat at the bottom of the canyon along
Pescadero Creek. Most of Pescadero Canyon is in private ownership and supports some
residential development. (LUP)
The Pescadero Creek watershed begins on marine terrace 6 at the top of Huckleberry Hill
and extends down through a succession of geomorphic surfaces to the Pacific Ocean.
This succession of marine and dune-covered terraces can be observed along the steep
canyon walls. Exposed in the canyon bottom and adjacent side slopes are the soils and
shale bedrock of the Monterey formation. (LUP)
Under natural conditions, a high rainfall runoff rate and consequent high discharge into
Pescadero Creek would be expected on the Narlon soils of the marine terraces. The
natural runoff rate and stream flows in Pescadero Creek have increased beyond natural
conditions with development in the Pescadero Creek watershed. (LUP)
Pescadero Canyon East supports Monterey pine forest along the steep slopes of the
canyon. Wetland drainage and two small, planted redwood groves can be found at the
bottom of the canyon. Monterey pine forest in Pescadero Canyon East can be found on
middle-aged dunes and on shale bedrock. Within this part of the Canyon, Monterey pine
forest on middle-aged dunes is dominant occurring on the upper north-facing slope of
Pescadero Canyon, along 2nd Avenue. Monterey pine forest on shale bedrock forms a
narrow band on both sides of the Creek. Pescadero Canyon East is traversed by a
perennial drainage that conveys runoff from the upper reaches of Pescadero Canyon to
Carmel Bay. The drainage bottom varies from 3 to 6 feet wide and is generally un-
vegetated. Wetland plants occur sporadically along the drainage edge. No special-status
species have been found in Pescadero Canyon East. (LUP)

Pescadero Canyon West is characterized by less extreme slopes than are found in the
eastern part of the canyon. This flatter area supports a mosaic of wetland drainage, central
coast arroyo willow riparian forest, wet meadow, and mixed horticultural species.
Pescadero Creek terminates at the western edge of Pescadero Canyon West. In this area
of the canyon the creek supports dense riparian forest and wet meadow along its banks.
Central coast arroyo willow riparian forest occurs as a dense multi-layered forest at
Pescadero Canyon West, adjacent to Pebble Beach Golf Course. The riparian forest
canopy and sub-canopy are dominated by arroyo willow with interspersed dogwood. A
mix of native and non-native species characterizes the under-story. Wet meadow also
occurs in Pescadero Canyon West, along the southern side of the perennial drainage. The
750-square-foot wet meadow area supports sedge, panicled bulrush and horsetail. (LUP)
Management guidelines for Pescadero Canyon should be implemented that respond to the
following issues of slope and channel stability, habitat enhancement and control of
invasive vegetation:
      • Reduce erosion and sedimentation into the creek channel and Carmel Bay
      • Remove accumulated debris from the creek channel
      • Minimize vegetation removal that could destabilize slopes
      • Prohibit removal of native vegetation from riparian forest and Monterey pine
            forest habitat.
      • Avoid the introduction and control or reduce the spread of invasive horticultural
            species
      • Require mitigation of impacts associated with development in or near the canyon
      • Avoid impacts to wet meadow and other wetland habitat types within Pescadero
            Canyon East and West and any other environmentally sensitive habitat areas.

Mission Trail Nature Preserve.
Mission Trail Nature Preserve lies along much of the City's eastern boundary and is the
largest ESHA in the City. It contains a wide variety of habitat types. To describe this area
the Preserve is divided into four planning units: Martin Road Parcel, Park Proper,
Flanders Mansion/Rowntree Native Plant Garden and Outlet Meadow. The Preserve
supports a vegetation mosaic consisting of Monterey pine forest on inland granitic
bedrock and oldest dunes, central coast arroyo willow riparian forest, wetland drainage,
wet meadow, coast live oak woodland, coastal terrace prairie and horticultural plantings.

            (LUP)
Monterey pine forest on inland granitic bedrock is dominant in the Preserve. One small
area of Monterey pine forest on oldest dunes occurs in the northern corner of the
Preserve. Only 20 percent of the historical extent of Monterey pine forest on oldest dunes
remains on the Monterey Peninsula. In general, the Preserve supports mature large
Monterey pine with a sub-canopy layer of Coast Live oak and a dense under story of
shrub, vine, and herbaceous species. (LUP)
Oak woodland, coastal terrace prairie and several riparian/wetland habitat types complete
the mosaic found in the Preserve. A small area of coast live oak woodland occurs in the
southeastern corner of the Preserve. The woodland is characterized by a closed canopy of
Coast Live oaks with an under story of coyote bush, California blackberry, poison oak
and herbaceous species. Coastal terrace prairie occurs along west-facing and south-facing
slopes in the Martin Road Parcel and Outlet Meadow units. These sites appear to occur
on old alluvial terraces of the Carmel River. Coastal terrace prairie typically occurs
within the zone of coastal fog incursion, on sandy loam. Most stands are patchy and
variable in composition, reflecting local differences in available soil moisture capacity.
(LUP)
Saturated soils and flowing water have been observed at the upper edge and lower bottom
of the coastal terrace prairie. The presence of this wetland hydrology and a prevalence of
hydrophytic wetland plants indicate that part of the coastal terrace prairie may qualify as
jurisdictional wetland under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and the Coastal Act.

Two main perennial drainages and several smaller drainages transect the Preserve. The
main perennial drainage enters the Preserve at its northern end, runs along its western
boundary and forks near the center of the Preserve. At the north end this drainage is
generally un-vegetated. The steep bank sides are vegetated with Monterey pine and coast
live oak with a dense under story of shrubs and vines. French broom dominates the banks
along the northern portion of the drainage, grading into a dense central coast arroyo
willow riparian forest (near the Eleventh Avenue entrance to the Preserve at Willow
Trail). Another perennial drainage feeds into the Preserve from the east, supporting a
dense central coast arroyo willow riparian forest. (LUP)
Central coast arroyo willow riparian forest occurs as a dense, multi-layered forest along
the northern boundary of the Preserve. As mentioned above, riparian forest also occurs
along a perennial drainage near the western boundary of the Preserve. The riparian forest
is characterized by a canopy layer of black cottonwood and arroyo willow with a sub-
canopy layer of shrub-size arroyo willow and dogwood. In localized areas, invasive
horticultural species form a conspicuously dense under-story in the forest and have
displaced desirable native riparian species. (LUP)
Special-status species have been found in the Preserve, including Hickman’s onion, a
federal species of concern and included on California Native Plant Society (CNPS) List
1B, which includes plants considered by CNPS to be rare, threatened, or endangered in
California and elsewhere due to their limited or vulnerable habitat, their low numbers of
individuals per population, or their limited number of populations. Federal species of
concern are not listed or candidates for listing as threatened or endangered, and they have
no formal protection under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The designation merely
indicates that U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) is concerned about these species.
(LUP)
Hickman’s onion is known from fewer than twenty populations and is threatened by
urbanization, grazing, road construction and military activities. A nearby occurrence of
Hickman's onion was previously identified along the south side of Hatton Road just east
of Mission Trail Nature Preserve (Department of Fish and Game, Natural Diversity
Database, 1994). A new population within the Preserve was found during field surveys in
1995 along the upper eastern edge of the coastal terrace prairie (Jones and Stokes, 1995).
This population contains approximately 100-150 individual plants. The area that supports
Hickman's onion is maintained by mowing each year. The overall effects on the
population from this maintenance activity are unknown and should be assessed through
monitoring efforts. Although no other special-status plant species have been located in
the Preserve, suitable habitat was identified for several late-blooming species including
Gairdner's yampah and Seaside bird's beak. (LUP)

The presence of one special-status wildlife species, the Monterey dusky-footed woodrat,
a federal and state species of special concern, was observed during fieldwork in the
Preserve (Jones and Stokes, 1995). As with federal species of concern, state species of
special concern are not listed or candidates for listing as threatened or endangered and
have no formal protection under the State Endangered Species Act. The designation
merely indicates that California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is concerned about
these species and that special consideration should be taken when decisions are made
regarding the future of an area containing these species. (LUP)
Two woodrat nests were observed on the eastern edge of the Preserve and several nests
were seen in the Outlet Meadow area. The nests had obvious entrance and exit holes that
showed evidence of use and appeared active. Because of the relatively large size and
isolation of the Mission Trail Nature Preserve, it has the greatest potential ecological
value of all the habitats studied in the City. The dense riparian areas provide potential
habitat for yellow warbler. The fairly frequent downed and decomposing logs could
potentially be used by the Monterey ornate shrew. Sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper's
hawks could use the Monterey pine forest for foraging and nesting. (LUP)
Management guidelines for Mission Trail Nature Preserve should be implemented that
respond to the following issues of habitat quality and enhancement and control of
invasive vegetation:
      • Reduce erosion and loss of native coastal terrace prairie vegetation
      • Enhance the habitat value of the coastal terrace prairie
      • Monitor and protect the Hickman's onion population
      • Maintain and enhance habitat for the Monterey dusky-footed woodrat
      • Prohibit removal of native vegetation from riparian forest habitat
      • Reduce the introduction and spread of invasive horticultural species
      • Survey for special status plants periodically and manage as appropriate. (LUP)

The white sands of Carmel Beach form the entire western boundary of the City. Although
largely un-vegetated, Carmel Beach does support scattered areas of native dune scrub and

horticultural plantings. Native dune scrub occurs near the corner of Ocean and San
Antonio Avenues in the North Dunes area. Species observed in this scrub habitat during
the field survey include mock heather, bush lupine, beach sagewort, California
blackberry, beach evening primrose, pink sand verbena, croton, California sea rocket and
ice plant. Coast Live oaks are scattered in the dune scrub. Horticultural plantings occur in
scattered locations along the bluffs of the Carmel shoreline. One grove of Monterey
Cypress occurs along Ocean Avenue, near the dune scrub. (LUP)
Tidestrom’s lupine can be found in and near the dune scrub habitat in the north dunes at
Carmel Beach. Tidestrom’s lupine is a state and federal listed endangered species and is
on list 1B of the CNPS. This is a perennial herb that typically occurs in coastal dune
habitat. The species is seriously threatened by coastal development, trampling, and
competition from invasive, non-native plants. The Carmel dunes population is a new
occurrence first reported in 1995 and contains approximately 280 individual plants (Jones
and Stokes, 1995). Other populations nearby can be found at Asilomar State Beach and at
several locations in Pebble Beach. At Carmel, the plant is associated with beach
sagewort, mock heather, beach evening primrose, bush lupine and wildrye. While the
local population appears viable the habitat conditions for Tidestrom’s lupine is degraded
from public use and the spread of invasive non-native species. No other special-status
plant species have been reported but the habitat is suitable for one-awned spineflower,
robust spineflower, and beach layia. (LUP)
In this area, black legless lizard, a State species of special concern, has been reported as
well. Twelve of these lizards were captured in the dunes along the Carmel shoreline in
1984 during a USFWS study (Bury 1985). Currently, potential habitat for black legless
lizards exists in the eastern portion of the north dunes area where a small pocket of native
dune vegetation exists. Frequent human use of the area and encroachment of non-native
species such as ice plant reduce the area’s value for legless lizard. The potential for these
lizards to still occur along Carmel’s shoreline is considered moderate. No other special-
status wildlife species are expected to occur along the shoreline. (LUP)
ESHA Management guidelines for the Carmel shoreline should be implemented that
respond to the issues of habitat quality enhancement and control of invasive vegetation:
      • Restore, enhance and protect the dunes to improve habitat for Tidestrom’s lupine
      • Develop interpretive signage to educate the public about dune ecology and
            discourage trampling of dune vegetation
      • Avoid planting and control the spread of invasive, non-native plants
      • Monitor the population of Tidestrom’s lupine and adjust management programs to

Water Quality, Drainage and Marine Resources
The City presently coordinates with the Carmel Area Wastewater District, the County of
Monterey and other public agencies concerning the status and impact of future
development on the water quality of the Carmel Bay Area of Special Biological
Significance (ASBS). Since Carmel Bay is not under the direct planning purview of the
City, this coordination role is the appropriate response for the City to this concern.
Compared to the impact of growth in other areas, the impact of Carmel growth on future
water supply and quality is minimal. However, the City has an important role to play in
assuring that new development in the incorporated City limits does not contribute to
water quality impacts from storm water or drainage discharges into the bay. (LUP)
Storm runoff onto Carmel Beach has been addressed in two fashions. First, the
Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments, in preparation of the area wide 2008
water quality plan, reviewed the issue of runoff. It noted that high-density development
has been causing sediment discharge in the area and encouraged local jurisdictions to
adopt erosion and sediment control ordinances. Second, and more specifically, the
adopted policy of the City is to clean the portions of the beach affected by runoff and
sediment deposits after each winter. In this fashion, build-up of potential contaminates is
prevented and the general quality of the sand is enhanced. Once each year, the beach is
also re-contoured under the policies of the Shoreline Management Plan to reestablish the
beach and bluff configuration, which is altered throughout the course of each year by
visitor foot traffic. (LUP)
As a third management approach, the City is developing its NPDES Phase II Storm
Water Plan (SWMP) and procedures manual that incorporates Best Management
Practices to reduce the negative effects related to storm water runoff. The program
outlines six minimum measures to proactively attack the problem of storm water runoff
in a semi-urban area like Carmel. Minimum measures of the Storm Water Management
Plan (SWMP) shall include:
                  Public education and outreach
                  Public participation and involvement
                  Illicit discharge detection and elimination

                  redevelopments. (LUP)
Best Management Practices (BMPs) include the City’s routine street sweeping of roads,
parking lots, and the commercial area. The education component informs residents of the
consequences of using pesticides/fertilizers, and the benefits of cleaning up after pets.
BMPs will address construction site “do’s and don’ts.” The City also has installed large
storm water filter devices at the ends of Ocean Avenue and Fourth Avenue. Additional
storm water filter systems are being installed at Sunset Center and at Eleventh
Avenue/Torres Street near Mission Trail Nature Preserve. These systems collect runoff
from the commercial area and the Ocean Avenue corridor removing debris and suspended
materials before conveying runoff directly to the beach or into Mission Trail Nature
Preserve and ultimately into Carmel Bay. Additionally, the Carmel Shoreline
Management Plan includes a commitment to evaluate the feasibility of retrofitting storm
water outfalls on the beach south of Ocean Avenue with filtration or treatment devices.

ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY ELEMENT
Introduction and Purpose
The Environmental Safety Element focuses on reducing human injury, loss of life, property
damage, and the economic and social dislocation caused by natural and human-made hazards.
The policies included in this element are intended to provide a framework to address natural and
human induced hazards through prevention and emergency response. This element seeks to
guide the continuous development of preventative measures that address existing and potential
hazards, while also providing contingent emergency response procedures in the instance of a
local or regional emergency.
Issues of Local Significance
The following issues were identified as relevant to the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea and are
addressed in the Goals, Objectives, and Policies and Supporting Information sections.
         Earthquakes
         Landslides
         Drainage/Flooding
         Fire
         Tsunami
         Disaster Preparedness
This element also includes some of the findings gathered through the Community Survey
(Survey). The Survey was prepared as part of the public outreach process to gain a broader
response from the community, property owners, and businesses on issues facing Carmel. The
complete Survey report can be found in Appendix A.

Seismic Hazards
Historical Seismic Hazards
California is situated in a seismically active area that lies within the California Coast Ranges
geomorphic and physiographic province. The region’s geology is dominated by active tectonics
on the margin between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. Regional tectonic forces
generate an estimated relative motion between the North American and Pacific plates of
approximately two inches per year.
The entire California Coast and Coast Range area is prone to earthquakes. Based on history, the
probability of a moderate or high magnitude earthquake occurring in the greater Monterey region
in the next few decades is quite likely. Table 8.1: Major Historical Earthquakes in the Region,
summarizes the year, epicenter, and magnitude of major historical quakes that have affected the
Monterey County region since 1900.

Regional and Local Faults
Faults that could present a hazard to Carmel during an earthquake event include the following
active or potentially active faults: San Andreas, San Gregorio-Palo Colorado, Chupines, Navy,
and Cypress Point. The San Andreas and San Gregorio faults are two dominant faults within the
Monterey County region that are considered active with evidence of historic or recent movement.
Figure 8.1: Regional and Local Faults of Significance, maps the location of faults that could
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                           September 2009

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                       Environmental Safety Element
present a hazard to Carmel. Active and potentially active faults are mapped as lines rather than
zones. It should be recognized that areas immediately adjacent to the mapped fault lines may
include secondary or branch faults. Therefore, the active and potentially active fault lines shown
on the maps should be treated as zones of approximately an eighth of a mile on either side of the
fault lines. This corresponds with the width of Special Studies Zones established pursuant to the
Alquist-Priolo Act. The hazard potentials along the active and potentially active faults include a
high potential for ground rupture and a moderate to severe ground shaking potential near the
fault.
Landslides
Landslide is a general term for the dislodgment and fall of a mass of soil or rocks along a sloped
surface or for the dislodged mass itself. The term is used for varying phenomena, including
mudflows, mudslides, debris flows, rock falls, rockslides, debris avalanches, debris slides, and
slump-earth flows. Landslides may result from a wide range of combinations of natural rock,
soil, or artificial fill. The susceptibility of hillside and mountainous areas to landslides depends
on variations in geology, topography, vegetation, and weather. Landslides may also occur due to
indiscriminate development of sloping ground or the creation of cut-and-fill slopes in areas of
unstable or inadequately stable geologic conditions (Monterey County 2007).
Landslides often occur together with other natural hazards, thereby exacerbating conditions, as
described below.
         Shaking due to earthquakes can trigger events ranging from rock falls and topples to
          massive slides.
         Intense or prolonged precipitation that causes flooding can also saturate slopes and
          cause failures leading to landslides.
         Landslides into a reservoir can indirectly compromise dam safety, and a landslide can
          even affect the dam itself.
         Wildfires can remove vegetation from hillsides, significantly increasing runoff and
          landslide potential (Ibid.).
Landslides in Carmel area historically have been caused by waterlogged soil rather than ground
shaking due to an earthquake. As shown on Figure 8.2: Areas Prone to Landslide, there are two
areas historically prone to landslides within the City limits. The first area is located in the north-
central portion of the City, which encompasses the Pescadero Canyon, including portions of 2nd,
3rd, and 4th Avenues, and Camino Del Monte Avenue, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. The second
area prone to landslides is located in the eastern portion of the City and encompasses the eastern
portion of the Mission Trail Nature Preserve.

Flood Hazards
Flooding is the accumulation of water where usually none occurs or the overflow of excess water
from a stream, river, lake, reservoir, or coastal body of water onto adjacent floodplains.
Floodplains are lowlands adjacent to water bodies that are subject to recurring floods. Floods are
natural events that are considered hazards only when people and property are affected (Monterey
County 2007).
Physical damage from floods includes the following:
        Inundation of structures, causing water damage to structural elements and contents.
        Erosion or scouring of stream banks, roadway embankments, foundations, footings for
         bridge piers, and other features.
        Impact damage to structures, roads, bridges, culverts, and other features from high-
         velocity flow and from debris carried by floodwaters.
        Destruction of crops, erosion of topsoil, and deposition of debris and sediment on
         croplands.
        Release of sewage and hazardous or toxic materials as wastewater treatment plants are
         inundated, storage tanks are damaged, and pipelines are severed.
Floods also cause economic losses through closure of businesses and government facilities,
disrupt communications, disrupt the provision of utilities such as water and sewer service, result
in excessive expenditures for emergency response, and generally disrupt the normal function of a
community. In Monterey County two types of flooding occur: riverine flooding, also known as
overbank flooding, due to excessive rainfall, and coastal flooding due to wave run-up (Monterey
County 2007).
Carmel is located on a sloping terrain that offers good storm water runoff into both the Pacific
Ocean and the Carmel River. As shown on Figure 8.3: Flood Hazard Zones and Localized
Flooding Areas, only a small portion of the City’s southern tip is designated as a FEMA 100-
year Flood Zone. Mission Fields, a residential area, is within the 100-year floodplain, as are the
Carmel Center/Carmel Rancho shopping centers.
Coastal Flooding
Coastal flooding in Monterey County is generally caused by wave run-up. Pacific Ocean storms
in the months of November through February in conjunction with high tides and strong winds
can cause significant wave run-up. In addition to intense offshore storms, coastal flooding from
the Pacific Ocean can also be attributed to seismic sea-waves or tsunamis that can occur at any
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                   September 2009
                                            Page 8 - 9

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                      Environmental Safety Element
time of the year. As such, coastal flooding can be exacerbated by the physical characteristics of
the continental shelf and shoreline.
Carmel Beach is subject to flooding during high tide and beach sand is lost yearly during winter
storms. The beach is a clearly separated from adjacent roads and houses by a moderately steep
hill. As shown in Figure 8.3: Flood Hazard Zones and Localized Flooding Areas, due to that
topographical feature, the coastal flooding rarely extends past the beach.
Localized Flooding
Localized flooding may occur outside of recognized drainage channels or delineated floodplains
due to a combination of locally heavy precipitation, increased surface runoff, and inadequate
facilities for drainage and stormwater conveyance. Such events frequently occur in flat areas and
in urbanized areas with large impermeable surfaces. Local drainage may result in “nuisance
flooding,” in which streets or parking lots are temporarily closed and minor property damage
occurs (Monterey County 2007).
There are several areas of the City, which have been identified as being prone to localized
flooding. The main area subject to localized flooding is located within the Mission Trail Nature
Preserve (see Figure 8.3: Flood Hazard Zones and Localized Flooding Areas). The Mission
Trail site is owned by the City and used as a park. This use mitigates some of the damage that
would normally result from the retention of water on the site.
Figure 8.3: Flood Hazard Zones and Localized Flooding Areas also shows areas that are prone
to periodic flooding during heavy rain events. These areas experience flooding when the City’s
drainage system is overwhelmed by the amount of rain water. Historically, the City’s
stormwater system has had sufficient capacity to accommodate a rainfall of up to two inches a
week. However, several factors, such as an increased amount of debris and reduced ability for
maintenance affect stormwater system capacity. The stormwater systems are maintained
regularly, however, during storm events the maintenance often can’t keep up with the amount of
debris entering the system. As a result, the system experiences serious failures during rainfall of
approximately 10 inches in a week.
Erosion and Landslides
Erosion is a natural process caused by wind, water, and gravitational forces. This process
generally creates two problems: the wear and removal of soil from one site and its deposit in
another. The removal of soil can be damaging through gully erosion, wind blown erosion, the
erosion of stream courses and banks, and the erosion of coastal dunes and beach area. Soil
deposit damage affects flood plains, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and may clog drainage structures.
Development activities frequently accelerate erosion related damages and losses.

            General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                        Environmental Safety Element
Climate is another major contributor to potentially high erosion rates. This is due to a number of
factors:
        Geologic studies indicate that erosion is highest in areas where annual precipitation is
         between 7" and 18". Annual precipitation on the Monterey Peninsula ranges from 12.7"
         on the coast to 17.7" at the higher elevations.
        Most of Carmel's rainfall occurs during the winter when temperatures are too low for
         rapid vegetative growth.
Erosion on sloped inland areas and at the shoreline (beach) has been a problem for much of
Monterey County, including Carmel. A discussion of Carmel beach erosion is included in the
Open Space/ Conservation/Scenic Highway Element. The hazards due to erosion are difficult to
separate from those due to flooding and landsliding. In some cases, erosion is a result of flood
and landslide conditions; in others, rapid water runoff and landsliding can occur in areas subject
to prolonged erosion.
The preventive costs of erosion are generally included within flood control measures and the
overall costs of hillside development. Adoption of the present state of the art procedures for
erosion prevention in hillside areas will, in most cases, eliminate losses.
Losses due to coastal erosion can be reduced most economically by avoiding construction in
areas subject to severe erosion. Erosion of the beach bluffs is addressed in the City's Shoreline
Management and Emergency Operations plans.
Fire Hazards
Fire poses a significant threat to life and property. Fire prevention and safety measures must be
evaluated in all land use and community wide decisions. Fire hazards in the Carmel planning
area can be categorized by fires within urbanized areas, and fires within undeveloped areas or
wildland fire areas.
Factors to Fire Susceptibility
There are several factors affecting the hazard potential of a wildland fire in the Carmel area:
topography, weather conditions, and fire fuel (type of vegetative cover, type and intensity of land
use).
The City of Carmel is located on a hillside. Steep slopes promote spreading of a fire and
increase its speed due to preheating of vegetation. Canyons and hillsides also promote gusts of
wind, which increase the unpredictable and uncontrollable nature of wildfires.
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                  September 2009

            General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                           Environmental Safety Element
Carmel’s topography also creates access issues. The unimproved and narrow roads are an
obstacle to fighting fires. Fire fighting personnel as well as fire trucks and other heavy
equipment have difficulty reaching some of the City’s areas. Containment being a key objective,
areas of limited accessibility have a correspondingly greater potential for fire spreading.
Weather is also a contributing factor to fire hazards. The central coast climate is characterized
by dry summers with virtually no precipitation. As a result the vegetation during the fire prone
summer/fall season is very dry, creating ideal conditions for faster fire spreading. A combination
of a generous rainy season followed by a dry summer can result in large amounts of vegetation
fire fuel. Wind direction and strength rival human proximity and vegetation as significant
factors affecting fire hazard. The City experiences prevailing winds from the beach, which can
potentially result in the spreading of a fire towards the City.
The most significant factor determining overall fire risk is human proximity. The majority of
wildland fires are caused by people and the remaining fires are started primarily by lightning.
New land development may suddenly cause drastic increases in the frequency of fires in areas
that have had few fires in the past. The increase in activity of off road vehicles, such as
motorcycles and mini-bikes, is becoming an ever-increasing source of brush fires as the trend
continues toward more recreational pursuits.
Another contributing factor to wildlife fire potential is accidents related to spark discharges from
transmission lines or leakage from pipelines carrying flammables in and adjacent to brush areas.
Wildland Fires
Carmel’s land area is largely forested and contains a significant amount of open space. There are
several areas in and around the City that qualify as wildland fire hazard areas. These areas are
located to the north and east of the City boundaries and include: to the north, Pescadero Canyon,
Forest Hill Park, and Del Monte Forest; and to east the Mission Trails Nature Preserve.
State Regulatory Context
Most land within the State of California has been designated as either a State Responsibility Area
(SRA) or Local Responsibility Area (LRA). These designations refer to the agency or entity
responsible for providing fire protection services, from either the local entity or the State's
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). In a LRA, the local agency, which is
typically a city, county, or district, is responsible for fire protection. In a SRA, the State bears the
financial responsibility for preventing and suppressing wildland and forest fires.
Land designated by the State as a SRA is subdivided into three categories of Fire Hazard
Severity Zones (FHSZs), either Moderate, High or Very High, based on the fire hazard level
present. Moderate and High zones are currently treated identically in the State's codes and
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                       September 2009

                 General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                            Environmental Safety Element
regulations.1 Very High zones are more stringently regulated and additional constraints on
construction materials and other safety-related restrictions are applicable.2
Within land that has been designated as a LRA, CalFire may recommend that the local entity
further designate land subject to a very high fire hazard as a Local Agency Very High FHSZ.3 In
such zones, the more stringent codes designed for SRA Very High FHSZs will apply.
State Fire Code
Recently, the California Building Standards Commission in collaboration with CalFire adopted
new building codes that apply in all land designated as a SRA. These new codes reduce the risk
of burning embers pushed by wind-blown wildfires from igniting buildings through increased
setbacks and vegetation clearance requirements. Roofing standards vary by the fire hazard zone
rating of the site. The new building codes require siding, exterior doors, decking, windows,
eaves wall vents, and enclosed overhanging decks to meet new test standards. These new codes
apply throughout all SRAs regardless of the fire hazard severity ranking.4 A summary of these
codes are provided below.
Chapter 7A Building Code §§ 701A-704A.5, Wildland-Urban Interface Building Standards: Materials and Construction
Methods for Exterior Wildfire Exposure
Chapter 7A applies to building materials, systems, and assemblies used in the exterior design and
construction of new buildings located within a wildland-urban interface fire area and in SRAs.
Projects that apply for building permits after January 1, 2008 must comply with roofing, attic
ventilation, exterior wall, decking, floor and under-floor protection, and inspection and
certification requirements.
2007 California Fire Code, Chapter 47, Requirements for Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Areas, §§ 4701 – 4713
This Chapter includes roofing and attic ventilation requirements for construction within
wildland-urban interface fire areas and in SRAs of any level of fire hazard severity zone and

of new buildings. While standards have only been set for roofing and attic ventilation, standards
for exterior walls, decking, floors, and under-floor protection and ancillary buildings and
structures may be promulgated in the future (these sections are currently "reserved" in the code).
Public Resources Code §§ 4202, 4291-4299
Revisions to these code sections (Senate Bill 1595, Kehoe, approved September 27, 2008) went
into effect on January 1, 2009. Senate Bill 1595 amends §§ 4202 and 4291. The amendments to §
4202 change the designation process for SRA lands and the new § 4291 requires a 100-foot fire
break around structures in lands within a SRA (or within a wildland-urban interface fire area)
that are covered with flammable materials such as brush, trees, and grasslands. The section
provides details regarding allowable vegetation within the fire break and structure maintenance
requirements concerning flammable vegetative materials. It also includes details regarding
rebuilding in an area previously damaged by fire. The section permits the State fire official to
require construction of a larger fire break, up to 300 feet, around sensitive structures.
Sections 4292 through 4296 oblige owners or operators of electrical transmission lines through
brush-covered areas to observe special maintenance protocols to reduce hazards from wildfire.
The local utility provider would be responsible for compliance with transmission line fire break
precautions.
California Code of Regulations, Title 14 §§ 1270-1299—CalFire SRA Fire Safe Regulations
These regulations set out basic wildland fire protection standards for building, construction, and
development within SRAs. These regulations are silent regarding whether they are equally
applicable within Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Areas. Measures include specifications for
emergency access and road design, signage and building numbering, private water supply
reserves for emergency fire use and vegetation modification. These regulations do not apply to
existing structures, roads, streets, and private lanes or facilities.
Local jurisdictions approving construction within an SRA must provide the Director of Forestry
and Fire Protection with notice of applications for building permits, tentative parcel maps,
tentative maps, and use permits for construction or development within an SRA. The local
jurisdiction must also ensure that applicable sections of the CalFire SRA Fire Safe Regulations
become a condition of approval of any applicable construction or development permit or map.
Local Fire Hazard Severity Zones
Wildland fire protection in California is the responsibility of either the State, local government,
or the federal government. Local responsibility areas include incorporated cities, cultivated
agriculture lands, and portions of the desert. Local responsibility area fire protection is typically
provided by city fire departments, fire protection districts, counties, and by Cal Fire under
contract to local government.

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                      Environmental Safety Element
California law requires Cal Fire to identify areas based on the severity of fire hazard that is
expected to prevail there. These areas, or “zones,” are based on factors such as fuel (material
that can burn), slope and fire weather. There are three zones, based on increasing fire hazard:
medium, high and very high. To determine Local Responsibility Areas (LRAs), Cal Fire used an
extension of the state responsibility area Fire Hazard Severity Zone model as the basis for
evaluating fire hazard in an LRA. The local responsibility area hazard rating reflects flame and
ember intrusion from adjacent wildlands and from flammable vegetation in the urban area.
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Fire Hazard Severity Zone Local
Responsibility Areas (LRA) map for Carmel-by-the-Sea, identifies a large area encompassing
northern and eastern portions of the City as a Very High fire hazard severity zone (see Figure
8.4: State and Local Responsibility Area Fire Hazard Severity Zones).
Local Responsibility Area Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone maps are used to identify areas
where ignition resistant building standards will be required for new construction, to identify
properties requiring defensible space maintenance, and by sellers to disclose natural hazards at
the time of property sale.
Urbanized Forest Fires
Carmel-by-the-Sea is often referred to as a village in the forest, due to its extensive urban forest.
While this forest is a major community asset, it also poses a potential significant fuel source for a
fire within the community. Fires can be a threat within built up areas of a community; there is
the ever-present danger of rapidly spreading fire. The high density of structures within the
Carmel residential areas and business district among numerous trees increase the fire hazard.
Many buildings in the Commercial District are very closely located with a lot of the buildings
having common walls.
Most construction within Carmel contains wood; most roofs are made of combustible materials,
while some made of tile. While installation of fire sprinkler systems is required with substantial
remodels, older structures in both the commercial and residential districts do not have this fire
fighting system in place.
Fires in homes can result from a number of causes, though primarily through human
carelessness. Other causes include faulty heating systems and substandard electrical wiring. In
addition, high-density development, small setbacks and narrow roads limit the effectiveness of
fire fighting efforts.
Fire Department
The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea Fire Department (Department) has one fire station equipped with
two type-one engines and one rescue unit.
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                    September 2009

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                     Environmental Safety Element
The Carmel-by-the-Sea Fire Department's response time goal for the first engine company is to
meet the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard of 5 minutes or less 90% of the
time. The actual response times that include turnout time for the Department is four minutes or
less 95% of the time. Carmel-by-the-Sea is also part of state and county wide contractual
agreements to provide mutual and automatic aid to each other on an as needed basis.
Historic Fire Causes
Historically, the main causes of fire in Carmel have been caused by human element. Most of the
fire related incidents are of small nature. Of the 960 incidents that the Carmel Fire Department
responded to in 2008, there were eight structure fires, four trash fires, four vehicle fires, and
three chimney fires. Table 8.2: Carmel Fire Department Incident Report: 2008, summarizes the
main types of events that the Department responded to during year 2008, including fire related
events.

Firefighting-Related Water Supply
The City of Carmel Fire Department requires a fire flow of 1,500 to 2,000 gallons per minute
(gpm) for a time limit of two to four hours. The water system can currently meet this demand.
One of the challenges that Carmel faced was related to a large number of failed hydrants. At the
beginning of 2007, the City in cooperation with California American water (Cal-Am) identified
29 of 201 hydrants within the City limits that were found inadequate for fire protection (Cal-Am
2009).
Cal-Am took several actions to address these inadequacies. In several areas of the City
experiencing low flow rates, Cal-Am replaced four inch flow mains with eight inch flow mains.

These larger underground mains are capable of delivering more water under higher pressure. In
addition, Cal-Am reviewed the fire hydrant network to remove redundancies, address hydrants
which experienced low flow, and assure adequate number and distribution of fire hydrants
throughout the City. In total, 23 hydrants were removed, eight hydrants experiencing low flows
were replaced and connected to the new eight-inch flow mains, and 15 new hydrants were
installed. During this process, the remaining 172 operational hydrants were fully capable of
supporting fire fighters throughout the City (Cal-Am 2009).
Fire Safety Proactive Measures
There are several measures that the City is undertaking in order to minimize the chance and/or
spreading of a fire. The FPB department has an active pruning and removal of trees program that
addresses safety concerns related to fire hazards and falling trees. Trees are evaluated during
yearly tree surveys, city drives, and reports from City staff and the public. Once a tree is deemed
a safety concern, it is pruned or removed completely. Preventative pruning minimizes damage
from trees during storm events. The FPB also responds to reports of rocking trees during storms,
and intervenes when possible. The Public Works department assists the FPB department with
heavy equipment and staff. As part of the management for forest viability, the FPB department
also controls forest disease (such as pitch canker) and implements pruning for structure, strength,
and a healthy canopy as well as removal of dead trees. These measures successfully remove
excessive fire fuel.
Sprinklers Requirements
Many of the buildings within the City are older and have minimal separation from adjacent
buildings. The age of the structure often means that a fire prevention system, such as sprinklers
was not installed. The commercial district contains many older structures, which also share
common walls.
In an on-going process of remodeling and rebuilding of older structures, the renovations that pass
a statutory threshold are required to include fire systems in their remodel. Of the approximately
250 commercial buildings in Carmel, more than half are equipped with fire alarm systems, and
approximately 20 percent have automatic fire sprinkler systems. Fire alarm systems in Carmel
are required to be Central Station Service fire systems, which are the most reliable systems
referenced in the National Fire Alarm Code. These systems can monitor inputs from smoke
detectors, heat detectors, manual fire alarm boxes, and fire sprinkler water flow switches.
Roof Requirements
The Survey reveled that most respondents have wood shakes/shingles or asphalt/composition
shingles as their roof material. Twenty nine percent of respondents reported as having wood
shakes or wood shingles and 34 percent reported asphalt/composition shingles as their roof

The City’s Municipal Code Section 15.08.120 – Roofing Materials, requires that any new roof
covering, or in the event of re-roofing of 25 percent or more of any existing roof, has to be made
of fire-retardant material that meets or exceeds Class A. Class A is the highest fire-resistance
rating for roofing and indicates roofing that is able to withstand severe exposure to fire
originating from sources outside the building.
Tsunami
Tsunamis, also known as seismic sea waves, are a series of enormous waves created by an
underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite, with
earthquakes being the most common cause. A tsunami spreads in all directions from its origin
with speeds up to hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean. As a wave approaches the
shore, it builds in height and could become as high as 100 feet or more (FEMA 2006).
A single tsunami event may involve a series of waves, known as a train, of varying heights. In
open water, tsunamis have extremely long periods of time (from minutes to hours) for the next
wave top to pass a point after the previous one. Additionally, a tsunami wavelength can extend
up to several hundred miles, very different from typical wind-generated swells on the ocean,
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                     September 2009

            General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                      Environmental Safety Element
which might have a period of about 10 seconds and a wavelength of 300 feet (Monterey County
2007).
The actual height of a tsunami wave in open water is generally only 1 to 3 feet and is often
practically unnoticeable to people on ships. The energy of a tsunami passes through the entire
water column to the seabed, unlike surface waves, which typically reach only down to a depth of
30 feet or so. The tsunami wave travels across the ocean at speeds up to 700 miles per hour
(mph). As the wave approaches land, the sea shallows and the wave no longer travels as quickly,
so the wave begins to “pile up” as the wave-front becomes steeper and taller, and less distance
occurs between crests. Therefore, the wave can increase to a height of 90 feet or more as it
approaches the coastline and compresses. This steepening process is often compared to the
sound of a cracking whip (Monterey County 2007). The height of a wave depends on the
topography of the coastline, resulting in different hazard levels of closely located beaches with
different topography. Areas at greatest risk are less than 25 feet above sea level and within a
mile of the shoreline (FEMA 2006).
Hazards associated with tsunamis include: life loss, property damage, flooding, contamination of
drinking water, and fires from gas lines or ruptured tanks (FEMA 2006).
Regional Setting
A tsunami not only affects beaches that are open to the ocean, but also bay mouths, tidal flats,
and the shores of large coastal rivers. Tsunami waves can also diffract around land masses. And
since tsunamis are not symmetrical, the waves may be much stronger in one direction than
another, depending on the nature of the source and the surrounding geography. However,
tsunamis do propagate outward from their source, so coasts in the shadow of affected land
masses are usually fairly safe.
As shown in Table 8.3: Historic Monterey County Tsunami Events: 1806-2006, over the last
200 years, eight observed tsunamis generated waves in Monterey County. Almost all of the
tsunamis were produced by earthquakes and resulted in wave run-ups of 1 meter or less. A
tsunami in 1960 produced severe currents in Monterey, Moss Landing, and Pacific Grove and is
blamed for one death.

Tsunami Warning Systems
The West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WCATWC) issues warnings for the North
America West Coast, including Monterey County. A tsunami warning is issued when a potential
tsunami with significant widespread inundation is imminent or expected. To provide the earliest
possible alert, initial warnings are based only on seismic information (Monterey County 2008).
When a warning has to be issued, the WCATWC notifies the California State Warning Center in
Sacramento, which in turn notifies all coastal county Public Safety Answering Points. The
WCATWC also notifies the National Weather Service (NWS) and federal defense interests. The
NWS activates the Emergency Alert System (EAS), which is the method TV and radio media use
to warn the public. These warnings produce an alert tone, then an audio message, or come across
TV screens as a text scrolling across the screen (Monterey County 2008).
The Monterey County Emergency Communications Center is responsible for notifying local
agencies, including all law and fire agencies, the office of Emergency Service, and the
Emergency Medical Service Agency of any warnings issued by the WCATWC (Monterey
County 2008).
Local Tsunami Hazards
As shown in Figure 8.5: Tsunami Hazard Areas, the City of Carmel would be minimally
affected by a moderate to extreme tsunami event. According to the Multi-Jurisdictional Hazards
Mitigation Plan, under a scenario of a 21-foot run-up, only nine people, seven residential
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                                      September 2009
                                                            Page 8 - 21

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                        Environmental Safety Element
buildings, and two non-residential buildings are located with in this hazards area along the
southern portion of the City.
This can be accredited to coastal topography along Carmel’s western boundary. The steep cliff,
or a step-down in elevation between the Scenic Road and the beach, acts as a protective
boundary during a tsunami event.
The relatively flat topography in the southern portion of the City and immediately adjacent to the
City, on the other hand, lends itself to a more significant wave run-up. The most significantly
affected is comparable to the area affected by the floods.
Tsunami Evacuation Areas
As discussed above, tsunami vulnerability in the City of Carmel is limited to its beachfront area
and the southeastern most portion of town that is near the Mission Fields / Carmel River Lagoon
area. If an evacuation is ordered, there are two areas that may need to be evacuated. The first is
the Carmel Beach and the approximately 100 oceanfront homes along Scenic Rd. Although the
oceanfront homes are above the tsunami evacuation zone, the homes could experience a “splash
effect” should a tsunami strike the coast (Monterey County 2008).
The second area is near the Carmel Mission. This area would need to be evacuated in the event
of a tsunami greater than five meters (17 feet). However, it is an area that may be populated by
many visitors and nearby schoolchildren. Junipero Serra School / Carmel Mission is located just
outside the evacuation zone, but may need to be evacuated out of precaution (Monterey County
2008).
The Carmel Police Department would be the lead agency in any evacuation. Evacuation will
include clearing the beach of all people, to include swimmers and surfers. For evacuating the
homes along Scenic Rd., notification by either door-to-door contact or police cruiser public
address systems will be used to notify those in the evacuation zone (Monterey County 2008).
Although the tsunami vulnerability in Carmel is limited, that areas immediately south of the city
limits have a much higher chance of being inundated. It is important that these areas be avoided
during a tsunami warning. The Carmel River Lagoon and the Crossroads Shopping Center / Post
Office are some of the areas that should be avoided (Monterey County 2008).
Hazardous Waste
A material is considered hazardous if it has been designated as such by a federal, state, or local
agency, or if it has characteristics defined as hazardous by such an agency. The California Code
of Regulations defines a hazardous material as a substance that, because of physical or chemical
properties, its quantity, concentration, or other characteristics, may either (1) cause an increase in
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                     September 2009

mortality or an increase in serious, irreversible, or incapacitating illness; or (2) pose a substantial
present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored,
transported or disposed of, or otherwise managed (22 CCR §66260.10 and California Health and
Safety Code [HSC] §25501). Based on this definition, “hazardous materials” include, but are not
limited to, hazardous substances, hazardous waste, and any material that a handler or the
administering agency has a reasonable basis for believing would be injurious to the health and
safety of persons or harmful to the environment if released into the workplace or the
environment (22 CCR §66260.10).
Chemical residuals in soil that are the result of the normal application of fertilizer, plant growth
regulants, and pesticides for agricultural purposes do not constitute a release of hazardous
substances under the California Hazardous Substances Account Act (HSC §25321 (d)).
Similarly, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (CERCLA) exempts parties from liability for the application of federally-registered
pesticides (42 USC §9607(i)).
Regulation of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes occurs at the federal, state, and local
levels of government. On the federal level, many hazardous materials-related regulations are
promulgated by the EPA. Additional regulations pertaining to work place standards and for
transportation of hazardous materials are enforced by the United States Department of Labor
Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and the United States Department of
Transportation (DOT).
On the state level, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), Department of
Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), and Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) are
responsible for overseeing many remediation and monitoring activities performed for sites in
California with hazardous materials. Carmel is located within the jurisdiction of the Central
Coast RWQCB. Regulations pertaining to work place standards and for transportation of
hazardous materials are enforced by the State of California Division of Occupational Safety and
Health (Cal-OSHA).

The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea has no facilities for permanent storage or transfer of hazardous
waste. The City has no industrial zone or zoning district compatible with a hazardous waste site.
The City is not in the vicinity of any pipeline, nor on the route of an airline transporting
potentially hazardous materials. As such the most probable exposure would be due to transport
of hazardous materials on state highways.
In Carmel-by-the-Sea, hazardous waste is generated by households (paint products, motor oil,
solvents, pesticides, oven cleaners and disinfectants), and a small number of commercial
generators (dry cleaners, service stations, and photo processing).
Compared to County-wide waste generation, Carmel’s community generates relatively little
hazardous waste because of the small population and limited number of waste-generating
commercial businesses. Future additional hazardous waste generation will primarily be from an
increase in the number of households. Land use policies of the City limit the expansion of
commercial uses, so that future additional commercial sources of waste will be limited.
Household generators must dispose of materials individually. Frequently, materials are
improperly disposed of through the regular trash pickup or poured down the storm drains. Long-
term storage on residential sites creates a health and safety hazard.
A portion of the City located east of Junipero Avenue is located within the one mile hazards
corridor along Highway 1. Residents and structures located within this buffer would potentially
be exposed to hazardous materials if there was an incident during transport of such materials on
Highway 1.
In the event of hazardous material incidents in the City, the Monterey County Hazardous
Materials Incident Plan (2007) would govern field operations and response. The City of
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                                     September 2009

Carmel-by-the-Sea is one of many jurisdictions within Monterey County participating in this
response plan.
The purpose of this plan is to establish specific emergency management policies and procedures
for coordinating Monterey County's integrated response to hazardous materials incidents, in
accordance with California Code of Regulations as it relates to the implementation of the
requirements of the California Health and Safety Code. The Plan establishes procedures for
response to hazardous material incidents, clean up and cost recovery as well as other post-
incident operations, preparedness and training (Monterey County 2007b).
Disaster Preparedness
Regional Emergency Preparedness
The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea has adopted by resolution the Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard
Mitigation Plan, Monterey County, CA (2007). The plan profiles hazards, assesses risks and
capabilities, as well as develops mitigation strategies for various hazards in the Monterey County
and local communities, including Carmel. Hazards addressed in this plan include:
         Coastal erosion;
         Dam failure;
         Earthquake;
         Flood;
         Hazardous materials events;
         Landslide;
         Tsunami;
         Wildland fire; and
         Windstorm.
The plan discusses these hazards in the context of the entire Monterey County as well as
jurisdictions within the County. In addition to Carmel-by-the-Sea, the plan also includes
discussion of hazards for the cities of Del Rey Oaks, Gonzales, Greenfield, King City, Marina,
Monterey, Pacific Grove, Salinas, and Sand City. Each of the jurisdictions has adopted the plan
by a local jurisdiction (Monterey County 2007).
The mitigation strategy included within the plan provides a blueprint for reducing the potential
life and property loses identified in the risk assessment of each of the hazards. For the
countywide mitigation strategy, the plan provides a list of mitigation goals and actions based

Local Emergency Preparedness
Carmel’s Emergency Operation Plan (CEOP) 2008, incorporates the policies and principles of
the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Standardized Emergency
Management System (SEMS), which were originally developed and employed by the State of
California. The purpose of CEOP is to provide guidelines for operations during all hazard
emergencies that could affect the City (Carmel 2008).
In times of emergency, the CEOP is implemented by the Carmel Emergency Operations Center
(CEOC). The primary purpose of the CEOC is to provide a centralized focal point for the
effective management of all emergency response operations. Specifically, the activation of the
CEOC facilitates and centralizes the following activities:
         Decision making and command authority;
         Coordination of all emergency functions;
         Management of information;
         Warning dissemination;
         Resource application; and
         Resource support and procurement (Carmel 2008).
The CEOC primary facility is located in the basement of the Carmel Police Department, on the
southeast corner of Junipero and 4th Avenues. The alternate CEOC is located in the Carmel Fire
Station, on Sixth Avenue between Mission and San Carlos Streets and will be used in the event
that the primary CEOC is not usable. The design and organization of the CEOC creates
centralized management of all operational and support components, allowing the most efficient
use of available resources within a framework of supporting strategies and response objectives
(Carmel 2008).
The CEOP describes the function of each of the seven sections involved in operation of the
CEOC, which are described in brief below:

        The Mayor and City Council set the overall policies for emergency management and
         support the Emergency Services Manager in their duties. The Mayor and City Council
         can also serve as an effective means of communication between residents and the
         CEOC staff;
        The Command Section is responsible for overall management of any disaster response
         and recovery operations for the City. The Emergency Services Director leads the
         Command Section and CEOC staff;
        The operations section is responsible for coordinating response and recovery
         operations;
        The Planning/Intelligence Section is responsible for all operational, strategic, and
         demobilization planning, disaster intelligence collection, assessment, and processing,
         report preparation, and incident documentation;
        The Logistics Section is responsible for establishment and management of the logistics
         efforts, including providing logistical information to the Director, managing and
         coordinating the provisions, and allocation and use of essential resources and services
         to support emergency operations;
        The Finance/Administration Section is responsible for providing, monitoring, and
         analyzing all elements of direct financial and administrative support to the CEOC staff;
         and
        The Public Information Section coordinates the origination and dissemination of all
         public information for the City (Carmel 2008).
To activate the emergency disaster aid a “Declaration of Local State of Emergency” has to be
proclaimed by one of the authorized individuals. For the City of Carmel, the following
individuals have the authority to proclaim a local emergency:
        The Emergency Service Director (City Administrator), requested when the City Council
         is in session;
        The Mayor or the Emergency Service Director, requested when the City Council is not
         in session; and
        The Director of Public Safety in the absence of the Mayor and the Emergency Service
         Director (Carmel 2008).
Following the ratification of proclamation of local emergency by the City Council, a designated
City Hall personnel contacts the Library (Main and Park branches), Community Services
Department, and the Information Systems Department that the CEOC has been activated (Carmel
2008).

Communication During Emergencies
In 2008, the City has implemented a Telephone Emergency Notification System (TENS). The
unique TENS technology allows rapid dissemination of emergency and non-emergency
information to the residents by phone. The phone company sends the District monthly updates
of local phone numbers, and the system allows the District to develop call lists in advance based
on a certain criteria (i.e. residents who need assistance during an evacuation) or real-time by
using computerized maps (Carmel 2008).
In case of declared emergencies, the TENS can be activated by the City’s Incident Commanders,
who contact the Watch supervisor at the Monterey County Emergency Communications Center
or Monterey County Office of Emergency Services. The Incident Commander can specify which
areas, on a street by street basis, need to be evacuated.
The fire departments also maintain an on-going list of residents that are known to require special
assistance during times of emergency. This list allows the emergency responders to quickly
address the needs of those residents who usually require additional time and resources during an
evacuation.
Evacuation Routes
In certain emergencies or disaster, e.g., tsunami, there will be a definite need for Carmel
residents to move quickly to other areas that are beyond the danger zone. While not all Carmel
residents may be affected by any one disaster, with the possible exception of a major earthquake,
an overall evacuation plan established in conjunction with the adopted Emergency Operation
Plan should be available to the residents of Carmel. Figure 8.6: Evacuation Routes, shows the
designated operational area and city evacuation routes. Evacuations are typically situation-
dependent and may be designated by the Incident Commander. However, these pre-designated
evacuation routes should result in expedient evacuation of the City.
In case of mass evacuation all the City field personnel would be summoned for evacuation
assistance. In addition to City staff, active citizen volunteers, who are employed under the
Volunteers in Policing (VIP) program would be summoned, as needed. The Police Department
is also in the process of developing an ancillary volunteer program known as Emergency
Volunteer Assistance Program (EVAP), which will seek to employ volunteers solely for the
purpose of assisting in major emergencies. These volunteers would fall under the command and
control of the Police Department and would assist with numerous emergency-related tasks,
including assistance with evacuation.
Emergency Service Delivery
The major day-to-day emergency services are provided by the Carmel-by-the-Sea Police and Fire
Departments. Emergency medical aid and transportation is provided by the Fire Department
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                  September 2009

within the district with major emergency medical services provided at the Monterey Peninsula
Community Hospital located on Highway 68, approximately three miles from Carmel. The
American Red Cross (Dolores Street and Eighth Avenue) provides disaster preparedness
training, first aid training, and shelter and feeding during a disaster.
Emergency Services are described in more detail in Public Facilities and Services Element.
Challenges to the Disaster Response
There are several challenges to the provision of emergency services in the City of Carmel-by-
the-Sea. The City is mostly developed and is often characterized as a village among the forest.
While this is one of the key attributes of the City, the village layout creates access challenges for
the emergency vehicles. Many of the roads in the residential districts are very narrow and lack
adequate turnaround space for larger emergency vehicles, such as fire trucks. In addition to
access, the tightly knit community of houses and trees doesn’t provide adequate fuel breaks
throughout the City.
Another aspect of the “village” character that creates an obstacle to emergency response is lack
of addresses. The lack of house numbers in response to emergencies such as fire, or flooding
may not have a significant impact on the ability of emergency responders to find a property, as
these are usually highly visible events. However, in case of a medical emergency, lack of the
house number may delay the arrival of the medical team.
As discussed in the Public Facilities and Services Element, the water supply is one of the biggest
challenges for Carmel and other Monterey Peninsula Cities. The City and its emergency
responders have a limited supply of water. In case of a large, regional fire incident, where
adjoining cities would be also drawing on water supply, the City of Carmel may experience
inadequate water supply to fight fires.

LAND USE AND COMMUNITY CHARACTER
ELEMENT
Introduction
Carmel-by-the-Sea is internationally recognized as a unique small coastal community
with a residential village character. Early development was predominantly residential.
Commercial development began as small-scale village enterprises designed to serve the
needs of the local residents. Through the years, these commercial uses have expanded to
cater largely to visitors. (LUP)
Located adjacent to Carmel Bay with gently rising slopes, the City has conscientiously
retained its residential village character in a forest setting, dominated by Monterey Pines.
The special character of this residential coastal community is considered a unique asset of
statewide and national significance that should be maintained as a resource both for local
residents and for visitors. The incorporated limits of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea shall
be designated a special community and a highly scenic area within the meaning of
Coastal Act sections 30251 and 30253 and for the purposes of implementing section
30610 and corresponding regulation section 13250 of the California Code of Regulations.
New development shall protect this special community and its unique characteristics.
(LUP)
Scope and Purpose
This Chapter of the General Plan includes topics typically covered a in Land Use
Element. The Land Use Element has the broadest scope of the seven required General
Plan Elements and has been required by California law in all General Plans since 1955. It
relates to many of the community issues in the other elements and plays a major role in
synthesizing all land use issues, constraints and opportunities. According to State
guidelines, the Land Use Element should:
      • “Promote a balanced and functional mix of land uses consistent with community
            values,
      • Guide public and private investment, and
      • Reflect the opportunities and constraints affecting land use identified in the other
            elements of the General Plan.”

         General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan              Land Use & Community Character Element
This Element discusses existing land uses, analyzes existing and potential conflicts
between land uses and offers recommendations in the form of policy statements
concerning specific issues unique to Carmel. The term “land use” refers generally to
broad categories such as residential or commercial. The term describes physical
improvements on land such as a house, motel, or retail outlet. Land use also describes the
human activities that take place. Carmel's land use policies must be linked with the
overriding social, economic and community values in Carmel. This Element integrates
land use policies with issues of design, aesthetics and historic preservation as part of the
Coastal Land Use Plan for the City.
Issues of Local Significance
The preservation of the residential character in Carmel is central to all land use issues that
are addressed in this Element. The General Plan Advisory Committee evaluated land use
issues for over six months. Based on the input from that Committee, the feeling of
Carmel residents is that there tends to be too much commercial use in Carmel and that
this could be detrimental to the character and residential focus of the community. The
mix of commercial uses for Carmel should be carefully considered and effort should be
made to encourage a mix that is beneficial to the city. This effort should also promote and
encourage more resident serving commercial uses, and in general high quality businesses.
The issues can be summarized as follows.
      • Maintaining a predominantly residential village character.
      • Encouraging land uses which provide goods and services for local residents.
      • Managing the commercial areas and tourist related businesses and activities in
            Carmel in a manner that is economically sound for the community and not
            detrimental to Carmel's residential character.
      • Evaluating the existing mix of businesses in the City and encouraging a mix
            appropriate to the needs of the community.
      • Providing land use policies, which define the appropriate level of commercial
            activity within the existing boundaries of the commercial district.
      • Limiting land uses that consume excessive amounts of water, but with the
            understanding that the severity of water shortages will vary from year to year and
            may be mitigated by new supplies.

Community Character and Development Background
Community Character
Incorporated in 1916, Carmel-by-the-Sea is a relatively young city by historical
standards. Prior to 1888, there was no commercial center and few residences. The City's
development pattern evolved from its natural setting and from the subdivision and
construction activity that took place over a relatively short time period during the City’s
first half century. This activity established a unique city with a strong residential focus, a
respect for the natural environment, a compact development pattern and a wide variety of
architectural designs. (LUP)
The natural setting of Carmel is dominated by a southwest-facing slope, which rolls
gently towards the Pacific Ocean. This slope is intersected by several drainages resulting
in a variety of hills, cross slopes and other topographic challenges. Within these
drainages and on the upper slopes of the City, a natural Monterey Pine forest existed.
These trees formed an upper canopy. A lower canopy of Coast Live oaks also was part of
the forest. On the lower slopes (approximately west of present day Casanova Street) were
sand dunes and coastal scrub. The beach along Carmel’s shore is made of fine, white
sand. These natural features are part of the community character and attracted settlers and
visitors to Carmel, just as they do today. (LUP)
The first subdivisions were filed before incorporation beginning in 1888 forming the
basis for subsequent development and the City’s road system (see Figure 1.1 Chronology
of Major Subdivisions). These subdivisions established a grid of streets and avenues with
virtually no respect for topography or other natural constraints. Blocks of 20 lots each
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                     Page 1-3

(ten lots per block face) were created by most of these subdivisions. Each lot typically
measured 40 feet by 100 feet with the long axis of the lot running east-west. This
represents a potential residential density of 11 units per acre. Streets were established on
paper at 50 to 60 feet in width. In Carmel's early days these streets were unpaved or
nonexistent. (LUP)
The combination of the City’s natural setting and these subdivision patterns is responsible
for much of the City's character. The keys to making this marriage of a grid subdivision
and a constrained environment work were to avoid over-building and to recognize the
natural constraints at each location. For example, most roads were not paved to their full,
dedicated width. Instead, the minimum width necessary for access and safety was the
standard. This allowed roads to follow the best topography within the rights-of-way and
to avoid significant trees. This also reduced road-building costs and the number of
engineering improvements required. The unused rights-of-way could then be left in
natural vegetation, giving the adjacent building sites the appearance of a larger size and
more open space. As lots were sold and re-sold, the original lots were combined into
larger holdings and often re-divided. This activity created a mix of lot sizes that
responded more rationally to the unique site constraints in each block. Early
homebuilders also planted and protected trees as an asset to the property and the
community. The subdivision's east-west lot axis proved beneficial. Most lots have a long
southern exposure providing maximum access to the sun's light and heat. This increased
the popularity of outdoor living in garden and patio spaces and influenced residential
building design. The subdivision orientation also maximized the number of lots with a
potential ocean view. (LUP)
The aftermath of the 1906 earthquake sent a stream of refugees down from San
Francisco. Others came from East coast communities in New York and New Jersey
where the Arts & Crafts movement and Bohemian lifestyle had already taken hold.
Development in Carmel-by-the-Sea was rapid in the 1920s and 1930s. By 1922, nearly
the whole village was subdivided. This coincided with the arrival of artists, poets, writers,
photographers, musicians, actors, and professors—the first of the Bohemians. (LUP)
From simple beginnings, the City quickly developed a residential community and a
strong, centralized business district. By 1940, just 24 years after incorporation, Carmel
had a population of 2,837 and a housing stock of 1,575 units. This developmental period
was critical in establishing community character. The dominant themes that continue to
shape the City today were formed in these early years:

      • Meeting the full range of local human needs, including health, safety shelter,
            social interaction, culture, commerce and growth, while accommodating the needs
            of coastal visitors;
      • Designing buildings, infrastructure, and other improvements to a human scale;
      • Enhancing and protecting the Monterey Pines, Coast Live oaks and other species
            of the natural environment that contributes to the high quality of life;
      • Respecting the past as a continuing legacy that challenges each citizen to preserve
            the City's character in spite of on-going change;
      • Preserving Carmel’s primarily residential character with business and commerce
            subordinate to its residential character. (LUP)
Residential Development
Early Influences
The single-family residential district is characterized by its architectural diversity, its
informal roads and by its forest of pines and oaks. Residential neighborhoods surround
the business district and display a wide architectural variety due to age, aesthetic and
architectural preferences, lot size and through each building’s response to site conditions.
No tracts of similar homes were constructed in Carmel, and no one block was constructed
in a single period of time. See Figure 1.1: Chronology of Major Subdivisions. (LUP)
Carmel City was the vision of Santiago Duckworth who purchased part of the Las
Manzanitas Rancho from Honoré Escolle in 1888. Duckworth subdivided 164 acres
bounded by Monte Verde, Pescadero Canyon and First Street, Monterey Street, and
Ocean Avenue. In 1902, James Devendorf and Frank Powers took over the unsold land
from Duckworth and formed the Carmel Land Company. (LUP)
Although Devendorf inherited Duckworth’s County-approved map of Carmel City with
its conventional grid pattern, he did not hesitate to curve roads around trees or
topographical features in later additions. His respect for the natural environment was in
contrast to many developers who flattened hills and cleared trees. Devendorf encouraged
the planting of trees so much that an illusion has been created of an area more wooded
than it was originally. When he sold a lot, he threw in a few trees for good measure. If he
actually got cash for the lot—which rarely happened—the buyer might have had a whole
grove presented to him as a bonus. Early photographs show open meadows or coastal
scrub with few trees west of Monte Verde except in natural canyons or near

watercourses. The efforts of Devendorf and others who followed have created a more
forested character for Carmel-by-the-Sea. (LUP)
Many of the earliest homes built in Carmel-by-the-Sea were one-story cottages typical of
turn of the century housing elsewhere in the country. Details of such cottages related
them either to the Queen Anne style, the Colonial Revival style or the Craftsman style.
Cottages of these types were built through the first decade of the twentieth century.
(LUP)
As Carmel continued to develop, its architecture was strongly influenced by the Arts and
Crafts Movement. A reaction against the impersonal production of the Industrial
Revolution and the loss of pride of craftsmanship, the movement had its roots in England
but gained momentum in the United States after the 1893 Colombian World’s Exposition
in Chicago. After 1893 dozens of arts and crafts societies were formed across the nation,
including one in Carmel. Both the aesthetic characteristics of the Craftsman style, and its
philosophic underpinnings, which linked it to progressive political, social, and artistic
movements in the early twentieth century, made it popular with Carmel’s academic,
literary, and artistic residents. (LUP)
Craftsman homes were characterized by horizontal proportions seen in the spreading
lines of low-pitched, overhanging gable roofs and informal building plans; reliance on the
honest use of materials such as wood, brick, and stone; the use of undisguised structural
elements such as exposed beams, braces, and rafters for architectural beauty; and the
enjoyment of the natural setting through porches, outdoor spaces, and the clustering of
windows into horizontal bands. The architectural precedents for Craftsman homes were
the wood traditions of Japan and India, as well as past styles such as the American
Colonial and The English Tudor. M.J. Murphy, Charles Summer Greene and many others
worked in Carmel with this style. Typical features of Craftsman homes in Carmel include
stucco or shingled siding, “L” or “U” shaped plans which enclose a patio, and windows-
either sliding, hinged casement, or double-hung sash in operation—which are framed by
extended lintels and sills. The heyday of Craftsman building in Carmel lasted from about
1905 to 1930. (LUP)
In the 1920s the emerging popularity of architectural revival styles set the stage for a
burst of individualism and creativity in Carmel during the 1920s and 1930s. The English,
French, Spanish, Italian, and other revival styles provided architectural inspiration. This
fashion coincided in Carmel with an increase in building of summer homes by the well-
to-do, as well as with new demands for traditional amenities by year-round residents.
Many of Carmel’s early larger homes date from this era. The rich diversity created by this
tradition, as well as the earlier periods of Craftsman building, continues to influence each
street and neighborhood today. (LUP)

In the decades that followed, Carmel embraced many other architectural traditions such
as Modern, the Bay Area Tradition and other styles. The LUP includes policies to update
the Context Statement periodically as future amendments to the Plan to document these
and other more recent architectural expressions that continue to shape Carmel. (LUP)
Responding to Change
With its aging housing stock, the City is undergoing a remarkable turnover of housing
that is likely to continue over the next several decades as older homes are replaced or
remodeled to meet the needs of current owners. The City is charged with protecting and
preserving the established design character of Carmel as well as its historic resources.
The City must plan for this change in a way that preserves the community character. This
does not mean that changes should be avoided, but that when change occurs, it should not
be out of character and, indeed, can be welcomed as a neighborhood improvement. To
achieve this there must be community consensus on the elements essential to the City's
character. Citizens must have confidence that building, zoning, and design ordinances
will preserve these essential elements through new construction and remodels. (LUP)
Were there a single architectural style that exemplified Carmel's character it would be
easy to define and encourage this style in new construction. However, one of the unique
strengths of Carmel has been its ability to embrace a multitude of architectural styles—
indeed to encourage creativity and invention in its buildings. The result is an eclectic mix
of architecture that nonetheless fits well together and with the environmental setting.
There are several attributes that serve to bind these different designs together:
Scale. Underlying much of Carmel's design character is a respect for scale. Scale can be
defined as a relationship of size among two or more objects. In Carmel, the scale tends to
be small and related to human size. The City itself is compact, its lots are small, and its
streets are narrow. The character established by existing small homes and cottages
reinforces this intimate size relationship. All of these contribute to a human scale and a
pedestrian-friendly, built environment. (LUP)
Site Design. Another characteristic that transcends architectural style is good site design.
Houses that follow the topography tend to complement the land rather than override its
constraints. A respect for trees, preserving natural drainages and carefully integrating
new landscaping with belts of existing native vegetation are all examples of the good site
design principles that are characteristic of Carmel. (LUP)
Sensitivity. When the City was young, few lots were developed and houses were often
smaller. Under these conditions it was easy to avoid crowding neighboring buildings.

However, as each lot develops and as houses grow to maximum allowed floor area it
becomes increasingly difficult to preserve a visual separation between houses. This can
impact privacy, views, and neighboring properties. (LUP)
These brief descriptions are only a beginning. If the character of the residential districts is
to be conserved through the coming years of rebuilding and remodeling, the City’s
implementing ordinances must guide rebuilding, rehabilitation and remodeling processes
to ensure that new construction fits in with the design traditions and historical character
that are already established. Policies in this element provide guidance to achieve this
result. (LUP)
Public and Quasi-public Uses
Table 1.1 lists land uses that are located in the single-family residential district and are
considered as public and quasi-public. Public uses include those lands and structures
publicly owned, accordingly zoned, or dedicated to public activities. Quasi-public land
uses include nonprofit organizations, churches, and other facilities. Publicly owned and
operated facilities are identified and discussed in other elements of the General Plan,
while park and open space lands are addressed in discussions of recreational facilities and
in the Open Space/Conservation/Scenic Highways Element of this General Plan.
Existing quasi-public uses in the R-1 district such as churches, clubs and membership
organizations represent both a service to the community and a potential conflict with the
living environment of residential neighborhoods. Policies in the General Plan related to
these uses are primarily intended to protect the values of residential neighborhoods when
changes to these uses are proposed. While minor alterations or additions to existing
structures may be allowed, significant additions or changes in use that would interfere
with adjoining neighborhoods should not be allowed.

Commercial Development
Early Influences
Commercial development in Carmel began as small-scale village enterprises designed to
serve the needs of the residents. Through the years the commercial activities centered
along Ocean Avenue, which serves as the main street of Carmel's commercial area.
Residential development continued at a slow pace; homes were constructed by local
builders for individual homeowners. Carmel's natural beauty was a primary factor in the
developing land use patterns; preservation of a village in a forest was and continues to be
an important concern to many of the residents.
Prior to adoption of Carmel's first zoning ordinance and land use regulations, visitor
accommodations began to appear in areas primarily intended for small-scale residential
development. To avoid expansion of these hotel/visitor accommodations into the
residential neighborhood, the community determined that some limitations would have to
be placed on such expansion.
Zoning is often considered the primary tool to implement land use regulation within a
community. Carmel's first zoning ordinance was adopted in 1924. The ordinance had
three zones, the largest being Zone 3: “Family Residential Only”. The other two zones,
Zone 1 and Zone 2, were directed at limiting the expansion of businesses into the
residential area.
Zone 1: “Business” generally was centered within a 16-block core area that is located
within today's business district. Zone 2: “Apartments, hotels, art shops, tea rooms,
boarding houses, and non-profit theatrical establishments,” was located generally west
and slightly south of the “Business” zone. This zone allowed a mix of land uses - those
which had developed over the years and were somewhat unique to Carmel's cultural
heritage. The 1924 zoning ordinance map illustrated in Figure 1.2.
In 1925, zoning was revised to limit commercial development to the boundaries of the
present commercial district. The 1925 zoning ordinance map indicated four zones; Zone
1 – “Single Family Residential”, Zone 2 – “Business and Multi-Family”, Zone 3 –
“Industrial/Wholesale”, and Zone 4 – “Obnoxious Industrial”. Very few, if any, industrial
uses were located in the City in 1925, and few existed in 1988. Figure 1.2 illustrates the
1925 zoning ordinance map.
In 1929, Ordinance No. 96 which set the primary direction for future development in
Carmel was adopted by the City Council.
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                 Page 1-10

                               “ARTICLE 1 — GENERAL PURPOSE
            STATEMENT OF INTENT. The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea is hereby determined
            to be primarily, essentially and predominantly a residential city wherein business
            and commerce have in the past, are now, and are proposed to be in the future,
            subordinated to its residential character; and that said determination is made
            having in mind the history and the development of said city, its growth and the
            causes thereof; and also its geographical and topographical aspects, together with
            its near proximity to the cities of Pacific Grove and Monterey, and the businesses,
            industries, trades, callings and professions in existence and permissible therein.”
Over the years, there were further refined zoning maps, as illustrated in Figure 1.2. With
each successive map, more zones were delineated with increased regulations and land
development requirements. From the simple three-zone map in 1924, Carmel had adopted
ten specialized zones by 1964 and as revised in 1985 and 1987.
The Commercial District Today (2001)
Carmel’s commercial district is a 39-acre area located near the center of the City and is
surrounded by residential neighborhoods. The core of the commercial district (See Figure
1.3) is dominated by ground floor retail activity operating from relatively small shops
located in many of Carmel’s oldest commercial buildings. This area supplies goods and
services to residents and visitors alike. Unique shops and the design qualities of this core
area encourage pedestrian exploration and discovery making the city’s downtown a
strong visitor attraction. Architecture in the commercial core is diverse with many of the
revival styles typical of the 1920s and 1930s on display. Scattered throughout this area
are landscaped courtyards and intra-block walkways that provide important visual breaks
and variety in building form and commercial business locations. (LUP)
Surrounding the core area of the commercial district is a less intensively developed buffer
area dominated by motels and apartments. This area forms a transition from the busy
central core to the relative quiet of the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Since this
buffer area is not retail-oriented and most sites are developed to provide a setting for
permanent and transient residential uses, the buildings tend to have greater setbacks,
more open space, more landscaping and more parking. These characteristics are
appropriate for the land uses present in a buffer district. Design regulations for the core
and buffer areas should support these differences. (LUP)

Carmel is host to hundreds of thousands of visitors each year who come to enjoy its
unique character, its beautiful beach, its cultural attractions and other amenities. This
visitor industry is consistent with the purposes of the Coastal Act and the commercial
uses found in Carmel’s commercial area reflect a predominance of visitor-serving
commercial use. For example, in spite of its small population of 4,081 residents Carmel
has:
      • 32 jewelry stores;
      • 50+ restaurants;
      • 120+ art galleries;
      • 120+ clothing stores; and
      • 50 hostelries with 948 authorized lodging units. (LUP)
To provide visitors with overnight accommodations, 50 percent of all commercially
zoned land in Carmel-by-the-Sea has been developed and occupied by hotel and motel
uses. A significant number of single-family residences also accommodate visitors on a
monthly rental basis to augment commercial motel and hotel lodgings. Along with the
City of Monterey, Carmel-by-the-Sea has the highest ratio of hotel/motel rooms to
residential housing units of any City in Monterey County. There is approximately one
hotel or motel room for every three residential dwelling units in the City. Table 1
compares the number of hotel/motel rooms to the number of housing units for various
cities in northern Monterey County. (LUP)

This data demonstrates that Carmel provides more than adequately for visitor commercial
uses and is fully consistent with the intent of the Coastal Act. (LUP)
Indeed, there is some risk that further visitor commercial development could unbalance
the community in ways that would diminish its character and make it less of an attraction
for visitors. Part of what makes Carmel so unique and attractive is the way that it has
carefully balanced visitor and local needs over the years. Carmel remains a functioning
city where residents live, work, and play as they engage in community life and pursue
their dreams and aspirations. The fact that Carmel remains a full-time community, and
not just a commercial tourist trap, is not lost on those who visit here. Tourists seek
destinations that have unique qualities where they can see new things and have new
experiences. The existence of village life is part of Carmel’s attraction and needs to be
protected if the City is to fulfill the intent of section 30253 of the Coastal Act. For these
reasons this Land Use Plan includes well-established policies that support existing hotels
and motels, prohibits new units and supports a healthy balance in other resident and
visitor commercial uses. (LUP)

Land Use Designations
Preservation of the existing land use pattern is a fundamental policy of this Land Use
Plan and is controlled through the City’s Coastal Implementation Plan. These two
documents work together to provide policy direction and regulations designed to protect
the City’s unique residential village character. Additionally, the City has prepared several
Master Plans and Management Plans on special topics to aid in maintaining the City’s
character. (LUP)
There are four primary land use designations used in the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea
Coastal Land Use Plan, and these correspond with more detailed designations contained
in the Implementation Plan. Each is described below, and Figure 1.3 shows the Land Use
Plan Diagram. (LUP)
Residential
This land use plan identifies two primary residential land use designations – Single-
Family Residential and Multi-Family Residential. Each designation is described below.
(LUP)
Single-Family Residential. This area is intended to provide for single-family residential
development at densities ranging from two (2) units per acre to eleven (11) units per acre.
Assuming an average population of 1.5 to 2.5 persons per unit this allows a maximum
population density of 16.5 to 27.5 persons per acre. Public/quasi-public uses and
overnight accommodations currently operating under a use permit are also allowed.
Above-ground building intensity in this area may not exceed 45 percent floor area ratio
and all development requires at least 45 percent open space. Proportionately less floor
area and greater open space are required on larger lots. (LUP)
Multi-Family Residential. This area is intended to provide for multiple family
residences at a maximum density of thirty-three (33) units per acre or forty-four (44)
units per acre when affordable housing is provided. Existing hotel and motel uses are
allowed and may be reconstructed. Existing commercial buildings occupied by uses
serving residential needs are also allowed, although additional commercial floor space is
not. This area is also appropriate for public uses. Assuming an average population of 1.0
to 2.0 persons per unit, this allows a population density of 33 to 66 persons per acre.
Maximum building intensity for this area is limited to 80 percent to 90 percent floor area
ratio depending on the quality of design. Minimum required open space is 45 percent of
each site. (LUP)

Commercial
This land use plan identifies two primary commercial land use designations – Core
Commercial and Residential/Commercial. Each designation is described below. (LUP)
Core Commercial. This area is intended to provide for a wide range of retail and service
uses in scale with the overall residential character of the community. More intense
commercial activities such as retail, restaurant and visitor commercial uses are
appropriate in this area. Less intensive development may be appropriate to preserve the
unique character and ambiance along Ocean Avenue. Mixed-use developments of
commercial and multi-family residential uses at a maximum density of thirty-three (33)
units per acre are allowed. This area is also appropriate for public service uses. Assuming
an average population of 1.0 to 2.0 persons per unit, this allows a population density of
33 to 66 persons per acre. (LUP)
Maximum building intensity in the core commercial area is limited to 95 percent and 135
percent floor area ratio for one and two story buildings, respectively. More open space
and less floor area is required on larger sites. Throughout the Core Commercial area,
floor area bonuses (up to 15 percent) and density bonuses (up to 35 percent) are allowed
as incentives for affordable or senior housing and for special design amenities. (LUP)
Commercial/Residential. This area is intended to provide for a mix of residential
dwellings and a limited range of office and service uses in scale with the character of the
community. Less intense commercial uses and visitor accommodations are allowed in
this area. Mixed-use developments of commercial and multi-family residential uses at a
maximum density of thirty-three (33) units per acre are allowed. This area is also
appropriate for public service uses. Assuming an average population of 1.0 to 2.0 persons
per unit, this allows a population density of 33 to 66 persons per acre. (LUP)
Maximum building intensity in the Commercial/Residential area is limited to 70 percent
and 80 percent for one and two story buildings, respectively. More open space and less
floor area is required on larger sites. Throughout the Commercial/Residential area, floor
area bonuses (up to 15 percent) and density bonuses (up to 35 percent) are allowed as
incentives for affordable or senior housing and for special design amenities. (LUP)

Preservation of the Central Business District. Ocean Avenue constitutes a major linear
park through the heart of the commercial district. It has for years housed businesses that
are attractive to both visitor and resident alike. It has been, and continues to be, the
nucleus of visitor attention.
The attraction of the area creates pedestrian congestion on the majority of weekend days
throughout the summer and during holiday periods. Pedestrian counts taken during the
Memorial Day weekend in 1984 found a peak hour volume of 2,400 persons crossing
through the southeast corner of Ocean Avenue and San Carlos Street.
Pedestrian congestion detracts from the shopping and walking experience and the overall
economic vitality in the commercial district, especially on Ocean Avenue. The large
number of establishments offering food that can be consumed immediately on the
sidewalks and litter and food debris left, also detract from the pedestrian experience.
Because of the attraction of Ocean Avenue, the businesses and properties have a
commercial advantage and are the most sought after and desirable in the central business
district. These pressures create high rent scales and an economic environment in which
only businesses with high volume sales, small inventory, or which are corporately owned
can compete. The high quality, independently or locally owned business which has been
the traditional character of the business district is at a distinct disadvantage and through
the years the trend has been that these types of businesses have moved away from an
Ocean Avenue location.
Reevaluation of Certain Commercial Zones. The concept of creating a buffer between
the commercial and residential areas is important. Maintaining the overall existing
commercial district boundary as discussed above is one step in the process. Uses in the
various zones should be reviewed for their effect on the overall business district as well
as on the preservation of a peripheral buffer zone. Using the current SIC Manual as a
base from which to identify land uses will continue to provide the City with a
standardized methodology to inventory land uses. The areas used to establish this buffer
are the RC and R-4 districts. Future development in these areas should be designed to
achieve a smooth transition to the R-1 district in both design and land use.
Unrelated Additional Uses In Businesses. Many stores in Carmel are licensed as a
singular business with a primary sales focus but provide unrelated additional goods or
services as well. In some cases, the additional uses tend to constitute 50% or more of the
business and the presence of these goods or services changes the appearance of the
business. Certain additional uses may not be considered compatible (e.g., a camera store
selling T shirts). This pattern in stores has an influence on the character and quality of the
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                   Page 1-18

community. Methods of regulating the provision of these additional uses may entail one
or a combination of the following:
      • A very defined regulation which would only allow single or primary uses specified
            under the four digit classification (industry number) for a single retail outlet as
            established in the current North American Standard Industrial Classification
            (NASIC) and allow only strictly ancillary uses. These ancillary uses would have to
            be directly related to the primary business. The impact would be to make
            numerous existing uses in the commercial area nonconforming as a retail outlet
            may offer non-related goods or services. This method, however, would be easier to
            enforce on new businesses.
      • A less defined method which would limit unrelated additional uses to a certain
            percentage of the floor area and/or display area. This alternative could also make
            some retail outlets nonconforming should the percentage of the additional use
            area, or some other factor, be less than the currently allowed 10%.
Determining the appropriate amount of unrelated additional goods or services may be
based on square footage in an establishment, display area, or gross sales receipts.
Controlling the amount of these uses based on square footage or display area would be
easier to enforce than sales receipts and would also address the visual impact of such uses
on the character of the commercial district.
Nonconforming Uses. In 1979, the City's Planning and Zoning Code was amended to
prohibit all uses other than apartments, offices and non-retail uses on the second floor of
buildings in the commercial and the R-4 districts. Current uses that were allowed prior to
1979 but then prohibited by these amendments are considered to be “nonconforming”.
Nonconforming uses are allowed to continue with restrictions on expansion.
Commercial District Boundaries. Continuing the definite boundary of the entire
commercial district (which encompasses several commercial zones) presents an
important physical and psychological separation between residential and downtown
commercial uses. Carmel, as a coastal community, has State mandated Coastal Act
policies it must implement regarding the provision of visitor serving uses. In addition,
Carmel's economic base is strongly influenced by the level of commercial activity. While
the role that these types of commercial activities have in the community is recognized,
these uses should be located in or near the central area and should not disrupt the
residential character. Therefore, an important policy in this Element is that the total
commercial district shall be contained within the 1982 boundary as shown in Figure 1.2.
Also seen as an extension of the commercial district is off-street parking located in the R-
1 district.

Cultural Resources and Historic Preservation
Historic resources are an important element of Carmel-by-the-Sea’s community
character. These resources and the City’s approach to protecting them are discussed
below. (LUP)
Architecture and Community Character
Each generation has left its imprint by contributing to the diversity of architecture found
in Carmel. The rich, visual experience found here owes much to this mix of architectural
styles. As noted above, early development in Carmel was greatly influenced by the Arts
and Crafts movement. This movement stressed the use of simple designs and natural
materials—quite unlike the extravagantly detailed architecture of the earlier Victorian
period. In the 1920s and 1930s several European Revival styles became popular. Later
periods saw the introduction of more modern styles. Underlying this architectural
diversity, are environmental influences and patterns of scale and form that consistently
reappear to establish Carmel’s character. (LUP)
Environmental influences include natural elements such as topography, vegetation and
climate. As Carmel-by-the-Sea has developed over time, efforts have been made to adapt
man-made elements to these underlying natural conditions. In the residential districts,
roads are typically not built to full width and they curve and undulate to follow the
topography and to make room for trees. In the commercial districts, sidewalks often
curve or are frequently interrupted by trees and mini-parks. Most shops and businesses
are built to face sidewalks and courtyards to promote an open exchange between interior
and exterior. (LUP)
In recognition of this close relationship between the natural and built environments, and
perhaps intended to enhance this fit, many of the City's buildings have been designed
with natural materials, pleasant open spaces and abundant landscaping with native plants.
Carmel Stone, local granite and the frequent use of wood in hand carved doors, window
frames, sills, moldings, roofing materials and signs are all design features that contribute
to the village character of the City. These form a contrast to the glass, steel, plastic and
featureless gray concrete so often found in other, more urban cities. (LUP)
Attention to detail and emphasis on fine craftsmanship can be seen in the varied
architecture of Carmel; local builders have embellished their work with detailing and
individual style, which creates a unique and appealing building design. Most of Carmel-
by-the-Sea's historic buildings exhibit myriad detailing, some of it intricate and some
bold: surfaces are broken up by ridges, insets, decorative tiles, cavities, niches and abrupt
changes of material; textures exhibit a great variety, from smooth-troweled plaster, brick,

stone, rock or exposed aggregate to painted, carved or unfinished wood; corners often
include bevels, bullnoses, cornices and moldings. (LUP)
The open spaces between buildings in the commercial district are an integral part of the
design of the community. The significant buildings in this district tend to use open space,
particularly courtyards, and building spaces and shapes that encourage pedestrian
exploration and circulation. Courtyards invite pedestrians onto private property away
from the street. These courts increase the amount of building surfaces and facades on a
building, and encourage the creation of additional and smaller shop spaces. In this way,
the building design within the central commercial district has subtly influenced the land
use patterns and economic vitality of the City as a whole. (LUP)
Courtyards also tend to conceal many open spaces and building forms from the direct
view of pedestrians along the street. Through such concealment, pedestrians are
encouraged to explore the limits of these open spaces and discover hidden shops off the
beaten path. This alternative pedestrian circulation pattern is encouraged in the City's
commercial buildings through the use of arches to define building openings, inviting
textures on pedestrian walking surfaces, directory signs at court entrances to identify
what lies within, and the unfolding mystery of revealed open spaces and new building
forms as pedestrians wander through the commercial courts and walkways. These
courtyards are even more effective when they are linked from street to street, or from one
property to another. Through-block interconnections also serve as shortcuts for local
residents who, by knowing these alternate routes, can avoid crowded sidewalks. These
unique open spaces and intra-block connections are an important part of the design
character of the commercial district and, when associated with significant buildings,
should be protected in a similar manner as the buildings to which they relate. (LUP)
Protection of Historic Resources
Although the Coastal Act does not specifically discuss historic preservation, this topic is
related to the preservation of character required by sections 30251 and 30253 of the Act.
The purpose of this component of the Land Use Plan is to provide a framework for
policies that address the preservation of the diverse and valuable historic resources in
Carmel. Its primary goals are to educate residents and visitors about the unique
architectural, cultural and historic identity of Carmel-by-the-Sea, and to promote the
identification and preservation of structures and sites that best represent this history. The
addition of this component to the Coastal Plan reflects Carmel’s commitment to the
preservation of its important historic resources and the City’s recognition of the role that
historic resources play in defining community character. (LUP)
When evaluating resources for potential historic value, the threshold of 50 years old is
often used by historic resource professionals as a trigger that such a review is needed.

The passing of fifty years provides sufficient time for evaluators to determine whether a
particular resource may have become significant in a particular context. Of course, it is
also important that decision makers have the discretion and ability based on the
recommendation of a qualified professional to determine that resources less than 50 years
old are historic, as sometimes a younger resource does rise to a level of historic
significance. The Carmel LCP provides the appropriate policies and procedures to allow
evaluation of potential historic resources, whether older than 50 years or not. (LUP)
The types of historic resources in Carmel are classified using the criteria established in
the California Register of Historic Resources.1 These range from architecturally
significant historic buildings and collections of residences that form distinctive
neighborhoods to those associated with important persons or events in Carmel’s history.
It also includes street features, landscaping, and both prehistoric and historic
archaeological resources. (A more definitive discussion of historic resources found in
Carmel is contained in the Historic Context Statement. See Appendix-F.) All these
significant historic resources contribute to the City and its Sphere of Influence. They help
to create a unique identity for the City that promotes Carmel as an attractive place for
both residents and visitors. These buildings and sites serve as important reminders of
Carmel’s rich history and the patterns in which it developed. Extending beyond its
contributions to the quality of life in Carmel, preservation of cultural resources also
provides direct economic benefits by maintaining the character and charm that makes this
an attractive visitor destination. The character of Carmel, while being diverse and
eclectic, also provides an established historical context for contemporary architects and
builders to work within so that their designs can become new, compatible contributions to
the community. (LUP)
To be most effective, historic preservation efforts should be integrated with the City’s
other permit processes such as design review and land use development approvals. This
plan contains policies that respond to the Coastal Act through a combined approach of
conservation and preservation. Conservation allows change and new construction as long
as it is consistent with established character. This approach is appropriate for new
buildings, remodels, façade changes and public way improvements involving non-historic

  The California Register has four criteria for historic significance. These are: (1) the resource is associated with
events that have made a significant contribution to broad patterns of local or regional history or the cultural heritage
of California or the United States; or (2) the resource is associated with the lives of persons important to local,
California or national history; or (3) the resource embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or
method of construction or represents the work of a master or possesses high artistic values; or (4) the resource has
yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to the prehistory or history of the local area, California
or the nation.

resources. The City implements conservation of its character through its Design
Guidelines for the residential district, the commercial district and for the public way. The
overall character of the City can be conserved through appropriate policies related to the
urbanized forest, roadway design and building design. Preservation requires that historic
resources be protected and rehabilitated without changes that would damage their
integrity2. Specific historic resources will be preserved after identification through an
ongoing survey and then implementing preservation programs that are effective. Only
changes consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties will be allowed unless environmental review demonstrates that this is
not feasible. (LUP)
A greater understanding of and appreciation for the cultural heritage of Carmel can be
fostered through a comprehensive historic preservation program. This includes the
preservation of local architectural resources and archaeological artifacts and sites, as well
as conservation of the landscape features such as the parks, seashore, roadside greenbelts
and natural setting that have played an integral role in making Carmel what it is today.
This program will help to promote an ethic of cultural stewardship, encouraging the
entire community to become actively involved in retaining and protecting these special
resources of Carmel-by-the-Sea. (LUP)
The initial step in an historic preservation program is a reconnaissance survey of potential
historic resources. This is followed by thorough research and documentation in an
intensive survey using the themes established in the Carmel Historic Context Statement
that explore the historic people, periods, places and events important to Carmel.3 This
survey process identifies all resources that have historic significance and are eligible for
2
  Integrity is based on why a property is significant. Ultimately, the question of integrity is answered by whether or
not the property retains the identity for which it is significant. The steps in assessing integrity are (1) defining the
physical features that must be present for a property to represent its significance, (2) determining whether these
features are still visible enough to convey significance, (3) determining whether the property needs to be compared
to other similar properties to understand its significance and (4) determine which aspects of integrity are vital if the
property is to qualify as a resource (adapted from the National Register of Historic Resources, Bulletin #15).
3
  An historic context is a body of information about historic properties organized by theme, place and time. A single
historic context describes one or more important aspects of the development of an area relating to its history,
architecture, archaeology and culture. A context may be based on one or a series of events, patterns of community
development, or associations with the lives of a person or group of persons that influenced the destiny and character
of a place or region (from National Register Bulletin #24). Currently there are five themes developed in Carmel’s
Historic Context Statement. They are: (1) Prehistory and Hispanic Settlement, (2) Economic Development, (3)
Government, Civic and Social Institutions (4) Architectural Development in Carmel and (5) Development of Art and
Culture.

listing on the California Register of Historic Resources. These sites, structures and
objects are then listed on the Carmel Inventory of Historic Resources. Those properties
not listed in the Inventory shall be considered not historically significant unless additional
information or the passage of time initiates the need for re-evaluation. The Carmel
Inventory of Historic Resources shall be updated on an ongoing basis as new resources
are surveyed. Properties not yet surveyed shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as
the need arises (e.g., including for all site assessments, etc.). (LUP)
Complementary policies and programs which will further the preservation of Carmel’s
cultural resources include:
      • Study and resolve possible existing conflicts between Building, Fire, Health and
            Housing Codes. Allow use of the State Historic Building Code.
      • Initiate measures to take advantage of state and federal Capital Improvement
            Programs for the preservation and enhancement of Carmel’s cultural resources.
      • Delineate tax advantages and tax incentives within the private and public sectors.
      • Study zoning codes and coordinate land use planning with historic preservation
            goals.
      • Explore public funding opportunities at the federal, state, regional or local levels,
            to underwrite preservation activities.
      • Investigate private sector funding and lending policies detailing less restrictive
            preservation code requirements.
      • Encourage citizen support of the preservation of its cultural resources by
            cooperating with and encouraging local historic preservation programs. (LUP)
In addition to the Inventory, the City also will establish a local Register of Historic
Resources. Owners may voluntarily request listing on the register as a way to provide
public recognition of their historic resource and to receive enhanced benefits. Registered
properties will receive a plaque that can be mounted on the property to identify its
historic significance. Registered properties also will appear on any maps of cultural
resources that are used to publicize and celebrate the City’s rich history. Finally,
registered properties may access enhanced financial benefits that are established for
historic resources such as fee reductions for building permits and participation in Mills
Act programs that reduce property taxes. It is desirable to place on the local register as

many of the City’s identified historic resources as possible so that the educational value
of the program is maximized. (LUP)
Archaeological Resources
Archaeological resources from both the prehistoric period and the early historic period
can be found in Carmel. Before establishment of the Carmel Mission and subsequent
ranching and settlement by Europeans native populations occupied the coastal area of
Monterey. During this pre-history period, the Carmel Area provided food and materials
for the Costanoan/Ohlone culture. The establishment of the Carmel Mission and the early
years of European settlement marked a new period that also is important to an
understanding of the cultural development throughout the Carmel region as well as
California. (LUP)
This historical development pattern in Carmel is similar to that of other urban areas in
California that have produced archaeological resources dating from the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. Potential finds from the area’s early historical period will
typically consist of such things as the foundations of former buildings, evidence of early
utilities, refuse deposits and privy pits. Such underground features can often address
research questions that are beyond the scope of written history, and can thus be
significant finds. (LUP)
It should be kept in mind that archaeological resources pertaining to the Native
American, Spanish and Mexican eras also could be buried in the previously built out
areas of the City. Early buildings tended to have a smaller impact on the landscape than
modern buildings. Consequently, there is a potential for archaeological resources to have
survived intact under buildings, roads, and other features of the landscape. (LUP)
General areas of archaeological significance are shown in Figure 1.4. Policies to protect
these resources are included in this Element. (LUP)
Community Infrastructure
The ongoing improvement of public and private property must rely on adequate public
services. When such services are constrained, efforts must be made either to increase
their capacity or to allocate their use for the greatest benefit. (LUP)
In Carmel-by-the-Sea, the most critical infrastructure needs for the future are water,
roads, and drainage. The improvement of property creates opportunities to implement
long-term infrastructure plans that benefit the whole community such as utilities
undergrounding and improved communications infrastructure. (LUP)

Water Resources
Water is a critical resource for development throughout the Monterey Peninsula. Carmel-
by-the-Sea is one of eight land use jurisdictions that are part of the Monterey Peninsula
Water Management District. This special district coordinates water supply planning,
distribution infrastructure and environmental protection. Water sources include the
Carmel River system (river, aquifer, and reservoirs) and aquifers that underlie the City of
Seaside. No water is imported from State or Federal water projects. (LUP)
After reaching its safe, long-term capacity in the late 1980s, the Water District declared a
moratorium on new connections and imposed limits on the remodeling of homes and
expansion of commercial buildings. A strong conservation program and the development
of a well in the Seaside Aquifer allowed the District to end the moratorium in 1993.
Water is now distributed as a finite resource to each member jurisdiction through a
District-wide allocation program. This supply is again nearly exhausted and constrains
most development projects. (LUP)
The City's share of District water resources is internally allocated to land use categories
based on policies in the Local Coastal Program and secondarily in the Conservation,
Land Use, and Housing Elements of the General Plan. These policies affirm the City's
commitment to lots of record, and residential use (new homes, apartments, and
remodeling) as the largest allocation for new development. In particular, existing
subdivided lots of record zoned for housing should always be considered "first in line"
for limited water resources. New subdivisions of land should be limited until existing
subdivided lots have a secure water supply to serve full build-out and additional water
allocation units have been obtained from the District. As documented above, visitor-
serving uses throughout the City have been well accommodated with prior water
allocations to achieve consistency with the Coastal Act. Augmenting scarce water
supplies to serve planned growth continues to be a City policy. (LUP)
The City will monitor activities of the Water District and cooperate in developing
programs to conserve water as well as to increase supplies. The City will support water
projects that are financially and environmentally sound. Water projects and programs also
must not lead to unacceptable levels of rationing during droughts. (LUP)
Transportation, Roads and Drainage
The grid network of roads serving the community is a vital infrastructure asset that is
under stress and deteriorating. A challenge facing the City is how to plan for the long-
term maintenance of roads, and provide adequate road capacity while preserving their
unique design character. (LUP)
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                  Page 1-26

Many roads serve as part of the City's storm water drainage system, and therefore these
two infrastructure systems are linked. As existing homes are rebuilt or enlarged their
connection to roads and impact on drainage often changes. Larger homes cover more site
area with impermeable surfaces causing more runoff. New driveways must interface with
road edges without causing damage or interfering with drainage capacity. The City has
adopted water quality and drainage control measures that apply during design review and
building permit review of new and remodeled homes. Additionally, the amount of site
coverage and impermeable surfaces proposed in new development has been limited to
protect some percolation and infiltration capability on each site. (LUP)
Urban drainage carries pollutants to Carmel Bay, an Area of Special Biological
Significance and part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Long-term
planning must reduce these pollutants to comply with the Clean Water Act. This will
require the development of improved drainage standards, storm water treatment and a
means of funding City-wide improvements. The City has established a Storm Water
Utility to address these issues and Best Management Practices that serve to minimize
runoff and direct it onto permeable surfaces before it is conveyed to Carmel Bay.
Likewise, the City is evaluating the feasibility of consolidating some storm water drains
and fitting them with debris filters and oil and water separators. Street design topics are
covered in this section of the Land Use Plan. Drainage issues and pollution mitigation are
covered in the third section under Protection of Coastal Resources. (LUP)
As development throughout the City continues, road and drainage improvement programs
must continue to include aesthetic considerations as well as safety and function in the
design. Street and drainage design should retain a “hand crafted” as opposed to “machine
made” appearance, yet still perform the intended functions. Construction should use
equipment that has the least environmental impact possible. Care must be taken not to
overbuild City streets through excessive widening or unnecessary realignments that might
make Carmel streets appear more broad, straight or urban. (LUP)
The historic character of Carmel's narrow roads, with their respect for topography and
their protection of trees, should be retained as a contributing element of neighborhood
design. Often, there is a perception of too many vehicles and excessive traffic throughout
the City. Narrow roadways and roadside vegetation help to slow traffic and, if designed
properly, can make the City’s streets safer for pedestrians. This is important in a village
without sidewalks, where so many residents include walks in their daily routine. (LUP)

Carmel’s Sphere of Influence
The State of California has authorized Local Agency Formation Commissions (LAFCO)
to determine the ultimate boundaries of local jurisdictions. A Sphere of Influence
represents the probable ultimate physical boundary and service area of a local
government. Within that boundary, an Urban Service Area is designated. This area is an
area now served by existing urban facilities, utilities and services or proposed to be
within the next two years. The Urban Transition Area is an area likely to be provided
with urban services within a five to twenty year time frame.
In May 1986, the Monterey County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO)
approved a Sphere of Influence for the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea as shown on Figure
1.5. This shows the ultimate boundary of the City generally to be Pescadero Canyon on
the north, the Hatton Canyon rights-of-way to the east and Carmel River to the south.
Included in the Urban Service Area are Carmel Woods, Hatton Fields, Mission Fields,
Carmel Point and the beach area immediately north of Carmel Beach.
Carmel Woods consists of approximately 170 acres north of the City limits. County
zoning permits medium density (1-5 units per acre). This area is fully developed with
single-family residences on 4,000 - 10,000 square foot lots. The Robert Louis Stevenson
School, a private elementary school serving area children, is also located in this area.
Hatton Fields consists of 300 acres of single-family residences east of the City limits and
west of Highway 1. Medium-density zoning is permitted by the County and the area is
developed in predominantly larger lots.
Mission Fields is an area located southeast of the City and west of Highway 1. This area
is developed with medium density residential sites and is zoned at that density. The
Carmel River Inn, forty-unit motel adjacent to Highway 1 and the Carmel River, is an
exception to the residential development. Most of the Mission Fields area is in the 100
year flood plain of the Carmel River.
The Mission Tract area is immediately south of the City. This area includes medium
density residential uses, the Mission Ranch, Hodges Property, the Carmel River School,
and Carmel Sanitary District Wastewater Treatment Plant. The Mission Ranch is
developed with 26 visitor units, a restaurant, and a tennis club. A large portion of the
Mission Ranch and adjacent Hodges property are undeveloped and include part of the
wetlands of the Carmel River Lagoon. These properties are zoned medium density
residential, resource-conservation and schools.
Carmel Point is a 150-acre residential neighborhood south of the City, north of Carmel
River and along the coast. Other uses in the area include two visitor accommodations and

the Carmel River Beach. This area is County-zoned medium density residential, parks
and resource conservation.
Carmel Hills, within the City's Urban Transition Area, is 115 acres between Highway 1
and the proposed Hatton Canyon Roadway. This area includes single-family residences,
zoned at medium density and the Carmel High School. About 75 lots in the Carmel Hills
area are on septic tanks and not served by sanitary sewage otherwise provided by the
Carmel Area Wastewater District.
Most of the residential area in the Sphere of Influence is in larger lots than the City's
standard 4,000 square foot size. Rezoning these properties to Carmel's standard R-1
zoning would be inappropriate since it would not reflect existing development patterns
and may increase density in the fringe areas of the community. Adopting a separate R-1
ordinance provision for these potential annexation areas similar to what has been adopted
in the past, would maintain the existing lot sizes and density. Special consideration
should be given to the Mission Ranch and Hodges properties since they represent the
largest undeveloped areas within the Sphere of Influence.

   The California Register has four criteria for historic significance. These (1) are associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to broad patterns of local or regional history or the cultural heritage of California or
the United States; or (2) are associated with the lives of persons important to local, California or national history; or
(3) embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction or represents the work
of a master or possesses high artistic values; or (4) has yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to
the prehistory or history of the local area, California or the nation.

  Integrity is based on why a property is significant. Ultimately, the question of integrity is answered by whether or
not the property retains the identity for which it is significant. The steps in assessing integrity are (1) defining the
physical features that must be present for a property to represent its significance, (2) determining whether these
features are still visible enough to convey significance, (3) determining whether the property needs to be compared
to other similar properties to understand its significance and (4) determine which aspects of integrity are vital if the
property is to qualify as a resource (adapted from the National Register of Historic Resources, Bulletin #15).

  An historic context is a body of information about historic properties organized by theme, place and time. A single
historic context describes one or more important aspects of the development of an area relating to its history,
architecture, archaeology and culture. A context may be based on one or a series of events, patterns of community
development, or associations with the lives of a person or group of persons that influenced the destiny and character
of a place or region (from National Register Bulletin #24). Currently there are five themes developed in Carmel’s
Historic Context Statement. They are: (1) Prehistory and Hispanic Settlement, (2) Economic Development, (3)
Government, Civic and Social Institutions (4) Architectural Development in Carmel and (5) Development of Art and
Culture.

NOISE ELEMENT
Introduction and Purpose
The Noise Element of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea's General Plan has been prepared pursuant
to Section 65302(g) of the California Government Code. This section requires that each city's or
county's General Plan shall contain a Noise Element. In preparing the Noise Element, the
“Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of the Noise Element of the General Plan,” prepared
by the office of Noise Control, California Department of Health, have been closely followed.
The purpose of the Noise Element is to form the basis for the City's efforts in community noise
control. The Noise Element is composed of the following parts:
         an evaluation of the present and future noise climate in Carmel;
         a discussion of the major noise sources in Carmel and some suggestions for their
          control;
         a section discussing the use of the Noise Element as a planning tool; and
         a section summarizing actions which the City can take to reduce existing noise levels
          and avoid future noise problems.
A major objective of the Noise Element is to provide guidelines to achieve noise compatible land
uses. As such, the Noise Element is most closely related to the Land Use, Housing, Circulation,
and Open Space Elements. By identifying noise sensitive land uses and establishing
compatibility guidelines for land use and noise, the Noise Element influences the general
distribution, location, and intensity of future land use.
The circulation system within a city is one of the major sources of continuous noise; therefore,
the existing and future circulation system identified in the Circulation Element will greatly
influence the noise environment. When proper planning occurs circulation routes such as major
streets and highways, along with truck routes, can be located to minimize noise impact upon
noise sensitive land use.
Since noise can adversely affect the enjoyment of quiet activities in open space, the Noise
Element is also closely related to the Open Space Element. Conversely, open space can be used
as a noise buffer between incompatible land uses. This technique can reduce community noise
levels and also provide usable open space for recreation.
This element also includes some of the findings gathered through the Community Survey
(Survey). The Survey was prepared as part of the public outreach process to gain a broader
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                   September 2009

response from the community, property owners, and businesses on issues facing Carmel. The
complete Survey report can be found in Appendix A.
Issues of Local Significance
The greatest noise source in Carmel is the large volume of automobile traffic that travels through
Carmel. Large buses, trucks and vehicles travel through residential neighborhoods and generate
noise that is not in keeping with Carmel's village character. The Survey identified construction,
delivery trucks, and garbage trucks as the top three most disturbing noise sources for Carmel’s
residents. The noise from traffic and buses was in the middle of the scale. While noises
generated by animals and the business district were identified as the least disturbing. Other noise
sources identified in the Survey included car alarms and leaf blowers as sources of disturbing
noise, beyond an occasional, acceptable limit.
Goals, Objectives and Policies
G9-1 Preserve Carmel's overall quiet environment; reduce noise in Carmel to levels compatible
        with the existing and future land uses and prevent the increase of noise levels in areas
        where noise sensitive uses are located.
        O9-1      Support programs to reduce community noise levels where possible to levels
                  acceptable to the community.
                   P9-1    Noise emission levels shall be considered alongside performance and

Noise Scales and Definitions
Sound is described in terms of the loudness (amplitude) of the sound and frequency (pitch) of the
sound. The standard unit of measurement of the loudness of sound is the decibel (dB). Since the
human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at all frequencies, a special frequency-dependent
rating scale has been devised to relate noise to human sensitivity. The A-weighted decibel scale
(dBA) performs this compensation by differentiating among frequencies in a manner
approximating the sensitivity of the human ear.
Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic scale compresses the wide range in
sound pressure levels to a more usable range of numbers in a manner similar to the Richter scale
used to measure earthquakes. In terms of human response to noise, a sound 10 dBA higher than
another is perceived to be twice as loud and 20 dBA higher is perceived to be four times as loud,
and so forth. Everyday sounds normally range from 30 dBA (very quiet) to 100 dBA (very
loud). Examples of various sound levels in different environments are illustrated on Figure 9.1:
Sound Levels and Human Response.
Many methods have been developed for evaluating community noise to account for, among other
things:
        The variation of noise levels over time;
        The influence of periodic individual loud events; and
        The community response to changes in the community noise environment.
Table 9.1: Noise Descriptors, provides a listing of methods to measure sound over a period of
time. Table 9.2 Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments, provides a
description of California noise standards for various land use categories.

Table 9.1: Noise Descriptors
 Term                                   Definition
 Decibel (dB)                           The unit for measuring the volume of sound equal to 10 times the
                                        logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the pressure of a measured sound to a
                                        reference pressure (20 micropascals).
 A-Weighted Decibel (dBA)               A sound measurement scale that adjusts the pressure of individual
                                        frequencies according to human sensitivities. The scale accounts for the
                                        fact that the region of highest sensitivity for the human ear is between
                                        2,000 and 4,000 cycles per second (hertz).
 Equivalent Sound Level (Leq)           The sound level containing the same total energy as a time varying signal
                                        over a given time period. The Leq is the value that expresses the time
                                        averaged total energy of a fluctuating sound level.
 Maximum Sound Level (Lmax)             The highest individual sound level (dBA) occurring over a given time
                                        period.
 Minimum Sound Level (Lmin)             The lowest individual sound level (dBA) occurring over a given time period.
 Community Noise Equivalent             A rating of community noise exposure to all sources of sound that
 Level (CNEL)                           differentiates between daytime, evening, and nighttime noise exposure.
                                        These adjustments are +5 dBA for the evening, 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, and
                                        +10 dBA for the night, 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM
 Day/Night Average (Ldn)                The Ldn is a measure of the 24-hour average noise level at a given
                                        location. It was adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
                                        (EPA) for developing criteria for the evaluation of community noise
                                        exposure. It is based on a measure of the average noise level over a
                                        given time period called the Leq. The Ldn is calculated by averaging the
                                        Leq’s for each hour of the day at a given location after penalizing the
                                        “sleeping hours” (defined as 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM), by 10 dBA to account
                                        for the increased sensitivity of people to noises that occur at night.
 L01, L10, L50, L90                     The fast A-weighted noise levels equaled or exceeded by a fluctuating
                                        sound level for 1 percent, 10 percent, 50 percent and 90 percent of a
                                        stated time period.

 Notes:
 NORMALLY ACCEPTABLE - Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of
 normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
 CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE - New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the
 noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation features included in the design. Conventional construction,
 but, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally suffice.
 NORMALLY UNACCEPTABLE - New Construction or development should be discouraged. If new construction or development
 does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features
 included in the design.
 CLEARLY UNACCEPTABLE - New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.
 NA: Not Applicable
Ambient Noise Measurements
To quantify existing ambient noise levels in Carmel, 11 noise measurements were conducted
throughout the City on June 12, 2007. Locations of noise measurement sites were representative
of typical existing noise exposure within the City of Carmel. Figure 9.2: Noise Measurement
Locations, shows the locations of each site. As shown in Table 9.3: Noise Measurements,
measured noise levels ranged from 41.4 dBA to 65.4 dBA.

The majority of the City consists of residential homes. The commercial areas within the City are
concentrated along major thoroughfares such as Ocean Avenue. As indicated in the noise
measurement level provided in Table 9.3: Noise Measurements, noise levels within the
residential areas of the City are well below 60 dBA. The noise levels within the residential
portions of the City are considered “Normally Acceptable” based upon California Standards.
The highest noise levels were recorded along Scenic Drive. However, this noise also takes into
account the noise generated from the Pacific Ocean in addition to traffic traveling along Scenic
Drive. Based upon the noise measurements, the noise levels at the commercial areas (site 3 and
4) were well below 65 dBA, which would be considered “Normally Acceptable” for commercial
and public areas.
Major Noise Sources
Control or abatement of a noise problem can typically be accomplished in any one or a
combination of three ways: reduce or remove completely the noise source; protect the receiver

of the noise; or block the path between the source of the noise and the receiver to reduce the
noise level. All of these options can be used to reduce the noise exposure in Carmel.
State Highway 1
The greatest generator of continuous high noise levels, Highway 1, is located east of Carmel,
outside of the city limits. The noise generated by motor vehicles on Highway 1 is caused by a
relatively large number of automobiles and trucks traveling at high speed. This high noise level
coupled with the fact that residences are located close to the roadway results in a noise problem.
The noise levels along Highway 1 in the yards of the nearest residents make conversation and
normal vocal levels difficult. Even inside these homes with the windows and doors closed,
highway noise is constantly audible as background level noise.
Truck and Bus Routes
Delivery trucks to the central business area of Carmel mainly use the following route: Carpenter
Street, Second Avenue, Santa Fe Street, Third Avenue, Junipero Avenue, Fourth Avenue, San
Carlos Street, Thirteenth Avenue and Rio road. As is shown in Figure 9.2: Noise Measurement
Locations and Table 9.3: Noise Measurements, noise levels along these streets ranged between
44.3 dBA (Junipero Avenue at 4th Avenue) to 45.5 dBA (Dolores Street at 13th Avenue). These
noise levels are considered very low and are “Normally Acceptable” for all types of land uses,
including residential uses (see Table 9.2: Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise
Environments). A heavy truck can generate noises as high as 88 dBA (TRBNA 2009), however,
the noise measuring equipment averages noise levels recorded, resulting in a lower reading.
Tour buses traveling through Carmel have also been identified by residents as a source of noise.
Tour buses are directed in a loop pattern through Carmel on Carpenter street, Second Avenue,
Santa Fe Street, Third Avenue, Junipero Avenue, Eighth Avenue, San Carlos Street, Thirteenth
Avenue, and Rio Road. The tour bus route is similar to the designated truck route. The main
problem with trucks and buses is that in a quiet residential area the noise emitted by these
vehicles contrasts sharply against the low-level background noise.
Ocean Avenue
Ocean Avenue is one of the major access arterials of Carmel. Ocean Avenue presently carries an
average daily traffic of 11,322 automobiles (more during seasonal periods and weekends) with a
decreasing number of motor vehicles west of the business area. Truck traffic is prohibited on
Ocean Avenue from Highway 1; therefore, the section of Ocean Avenue from Highway 1 to east
of the central business area is used by automobiles only. Within the business area, trucks have
destinations on Ocean, Junipero, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and San Carlos,
Lincoln, Mission, Dolores and Monte Verde Streets have to travel and unload throughout the
business district. Residents living adjacent to Ocean Avenue are occasionally exposed to
temporary, traffic generated, high noise levels. Noise measurements recorded along Ocean

Avenue ranged from 53.6 dBA (evening) and 57.2 dBA (mid day) (see Figure 9.2: Noise
Measurement Locations and Table 9.3: Noise Measurements). These noise levels are
considered very low and are “Normally Acceptable” for all types of land uses, including
residential uses (see Table 9.2 Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments).
Individual Vehicles
One of the most annoying and illegal sources of noise in any community, including Carmel, is
un-muffled or improperly muffled motor vehicles. Section 27150 of the California Motor
Vehicle Code requires that all vehicles be equipped with a properly maintained muffler. Section
27151 makes it illegal to modify the exhaust system of any vehicle. Enforcement of these
sections of the vehicle code does not require the use of a sound level meter to prove a violation.
In addition to the muffler regulations, Section 23130.5 of the Vehicle Code sets quantitative
noise emission limits for different vehicle classes. Enforcement of this section requires noise
monitoring equipment and trained personnel. Since almost all the vehicles that violate the
quantitative limits have faulty or modified exhaust systems, it is generally more cost effective for
a city to cite vehicles under sections 27150 and 27151.
Trash Pick-Up
Noise from trash pickup and compacting results from the use of hydraulic equipment which
raises and lowers the metal trash bins, as well as compacts the contents. Typical noise levels
range from 80 to 85 dBA at 50 feet during the raising, lowering and compacting operations. A
typical trash pickup takes approximately three minutes. The higher noise levels occur during
approximately one-half of the operation. The City experiences this type of noise level from
existing trash pick-operation, and while this service emits much higher noise levels than its
surroundings, the impact of trash pick up service would be short-term and periodic.
Street Sweepers
Because of the slow speed of the sweepers and the need to sometimes sweep opposite to the
traffic flow, it is imperative that the sweepers operate when traffic is at its lowest. The nominal
operating speed for a street sweeper is 5 miles per hour. This ensures a thorough pickup of
debris, but can provide frustrating traffic delays during busy traffic hours. Most cities find it
nearly impossible to sweep busy arterial streets or commercial areas after 7:00 AM. In
residential areas the opposite is true as streets tend to have less on-street parking during normal
work hours. Table 9.4: Street Sweeper Noise Levels, provides representative noise levels for
two types of street sweepers. As indicated in Table 9.5: Street Sweeper Noise Levels, noise
levels can vary between product type and operation. The noise generated by street sweepers may
cause annoyance to surrounding sensitive uses. Although the sweepers result in noise levels
above 60 dBA it is not a sustained noise level. The operation of street sweepers would vary and
is not anticipated to significantly increase the ambient noise levels within the City.

Community Perceptions About Noise
The Survey prepared as part of the General Plan update included a series of questions related to
establishing community noise perception. A great majority of respondents (80 percent)
perceived Carmel as a tranquil, quiet place with only occasional noise problems (64 percent). A
small percentage of respondents (22 percent) believed that Carmel has an increasing noise
problem. Similarly, a small percentage of respondents (22 percent) thought that the City should
do more to control noise. Graph 9.1: Noise Perception, provides detail related to Carmel
residents perception of noise.

Construction, delivery trucks, and garbage trucks were identified as the top three most disturbing
noise sources in Carmel. The noise from traffic and buses was in the middle of the scale, while
noises generated by animals and the business district were identified as the least disturbing (see
Graph 9.2: Disturbing Noise Sources). In addition, the narrative portion of responses also
identified car alarms and leaf blowers as sources of disturbing noise, beyond an occasional,
acceptable limit.

      A lot of the miscellaneous noises above were identified as common problem in Carmel. Power
      saws, leaf blowers and other assorted power tools (such as branch shredders and street sweepers
      operated by the City) are often annoying to neighbors. The variety of power tools in use and
      because some are used exclusively outdoors, makes enforcement of fixed noise emission limits
      difficult. The hours during which these tools are used, however, can be regulated. Other
      activities which generate noise, and which may cause annoyance, include amplified music,
      public address systems, and refuse collection and are best controlled through the adoption of a
      quantitative community noise ordinance.
      The Noise Element as a Planning Tool
      The noise measurements for Carmel provide baseline information that will be very useful in the
      City's planning efforts. Some of the more important uses follow.

Exterior Noise Levels and Land Use Compatibility
Over the years many studies have been performed to determine how much noise is acceptable for
different land uses. Table 9.2: Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments
summarizes this information. The table indicates that there is often a large range of exterior
noise levels for which a land use could be made compatible if the necessary noise reduction
features are included in the design of the project. The land use compatibility table used in
conjunction with the noise measurements will, therefore, provide additional input into the
decision making process. Proposals to rezone parcels, for example, can be quickly evaluated for
any potential conflicts with the existing noise environment.
Noise Ordinance
Section 8.56 of the City’s Municipal Code includes a Noise Ordinance. The purpose of this
ordinance is to prohibit unnecessary, excessive and annoying noises from all sources in the City
and provide guidance as to what uses fall within this group. The standards used in determining if
a noise is a nuisance include, but are not limited to:
         The volume, intensity, and duration of the noise;
         The number of persons affected by the noise;
         The use and zoning of the area within which the noise emanates;
         The time of day or night the noise occurs;
         Whether the origin of the noise is natural or unnatural;
         Whether the noise is recurrent, intermittent, or constant; and
         Whether the noise is produced by a commercial or a noncommercial activity.
The Noise Exposure Contours and the California Noise Insulation Standards
The California Noise Insulation Standard for Multi-Family Dwellings (Title 25 of the California
Government Code) requires an acoustical report for dwellings proposed in areas where the
CNEL exceeds 60 dBA. The purpose of the acoustical report is to demonstrate the manner by
which the development will meet the standards for interior noise levels.
Noise Mitigation Measures
In some situations it is necessary to construct noise sensitive developments (e.g. residential,
schools, hospitals) in noisy areas. In those cases noise control engineering can be used to help
mitigate noise impacts in a way that does not interfere with structural, architectural, or building
code requirements. The measures or combinations of measures used to mitigate noise fall into
four major categories: site planning, architectural layout, noise barriers, and construction
modifications. Noise mitigation measures should also be assessed against other community
values such as open space, aesthetics, maintenance problems, etc. Each project has its own
special problems, and mitigation measures, which are cost effective for one project, may not be

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Introduction and Purpose
The open space element has a broad scope that overlaps with other related elements. This
General Plan combines the Open-Space element with Conservation element as permitted by the
California State General Plan Guidelines. The purpose of the open space element is to describe
comprehensive goal and policies for the long-range management and preservation of the open-
space land. Issues considered in the Open-space element include agriculture, natural resources,
recreation, and enjoyment of publicly owned natural areas, while the Conservation element
focuses on natural resources issues such as management, conservation, development, and
utilization of natural resources (CA 2003).
Issues of Local Significance
The following issues were identified as relevant to the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea and will be
discussed in the Goals, Policies and Implementations and Supporting Information sections.
Open Space
         The amount and location of publicly owned open-space;
         Parks- their size and location;
         Unimproved Right of Way as part of open space (linear greenbelts);
         Management and maintenance of the open space areas;
         Areas required for the preservation of wildlife;
         Future needs for open space areas and recreational facilities;
         Beach as an outdoor recreation area; and
         Scenic walkway.

G7-2 To provide accessible, safe, and well-maintained parks, open space, and active recreation
       facilities.
       O7-2       Provide and manage a system of parks and recreation facilities that serve the
                  needs of residents and visitors.
                   P7-5     Ensure that park and recreation facilities are adequately maintained to
                            ensure safe access and use.
                   P7-6     Investigate and evaluate opportunities and incentives for other
                            agencies, non-profits, private businesses, and user groups to
                            participate in the provision, development and maintenance of parks,
                            open space, and recreational facilities.
                   P7-7     Enhance and improve park facilities to accommodate a broad range of
                            users including children and seniors.
                   P7-8     Maintain the City's beach, park and open space in a manner that
                            encourages use and enjoyment by residents and visitors while
                            protecting the aesthetic and environmental quality of these areas.
G7-3 To reduce release of airborne pollutants and contribution to green house gases.
       O7-3       Promote planning and programs that result in the reduction of airborne
                  pollutants
                   P7-9     Coordinate air quality planning efforts with local, regional, and State
                            agencies, and evaluate the air quality impacts of proposed plans and
                            development projects.
                   P7-10    Consider an ordinance that phases out the use of older, polluting
                            wood-burning appliances and limits the installation of wood-burning
                            devices in new or renovated homes to pellet stoves, EPA-certified
                            woodstoves and fireplace inserts, or natural gas or propane appliances.

                 P7-12    Investigate the possibility of installing electric vehicle recharging
                          stations within the downtown and at public parking lots.
                 P7-13    Work with local hospitality businesses (hotels, motels, restaurants,
                          etc.) to identify opportunities for visitors to use alternative forms of
                          transportation.
                 P7-14    Support and promote bus shuttle systems that provide transportation
                          within the City.
       O7-5     Minimize contributions to Greenhouse Gases
                 P7-15    Continue to implement the City’s Green Building Program requiring

Open Space
Parks and Open Space
The city of Carmel has nine formally designated park, open space, and recreational areas as well
as the Rio Park, which is located outside of the City limits, but is owned by the City. The parks
and open space amount to over 68 acres of land. In addition, the City has approximately 67 acres
of other areas that can be considered an important open space resource, but are not available for
the traditional park and recreation use. Unimproved Right of Way, otherwise known as a linear
greenbelt, as well as miniature parks are examples of such resources.
The majority of Carmel’s parks are designed for passive use that consists of enjoyment of natural
resources and do not provide any recreational facilities. Parks in that category include
downtown parks (Devendorf Park, Piccadilly Park, First Murphy Park, Vista Lobos, Mission
Trails) and parks preserving natural areas (Pescadero Park, Rio Park). Parks that provide active
uses or both passive and active uses include Carmel Beach Park, Forest Hill Park, and Forest
Theater. As of 2008 smoking is prohibited in all of the City’s parks. The parks and open space
are described in more detail below. Table 7.1: City of Carmel-by-the-Sea Open Space and
Parks, provides a summary list of the city’s open spaces and parks. Figure 7.1: Parks, Open
Space, Recreation and Community Facilities illustrates the location of the parks and open areas
listed in the table.
Mission Trails Nature Preserve
The Mission Trails Nature Preserve (MTNP) is located along southeastern boundary of the City
(see Figure 7.1: Parks, Open Space, Recreation and Community Facilities). The MTNP
encompasses 35 acres of unspoiled native vegetation and includes Flanders Mansion, which is
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Lester Rowntree Native Plant Garden, and
the meadow off Martin Road. Majority of the park’s area is designated as an Environmentally
Sensitive Habitat Area (ESHA).            The Mission Trails ESHA supports a variety of
environmentally sensitive habitats including Monterey pine forest, wetland drainage, central
coast arroyo willow riparian forest, coastal terrace prairie, and wet meadow. Hickman’s onion
population (a special-status plant species) and the Monterey dusky-footed woodrat (special-status
wildlife species) are found in the park’s habitat.
The MTNP offers passive recreational use to the public. Primary uses include hiking, jogging,
bird watching, and relaxation in a quiet setting. Bicycling is allowed on maintenance roads.
The MTNP facilities include the Flanders Mansion and the Lester Rowntree Native Plant
Garden. The Flanders Mansion is currently vacant and not used by the City for any public
services. There are no public restrooms. There is no private vehicle access to the MTNP proper.

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan           Open Space and Conservation Element
There is limited parking space near the Flanders Mansion and the majority of park’s users use
on-street parking.
Management of the MTNP is described in the Mission Trail Nature Preserve Master Plan. The
MTNP Master Plan establishes goals, objectives and policies for the current and long-term
preservation and use of the MTNP.
The management of the MTNP includes roads, trails, and drainage maintenance, removal of
invasive species, and mowing of meadow grasses to reduce the risk of fire. Mowing is
performed in June, after the Hickman’s onion flowering and seeding period. The Flanders
Mansion maintenance is performed on as needed basis and includes pest and vegetation control.
Carmel Beach Park
The Carmel Beach Park is located along western boundary and Scenic Road and San Antonio
Avenue (see Figure 7.1: Parks, Open Space, Recreation and Community Facilities). The North
Dunes and portion of the park located between Ocean and Eighth Avenues are also designated as
an ESHA. The Carmel Beach Park ESHA supports environmentally sensitive habitat of un-
vegetated dunes and dune scrub (see Coastal Resource Management element of the General Plan
for a detailed discussion of ESHAs).
This second largest park in the City combines active and passive uses. In addition to beach
activities such as swimming, picnicking, and fires (with specific restrictions), this park includes
three volleyball courts, located near the Del Mar Avenue parking lot.
The park facilities include permanent bathrooms located near the parking lot and temporary
bathrooms located at Scenic Road and Santa Lucia Avenue intersection. The City has plans to
convert the temporary restroom facilities to permanent fixture. The City has contracted with a
firm to prepare the permanent bathroom designs; however, no funding has been allocated for
construction. Three 911 call boxes are located at the Del Mar restrooms at Ocean Avenue and
Del Mar, Scenic Road/ Eighth Avenue, and Scenic Road/Thirteenth Avenue intersections.
The main parking for the Carmel Beach Park is located at Ocean Avenue/Del Mar Avenue
parking lot, which consists of 122 parking spaces. Additional parking is located along Scenic
Road, which includes approximately 127 curbside parking spaces.
The management of the Carmel Beach Park is described in detail in the Shoreline Management
Plan and the Del Mar Master Plan. The Shoreline Management Plan is a comprehensive
document guiding management of the City’s shoreline area including its beaches, dunes, bluffs,
landscape, and associated infrastructure. The Del Mar Master Plan focuses on improvements
and restoration efforts in the Del Mar and North Dunes and the Del Mar parking area.

            General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan              Open Space and Conservation Element
The management of the Carmel Beach Park consists of general maintenance and conservation.
The general maintenance includes litter removal from the beach, landscaping along the scenic
walkway, and road sweeping. In addition, the City regularly redistributes sand on the beach to
cover any exposed rocks and to correct the man-made erosion at the main entrance to the Beach
Park (at the bottom of Ocean Avenue). The main entrance experiences heavy pedestrian traffic,
which results in shifting of the sand towards the ocean. This correctional measure assures that
the sand is not carried away by the ocean.
The conservation measures, described in detail in the Shoreline Management Plan, include
replanting and invasive species removal in the North Dunes area.
Rio Park
Rio Park is not within the City limits, however, it is City property. The park borders the City’s
southern boundary, west of Larson Field (see Figure 7.1: Parks, Open Space, Recreation and
Community Facilities).
The Rio Park is an open area providing opportunities for passive use, however, the park is not
open to the public at this time. A portion of the park is currently used as a storage/staging area
for project development, street projects, and contractor parking.
The Survey asked Carmel residents about their preferred option for the future of the Rio Park.
As shown in Graph 7.1: Options for Rio Park Development, most respondents would like the
Rio Park property to be both restored to provide habitat for native plants and animals as well as
partially developed into an active recreational park. The second most favored option was
restoring the habitat, followed by 20 percent of respondents who would like this property to be
sold.

Mini Park and Linear Greenbelts
In addition to formally designated parks and open space, the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea has
cumulatively large area of open spaces that are not formal parks. These areas include mini parks,
landscaping, and linear greenbelts.
Mini parks and landscaping can be defined as small, unutilized areas, which were improved by
introducing various levels of landscaping. Landscaping might include decorative plants and
rocks, and benches. Two examples of a mini park are Mary Austin Park and Carmelita Park.
Mary Austin Park is a 2,000 square foot park located at the intersection of Monte Verde Street
and Fourth Avenue. Carmelita Park is approximately 500 square feet and is located in the corner
of Dolores Street and Fifth Avenue.
Linear greenbelts are defined as unimproved right-of-way (ROW), where roadway width is
reduced and a certain percentage of the ROW is dedicated to self-sufficient landscaping. Linear

residents expressed satisfaction with the City’s parks, open space and other amenities in Carmel.
A large percentage of residents identified themselves as being neutral, and a very small
percentage of residents being dissatisfied with parks in Carmel. The Carmel Beach, Devendorf

In addition to the priority list, the City has identified two desirable properties to be added to
publicly owned land, which include the last piece of privately owned beach frontage and the
private, undeveloped properties in Pescadero Canyon (Carmel 2004).
Beach
The management of Carmel’s beaches is the responsibility of the Public Services Department.
This department is responsible for the regular maintenance along the Beach Bluff Pathway, litter
and trash pick-up from the Pathway and beach areas, beach fire cleanup, maintenance of trees
and landscape plants, pathway irrigation system, beach access stairways, and restroom facilities.
The department is also responsible for the maintenance and repairs of shoreline walls and
revetments, beach access stairways and ramps, the Pathway, storm drains, Scenic Road, and
other structures (Carmel 2003).
The City’s Forest and Beach Commission also deals with issues affecting the coastline and is an
advisory group to the FPB department.
Additional information related to the beach maintenance and shoreline protection is included in
the Coastal Resource Management Element.
Urbanized Forest
The term “urbanized forest” refers to forests that were present prior to urban development, as
opposed to “urban forest,” which describes forests planted after the urban development.
Urbanized forest is characterized by a variety and diversity of species, age, and random tree
spacing and location (Carmel 2001). These characteristics of urbanized forests give Carmel its
character of a village among the trees.
Tree Survey
The City’s Forest, Parks, and Beach Department performs a yearly tree survey. Each year, as
part of the survey a quarter of the City’s public land area is surveyed for the type and quantity of
trees. Formally designated parks and open space are not included in the survey. This cyclic
system provides the Public Services department with citywide data every four years. The
surveys are available from the year 1971 to 2008 with some interruptions in the year 1975 and
1980. Up to year 2006, the data included counts for both public and private trees. Starting with
the 2006 tree survey, the counts will be provided only for the public trees. The Commercial
Business District trees are surveyed every other year (even years) and are included in the overall
counts.
There are several factors that affect the tree survey data. Each year a different team of volunteers
performs the survey on a quarter of the City’s land area. Due to personal perception, different

trees may or may not be included in the survey. The four-year cycle provides a snapshot of the
state of the forest in the surveyed quarter. While the resulting data is not a perfect representation
of the state of the entire urbanized forest, it provides basis for documenting trends in tree
composition and quantity.
Starting in 2006, the tree survey only included public trees. To account for this change in
methodology the below discussion includes the information based on six full survey cycles,
starting in 1981 and ending in 2004 for both private and public trees and information based on
seven survey cycles (1981 through 2008) for only public trees.
Forest Composition and Trends
Table 7.2: Number of Public and Private Trees in Carmel’s Urbanized Forest, provides detailed
findings of the City tree survey for public and private trees between 1981 and 2004. As
mentioned above, the data may vary slightly between survey cycles due to many factors. As a
result the slight variation in the total number of trees shown in Table 7.2: Number of Public and
Private Trees in Carmel’s Urbanized Forest, could be a result of the survey methodology
imperfections and not actual changes in tree numbers.

Taking methodology shortcomings into account, the Carmel urbanized forest total numbers have
remained relatively steady over the last twenty years. Acacia trees experienced the highest
decrease in numbers at approximately 40 percent. Both pine and “other” trees experienced
slightly more than 20 and 12 percent reduction in numbers, respectively. Redwoods experienced
the highest amount of growth (53 percent). However, redwoods still remain as the least

   As part of the management for forest viability, the FPB department manages forest disease (such
   as pitch canker) and implements pruning for structure, strength, and healthy canopy as well as
   removal of dead trees. The City cooperates with Pebble Beach and Monterey City to manage the
   spread of pitch canker, a disease that causes die-back of individual pine branches, leading to a
   general decline in tree health, and, in some cases, premature death. The City also follows the
   recommendations of the State Pitch Canker Task force, which develops short and long-term
   management guidelines for managing pitch canker in Monterey pine forest, defines research and
   management priorities for pitch canker, and allocates resources to implement guidelines and
   recommendations.
   The safety concerns include limb and tree failures and fire hazards. The Public Services
   department has an active pruning and removal of trees program that addresses both of these

issues. Trees are evaluated during yearly tree surveys, city drives, and reports from the City staff
and the public. Once a tree is deemed a safety concern, it is pruned or removed completely.
Preventative pruning minimizes damage from trees during storm events. The FPB also responds
to reports of rocking trees during storms, and intervenes when possible. The Public Works
department assists the FPB department with heavy equipment and staff.
The preventative pruning and dead tree removal as well as disease control also reduce fire
potential. Healthy, green trees are not as susceptible to fire as dead or unmanaged trees, and in
case of fire healthy trees limit the speed of fire spreading.

Water Supply
The lack of an available water supply has limited growth in Carmel and throughout the Monterey
Peninsula region over the last ten years. Carmel is under the jurisdiction of the Monterey
Peninsula Water Management District (MPWMD) and receives its water from the California-
American Water Company (Cal-Am).
In 1980 the residential per capita water use was 171 gallons per day, which was the lowest per
capita use for the Cal-Am system. As shown in Table 7.4: Residential and Commercial Water
Use per Connection, Carmel-by-the-Sea residential water use between the years of 2002 and
2006 was the fourth lowest per capita use within the Cal-Am system, following the cities of
Pacific Grove, Sand City, and Monterey. Carmel’s residential per capita water use ranged
between 143 and 158 gallons per day from 2002 to 2006.
The commercial uses represent the largest water consumers in the Cal-Am’s service area. The
City of Carmel was the second lowest per connection water user in the commercial uses category
(Table 7.4: Residential and Commercial Water Use per Connection). Carmel’s commercial per
connection water use ranged from 529 to 579 gallons per day from 2002 to 2006.

  Water Conservation
  The MPWMD developed a seven stage Expanded Water Conservation and Standby Rationing
  Plan, which responds to water shortages, whether caused by the weather or the limits imposed by
  the State Water Resources Control Board. As of March 1999, all users within the MPWMD
  service area are subject to Stage 1 of the Conservation Plan. Stage 1 is a water conservation
  partnership between Cal-AM and the MPWMD, where both entities work together to promote
  water conservation in the community and to educate the public. The water conservation is

encouraged by block water rates, where customers that use more water pay higher water rates
than those who use less water.
In addition, the City's Municipal Code includes specific requirements for water conservation in
existing and new developments such as landscaping, plumbing fixtures, irrigation, and the use of
free-flowing water conveyances, such as hoses. New development projects and existing
structures needing a building permit for substantial proposed construction must meet the City's
water conservation requirements.
Urbanized Forest
Both the survey and the workshops indicated Carmel’s urbanized forest as an important topic for
Carmel residents. While a clear division exists between those who would support the planting of
additional trees and those who would support the removal of some trees, there is consensus
regarding providing adequate care of the forest as a whole.
The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea Forest Management Plan (2001) (FMP), provides specific
direction and guidelines for the maintenance and enhancement of Carmel’s urbanized forest. The
FMP provides management guidance by presenting the City’s goals and objectives relating to
trees and the policies by which they can be implemented. In addition to collecting all the General
Plan’s goals, objectives, and policies related to trees, the FMP provides information, standards,
and City requirements related to proper tree pruning and removal, planting of landscape trees,
tree density policies, requirements for protecting trees from construction impacts, guidelines for
handling diseased trees, and a list and description of allowed tree species as well as a list of
compatible plants allowed under and around native trees.
Additional information related to the urbanized forest conservation is included in the Coastal
Resource Management Element.
Natural Habitat
Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas (ESHAs)
The Central Coast of California supports a wide range of climatic, topographic, and soil
conditions that promote a diverse and rich wildlife community. While mostly developed, the
City of Carmel contains approximately 68 acres of public parks/open space and 10 acres of
privately owned undeveloped land that sustain the City’s natural resources. These areas include
Pescadero Canyon, Rio Park, Mission Trails Park, and Carmel Beach (see Figure 7.2:
Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas [ESHAs]) (Carmel 1995).
Additional information related to the ESHAs is included in the Coastal Resource Management
Element.

Areas of Special Biological Significance
Carmel Bay is designated as an Area of Special Biological Significance (ASBS) by the State
Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). Areas of special biological significance are those
areas designated by the State Water Control Board as requiring protection of species or
biological communities to the extent that alteration of natural water quality is undesirable.
The Carmel Bay ASBS has 6.7 miles in coastline length and 1,584 acres of marine waters (see
Figure 7.3: Carmel Bay Area of Special Biological Significance). The ASBS is adjacent to the
City of Carmel and Pebble Beach Golf Course, and is contiguous with the Point Lobos ASBS.
The climate of the Carmel Bay ASBS is characterized by the mild air temperatures and the cool
ocean breezes. Fog persists (until early afternoon) in late spring and summer. Typically 90
percent of the rainfall occurs between November and April, and summers are dry.
The ASBS coastline is characterized by alternating rocky points and extensive granitic sand
beaches. A high rocky cliff extends northeastward from Pescadero Point, forming partial
protection for Stillwater Cove and Pebble Beach. Arrowhead Point, just south of Stillwater Cove,
is oriented in a southwesterly direction and partially protects both the cove and Carmel City
Beach to the south from wave action.
The Carmel River drains into ASBS just south of Carmel Point. The coastline just north of the
river and a few miles south consists of the steep Carmel River Beach, interspersed with a few
granite outcroppings. There are several watersheds adjacent to the Carmel Bay ASBS; however,
all freshwater discharges are seasonal. Pescadero Canyon drains into the ASBS at the north end
of Camel City Beach and San Jose Creek drains into Monastery Beach. The principle drainage is
the Carmel River Basin, which covers a total of about 225 square miles in a northwest-southwest
direction.
The submarine topography of the ASBS in dominated by the Carmel canyon, a major tributary of
the Monterey submarine canyon. The Carmel canyon originates about ¼ mile offshore from the
mouth of the San Jose Creek in the ASBS.
The ASBS contains a highly diverse marine animal and plant life within a relatively short length
of coastline. The ASBS provides habitat for approximately 30 flora species, 125 invertebrate
species, and 78 fish species.
Additional information related to water quality issues associated with the ASBS is included in
the Coastal Resource Management Element.

Soils
Soils within the city limits and along Carmel Valley are generally in Soil Class I, II, or III,
indicating that they are suitable for cultivation, pasture, range, woodland, wildlife, or urban uses.
Soils south of Carmel River floodplain are generally in Soil Class VII or VIII, so they are
unsuitable for most cultivation, but are broadly suited for grazing, woodland, and wildlife uses,
and may be used for recreation or water supply.
As shown on Figure 7.4: Carmel-by-the-Sea and Vicinity Soils, majority of soils within the City
limits consist of a variety of sandy soils, and silt, sandy, and clay loams. There are no
agricultural lands within the city limits of Carmel.
Air Quality
Carmel is located within the North Central Coast Air Basin (Basin). The Basin, which is just
south of the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin, covers an area of 5,159 square miles and consists
of the counties of Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey. Marine breezes from Monterey Bay
dominate the climate of this portion of the Basin. Westerly winds predominate in all seasons, but
are strongest and most persistent during the spring and summer months.
The extent and severity of the air pollution problem in the Basin is a function of the area's natural
physical characteristics (weather and topography), as well as human created influences
(development patterns and lifestyle). Factors such as wind, sunlight, temperature, humidity,
rainfall and topography all affect the accumulation and/or dispersion of pollutants throughout the
Basin area.
In general, the air pollution potential of the coastal areas is relatively low due to persistent winds.
However, the Basin is subject to temperature inversions that restrict vertical mixing of pollutants
and the warmer inland valleys of the Basin have a high pollution potential.
Global Climate Change
Global climate change is a subject that is gaining increasing statewide, national and international
attention. Recent reports released by the State of California indicate that climate change could
have profound impacts on California’s water supply and usage. In the recent report prepared by
the California Climate Change Center, "Our Changing Climate: Assessing the Risks to
California" (2006), the state's top scientists consider global warming to be a very serious issue
requiring changes in resource, water supply, and public health management. Natural processes
and human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, deforestation and other changes in land use
are resulting in the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2) into
the atmosphere. An increase in GHG emissions is said to result in an increase in the earth’s
average surface temperature, commonly referred to as global warming, which is expected to
affect weather patterns, average sea level, ocean acidification, and precipitation rates.

California is a substantial contributor of global greenhouse gases, emitting over 400 million tons
of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year.2 Greenhouse gases are global in their effect. Because primary
greenhouse gases have a long lifetime in the atmosphere, accumulate over time, and are
generally well mixed, their impact on the atmosphere is mostly independent of the point of
emission. Although GHG emissions are not currently addressed in federal regulations, the State
of California recently passed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32), which seeks to
reduce GHG emission generated by California. AB 32 (which is further described below) states:
           Global warming poses a serious threat to the economic well-being, public health,
           natural resources, and the environment of California. The potential adverse
           impacts of global warming include the exacerbation of air quality problems, a
           reduction in the quality and supply of water to the state from the Sierra snowpack,
           a rise in sea levels resulting in the displacement of thousands of coastal
           businesses and residences, damage to marine ecosystems and the natural
           environment, and an increase in the incidences of infectious diseases, asthma, and
           other human health-related problems.
Global Climate Change Gases
The natural process through which heat is retained in the troposphere3 is called the “greenhouse
effect.” The greenhouse effect traps heat in the troposphere through a three fold process as
follows: shortwave radiation emitted by the Sun is absorbed by the Earth; the Earth emits a
portion of this energy in the form of longwave radiation; and greenhouse gases in the upper
atmosphere absorb this longwave radiation and emit this longwave radiation both into space and
back toward Earth. This “trapping” of the longwave (thermal) radiation emitted back toward the
Earth is the underlying process of the greenhouse effect.
The most abundant greenhouse gases are water vapor and carbon dioxide. While many other
trace gases have greater ability to absorb and re-radiate longwave radiation, these gases are not
as plentiful in the atmosphere. For this reason, and to gauge the potency of greenhouse gases,
scientists have established a Global Warming Potential for each greenhouse gas based on its
2

  The troposphere is the bottom layer of the atmosphere, which varies in height from the Earth’s surface to 10 to 12 kilometers.

Global Climate Change Regulatory Programs
Senate Bill 375
Senate Bill 375 would require metropolitan planning organizations to include sustainable
communities’ strategies in their regional transportation plans. The purpose of Senate Bill 375
would be to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and light trucks, require the
CARB to provide greenhouse gas emission reduction targets from the automobile and light truck
sector for 2020 and 2035 by January 1, 2010 and update the regional targets until 2050. Senate
Bill 375 would require certain transportation planning and programming activities to be
consistent with the sustainable communities strategies contained in the regional transportation
plan. The bill would also require affected regional agencies to prepare an alternative planning
strategy to the sustainable communities’ strategies if the sustainable communities’ strategy is
unable to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. Senate Bill 375 was approved
by the California State Assembly and the California Senate in August 2008. Governor
Schwarzenegger signed and approved Senate Bill 375 on September 30, 2008.
Assembly Bill 32
The Legislature enacted Assembly Bill 32 (Assembly Bill 32, Nuñez), the California Global
Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which Governor Schwarzenegger signed on September 27,
2006 to further the goals of Executive Order S-3-05. Assembly Bill 32 represents the first
enforceable statewide program to limit greenhouse gas emissions from all major industries, with
penalties for noncompliance. The CARB has been assigned to carry out and develop the
programs and requirements necessary to achieve the goals of Assembly Bill 32. The foremost
objective of the CARB is to adopt regulations that require the reporting and verification of
statewide greenhouse gas emissions. This program would be used to monitor and enforce
compliance with the established standards. The first greenhouse gas emissions limit is
equivalent to the 1990 levels, which are to be achieved by 2020. The CARB is also required to
adopt rules and regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost effective
greenhouse gas emission reductions. Assembly Bill 32 allows the CARB to adopt market based
compliance mechanisms to meet the specified requirements. Finally, the CARB is ultimately
responsible for monitoring compliance and enforcing any rule, regulation, order, emission
limitation, emission reduction measure, or market based compliance mechanism adopted. In
order to advise the CARB, it must convene an Environmental Justice Advisory Committee and
an Economic and Technology Advancement Advisory Committee. By January 2009, the CARB
must adopt mandatory reporting rules for significant sources of greenhouse gases and also a plan
indicating how reductions in significant greenhouse gas sources would be achieved through
regulations, market mechanisms, and other actions.

Executive Order S-3-05
In June 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger established California’s greenhouse gas emissions
reduction targets in Executive Order S-3-05. The Executive Order established the following
goals: Greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced to 2000 levels by 2010; greenhouse gas
emissions should be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020; and greenhouse gas emissions should be
reduced to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The Secretary of the California EPA (the
Secretary) is required to coordinate efforts of various agencies in order to collectively and
efficiently reduce greenhouse gases. Some of the agencies involved in the greenhouse gas
reduction plan include Secretary of Business, Transportation, and Housing Agency, Secretary of
Department of Food and Agriculture, Secretary of Resources Agency, Chairperson of CARB,
Chairperson of the Energy Commission, and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.
The Secretary is required to submit a biannual progress report to the Governor and State
Legislature disclosing the progress made toward greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In
addition, another biannual report must be submitted illustrating the impacts of global warming on
California’s water supply, public health, agriculture, and the coastline and forestry, and reporting
possible mitigation and adaptation plans to combat these impacts.
Sustainable Practices
In 1987, the United Nations’ World Commission on Environment and Development released a
report, Our Common Future, which brought the term sustainability into widespread use. In
defining sustainability, the United Nations’ World Commission offered these five key concepts:
         The needs of the future must not be sacrificed to the demands of the present.
         Humanity’s economic future is linked to the integrity of natural systems.
         The present world system is not sustainable because it is not meeting the needs of
          many, especially the poor.
         Protecting the environment is impossible unless we improve the economic prospects of
          the earth’s poorest peoples.
         We must act to preserve as many options as possible for future generations, since they
          have the right to determine their own needs for themselves.
The American Planning Association identified the following four objectives in planning for
sustainability:
         Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels, extracted underground metals, and minerals.
         Reduce dependence on chemicals and other manufactured substances that can
          accumulate in nature.
         Reduce dependence on activities that harm life sustaining ecosystems.

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan             Open Space and Conservation Element
         Meet the hierarchy of present and future human needs fairly and efficiently.
Sustainability is often defined in many ways and its principles can be applied to various aspects
of a community. For the purpose of a general plan, sustainability can be defined as aligning
community’s built environment and socioeconomic activities with the natural systems that
support life.
Sustainable practices on a community level often align with the core values a community is
already embracing. Carmel’s community has a long standing history of ensuring that the built
environment is respectful of the natural environment.
Policies encouraging sustainable practices were embedded into all of the revised elements of this
General Plan. The majority of these policies clarified and solidified already existing community
core values. Spreading these polices throughout the various elements reflects the point of view,
which understands that sustainability works bests when it is seamlessly intertwined with all other
aspects of a community, rather than acting separately, or alongside of it.
Green Building Program
In an attempt to promote energy efficiency, improve air quality, preserve natural resources and
encourage sustainable construction practices the City adopted a Green Building Ordinance on 4
August 2009.
The Survey found that 57 percent of respondents either strongly agreed or somewhat agreed with
the City developing green building standards for new construction in the City. Respondents
indicated support for the City’s adoption of a variety of environmental sustainability programs
for municipal operations, businesses, and residents. Specifically, the respondents would support
the adoption of local standards for municipal buildings construction and remodeling, new
building construction, and remodeling of existing structures.
Scenic Highways
State Scenic Highway System
Many state highways are located in areas of outstanding natural beauty. California's Scenic
Highway Program was created by the Legislature in 1963 with a purpose to protect and enhance
the natural scenic beauty of California highways and adjacent corridors, through special
conservation treatment (Streets and Highways Code, Sections 260 through 263). A highway
may be designated scenic depending upon how much of the natural landscape can be seen by
travelers, the scenic quality of the landscape, and the extent to which development intrudes upon
the traveler's enjoyment of the view.

             General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan               Open Space and Conservation Element
Official designation requires a local governing body to enact a Corridor Protection Program that
protects and enhances scenic resources along the highway. A properly enforced program can:
         Protect the scenic corridor from encroachment of incompatible land uses such as
          junkyards, dumps, concrete plants, and gravel pits, etc.
         Mitigate activities within the corridor that detract from its scenic quality by proper
          siting, landscaping or screening.
         Prohibit billboards and regulate on-site signs so that they do not detract from scenic
          views.
         Make development more compatible with the environment and in harmony with the
          surroundings.
         Regulate grading to prevent erosion and cause minimal alteration of existing contours
          and to preserve important vegetative features along the highway.
         Preserve views of hillsides by minimizing development on steep slopes and along
          ridgelines.
         Prevent the need for noise barriers (sound walls) by requiring a minimum setback for
          residential development adjacent to a scenic highway.
The three officially designated (adopted) scenic highways in Monterey County are: Highway 1
from the San Luis Obispo county line to the Highway 68 interchange near the Naval Post
Graduate School in Monterey, a distance of 78 miles; Highway 68 from Highway 1 to the
Salinas River; and Highway 156 from 1 mile east of Castroville to Highway 101 near Prunedale.
Monterey County also has three roadways, which are eligible for listing as a State Scenic
Highway. These roadways include Highway 25 – between Highway 198 and San Benito County
line; Highway 68 – between Highway 1 at the City of Monterey and Salinas River – Highway
101; and Highway 198 – between Highway 101 and Fresno County line.
Monterey County Scenic Highway System
Monterey County has two officially designated County scenic highways: Los Laureles Grade
Road between Highway 68 and Carmel Valley Road, and Interlake Road, a county road crossing
the Nacimiento-San Antonio Reservoir Recreation Area.
Local Scenic Corridors in Carmel
There are two scenic corridors in Carmel, Junipero Avenue and Scenic Road.

Junipero Avenue (From 1st Avenue to Rio Road)
Junipero Avenue has been paved to the natural contours of the land and lacks visual distracting
street signals and directional signs. From north to south, Junipero Avenue provides access to
and/or scenic views of the City tennis courts, Forest Hill Park, the commercial district,
Devendorf Park, Sunset Community and Cultural Center (via Eighth or Tenth Avenues), Mission
Trail Park and the Carmel Mission (via Rio Road).
Scenic Road (From Eighth Avenue to Southern City Limits)
Scenic Road is a one-way roadway which meanders south, along the Cypress trimmed beach
bluffs, beyond the southern city limits, past the historic Robinson Jeffers Tor House, and ending
along the Carmel River State Beach. The junction of Scenic Road and Santa Lucia Avenue,
where Scenic Road becomes a two-way road, provides an uninterrupted view of the length of the
city beach from Pebble Beach to Carmel Point.

PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
Introduction and Purpose
The Public Facilities and Services Element of the General Plan addresses those components of
community life important to the education, culture, recreation and social well-being of the
residents of Carmel-by-the-Sea and its Sphere of Influence. This aspect of Carmel-by-the-Sea is
distinguished by a number of public and semi-public structures and facilities and by the existence
of various public and private agencies and commissions with responsibility for programs and
operations. This Element sets out the goals, objectives and operational policies that govern these
facilities and agencies.
The focus of this section is on the physical facilities present within the City as well as services
provided by these facilities to the residents. The facilities described within this element include
social, cultural, and other public facilities, facilities which provide City services (police and fire
stations), as well as facilities providing utility services (potable water, wastewater, solid waste,
and stormwater services).
Issues of Local Significance
The following issues were identified as relevant to the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea and will be
discussed in the Goals, Policies and Implementations and Supporting Information sections.
          Maintenance of the City’s parks, open space and amenities including bicycle and
           walking trails;
          Need for larger passive use parks that meet the needs or an aging population;
          Development of Rio Park for both active and passive recreation;
          Proactive efforts to expand existing recycling programs;
          Ensuring adequate levels of service for out-sourced services and operations; and
          Prioritization of infrastructure maintenance and improvements with City streets, under
           grounding utilities, drainage and stormwater facilities, and tree planting and
           maintenance being the top four.
This element also includes some of the findings gathered through the Community Survey
(Survey). The Survey was prepared as part of the public outreach process to gain a broader
response from the community, property owners, and businesses on issues facing Carmel. The
complete Survey report can be found in Appendix A.

Social, Cultural and Other Public Facilities
Carmel's primary social and cultural facilities are the Sunset Community and Cultural Center,
Harrison Memorial Library, and the Forest Theatre. Two other facilities, City Hall and the Post
Office, have both functional and social significance in the community and represent important
meeting places. Public recreational facilities include the beach, Forest Hill Park, Mission Trail
Park, Vista Lobos, and, in Carmel's Sphere of Influence, facilities of the Carmel Unified School
District and Rio Park. The Carmel Youth Center is a meeting place for young people. The
Carmel Foundation offers a variety of services, both cultural and recreational, to older people;
The Carmel Mission, an active church and a visitor attraction, owns the Larson Athletic Field.
Each of the major facilities is described below, mapped on Figure 6.1: Recreational and Service
Facilities in Carmel-by-the-Sea, and included in Table 6.1: Location of Recreational and Service
Facilities in Carmel-by-the-Sea. Key numbers next to each facility (e.g. # 1) reference location
on the map of each respective facility.
Sunset Center (# 1)
Sunset Center is a community gathering place, where many of the region’s performing arts,
visual-arts exhibits, organization meetings and educational events are held and is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places. The Center is also home to some of the region’s leading
performing-arts organizations, visual and arts service organizations, and volunteer groups
(Sunset 2009).
Sunset Cultural Center, Inc. is a non-profit corporation that assumed management of the City-
owned theater in 2004. Sunset Center is located on the east side of San Carlos Street between
Eighth and Tenth Avenues, three blocks from Ocean Avenue in Carmel. Facilities include a
718-seat auditorium, several rooms for classes and meetings, gymnasium, art gallery and offices
for several cultural organizations. The north end of Sunset Center consists of a parking lot
(Sunset 2009).
For nearly 80 years, the Sunset Center was home to symphonies, chamber musicians, singers,
actors, and dancers. To address the problem of a facility that was ill-equipped for the 21st
century, a nonprofit corporation, Sunset Center for the Arts, private foundations, individuals, and
the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea raised the money needed for renovation (Sunset 2009).
The construction project began in September 2001 and in July 2003, less than two years later, the
Sunset Center reopened with the Carmel Bach Festival, a long-standing annual music event in
Carmel. The renovation focused on improving the acoustics, enlarging the stage area and
proscenium to accommodate a full orchestra and chorus (Sunset 2009).

Sunset Center is the home of four historic Presenting Partners: Carmel Bach Festival, Carmel
Music Society, Chamber Music Monterey Bay, and the Monterey Symphony. Together, these
four nonprofit organizations offer more than 50 classical music events each year (Sunset 2009).
The Scout House (# 2)
The Scout House is a multi-use facility located at the northeast corner of Mission Street and
Eighth Avenue. The Scout House was built in 1931 by Carmel Masterbuilder M.J. Murphy. Its
construction culminated a fund raising drive to create a clubhouse for the local Boy Scout Troop
Number 86. This building has a large room, working fireplace, and a full kitchen and is a
completely contained unit. It has been the site for holiday parties, receptions, dinners, dances,
weddings, religious services and conferences as well as for Scout activities. In 1986, 438 events
occurred here. Due primarily to lack of ADA access, the building is not currently in operation.
Harrison Memorial Library (# 3)
Library services for the City of Carmel are provided by the Harrison Memorial Library (Main
Library) and its Park Branch (# 3a). The Main Library, which is home to adult services, is
located on Ocean Avenue at Lincoln Street. Youth Services, Local History and Administration
are located in the Park Branch on Mission Street at Sixth Avenue. The Main Library opened in
1928 and services were expanded with the addition of its Park Branch facility in 1989 (HML
2009).
Between the Main Library building and the Park Branch, the library provides services to more
than 10,000 cardholders who are residents of Carmel-by-the-Sea and the surrounding areas of
Monterey County. (HML 2009).
The library's personnel and facility maintenance budget is funded by the city of Carmel-by-the-
Sea. All library books, magazines, programs and equipment are funded by donations to the
Carmel Public Library Foundation and Friends of Harrison Memorial Library (HML 2009).
The library is administered by a five member citizen's Board of Trustees appointed by the Mayor
of Carmel-by-the-Sea and confirmed by the City Council. The Board of Trustees formulates
library policy, administers funds and plans library services for the community (HML 2009).
The Harrison Memorial Library, built in 1927 by M.J. Murphy, is an important historical and
cultural landmark in Carmel. The Main Library building was designed by the renowned
California architect Bernard Maybeck and financed by a bequest from Ella Reid Harrison as a
memorial to her husband, California Supreme Court Justice Ralph Chandler Harrison (HML
2009).

Forest Theatre (# 4)
The Forest Theater is located in east central portion of the City, north of the Mission Trails
Nature Preserve. One of California’s first outdoor theatres, the Forest Theatre was founded in
1910 and includes approximately 540 outdoor seats and a 60 indoor-seat theatre. The theater has
a long history as a community center for theater arts and was part of a Works Progress
Administration (WPA) project in 1939 to 1940. The main stage is used for a summer program of
Shakespeare and other plays, musicals and concerts, while the smaller indoor stage is used by the
Children’s Experimental Theatre for instruction and drama. This site was deeded to the City by
gift in 1937 with the stipulation that it always remain a park (Forest Theater 2009).
The City is currently in the process of evaluating the upgrade and rehabilitation of the facility.
City Hall (# 5)
City Hall is located on the east side of Monte Verde Street between Ocean and Seventh Avenues.
Originally a church built in 1921, it has been extensively altered in 1950 and 1985 for use as a
City Hall. Much tradition attaches to this facility that is under the jurisdiction of the City
Administrator. It now houses the City Administrator's office, the Department of Administrative
Services and the Department of Community Planning and Building.
Post Office (# 6)
As Carmel does not have street number addresses, the mail is not delivered to individual
homeowners or businesses, but rather to post office boxes. The Carmel-by-the-Sea Post Office is
located at Dolores Street and 5th Avenue. The Post Office is under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Postal Service. The Postmaster's office is in the facility at the mouth of Carmel Valley.
As residents make daily visits to the Post Office its function often goes beyond the original
purpose of delivering mail and becomes a social activity for Carmel residents. The post office is
often used to reach out to the community about important local happenings and events.
Carmel Foundation (# 7)
The Carmel Foundation was incorporated as a non-profit organization on April 21, 1950. The
Foundation is housed in three buildings located at 8th and Lincoln Streets. A fourth building
opened in the fall of 1999 at 8th and Dolores Streets, which has been named the Ruth Blanchard
House. The Foundation is supported entirely by donations with no government funding (Carmel
Foundation 2009).
The Foundation’s purpose is to provide services to Carmel’s older population, both in Carmel
and in the surrounding area, such as adult education classes, hobbies, social gatherings,
Homebound Meal Program, which provides four meals a week for a nominal fee, to those
members who may be homebound or have other special circumstances, assistance in solving

problems, and many others. Its members consist of approximately 4,000 people over 55 years of
age (Carmel Foundation 2009).
One of the most prominent of the Foundation’s support services is the provision of housing to
members 65 years of age and over who have limited financial resources. The housing, consisting
of 45 apartments available for seniors, is located in three separate buildings; Haseltine Court,
Trevvett Court, and Norton Court, all in Carmel-by-the Sea (Carmel Foundation 2009).
Carmel Youth Center (# 8)
The Carmel Youth Center was established in October of 1949. The center is located on the
southwest corner of 4th and Torres in Carmel-by-the-Sea. The purpose of this center is to
maintain a youth-oriented facility and programs for the use of our youth who reside within the
boundaries of the Carmel Unified School District (CYC 2009).
The Carmel Youth Center includes a variety of kid-friendly environments in one place. These
facilities include Checker's Grill, which is a 50's style snack bar, a computer center with 8
Macintosh computers, internet access and laser jet printer is available for homework or internet
access, and a Multi-Purpose room, where members are able to play half court basketball, ping-
pong, and football. The center also houses a state-of-the-art music studio housed with
opportunities to take private music lessons on drums, bass and guitar and the Jeffrey Raymond
Sutton Movie Theater (CYC 2009).
Carmel Unified School District (# 9)
There are no public schools located within the city limits of Carmel-by-the-Sea. The nearest
school district is that of the he Carmel Unified School District (CUSD) (CUSD 2009).
The CUSD jurisdiction encompasses approximately 594 square miles with four distinctive
population centers within their boundaries: Carmel-by-the-Sea, Carmel Valley, Pebble Beach,
and Big Sur (CUSD 2009).
CUSD is a unified school district grades pre K-12 with a current enrollment of approximately
2,160. The District is comprised of three K-5 schools, one 6-8 middle school, one 9-12 high
school, a continuation high school, an adult school, and a NAEYC-accredited Child
Development Center serving children aged 6 weeks to 11 years. These schools offer recreational
facilities in the form of playgrounds, tennis courts, gymnasiums and a swimming pool (CUSD
2009).
Carmel Mission (# 10)
The Carmel Mission established in 1771, is located in the most southeastern portion of the City
of Carmel, along Rio Road. The Carmel Mission is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of
Monterey (Mission 2009).

The Mission is home to a parish, which continues to function since the Mission’s establishment,
museums, and a parochial school, with playground and athletic field. Junipero Serra School
includes an elementary and junior high school that services students from many different
parishes and cities from within the local area (Mission 2009).
Through its five museums, the Carmel Mission addresses the history of one of California’s most
important heritage sites. The Basilica Church, a registered National Historic Landmark, is the
centerpiece of the Mission, which displays a fine collection of Spanish Colonial Liturgical Art
and Artifacts through the church (Mission 2009).
The Harry Downie Museum, located in the forecourt to the Basilica, houses interpretive displays
and artifacts devoted to telling the restoration story of the Mission and the significance of Harry
Downie’s efforts in the restoration (Mission 2009).
Behind the Basilica, in the Munrás courtyard, is located the Munrás Family Heritage Museum,
which displays the treasured keepsakes of this prominent Monterey family (Mission 2009).
Adjacent to the Basilica, the Jo Mora Chapel Gallery houses the elaborate Serra Memorial
Cenotaph, sculpted in 1924 by Jo Mora, of travertine marble and bronze. This museum is also
the home to a periodically changed art exhibit (Mission 2009).
In the Convento Museum, through which one exits the Mission complex, is found the cell used
by Junipero Serra and where he died in 1784. Other rooms in the museum present interpretive
displays for further understanding the history of this heritage site (Mission 2009).
Carl Cherry Center For The Arts (# 11)
The Carl Cherry Center for the Arts is located on the corner of 4th Avenue and Guadalupe Street
in Carmel. The non-profit institution was established in 1948 as a cultural center to support
experimental fine arts and help artists and scientists cross the standard borders of their

City Services
In addition to the facilities already discussed, the Police Station, the Fire Station, the Public
Works Department and corporation yard are the main public service facilities in Carmel.
Police Station/Public Works/Corporation Yard (# 13)
The Carmel-by-the-Sea Police Department and the Public Works Department are located at
Junipero and 4th Avenues in a facility constructed in 1967. The facilities were upgraded in 2008
to include an automated target system and additional four lanes to firing range.
The Police Department is responsible for law enforcement and crime prevention within the City
of Carmel-by-the-Sea. On average, the Department responds to approximately 16,000 incident
calls a year. The Departments response time goal is three minutes or less.
In addition to the core services the Department provides animal services, traffic and parking
enforcement, Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) school program, and Seniors Helping
Seniors program.
The Carmel-by-the-Sea Police Department Animal Services provides responsive animal care and
control services to the residents of Carmel. Due to Carmel’s unique geography, forested areas,
ocean fronting, and wild land many domesticated, wildlife, and marine animals interact. The goal
of the Animal Services is to provide services for the health and well being of all animals and
people through enforcement of the City ordinances, and state laws governing the keeping of
animals in the City, and increased public awareness of those laws.
The primary purpose of traffic enforcement is to ensure the safety of others. Traffic enforcement
is a priority due to the narrow streets, abundant pedestrians, and high volumes of traffic relating
to tourism in Carmel-by-the-Sea. The Department is also responsible for the enforcement of all
parking violations within the city. The department currently utilizes three Community Services
Officers to enforce parking violations, the vast majority of which are for overtime parking.
The D.A.R.E. program was created in 1983 as a joint venture of the Los Angeles Police and the
Los Angeles Unified School District due to the increasing negative impact drugs and violence
were having on youth. In Carmel the program was established in conjunction with the
Carmel-by-the-Sea                                                                   September 2009

Department in 1988. The Department teaches D.A.R.E. at the Junipero Serra School.
Presentations are also given to support groups, businesses, parent-teachers organizations, local
service groups, and private citizens.
The Seniors Helping Seniors program was developed and implemented by the Department in
1997. The primary purpose of the program is to make daily calls and welfare checks to the many
senior citizens in Carmel’s community who live alone. In addition, this program also provides
volunteer opportunities for seniors who enjoy helping other seniors. The program consists of
volunteer senior callers who come to the police department each morning and make phone calls
to our list of senior recipients.
Fire Station (# 14)1
The Carmel Fire Department, located on the south side of 6th Avenue between Mission and San
Carlos Streets, was constructed in 1937. The City performed a seismic retrofit of these facilities
in 2006, along with a bathroom addition and other interior remodels.
The Department’s equipment consists of two type one engines and one rescue unit.                                                               The
Department provides fire fighting as well as medical response services.
The Carmel-by-the-Sea Fire Department's response time goal for the first in engine company is
to meet the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard of 5 minutes or less 90% of
the time. The actual response times that include turnout time for the Department is four minutes
or less approximately 95% of the time. Carmel-by-the-Sea is also part of state and county wide
contractual agreements to provide mutual and automatic aid to each other on an as needed basis.

The District’s facilities consist of approximately 80 miles of gravity sewers, interceptors, and
force mains, six remote sewage pump stations, and a wastewater treatment plant with secondary
treatment for ocean discharge and tertiary (microfiltration and reverse osmosis) treatment to
reclaim water for irrigation of golf courses in the Del Monte Forest. The District’s permitted
capacity is 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD) and their current average daily dry weather flow is
1.8 MGD (CAWD 2008). The District has adequate capacity to fully meet current and future
needs of the areas within its jurisdiction.
The District operates a full tertiary treatment plant near the mouth of the Carmel River. A
tertiary treatment, also referred to as "effluent polishing," provides a final treatment stage, which
raises the effluent quality before it is discharged into the ocean. The treatment plant’s outfall is
located south of the Carmel River Lagoon, approximately 650 feet off-shore, into the Carmel
Bay Area of Special Biological Significance (ASBS).
Since 1983, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) has prohibited waste discharges
to ASBS. In CAWD's case, the SWRCB has issued an exemption (Resolution No. 84-78), which
required the CAWD to develop a comprehensive study evaluating the effects of the discharge on
both the Carmel Bay ASBS and the Point Lobos ASBS. Consequently, the plant has a permitted
flow limit of 3.0 MGD, which is conditional upon results of ongoing water studies proving that
the discharge is not causing alteration within the ASBS.
Following the 1994/1995 fiscal year upgrade of the treatment facility from secondary to full
tertiary treatment, the District’s facility discharge is in full compliance of the SWRCB issued
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and no improvements are needed or
scheduled with respect to ocean discharge quality.
Water Service
Carmel is under the jurisdiction of the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District
(MPWMD) and receives its water from the California-American Water Company (Cal-Am).
The MPWMD has permit authority over the production and distribution of all water supplies
within the Monterey Peninsula region. The District allocates water supplies to cities and the
County areas within its jurisdiction. Water service by Cal-Am is constrained by SWRCB Order
WR 95-10, which determined that approximately 70 percent of Cal-Am supply is based on
unlawful diversion from the Carmel River. Order 95-10 requires any new water supply be used
to reduce diversions from the Carmel River prior to allowing new users. Furthermore, SWRCB
has issued to Cal-Am a Cease and Desist order in January 2008 to further restrict water use, up to
an additional 50 percent, if upheld.
Since 1993, MPWMD has been given a single, lump-sum supply of Cal-Am water to allocate
proportionately to the jurisdictions within its boundaries (see Figure 6.2: Water Service Areas).

As of February 2008, 121 of the 342 acre feet of water remain. Some jurisdictions, like the City
of Del Rey Oaks, have used up its allocated amount of water, while Carmel-by-the-Sea is very
close to expending its respective allocation.
There are seven projects currently being discussed as options for providing a new water supply,
including a few desalination proposals, groundwater replenishment, and aquifer storage and
recovery in the Seaside Basin, to meet the existing as well as future water needs of North
Monterey county. However, these water projects are not expected to be implemented in the near
future due to the technical studies, environmental review, and financing issues that would need
resolution.
Although water scarcity and provision of new supply is ultimately beyond the control of the City,
the City supports efforts by the MPWMD and other agencies to expand the water supply and has
a representative on both the Technical Advisory Committee and the Policy Advisory Committee.
The City also cooperated with the District in developing projected water demand needs at build-
out for use in the planning of future water projects.
In February of 2009, the City Council passed a resolution, which states Carmel’s support for the
Water for Monterey County Coalition and a continued collaboration of political and quasi-
political entities in Monterey. Based on the understanding that Monterey Peninsula’s water
supply projects require a focused technical and political effort to be resolved, the Coalition is set
to provide regional projects and water management programs for sustainable and cost effective
water supply solutions.
State law mandates the prioritizing of water for affordable housing if water is an issue. The
City's share of water resources is internally allocated to land use categories based on policies in
the Land Use and Community Character and Housing Elements of the General Plan. The City
has approximately .589 acre-feet of water available for affordable housing projects (RBF
Consulting, 2009). In the past five years, the City has allocated approximately .308 acre-feet to
affordable housing projects. This is the only water available until District supplies increase and
new allocations are made to each city in the District.
Stormwater Drainage
Due to Carmel’s topography, the City’s drainage system is based on gravity pull. Given the fact
that Carmel does not have curbs, a significant portion of the runoff from roadways sheet flows
into the adjacent swales and is infiltrated as groundwater. The remaining surface water is
collected via a series of culverts located throughout the City. Ultimately, these surface flows are
released into the ocean via 10 drainage outlets located along Carmel Beach (Carmel 2007).
The size of the drainage pipes vary depending on location. The drainage channel originating
within the Mission Trails Nature Preserve, which generally follows Junipero Avenue, ranges

            General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                 Public Facilities & Services Element
from 42 inches to 24 inches in diameter. The drainage channel along Ocean Avenue ranges from
15 to 24 inches in diameter. The drainage channel along First and Second Avenues converges
and then follows Fourth Avenue. The diameter of these channels ranges from 12 to 34 inches
(Carmel 2007).
Street corner collection culverts are located along Seventh through Twelve Avenues, south of
Ocean Avenue as well as in several locations north of Fourth Avenue. These culverts collect
stormwater in residential areas and divert it towards the ocean. The culverts are generally 12 to
15 inches in size, with maximum size of 18 inches (Carmel 2007).
Carmel Bay is considered an Area of Special Biological Significance (ASBS). The City follows
the Monterey Regional Storm Water Management Program (MRSWMP), which establishes Best
Management Practices (BMP’s) designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the
municipal separate storm sewer systems to the “maximum extent practicable,” to protect water
quality, and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of the Clean Water Act.
Recycling and Solid Waste Disposal
The City has an exclusive franchise agreement with the Waste Management Company for trash
and recycling collection, which occurs once per week in the residential district and daily in the
commercial district.
Households are issued yard waste, mixed recycle and trash cans. Due to the City’s large number
of second homeowners, the City contract calls for Waste Management to collect the cans from
wherever they are housed and return them to the same location. This avoids the need to take the
cans to the curb.
Public Restrooms (# 15)
Consistent with the City's Local Coastal Program (LCP), the City will continue to provide
restrooms for visitors. The City presently provides beach area public restrooms at the foot of
Ocean Avenue (#15a) and on Scenic Road at Santa Lucia Avenue (#15b). Additional public
restrooms are associated with some of the City’s parks and include restrooms at Devendorf Park,
(#15c), at Piccadilly Park (Key #15d), First Murphy Park (#15e), and Forest Hill Park (#15f).

Infrastructure Maintenance and Improvement Priorities
A Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a short-range plan prepared by the City to identify a
fifth-year infrastructure improvement and maintenance plan. Essentially, the plan provides a link
between a municipality and other departments in a comprehensive and strategic plans and the
City’s annual budget.

            General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan                  Public Facilities & Services Element
A CIP provides many benefits including:
         Allowing for a systematic evaluation of all potential projects at the same time;
         Providing the ability to stabilize debt and consolidate projects to reduce borrowing
          costs; and
         Serving as a public relations and economic development tool.
In addition a CIP focuses on preserving the City’s infrastructure while ensuring the efficient use
of public funds. The CIP process provides an opportunity to foster cooperation among
departments and an ability to inform other City departments of each unit’s priorities.
Historically, the City was able to meet the improvement and maintenance schedule outlined in its
CIPs. Each year, the City reviews the plan to reflect any budgetary constraints of a given fiscal
year.
Public’s Priorities
The Survey results showed that improvement/maintenance of City streets and undergrounding
utilities were the two top-most priorities for the City. As shown in Graph 6.1: Priorities for
Improving/Maintaining City Amenities, when asked to identify top infrastructure-related
priorities for the City, 64 percent of respondents identified improving and maintaining City
streets; 50 percent identified planting and maintaining City trees; 59 percent identified
undergrounding the utilities; 47 percent identified improving sidewalks and parking in the
commercial district; and 41 percent identified maintaining City park facilities. Improving and
maintaining City buildings was commonly listed as the lowest priority.
