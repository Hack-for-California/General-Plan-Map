                                                                          CHAPTER 1
                                                          INTRODUCTION
The 2009-2014 Housing Element is a component of the Porterville 2030 General Plan. The
Housing Element contains the City’s goals, policies, and strategic plan for addressing the most
critical housing needs in the community over the next eight years. The Housing Element is
designed to provide the City with a coordinated and comprehensive strategy for promoting the
production of safe, decent, and affordable housing within the community.
A.       COMMUNITY CONTEXT
The City of Porterville is located in southeast Tulare County, along the foothills of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, 165 miles north of Los Angeles, 171 miles east of the Pacific Coast.
Roughly between the major market areas of Northern and Southern California, Porterville is a
key gateway city to Sequoia National Park and the southern Sierra Nevada region.
Tulare County is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the nation, and Porterville is
significantly influenced by agriculture and supportive industries, although the economy is more
diversified today than in past years. Specifically, Porterville has grown into a regionally
important medical and educational center. More recently, the City has become a desirable
location for shipping and warehousing business, due to its advantageous location between
Northern and Southern California.
Incorporated in 1902 with a population of 2,906, Porterville has grown to a community of 51,863
in 2008, according to the Department of Finance population and housing estimates. Similar to
Tulare County, Porterville has experienced rapid growth since 1960, with a 50 percent or greater
increase during the decades of the 1970s and 1980s. The Tulare County Association of
Governments (TCAG) predicts less rapid growth through 2008, with an expected annual
population increase of 2.8 percent. As the City continues to grow into areas where urban
services and infrastructure are not yet in place, this expected population growth will pose a
challenge in helping ensure that all members of the community have access to decent and
affordable housing.
Porterville has undergone significant changes in ethnic composition, with an increasing Hispanic
population that now accounts for almost half of all residents. The City is also home to an
increasing proportion of younger residents, as the City has seen an increase in the proportion of
families with children.
The housing stock in Porterville consists predominantly of single-family homes. Housing prices
in the City are low compared to other areas in the County and region. Approximately 44 percent
of the households in Porterville are renters, compared to 39 percent Countywide.
In preparing a housing plan to address the housing needs of residents, the City has set forth
policies and programs that:

        •   Preserve existing housing;
        •   Provide sites for new housing construction;
        •   Expand housing opportunities for low income and special needs households;
        •   Reduce governmental constraints to housing development; and
        •   Ensure equal housing access for all residents.
B.       STATE POLICY AND AUTHORIZATION
The California Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living
environment for every resident as the State's primary housing goal. Recognizing the important
role of local planning programs in pursuing this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all
jurisdictions prepare a housing element as part of the comprehensive general plan. Section
65302(c) of the Government Code sets forth the specific components to be contained in a
community's housing element.
Previously state law required housing elements to be updated at least every five years to reflect a
community's changing housing needs. The 2003 Housing Element covered the five-year period
spanning 2003 through 2008. Special legislation extended the deadline for Housing Element
updates in Tulare County by one year. This new update covers the planning period of July 1,
2009 through June 30, 2014.
A critical measure of compliance with the State Housing Element Law is the City’s ability to
accommodate its share of the regional housing needs, as allocated in the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA) Plan prepared by the Tulare County Association of Governments.
For Tulare County, the RHNA covers the period between January 1, 2007 and July 1, 2014.
Therefore, while the Housing Element is an five-year document, the City has seven and one-half
years (January 1, 2007 to July 1, 2014) to fulfill the RHNA.
C.      ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
 The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
        1. An introduction that explains the purpose and scope of the Housing Element (Chapter
            1).
        2. An analysis of the City's demographic and housing characteristics and trends
            (Chapter 2).
        3. Review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints that impact
            the City's ability to address its housing needs (Chapter 3).

        4. An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to address the
           City’s housing goals (Chapter 4).
        5. An evaluation of the accomplishments of the 2003 Housing Element (Chapter 5).
        6. A Housing Plan to address the City's identified housing needs, including housing
           goals, policies and programs (Chapter 6).
D.      RELATIONSHIP TO PORTERVILLE GENERAL PLAN
The Housing Element is a component of the Porterville General Plan, which provides policies
and programs to guide development in the City. State law requires consistency among sections
of the General Plan. As such, goals and policies contained in the Housing Element should be
consistent with the goals and policies set forth in the other elements of the General Plan.
LAND USE ELEMENT
The following General Plan “Guiding Policies” relate to housing in the City:
LU-G-6         Provide for residential development with strong community identities,
               appropriate and compatible scales of development, identifiable centers and edges
               and well-defined public spaces for recreation and civic activities.
LU-G-7         Guide new development into compact neighborhoods with defined, mixed-use
               center including public open space, a school or other community facilities, and
               neighborhood commercial.
LU-G-8         Allow and encourage efficient infill development in existing neighborhoods.
LU-G-9         Provide sufficient land with appropriate parcel sizes to support a full range of
               housing types and prices.
LAND USE ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
The following Housing Element Implementation Policies relate to the land use policies in the
General Plan:
LU-G-I-10:     Amend the Zoning Ordinance to include:
               •       Minimum lot sizes and densities consistent with the Plan’s land use
                       classifications;
               •       Development standards that permit townhouses and zero-lot line attached
                       or detached single-family dwellings on sites designated for low-medium,
                       medium, or medium-high densities;

            •       Development standards that permit second units, small family daycares,
                    and residential care homes in neighborhoods in accordance with State
                    law; and
            •       Sustainable design standards that will achieve compact, walkable
                    neighborhoods and provide an interconnected network of local streets.
LU-I-11     Only allow gated communities in very low density, planned development areas,
            and Resort Residential areas.
LU-I-12     Require residential development on slopes over six percent to comply with the
            Hillside Development Ordinance.
            This ordinance establishes a Hillside Development Zoning District with
            standards and review procedures tailored to the City’s needs and expectation for
            hillside development.
LU-I-13     Discourage residential development within the Airport Safety Zone. If
            residential development is approved in the County within the Airport Safety
            Zone, it must comply with Tulare County Airport Land Use Commissions’s land-
            use compatibility standards and density restrictions.
            The County is currently preparing an Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
            which will include updated information for a safety zone.
LU-I-14     Allow residential developments to employ creative site design, landscaping, and
            architectural quality that blend with the characteristics of each location and its
            surroundings and offer superior design solutions.
LU-I-15     Adopt community design standards for new residential development.
            These could include but are not limited to:
            •       Maximum block length;
            •       Maximum ratio of block length to width;
            •       Limited use of dead-end streets;
            •       Orientation of residential building; and
            •       Required connectivity.
            Exceptions may be provided for infill sites and projects in the Hillside
            Development Zone.
LU-I-16     Establish guidelines and incentives to promote green building techniques and
            materials in residential development.
LU-I-17     Require that all new subdivisions preserve natural, cultural, and biological
            resources, including stands of large trees and rock outcroppings, to the maximum
            extent feasible.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                       1-4                    2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

LU-I-18        Protect existing, residential neighborhoods from the encroachment of
               incompatible activities and land uses, and environmental hazards.
LU-I-19        Enforce zoning and development regulations through project review,
               construction inspections, and code enforcement, with fees to enable full-cost
               recovery for providing these services.
               State law allows cities to set permit fees to recover administrative costs.
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
The following General Plan “Guiding Policy” relates to housing in the City:
OSC-G-9        Improve and protect Porterville’s air quality by making air quality a priority in
               land use and transportation planning and in development review.
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
OSC-I-58       Continue to assess air quality impacts through environmental review and require
               developers to implement best management practices to reduce air pollutant
               emissions associated with the construction and operation of development
               projects.
OSC-I-60       Require dust control measures as a condition of approval for subdivision maps,
               site plans, and all grading permits.
OSC-I-61       Coordinate air quality planning efforts with other local, regional and State
               agencies.
OSC-I-62       Be proactive in educating the public about the linkages between land use,
               transportation and air quality.
OSC-I-63       Notify local and regional jurisdictions of proposed projects that may affect
               regional air quality.
These policies are consistent with the policies set forth in the Housing Element. The City will
continue to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and other General Plan elements.
If future changes to any element are necessary for internal consistency, any change will be
proposed to the City Council for consideration.

E.       COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
Community involvement is critical to developing policies and programs that meet the housing
needs of residents. In preparing this Housing Element, the City garnered community input
through community workshops and through a community needs survey.
COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS
The City held a community workshop, a public meeting and participated in an informational
luncheon hosted by the Orangebelt Board of Realtors to discuss and explain the housing element
process and to receive input on the housing issues most important to residents and service
providers. The City also provided housing surveys at the Heritage Center, City Library, City
Hall, and First Time Homebuyer Workshops held monthly from November 2008 through
February 2009. .
The City advertised the workshops through direct mailings to over 70 service providers, realtors,
and lenders, as well as publishing a newspaper advertisement. Flyers about the workshops were
also placed at the City Hall. Workshop attendees included concerned residents, community
leaders, lenders, realtors, and service providers, including those serving the homeless, disabled,
and persons of lower incomes. Specifically, interested residents, civic leaders, lenders and
insurers, real estate and management companies, homeless, disabled, and other special needs
groups and the following agencies posted notices and/or were noticed to attend the meetings:
         •   CCFCC
         •   Salvation Army
         •   Rescue Mission
         •   PSW Independent Living Program
         •   Central California Legal Services
         •   Central California Family Crisis Center Media
         •   Porterville Recorder & Noticiero (Local Newspapers)
         •   Post Office
         •   Local Real Estate Offices (Melson Realty, Century 21, Home Realty, Letsinger,
             Remax, & Ringe/Moore Realty)
         •   Local Title/ Lending Companies (Chicago Title, Stewart Title, Country Club, CTX)
HOUSING NEEDS SURVEY
The City developed a housing needs survey to gather input from residents and service providers
on housing issues, including housing needs, housing policies and programs, and fair housing
issues. The survey was made available at public counters, to service providers, and workshop
attendees. A copy of the survey is included in the Appendix of this report.
In total, 59 people completed the survey. Among those completing the survey, 42 were renters
and 17 were owners. The most common housing need indicated by both renters and owners was
home improvement. Approximately half of both owners and renters indicated their units were in

need of improvement. The second highest housing need was affordable housing. The housing
market has slowed as the economy has suffered and taken a fall between late 2007 through 2009.
 Although homes have been priced at affordable rates compared to prior years, lending
institutions have also raised the criteria and qualification requirements for home loans, making it
more difficult for many low-income first time home buyers and young families. Several housing
policies received a favorable response from survey respondents. Policies and programs receiving
the most favorable responses were:
         •  Offering credit counseling to first-time homebuyers;
         •  Policies encouraging new apartments at rents affordable to lower-income households;
         •  Policies encouraging new homes at prices affordable to lower-income households;
            and
         •  A first-time homebuyers workshop that informs prospective buyers of the home
            purchasing process.

                      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Addressing the current and future housing needs of Porterville residents requires a
comprehensive assessment of the community’s housing needs. An understanding of housing
needs provides the basis for an appropriate and effective housing plan. This chapter presents
an analysis of the demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics that may affect
housing needs in Porterville.
A.       POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
The nature and extent of housing need in a community is largely determined by population
growth and demographic characteristics such as age, household size, occupation, and income.
Cultural factors may also affect housing preferences.
1.       POPULATION TRENDS
Porterville is the third largest city in Tulare County. Porterville has grown rapidly for many
years: the City has more than tripled in population since 1970, with 50 percent or greater
increases in population during the decades of the 1970s and 1980s. As of January 2008, the
State Department of Finance (DOF) reported a population of 51,467 for Porterville.
As the Bureau of the Census continues                                    Table 2-1
its efforts with the 2010 census, the City           Regional    Population       Trends, 1990-2000

the 1990s, 36 percent were born in
foreign countries, with a majority born
in Mexico. The foreign-born residents who moved to Porterville during the 1990s account
for 40 percent of the City’s entire foreign-born population as of 2000.

Another factor that helps explain the population increase between 1990 and 2000 is the area’s
relatively high birthrate, particularly among teenagers. Tulare County as a whole had a teen
birthrate of 78.5 births per 1,000 persons during 2000.1 In contrast, the average teen birthrate
for the State of California during 2000 was 46.8 births per 1,000 persons. Most teen parents
cannot afford to live independently, potentially contributing to overcrowding and
affordability issues in the community.
The Porterville population trends since 1970 as well as projections through 2008 are
presented in Table 2-2. An estimated population of 50,000 by 2008 was projected from the
Tulare County Association of Governments (TCAG) assuming a straight-line growth rate of
2.8 percent over the six year period within the City’s incorporated area. Based on the TCAG
projection, Porterville surpassed the estimated 50,000 population mark prior to 2008.

2.      AGE CHARACTERISTICS
The age characteristics of a community are important factors in evaluating housing needs.
Different age groups have distinct family types and sizes, income levels, and home-
maintenance capabilities, all of which correspond to different housing needs. Younger adults
tend to seek apartments, condominiums, and single-family units that are proportionate to
their typically smaller household sizes and more constrained finances. Mature adults with
children may seek larger single-family homes. However, as grown children begin to leave
home, older adults and seniors often trade in for smaller condominiums and single-family
homes that are typically easier to maintain and afford.
A review of the changes among age groups in Porterville reveals several interesting trends
(Table 2-3). First, in absolute and percentage terms, Porterville’s senior population
decreased during the last decade. The decrease stands in contrast to the robust overall
population increase during the 1990s. Many potential factors may be associated with the
decrease in the number of seniors, including natural processes, lack of housing appropriate to

the needs of seniors, and a small to non-existent number of new residents over 65 years of
age.
The Census data show that population growth is concentrated among younger age groups.
There were 1,500 more high school age students (15 to 19 years old) in 2000 than there were
in 1990 – a 74 percent increase. Similarly, there were 1,294 (55 percent) more 10 to 14 year
old children in 2000 than in 1990. Specifically, in 1990, there were 2,775 persons aged 0 to
4 years. Following this age group to the year 2000, one sees that the 10 to 14 year age group
includes 3,684 people. Therefore, in addition to all of the 0 to 4 year olds who were already
in Porterville in 1990, at least 900 other very young people became Porterville residents
during the 1990s. Aside from posing obvious needs for adequate school facilities, the
increase in young children may suggest a need for housing appropriate for young families

Among the older age groups, the 45-49 and 50-54 age groups grew the fastest during the
1990s in relative terms. However, these relative increases seem to be due more to the
population aging than to in-migration. The 50-54 age group increased 94 percent in size
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                                            2-3           2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

between 1990 and 2000, but in tracking this age group through different time periods, one
finds a shrinking population. Specifically, the 40-44 years age group in 1990 had a
population of 2,035. Its associated age group in the year 2000, the 50-54 age group, had a
population of 2,000 – a 35-person decrease in ten years. This suggests that the increase of
this age group may be attributable to aging in place rather than to in-migration. It also
suggests that from 2010 to 2017, the City will see a large group of residents at or very close
to retirement age. This is potentially critical given that, as previously noted, there appear to
be factors inducing seniors to leave Porterville upon reaching retirement age.
3.       RACE AND ETHNICITY
Like many other communities in California, over the past decades Porterville has
experienced significant changes in the racial and ethnic composition of its population. These
changes may have implications for housing needs, to the extent that cultural preferences
influence housing choices.
Overall, Porterville has become more racially and ethnically diverse during the past twenty
years. Porterville's most significant racial and ethnic change during the 1980s and 1990s has
been the increase in the proportion of the Hispanic population.2 The 2000 Census indicates
that nearly half of the Porterville population is of Hispanic origin, up from just over one-third
in 1990. In addition, there has been a corresponding decrease in the proportion of White
residents, from 57 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 2000. This trend is prevalent in Tulare
County. The percentage of Asian and Black residents has remained relatively consistent
since 1990.
School enrollment data from the California Department of Education provide additional
insight on the race and ethnicity of the student body of the two school districts that cover
Porterville. As of the fall of 2008, the nearly 13,500 students in the Porterville Unified
School District, 65 percent or 8,775 are of Hispanic origin. As of the fall of 2008, the 3,688
students in the Burton School District, 57 percent of students are identified as Hispanic.3
Porterville has clearly seen a tremendous increase in its Hispanic population in the past
twenty years. If current trends continue, the next census in 2010 will likely indicate that
those of Hispanic origin will constitute over fifty percent of Porterville residents. This has
implications for many city government issues, particularly housing policy, because Census
data further reveal that people of Hispanic origin are disproportionately concentrated in the
lower income group, young, and tend to live in overcrowded conditions.
2
    The Census considers Hispanic origin separately from racial categories. Census respondents are directed to
    indicate Hispanic origin as well as a racial group – White, African American, Native American,
    Asian/Pacific Islander, other race, or two or more races. Reviewers and commentators of national
    demographic trends have suggested that because many people of Hispanic origin are of mixed racial
    ancestry, the relatively rigid racial categories in the Census pose many difficulties among some Hispanic
    people who consider race to be a flexible concept. Further, it is generally understood that not all Census
    respondents agree with or understand the distinction between racial groups and ethnic origin.
3
    School district reports treated Hispanics as a separate racial group, rather than allowing for separate ethnic
    and racial identification.

4.      EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT
A person’s level of education can often determine employment and income levels. The
educational attainment level of Porterville residents 25 years or older is very similar to that of
Tulare County residents as a whole. Porterville has a slightly higher percentage of high
school graduates than Tulare County, but a slightly smaller percentage with college and/or
advanced degrees.
More than 60 percent of Porterville residents over 25 have earned a high school diploma, and
more than a third of all residents have attended college and/or obtained an advanced degree
(Figure 2-1). Relative to 1990, a higher proportion of Porterville residents aged 25 years or
older in 2000 had high school degrees or attended some college.

5.       OCCUPATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL CHARACTERISTICS
The number and types of jobs in a community are important considerations in determining
housing needs. Different jobs and associated income levels determine the type and size of
housing a household can afford. Both occupational and industrial information are evaluated
here in terms of potential impact on housing choice.
Occupational Characteristics
Occupations of employed Porterville residents in 2000 were heavily concentrated in the
managerial/professional, service, and sales sectors (Table 2-5). According to Census data,
the City had a similar occupational profile to Tulare County; however, the City had relatively
smaller percentages of workers in farming, construction, and production.

Industrial Characteristics
Occupation by industry provides a more detailed profile of jobs in the City. Education,
health, and social services jobs accounted for 28 percent of all jobs held by Porterville
residents, far more than any other industrial grouping (Table 2-6). This reflects the City’s
increasing role as a regionally important medical and educational center. As the City
becomes increasingly urbanized, agricultural employment will continue to play a smaller role
in the City’s economy.
According to the Census, agricultural jobs accounted for 11.2 percent of all jobs held by
Porterville residents. In comparison, agricultural jobs accounted for as much as 30 percent of
all jobs in the adjacent County unincorporated areas, including Poplar/Cotton Center and
East Porterville. The California Employment Development Department (EDD) indicates that
for Tulare County as a whole, agricultural jobs accounted for 25 percent of all employment in
2001. This figure includes direct involvement plus associated industries such as food
processing and distribution. However, official data tend to under-estimate the number of

   agricultural workers, particularly migrant farmworkers, due partly to the seasonal nature and
   migratory pattern of their work.

   Major Employers
   A more refined understanding of the City’s employment picture comes from a review of its
   major employers (Table 2-7). These jobs are held by Porterville residents and non-residents
   alike. Health care and education providers comprise five of the City's largest employers. Six
   of the ten largest employers are public entities, which cumulatively have more than 6,300
   employees.
   The single largest employer is the Porterville Developmental Center, with more than 1,600
   employees. The second largest private employer is Walmart, with nearly 901 of which work
   in the distribution center, with the balance in the company’s retail store. Other large
   employers are Porterville Public Schools, Sierra View District Hospital, Family Health Care,
   Eagle Mountain Casino and the City of Porterville. Large privately owned employers
   include Beckman Coulter, an Orange County based medical equipment manufacturer, and
   Royalty Carpet Mills, a carpet maker also based in Orange County. The largest private
   employer with headquarters in Porterville is Bank of the Sierra, with branch offices in Tulare,
   Fresno, and Kern counties.

 Projected Employment Trends
 Understanding areas of potential job growth is an additional aid to forecasting community
 needs. Table 2-8 presents job growth by occupation in Tulare County through 2014. Current
 mean annual wages for these positions are also listed. While the fastest growing jobs in
 Tulare County are the higher income jobs (such as computer, business operations, and legal),
 farming and office/administrative support jobs are expected to continue to constitute large
 portions of the employment base. These jobs are at the lower pay scales. Providing
 affordable housing to these groups presents a challenge to local jurisdictions, including
 Porterville.

Unemployment
Tulare County has had some of the highest unemployment rates in the nation. According to
the California Employment Development Department (EDD), October 2008, the
metropolitan statistical area of Visalia-Tulare-Porterville had an unemployment rate of 11.8
percent.
Most of the metropolitan areas suffering high unemployment are agricultural areas with large
populations of immigrants – other areas with very high unemployment rates are Merced,
Fresno, Salinas, Yuba City, and Bakersfield. The Bureau of Labor Statistics since 2000
indicates that Porterville has consistently had unemployment rates between 8.2 and 12.3
percent. Prior to 2000 unemployment rates for Porterville reached as high as 19.4 percent.
On a monthly basis, area unemployment rates have tended to dip during the months of May,
August, and September – which are traditionally harvest periods. Although Porterville has
established itself as a regional shopping, health care and service center, the average
unemployment rate within the City during 2007 was 8.5 percent, and for the month of
December 2008, unemployment rate in Porterville increased to 13.1 percent, according to the
EDD. This unemployment rate is not an indication of the estimate of the farmworker
population in the City, which tends to exhibit high unemployment rates during non-harvest
months.

children, whereas single-person households, especially        single persons living alone, families
                                                              related through marriage or blood,
those headed by seniors, may desire smaller, easier-to-       or unrelated persons who share

apartments.                                                   retirement or convalescent homes,
                                                              dormitories, or other group quarters
The City had 11,884 households in 2000 (Table 2-9).           situations are not considered
                                                              households.
Among these households, 77 percent were family
households. Nearly 53 percent of all households were married-couple households. Married
couples with children under 18 years old living at home comprised about 31 percent of all
households. Approximately one-quarter of all households in the City were single-parent
households. More than half of all single-parent households were female-headed with
children under 18 living at home. This group is typically considered to be a special needs
group that have particular vulnerabilities in finding and maintaining affordable housing.

alone. A significant percentage of these single-person households were headed by seniors,
constituting another potential group with specialized housing needs.

2.                                 HOUSEHOLD INCOME
Household income is one of the most important factors affecting housing opportunity. A
household's income determines its ability to balance housing costs with other basic
necessities of life. Income levels can and often do vary considerably among households and
affect housing choices such as tenure (ownership or rental), type, and location. According to
HUD’s most recent metropolitan area surveys, the Visalia-Porterville 2008 median income is
$46,900.
According to the 2000 census, the median household income for Porterville ($32,046) was
similar to that of Tulare County as a whole. Figure 2-2 compares the median household
incomes for Porterville with nearby cities and Tulare County. Of all cities in Tulare County,
only the City of Visalia had a median household income ($41,349) above the County median
household income ($33,983).
Median household income varies by race and ethnic origin. Median household income
among Hispanic households was $26,123. For White non-Hispanic households, median
household income was $37,865 or 145 percent of the median household income of Hispanic
households. Higher still was the median household income for Asian households; at
$40,463, this was the highest median household income among the various racial groups in
Porterville.

Poverty status
The 2000 Census shows that about 26 percent of the Porterville residents were living in
poverty. Among residents living in poverty, nearly 46 percent were under 18 years old.
Seniors constituted a small percentage of those in poverty - only 6.4 percent. Approximately
20 percent of all Porterville families lived in poverty; the vast majority (90 percent) of these
families in poverty had children under 18 years of age.
Among the various racial/ethnic groups, poverty is particularly prevalent among Hispanic
residents. Nearly two-thirds of all City residents in poverty were people of Hispanic origin.
Overall, approximately 17 percent of the City population was Hispanic living in poverty.
About one third of all Porterville residents in poverty status were born in foreign countries.
Of all foreign-born residents in poverty, an overwhelming majority – 86 percent – were not
U.S. citizens. In contrast, of all naturalized foreign-born citizens, only 19 percent were in
poverty status. Typically naturalization requires English language skills; those able to speak
English often have an easier time finding employment in higher paying jobs, whereas those
without English speaking skills may be consigned to lower paying work.
3.      SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding and holding on to decent, affordable housing
due to special circumstances relating to employment and income, household characteristics,
and disabilities, among others. These “special needs” groups in Porterville include seniors,
persons with disabilities, large households, single-parent households (especially female-
headed households with children), homeless persons, and agricultural workers (Table 2-10).
Following are more in-depth discussions of each special needs group.

Seniors
Seniors (those aged 65 years or older) often have special housing needs due to three reasons;
income, health care costs, and physical disabilities. According to the 2000 Census, about
3,738 seniors were living in Porterville, comprising 9.4 percent of the City population.
Households led by a senior comprised 18.4 percent of all City households. Some of the
special needs of seniors are:
    •   Limited Income: Many seniors have limited income available for health and other
        expenses. Among households where the householder was age 65 or older, about 59
        percent had household incomes of less than $30,000. Census data further indicate
        that 6.4 percent of all seniors were living at or below the poverty line.
    •   Disabilities: Among the seniors in Porterville, 43 percent had a disability.
        Approximately 350 seniors had “self-care” disabilities, requiring assistance in routine
        daily functions.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                                     2-14         2009-17 HOUSING ELEMENT

      •  Cost Burden: About 43 percent of all senior households that rented in 2000, paid
         more than 30 percent of their income on housing, relative to 22 percent of senior
         households who owned their homes.
In 2000, 71 percent of the senior-headed households were homeowners. Senior homeowners,
particularly, elderly women living alone, may require assistance in performing regular home
maintenance or repair activities due to physical limitations or disabilities, in addition to
constraints posed by limited incomes.
The special needs of seniors can be met through a range of services, including congregate
care, rent subsidies, assisted housing programs, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the
frail or disabled elderly, housing with architectural design features that accommodate
disabilities helps ensure continued independent living. Elderly persons with a mobility or
self-care limitation also benefit from transportation alternatives and shared housing options.
Senior housing with supportive services can be provided to assist with independent living.
Many such services are provided to Porterville seniors by the Kings/Tulare Area Agency on
Aging (KTAAA). Several of the KTAAA programs are intended to help seniors stay within
their present residences – including meal delivery services, chore and personal care
assistance, and similar programs. Similar services, including senior day care, are provided
by the Porterville Senior Day Care Center.
Within the City are two housing developments that are either reserved expressly for seniors
or available to lower income seniors. Santa Fe Plaza is restricted to very low income seniors.
As of March 2003, the annual income limit for one person at Santa Fe Plaza is $18,850.
Santa Fe Plaza has an on-site community center and is administered by the Housing
Authority of Tulare County (HATC). HATC also administers the La Serena Apartments,
which is open to all very low income individuals and families. The annual income limit as of
February 2009 is $18,850 for one person. Both facilities are popular and have long waiting
lists: 20 applicants are awaiting openings at Santa Fe; 824 applicants are on La Serena’s wait
list.
Several for-profit homes and/or supportive services for the elderly are also available in
Porterville. Nursing homes include Autumn Oaks, Valley Care Center, Porterville
Convalescent Hospital, Sierra Valley Rehabilitation Center ,Westwood Eldercare, Tanner’s
Park Place, and Sun Villa Manor Care Center. Autumn Oaks and Westwood offer both
assisted living and independent living arrangements.
Persons with Disabilities
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working, may
restrict one's mobility, or may make it difficult to care for oneself. Persons with disabilities
have special housing needs often related to the limited ability to earn a sufficient income, and
to a lack of accessible and affordable housing. Some residents have disabilities that require
living in a supportive or institutional setting.

Based on the 2000 Census, 7,458 persons in Porterville had some form of disability,
representing almost 19 percent of the City population. Of those between ages 21 and 64 with
disabilities, just 16 percent were employed. Given this low rate of employment, many of
these disabilities may be significant in nature.
The Porterville Developmental Center (PDC) is a state facility that provides intensive
training and supervision to individuals with the most severe limitations and disabilities,
whose needs cannot readily be met by available private community-based services.
Programs at PDC include: physical development; sensory development; habilitation and
social development; behavior adjustment; and adult physical and social development. The
PDC has also expanded a forensic unit. As of January 2009, the PDC inpatient population
was 612 with a capacity of 1,210; the facility also offers day care for less severe cases.
The living arrangement of persons with disabilities depends on the severity of the disability.
Many persons live at home in an independent fashion or with other family members. To
maintain independent living, persons with disabilities may need special assistance. This can
include special housing design features, income support for those who are unable to work,
and in-home supportive services, among others. In addition to the aforementioned Porterville
Developmental Center, other supportive service providers include private in-home care
providers and non-profit and governmental programs. The Porterville Sheltered Workshop
helps the disabled or those with habilitation challenges live independently. The Workshop is
particularly known for helping the disabled enhance their vocational skills so they can obtain
employment and achieve greater independence. The City also has smaller group homes for
the developmentally challenged. Good Shepherd Communities has Corporate offices in
Porterville manage a number of these residential group homes in the Porterville, throughout
California, and in several other states.

Generally, such large households require dwelling units with three or more bedrooms for
adequate housing. Dwelling units of this size tend to be ownership units; few multifamily
rental units with three or more bedrooms are available unless they are part of low-income
housing tax credit projects which incorporate three (3) or four (4) units for these large
families. Within the City, nearly 74 percent of all ownership housing units have three or
more bedrooms, while only 26 percent of the rental units have three or more bedrooms. As a
result, approximately 26 percent of all renter-households lived in overcrowded conditions,
defined as more than one person per room, compared to just 13 percent of all ownership
households.
To address overcrowding, communities can provide incentives for developers to build larger
apartments with three or more bedrooms. Often, the shortage of large rental units can also be
alleviated through the provision of affordable ownership housing, which can be coupled with
homeownership assistance.
Single-Parent Households
Most single-parent households with children have only one income with limited resources to
obtain decent and safe housing. Such households may also require special consideration and
assistance because of the greater need for supportive services such as day care and health
care.
Female-headed families with children are an especially vulnerable group because women
typically earn lower incomes and often take part-time jobs to accommodate childcare needs.
Nationally, single-parent households are twice as likely to be female-headed; among all
single-parent households living below the poverty level, an overwhelming majority are
female-headed.
Based on data from the 2000 Census, 1,495 female-headed households with children were
residing in Porterville, comprising 13 percent of all City households. Between 1990 and
2000, Porterville gained an additional 300 households headed by single females. Income
estimates from the 2000 Census indicate that approximately 40 percent of all Porterville
families in poverty were female headed. The relatively large size of this group as well as its
disproportionate need for services and assistance poses many significant social and planning
consequences, including the need for affordable units with sufficient space for a family.
Homeless Persons
An accurate assessment of the homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature
of the population, and because many individuals are not visibly homeless but move around in
temporary living conditions. In 2008, the Kings/Tulare County Continuum of Care
conducted a homeless survey to assess the nature and extent of homelessness in the region.
A total of 597 homeless persons in the two counties responded to the survey. The following
are some of the characteristics of the homeless in the Porterville area:

    •    64 percent have been homeless for one year or less; only 13 percent are considered
         chronic homeless
    •    44 percent are of Hispanic origin
    •    45 percent are female
    •    Adults between 40 and 49 years old are the largest group (26 percent) followed by
         adults between 30 and 39 years old (23 percent)
    •    37 percent are families with children
    •    16 percent are victims of domestic violence
    •    52 percent are considered disabled
    •    14 percent are employed
    •    72 percent are housed (45 percent with relatives and friends, 10 percent in transitional
         housing, 10 percent in emergency shelters, 7 percent in hotels/motels)
    •    Most needed services are dental care (61 percent), housing assistance (90 percent),
         and health care (58 percent)
Three types of facilities provide shelter for homeless individuals and families: emergency
shelters, transitional housing, and permanent housing:
    Emergency Shelter: A facility that provides overnight shelter and fulfills a client's basic
    needs (i.e. food, clothing, medical care) either on-site or through off-site services. The
    permitted length of stay can vary from one day at a time to three months.
    Transitional Housing: A residence that provides housing for up to two years. Residents
    of transitional housing are usually connected to supportive services designed to assist the
    homeless in achieving greater economic independence and a permanent, stable living
    situation. Services may include substance abuse treatment, mental and physical health
    care interventions, job training and employment services, individual and group
    counseling and life skills training.
    Permanent Housing: Affordable permanent housing or service-enriched permanent
    housing is linked with supportive services (on-site or off-site) and designed to allow
    formerly homeless clients to live at the facility on an indefinite basis.
Following are brief descriptions of homeless facilities located closest to Porterville. These
facilities serve a variety of homeless persons, including battered women and children,
persons with mental and/or physical disabilities, individuals, and needy families.
    The Porterville Area Coordinating Council (PACC) is a private, nonprofit organization
    that receives over 100 requests for assistance every month, many of which are for
    emergency housing. While the PACC does not operate an emergency shelter, it provides
    funding for individuals or families in need to spend one or two nights in a motel as
    emergency assistance.
    Porterville Rescue Mission provides meals, clothing, counseling, and related services to
    over 100 individuals and families per month.

    El Granito Foundation provides a range of services, including six emergency shelter
    beds. It also provides financial assistance for food, clothing, legal assistance and other
    essential services.
    Central California Family Crisis Center is a multi-faceted organization providing
    services primarily to women with young children dealing with domestic violence and
    abusive situations but also provides shelter for homeless women when beds are available.
    There are also transitional units for homeless. Its emergency shelter has 38 beds,
    including 4 cribs, and averages 31 clients per night. Minors – children under 18 years of
    age – constitute the majority of those served by the agency. The agency can also provide
    transitional housing to up to 18 individuals at any one time; individuals are allowed to
    stay for up to one year. The agency also provides an array of counseling, job training,
    and budgeting/financial planning assistance.
    The PAAR Center is a drug and alcohol recovery home with 81 beds of transitional
    housing available for both men and women clients. PAAR Center clients stay an
    average of 60-90 days and are typically referred to PAAR through Tulare County
    Prevention Services. The Center estimates that approximately 15 percent of clients are
    homeless.
    The Daybell-Brooks Transitional Shelter provides seven beds for homeless single men
    in addition to counseling and financial assistance.
    St. Vincent de Paul provides food, clothing, and financial assistance to homeless
    persons.
Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the
fields, processing plants, or support activities on generally year-round basis. When
workloads increase during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor,
often supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant workers,
defined as those whose travel distance to work prevents them from returning to their primary
residence every evening. Determining the true size of the agricultural labor force is
problematic. For instance, the government agencies that track farm labor do not consistently
define farmworkers (e.g. field laborers versus workers in processing plants), length of
employment (e.g., permanent or seasonal), or place of work (e.g., the location of the business
or field).
Farmworkers are generally considered to have special housing needs because of the limited
income and the unstable nature of employment (i.e., having to move throughout the year
from one harvest to the next). Statewide surveys provide some insight into the demographic
characteristics and housing needs of farmworkers. Among the major findings are:
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                        2-19                   2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

    Limited Income - Farmworkers typically earn very low incomes. According the the
    State Employment Development Department, mean annual wage for people holding
    farming/fishery/forestry occupations in Tulare County was $19,260 in 2008. While
    many farmworker households include extended family members and therefore are
    households with multiple wage-earners, when household income and household size are
    considered, many still fall in lower income group.
    Overcrowding - Because of the very low incomes, farmworkers have limited housing
    options and are often forced to double up to afford rents. A statewide survey indicates
    that overcrowding is a prevalent and significant housing problem among farmworkers.
    Substandard Housing Conditions - Many farmworkers live in overcrowded conditions
    and substandard housing, including informal shacks, illegal garage units, and other
    structures generally unsuitable for occupancy.
Porterville is surrounded by fertile agricultural land and is located in an important
agricultural region, both within California and the nation as a whole. According to the
California Economic Development Department, Tulare County remains ranked as one of
California’s largest agricultural producing counties in the total value crops. Census data
indicate that 1,588 persons (11 percent of the employed Porterville residents) worked in
agricultural positions. By 2014, persons employed in farming/fishery/forestry occupations
are expected to constitute 16.7 percent of all employed persons in the County. This figure
includes jobs in several supportive industries, such as food packing, processing, and
transport. However, the high unemployment rates in the City may indicate a larger
farmworker population in the City, which tends to exhibit high off-season unemployment
rates.
Almost all major farm and other agricultural producers that employ seasonal, migrant, or
year-round farmworkers are located outside the City boundaries in the unincorporated areas
of the County. Porterville is an urbanized community that offers affordable housing
opportunities for many. As discussed later in detail, housing costs in Porterville are the
lowest among the three largest communities in the County. The City also contains a larger
proportion of rental units than the County.        Many farmworkers migrate seasonally to
different parts of the County and State for work when the farmworker households reside in
the City. Specifically, the majority (77 percent) of the units approved, under construction, or
constructed recently are for households earning very low and low income households (Table
4-2), available to farmworker households.
The new Porterville General Plan includes an Agriculture/Rural/Conservation land use
designation that preserves agricultural and resource conservation areas. Incidental residential
uses are allowed in these areas. Clustered housing, in particular, is strongly encouraged
because it makes the provision of other infrastructure, such as roads and electricity, more
cost-effective and limits the impact on natural resources.

Furthermore, permanent housing for farmworker households, such as rental apartments
sponsored by the Rural Housing Services, or single-family homes constructed by self-help
groups, are permitted in the City. Rental housing is permitted by right in the R-2 and R-4
districts and single-family homes are permitted by right in the R-1 district. The Porterville
Zoning Ordinance regulates the development standards but not the users of developments.
As long as the proposed development meets City standards, no additional conditions are
placed when the potential occupants may be farmworker households. As demonstrated in
Chapter 4, Housing Resources, the City has adequate supply of vacant land that can
accommodate more than 746 additional units, including housing appropriate for farmworker
households.
The City assists farm worker households obtaining affordable housing through its First-Time
Low Income Home Buyer Program. A large proportion of households that have been
assisted under this program are farmworker households. Additionally, the Villa Sienna
mixed use project has received conditional approval for Joe Serna Farmworker Program
Funds and USDA Loan Funds of which will require a certain percentage of the 70 units will
be reserved for farmworkers.
Within and immediately adjacent to Porterville, no housing facility is designated for
agricultural workers and their families. However, two county facilities operated by the
Housing Authority of Tulare County (HATC) are located nearby. To the City’s west is the
Woodville Farm Center, which offers 178 units for agricultural workers and their families.
About 10 miles south of the City is the Terra Bella Farm Labor Center. This facility provides
14 units, each of which has 2 or 3 bedrooms. All of the units are available to farmworkers
and families, with the restriction that the head of household must be a legal resident of the
United States. According to HATC, as of December 30, 2008 fifteen (15) families were on
the waiting list for Woodville and 5 families were waiting for openings at Terra Bella.5
HATC notes that turnover at these facilities is limited – families tend to stay for many years.

that affect the quality of life for Porterville residents. Housing factors evaluated include:
housing stock and growth; tenure and vacancy rates; age and condition; housing costs; and
affordability, among others.
1.        HOUSING GROWTH
Between 2000 and 2008, 1,964 new housing units were built in Porterville, representing a 26
percent increase over nine years. Table 2-11 compares housing growth in Porterville with
other Tulare County jurisdictions.
According to the City’s General Plan 2030, 14,635 residential acres are provided within the
City’s planning area. A further discussion of available land for development within this
Housing Element period is provided in the “Housing Resources” chapter of the Housing
Element.

Mobility
Porterville, like the rest of Tulare County has had a mobile population. More than one half
of the City’s residents in 2000 had moved into new living quarters between 1995 and 2000.
At the national and state levels, this mobility has been attributed to historically low mortgage
rates.
Single-family housing construction in Porterville is likely to continue its growth despite
several significant economic hardship cycles. The City population has grown steadily in the

last two decades and is projected to continue an annual growth rate of 2.8 percent through
2017, according to the Tulare County Association of Governments. The housing stock also
increased due to annexations of unincorporated islands.
2.      HOUSING TYPE AND TENURE
Housing Type
The housing stock in Porterville consists predominantly of single-family units (Table 2-12).
Of the 2,155 new units constructed between 2000 and 2008, 1,849 (86 percent), were single-
family dwellings, the overwhelming majority of which were detached units. Although the
Census data indicate that the number of mobile homes decreased during the last decade, no
closure of any mobile home park or wholesale removal of mobile homes from the City
occurred during that period.6

Housing Tenure
Approximately 44 percent of all households are renters. In comparison, 39 percent of the
households countywide are renters. Race and ethnic origin are somewhat useful predictors of
housing tenure in Porterville. White, non-Hispanic householders are more likely to be
owners than renters – 62 percent of all White non-Hispanic householders in Porterville were
homeowners according to the Census. In contrast, Hispanic householders, both in Porterville
proper as well as the Porterville urbanized area, divide about equally into homeowners and
renters.

In 2000, 2,589 large households reside in the City. Households of this size typically need
housing units with three or more bedrooms, else they risk becoming overcrowded. Although
the number of three- or more bedroom units (6,325 in all) far exceeds the number of large
households in the City, most of the larger housing units were ownership units (Table 2-14).
Just over one quarter of all owned units have two or fewer bedrooms. In contrast, only about
one quarter of all rental units have three or more bedrooms; all others have two or fewer
units.
Furthermore, a mismatch between housing supply and needs typically exists in most
communities. Large units are often not occupied by large households; those with financial
means tend to occupy larger units. In Porterville, 74 percent of the ownership units in the
City are large units, with only 22 percent of the owner-households considered as large
households. In contrast, while 26 percent (1,374) of rental units are large units, about 23
percent (1,181) of the renter-households are large households, indicating a comparatively
tighter market for renter-households requiring large units (Table 2-15). Furthermore, many
large renter-households earn lower incomes and cannot afford the large rental units on the
market. As a result, 26 percent of the renter-households in the City lived in overcrowded
conditions, according to the 2000 Census.

Vacancy
According to the Census, vacancy rates in the City fluctuated. In 1990, the overall vacancy
rate was 4.8 percent, which was increased to 6.4 percent in 2000. The State Department of
Finance estimated that 2008 overall vacancy rate at 6.0 percent.
Vacancy rates reflect the balance between supply and demand. When supply exceeds
demand, the vacancy rate will increase. Conversely, when demand outpaces supply, the
vacancy rate will decrease, resulting in increased prices/rents. Typically, a vacancy rate of
two to three percent is considered optimum for ownership housing. Rental housing requires
a higher vacancy rate to allow for mobility; a vacancy rate of five to six percent for rental
housing is usually considered desirable. In 2000, vacancy rate for ownership units was 2.0
percent, compared to a vacancy rate of 7.2 percent for rental units. (Updated vacancy rate by
tenure is not available.)

provides additional insight on housing needs.
Overcrowding is an indicator that housing costs are high          – State Department of Housing
relative to income, such that families and individuals who         and Community Development
otherwise would live alone, share units so as to devote
income to other basic needs like food and medical care.
However, cultural preference is also a factor that influences the overcrowding rate in a
community. Many Hispanics and Asians live with extended family members. Also, recent
immigrants from Mexico and Asian countries have a high level of tolerance for
overcrowding due to the housing situations in their origin countries.
Among all households in Porterville, 2,291 households (19.1 percent) were overcrowded in
2000. Among renter-households, 1,374 households (26.2 percent) were overcrowded,
relative to 917 (13.6 percent) of all owner-households. Specifically, more than half of the
overcrowded households were considered to be severely overcrowded (15 percent of all
renter-households, 7 percent of all owners; 10 percent of all households). Overcrowding
rates have risen steadily in the last two decades. The overall overcrowding rate in 1980 was
5.2 percent; it grew to 13.4 percent in 1990 and 19.1 percent in 2000.

Overcrowding and Race/Ethnicity
Household size and overcrowding varies dramatically along racial and ethnic lines. In
comparing overcrowding information among racial and ethnic groups, however, one must
take cultural factors into account. For example, although more than 40 percent of
Porterville’s Asian population lives in overcrowded conditions, other Census data indicate
that Porterville’s Asian population is relatively prosperous on the whole and that this
overcrowding may be explained by cultural preferences rather than economic circumstances.
A different situation for Hispanic households may be determined by the Census data. Nearly
38 percent of all households with a Hispanic householder were overcrowded. Like Asians,
cultural preference plays a significant role in household overcrowding for Hispanics, who
often live with extended family members. However, given that the majority of Porterville
residents living in poverty were Hispanics, the overcrowding situation among this group may
also be income driven.
While overcrowding is usually income-influenced, the Census Bureau does not tabulate
overcrowding data by income levels.
3.      HOUSING AGE AND CONDITION
Housing stock in the City is relatively young. Two-thirds of all housing units in the City
were built in 1970 or later and 42 percent of all housing units were built in 1980 or later. The
age profile of housing in Porterville is roughly similar to that of Tulare County as a whole.
Housing age can be an important indicator of housing conditions. Housing is subject to
gradual deterioration over time. As a general rule within the housing industry, structures
older than 30 years begin to show signs of deterioration unless efforts are made to maintain
and improve the quality. Unless properly maintained, units 50 years and older typically
require major renovations to remain in good condition.

units have been well-maintained. While the relative youth of the housing stock might on its
own suggest generally good housing conditions, field reconnaissance indicates that certain
areas exhibit deferred maintenance issues. Specifically, the older homes are being used as
rentals, potentially presenting additional concerns regarding housing maintenance. Unlike
apartment complexes, on-site management is not available when homes are rented out
individually. Knowledge of and financial resources for repair works may also be limited for
property owners of single rental units or small complexes.
Housing Conditions Survey
As part of the Housing Element update in 2003, the City conducted a parcel-by-parcel
housing conditions survey that involved the City’s CDBG target areas and unincorporated
islands. The survey area encompassed 5,580 parcels, of which 1,074 are occupied by
nonresidential uses and 362 are vacant lots scattered throughout residential neighborhoods.
Excluding vacant and nonresidential parcels within the surveyed area, a total of 4,144 parcels
were surveyed for exterior conditions of the building structures. Figure 2-3 illustrates the
surveyed area.
Methodology: A windshield survey was conducted for 4,144 parcels. Structures, not units,
on the individual parcels were rated. Where a parcel contains more than one unit (such as
multi-family structures, duplexes, triplexes), an average rating for all structures on that parcel
was assigned. Since this was a windshield survey of exterior conditions, only conditions
visible from the public right-of-way were evaluated. The following criteria were used in the
survey:

Definition of Housing Conditions: Based on the criteria above, the following definitions of
housing conditions are used. Figure 2-4 illustrates the various housing conditions.
              Sound:         (0-9 points) A unit that appears new or well maintained and
                             structurally intact. The foundation should appear structurally
                             undamaged and there should be straight roof lines. Siding,
                             windows, and doors should be in good repair with good
                             exterior paint condition. Minor problems such as small areas
                             of peeling paint and/or other maintenance items are allowable
                             under this category.
              Minor:         (10-15 points) A unit that show signs of deferred maintenance,
                             or which needs only one major component such as a roof.
              Moderate:      (16-39 points) A unit in need of replacement of one or more
                             major components and other repairs, such as roof replacement,
                             painting, and window repairs.
              Substantial: (40-55 points) A unit that requires replacement of several
                             major systems and possibly other repairs (e.g. complete

                              foundation work, roof structure replacement and re-roofing, as
                              well as painting and window replacement).
                Dilapidated: (56+ points) A unit suffering from excessive neglect, where the
                              building appears structurally unsound and maintenance is
                              none-existent, not fit for human habitation in its current
                              condition, may be considered for demolition or at minimum,
                              major rehabilitation will be required.
Survey Results: Consistent with the age of the City’s housing stock, the majority of the
housing units in the target areas are in sound condition. Of the parcels surveyed,
approximately 85 percent are considered to be in sound condition. Approximately nine
percent require minor repairs and three percent require moderate repairs. However, close to
four percent of the units may require substantial repairs. The City does not have any units
requiring replacement due to dilapidated conditions.

HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
Housing Costs
Housing costs in Porterville and Tulare County are generally lower than most parts of
California. Compared to nearby counties, housing prices in Tulare County are low, according
to real estate sales data compiled by the California Association of Realtors (CAR). Within
Tulare County, Porterville’s median home price was the lowest among the three largest cities
(Figure 2-3).

Home prices were compiled based on an internet search of listed sales in Porterville. Most
homes available for sale were primarily single-family homes, with ten mobile homes also
listed. In addition, the Porterville Recorder listed four of the ten mobile home parks in the
City with available spaces listed for sale.
Three-bedroom single-family homes were the predominant size, selling at a median price of
$122,900 (Table 2-18). Some older and smaller homes were also available for sale at a
median price of $109,000. Overall median price of single-family homes was $324,950.
Mobile homes were selling at significantly lower prices, representing an affordable housing
option for many. The median price of mobile homes was $72,158.

          Note 1: The upper end figures for single-family homes are typically caused by homes on
          large lots. Several homes listed for sale have lot sizes over ten acres.
Approximately 44 percent of the households in Porterville                      Table 2-19
are renters. Therefore, the availability of rental housing in                  Apartment Rents, 2009

Housing Affordability
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually conducts housing
income surveys to determine the maximum affordable payments of different households and
the eligibility for federal housing assistance. These income surveys by HUD are adopted by
the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to determine
eligibility for state housing assistance. The Area Median Income (AMI) established by HCD
provides a benchmark for estimating the affordability of housing and the ability of
newcomers to move into the community.
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in
Porterville with the maximum affordable housing cost to households at different income
levels (Table 2-20). The affordable housing prices and rents in Table 2-20 can be compared
to current market prices for single-family homes and apartments to determine what types of
housing opportunities are available to households of different income levels.
Extremely low income households: Households whose incomes are at or below 30 percent
of AMI are considered extremely low income. A review of classified advertising sections of
the Porterville Recorder from January 2009 and an internet search of rental listings indicated
that a small percentage of advertised apartments for rent fell within these limits (mostly
$450-$497), but all were studios or one bedroom units. Two- and three-bedroom apartments,
more appropriate for families of four or more people, started at about $525 in monthly rent.
Housing opportunities for this income group are extremely limited.
Very Low Income Households: Very low-income households earn between 31 and 50
percent of the AMI. A review of classified advertising indicated that most of the two-
bedroom apartments during January 2009 were renting between $525 and $650 per month.
However, large households needing three-bedroom units may have difficulty finding
affordable housing.
With regard to ownership housing, housing units affordable to very low income households
range between $50,000 and $76,000. Aside from some small mobile/manufactured homes
and small and older single-family homes, few units listed for sale were affordable to very low
income households.

Low-Income Households: Low-income households earn between 51 and 80 percent of AMI.
Apartments and homes advertised for rent were mostly affordable to this income group. In
general, most two- and three-bedroom homes listed for sale were affordable to low income
households.

As a general rule of thumb, households are considered to have a housing cost burden (also
known as overpayment) when housing costs – mortgages, rents, and/or other costs associated
with housing – exceed 30 percent of gross household income. Housing cost burden is a
particular problem for some segments of the community.
The 2000 Census data indicate that almost half (approximately 2,400 households or 47
percent) of all rental households in Porterville spent 30 percent or more of household income
on rent in 1999. This percentage exceeded the rates for Tulare County (41 percent) and
California as a whole (42 percent).
Among households with extremely low incomes (less than 30 percent of the area median
income), 32 percent of the renters and 38 percent of the owners had a cost burden of over 30
percent, while 84 percent of the renters and 97 percent of the owners in this income group
had any housing problems. Similarly, among the very low incomes (less than half of the area
median income) households, 15 percent of the renters and 38 percent of the owners had a
housing cost burden, when overall, 82 percent of the renters and 71 percent of the owners in
this income group had some form of housing problems. These patterns indicate that
overcrowding and substandard conditions were impacting more households in these income
groups.
Overcrowding by tenure information is provided previously on page 2-26. Overall, 26
percent of the renter-households and 14 percent of the owner-households were considered
overcrowded. However, the City has not identified any analysis or survey including those
conducted by the Census of the Bureau that identify “overcrowding” or “overpayment” by
income data. Overpayment is a cost burden and is included in Table 2-21. Overcrowding by
income is not identified in the Census.
In contrast, housing cost burden was much less prevalent among homeowners –
approximately 1,800 households or 27 percent of owner-households spent 30 percent or more
of household income on housing costs in 1999, according to the Census. This figure was
lower than the rates for Tulare County (29 percent) and California as a whole (31 percent).
The City’s FTHB programs are specifically designed to assist families that are low and
extremely low income. Between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2009, 469 low income families
have participated in the City’s monthly workshops becoming eligible for FTHB financial
assistance. Of the 469 participants 47 were very low income and 162 were low income
families.
Senior residents who rent were most affected by housing cost burden. Such households
typically have fixed incomes, making rent increases more difficult to absorb. In Porterville,
about 43 percent of renter-households headed by seniors (age 65 or older) had a housing cost
burden. Among all senior homeowners, by contrast, only 22 percent had a housing cost
burden.

     Housing cost burden also varies by household type and is also more prevalent among lower
     income households than those in other income groups. As shown in Table 2-21, extremely
     low, very low, and low income large households are proportionately more impacted by
     housing cost burden than other households.

     5.           Inventory of Affordable Housing
     Many government programs assist with the creation and maintenance of affordable housing.
     Publicly assisted housing in Porterville includes housing subsidized with federal, state, and
     local funding resources (Table 2-22). The affordability of these housing units is typically
     governed by the loan terms and deed restrictions. Upon expiration of the loan terms and
     deed restrictions, or termination of subsidies, some of these assisted housing units may be at
     risk of converting to market rate housing. This section of the Housing Element provides an
     inventory of publicly assisted rental housing in the City, and the potential for these units to
     convert to market rate housing. For this Housing Element, the at-risk analysis covers the ten-
     year planning period of September 1, 2009 through August 31, 2019.
     At-Risk Housing
     Santa Fe Plaza and La Serena are two HUD-funded projects with contracts for Section 8
     rental assistance that are due to expire within the next ten years. However, both projects are
     nonprofit owned and the intent to maintain these units as long-term affordable housing.
     Furthermore, HUD has prioritized funding for Section 8 contract renewals for nonprofit-
     owned properties, particularly for housing serving seniors and disabled persons. Therefore,
     CITY OF PORTERVILLE                                               2-38               2009-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
HUD and the California Housing Partnership consider these projects as low risk of
converting to market-rate housing.
In addition, three FmHA Section 515 housing developments are located in Porterville.
Section 515 projects have mortgage terms of 50 years. Two of the projects – Alderwood and
Evergreen – have rent subsidy contracts that will expire over the next 10 years. The third
project, Porterville Gardens, has no rent subsidy contract and is not eligible to convert to
market-rate housing.
In addition to the potential for expiring rent subsidies, these projects are also eligible to
prepay the remaining mortgage and opt out of affordability controls. However, the nature of
the program makes it difficult for these projects to prepay and convert to market-rate rents.
To qualify for prepayment and conversion, the owner must prove that the affordable housing
provided by the project is not needed. Discussions with FmHA representatives indicate that
few farm housing projects have ever been able to document that affordable, farm housing is
no longer needed. Therefore, the affordable housing restrictions are expected to continue for
the entire duration of the loan. Additional incentives, such as rent subsidies, are often offered
to encourage the continued affordability of the units.

Preservation of At-Risk Housing
To maintain the existing affordable housing stock, the City may either preserve the existing
assisted units or replenish the affordable housing with new units. HUD provides the Mark-
to-Market and Mark-up-to-Market programs for Section 8 projects seeking renewal. If
current contracted rents exceed the Fair Market Rent (FMR), HUD will provide favorable tax
treatment to property owners in return for preserving the units at affordable rents (Mark-to-
Market). For apartments renting at below FMR rates, HUD allows rents to be increased to
levels comparable to market rents, though not exceeding 150 percent of the FMR (Mark-up-
to-Market).
Given the nonprofit ownership of the two Section 8 projects, contract renewal is expected as
long as Section 8 funding continues to be available. Should Section 8 funding become
unavailable in the future, the City is willing to use and/or pursue other funding sources to
provide ongoing rent subsidies. Similarly, should rent subsidies from FmHA are terminated,
the City is willing to use, pursue, or set-aside other funding sources to maintain these housing
units as affordable rentals. Approximately $96,514 in rent subsidies may be needed monthly
or $1,158,168 annually to maintain affordability for the 274 very-low-income households
(Table 2-23) residing at the four developments.
Another option for preservation is to reduce the monthly mortgage payment on the property
to the extent that rent subsidies would no longer be needed to maintain the financial viability
of the projects. This can be achieved by refinancing the remaining mortgage with a reduced
interest rate or by providing a lump-sum principal write-down to the projects.

Replacement Option
The City also may wish to build new very low-income housing units to replace any at-risk
units lost. Given the nonprofit ownership of Santa Fe Plaza and La Serena and the
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                                                               2-41                                   2009-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
commitment to providing affordable housing, constructing new units, while a worthwhile
action, is not a necessary action to maintain the affordable housing stock.
The cost of developing housing depends upon a variety of factors, including density, size of
the units (i.e., number of bedrooms), location, land costs, and type of construction. The
average construction cost for a rental residential unit is approximately $54,000 (including
land, construction, financing, marketing, and profit), based on discussions with developers
active in Porterville (see Chapter 3 for discussions on construction and land costs).
Replacement of the 104 affordable units at the two FmHA projects could cost approximately
$5.6 million, with many important variables that could alter the overall costs. Given a
limited pool of financial resources, development of replacement housing should seek to
leverage participation by non-profit or for-profit housing developers, or other public entities.
The Porterville Hotel once provided 70 affordable studio and one bedroom units but due to
health and safety issues, the building was considered unsafe. As leases terminated they were
not renewed. Currently the building sits vacant, but in 2008 the City began talks with the
owner and lenders involved in effort to come up with a demo and rebuilding plan. As part of
the City’s efforts to replace the units lost with closing of the Porterville Hotel, the City is
working with the owner and HCD to transfer the loan obligations and the affordability
covenants to a new project, the Villa Sienna, in the downtown area. The Redevelopment
Agency has pledged up to $1.2 million in low/moderate funds for the project and have
assisted the developer in being awarded $2.3 million in Prop 1C Infill funds and $1 million in

                                  Land Use
This element of the General Plan constitutes the framework for land use planning in
Porterville. To provide context, the evolution of the City is described and existing land use in
the City is summarized. The guiding principles of the land use framework, the General Plan
Land Use Diagram (Diagram), the land use classification system, and the buildout of this Plan
to the year 2030 are then presented.
2.1     BACKGROUND & CONTEXT
HISTORICAL LAND USE DEVELOPMENT
Much of the existing land use pattern found in the Planning Area can be traced back to
Porterville’s evolution as a valley agriculture center. Downtown Porterville is similar to many
older Central Valley downtown districts, with a mixture of retail, public facilities, and older
residential neighborhoods. Larger commercial, agriculture, and newer residential
neighborhoods are located further out from the city center. Some industrial land is located
adjacent to State Route 190 (SR 190) and Union Pacific Railroad. Parks and schools are
distributed throughout residential neighborhoods within the city.
EXISTING LAND USE CHARACTERISTICS
The existing land use pattern in the Planning Area, based on 2005 data, is illustrated in Figure
2-1, and current land uses are listed in Table 2-1. Single Family Residential and Public/Quasi-
Public were the most significant existing land uses located within the 2005 City Limits, each
representing more than 20 percent of the total land use. More than 1,500 acres (17 percent) of
the incorporated land was designated as vacant, with no identified land use designation.

Porterville General Plan
Within the Planning Area, approximately 21,270 acres or 59 percent of the total land area
was being used for agriculture and other rural uses (generally categorized as
Agriculture/Rural/Conservation). Thirteen percent of the whole Planning Area was categorized
as single family residential and 10 percent was considered vacant.
Other land uses in the Planning Area include commercial, retail, and industrial. Downtown
lies near the center of the Planning Area, bordered by Morton Avenue to the north, Olive
Avenue to the south, D Street to the west, and Fourth Street to the east. Main Street is the
central commercial street. Other large commercial areas are located along State Route 65 (SR
65) and Olive Avenue. The majority of the industrial sites are in proximity to the intersection
of SR 190 and Main Street, and in proximity to the Union Pacific Railroad. A few industrial
developments are also located near the Porterville Municipal Airport.

2.2        GROWTH STRATEGY
This General Plan shows how the community would like Porterville to grow over the planning
period, through 2030. Through integration of all the General Plan Elements, this General Plan
will guide sustainable physical and economic growth, while conserving natural and cultural
resources.
COMPACT
Urban Development Boundary
Clearly defined urban edges reflect a commitment to focus future growth within the City in
order to prevent urban sprawl and protect environmentally sensitive areas. The Urban
Development Boundary (UDB) is one of the best strategies to achieve this. The UDB protects
the health, safety, welfare, and quality of life of the residents of Porterville by concentrating

future residential, commercial, and industrial growth in areas already served by urban services
or areas where such services are to be provided consistent with this General Plan.
The UDB is an administrative boundary beyond which urban development is not allowed
during the time period for which it is effective. The current UDB was most recently amended
in 1993. Tulare County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) allows the UDB to be
reviewed and amended every five years to ensure an adequate land supply is provided to
accommodate 10 years of residential land demand and 20 years of non-residential land
demand. Following General Plan adoption, the UDB will be reviewed and updated.
Open Space Action Plan
Porterville’s Open Space Action Plan consists of the goals, principles and policies presented in
the Open Space & Conservation Element. The open space network reinforces the limits of
urban development by designating land around the growth area as Agriculture/
Rural/Conservation, Park, and Rural Residential. Additional detail on how the action plan
will be implemented is in the Implementation Chapter. Taken together, these initiatives
specifically respond to and are consistent with the Government Code’s requirements for an
Open Space Action Plan.
Infill Development
The Urban Development Boundary complements General Plan policies emphasizing infill
development, a thriving downtown, new industrial parks and additional housing
opportunities. In addition to the 1,580 acres of vacant land within the 2006 City limits, more
than 700 acres can be classified as underutilized, based on a improvement to land value ratio,
and may have redevelopment potential. Infill development is encouraged with the Urban
Development Boundary. In addition, the Economic Development and Land Use Elements
provide strategies for fostering a strong Downtown that is the center of the community and a
source of positive identity for the City of Porterville.
BALANCED
The General Plan Land Use Diagram (Figure 2-2) illustrates a mix of land uses that meet the
housing and economic development needs of the community while balancing growth so that
Downtown is once again the “heart of the City” and environmental and cultural resources are
protected. In recent years, the majority of the growth and development has occurred in the
northwest of the City. This Plan re-centers the City on Downtown by promoting growth in the
eastern portions of the Planning Area.
In addition to balancing the anticipated growth geographically, the General Plan Land Use
Diagram balances residential growth with employment-generating land uses. More than 2,000
additional acres of commercial and industrial land for potential employment development
have been planned. This will help not only to create jobs for local residents, but also balance
the job to housing ratio.
EQUITABLE
This General Plan is predicated on the idea that new development should pay its own way, so
existing residents do not have to assume the costs of providing infrastructure and services to
                                                                                                 19

Porterville General Plan
growth areas. The key principle underpinning the Plan’s policies for development mitigation is
that the development community has an obligation to pay its fair share of costs so growth will
not diminish the quality of public services, facilities, and lifestyle that are enjoyed by those
who live in the community. Development mitigation and growth management policies will be
used as tools to manage all development within Porterville and protect and enhance open
space and environmental resources.
BETTER NEIGHBORHOODS
The General Plan directs residential expansion
in the new growth areas into a network of
approximately seventeen neighborhoods. These
neighborhoods are planned to contain a mix of
uses and housing types. Each neighborhood
will have a well-defined, mixed-use center with
neighborhood commercial and publicly-
oriented uses, such as a park and recreation
facility or a school. By creating these centrally
located hubs, a larger number of residents have
the option to bike or walk for non-work
related trips. The General Plan Land Use
Diagram depicts seven residential and two The General Plan will promote development of new
mixed-use land use designations. These land neighborhoods around publicly-oriented uses.
uses will accommodate a diverse range of
housing types and prices to provide more
housing choices. Policies in the General Plan strive to promote the integration of new
neighborhoods with existing urban development, and to preserve and enhance neighborhood
connectivity with a continuous street network.
One of the new neighborhoods proposed in the General Plan Land Use Diagram is a Resort
Residential community along the northwestern shore of Lake Success. This area is envisioned
to incorporate a mix of land uses which provide a variety of housing types for all ages and
income levels, and a complete open space system. The residential neighborhoods would be
environmentally planned to be compact and walkable with some commercial and community
services. The recreational facilities may include a golf course, a hotel, new boat ramps, parks,
and trails.
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES
Another priority over the next two decades is to ensure opportunities for economic
development for the residents and the City as a whole. New jobs and industries, a skilled labor
force, thriving local businesses and a high-quality of life for all residents will help preserve
“the good life.” In order to facilitate economic development, a range of commercial and retail
sites and ample land for industrial and educational development has been designated in the
General Plan Land Use Diagram. The Economic Development Element provides additional
policies and strategies for this initiative. The Land Use Element also provides guidance for new
and revitalized commercial areas, including neighborhood and regional shopping centers,
office parks and mixed-use districts.

          component of neighborhood centers.
          The Zoning Ordinance will establish a minimum site area and use mix so
          centers include more than just a convenience store or gas station. They also will
          need to provide for transit stops and related amenities. The City may offer FAR
          or density bonuses or other incentives for projects undertaking elective
          improvements that further the City’s community design and/or open space
          objectives. This type of density bonus cannot be combined with the affordable
          housing bonus. Off-site improvements directly resulting from a project’s
          impacts, as specified in the Zoning Ordinance, will be required under the City’s
          development mitigation program; the bonus is intended for improvements that
          go beyond the required minimum.
LU-I-3    Amend the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) in order to guide growth
          through annexation and development, and the efficient extension of public
          services to new areas.
          The UDB will be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure that it provides
          for a 10-year supply of developable residential land and a 20-year supply of
          developable commercial and industrial land, consistent with the General Plan
          and LAFCO requirements. The UDB will be adopted separately by the City
          Council as a General Plan implementation policy.
LU-I-4    Seek LAFCO approval of a Sphere of Influence (SOI) line that accommodates
          planned urban development under a General Plan.
                                                                                             23

Porterville General Plan
                    This policy is not intended to limit extension of services to existing rural uses,
                    nor deny existing rural property owners the option of requesting annexation.
LU-I-5              Require contiguous development within the UDB unless it can be demonstrated
                    that development of property which is contiguous to urban development is
                    unavailable.
                    The City desires to prevent leapfrog development where development skips
                    over available land to outlying and isolated areas. Contiguous development
                    will reduce sprawl, safeguard agriculture land, and reduce the cost of extending
                    services.
LU-I-6              Adopt, and maintain in place, a development mitigation program to ensure
                    that all new growth is paying its share of the costs associated with that growth.
                    This program will include two components:
                    •    Local Mitigation Program: The local development fee program will
                         establish fees, exactions, assessments or other mitigation measures to fund
                         streets and other city-owned facilities. Revenue provided from this program
                         shall not be used to replace private developer funding of any required
                         improvements that have or would have been committed to any project.
                    •    Regional Mitigation Program: The regional development fee program will
                         establish fees, exactions, assessments or other mitigation measures to fund
                         State highway and other regional transportation improvements needed to
                         mitigate the impacts of planned development under the General Plan.
                         Regional development impact fees may be established under this program
                         that would apply to all new development in the City, unless exempt.
LU-I-7              Use other funding mechanisms to augment developer and/or mitigation fees,
                    when and where appropriate.
                    In certain situations, it may benefit the City to advance funds, prior to
                    developer funding and/or project completion. Additional financing options
                    available to the City include but are not limited to: reimbursement agreements;
                    redevelopment tax increment financing; debt financing; and assessment
                    districts. None of these mechanisms precludes the developer’s responsibility to
                    pay the cost or mitigate the impact of their proposed development.
LU-I-8              Approve development projects only after making findings that one or more of
                    the following conditions are met:
                    •    No General Fund revenue will be used to replace developer funding that
                         has or would have been committed to any other public project;
                    •    The development project will fully fund all public facilities and
                         infrastructure, including streets, water, sewer and storm drainage systems,
                         parks and public safety facilities and equipment, as necessary to directly
                         mitigate the impact of the new development; and
                    •    The development project will pay impact fees for public facilities and
                         infrastructure improvements in proportion to the development’s impacts, as
                         per the approved master plans.

2.3      GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DIAGRAM
The General Plan Land Use Diagram, Figure 2-2, is a graphic representation of the Plan’s
themes and policies. It designates the proposed general location, distribution, and extent of
land uses through 2030. The Diagram is to be used and interpreted only in conjunction with
the text and other figures contained in the General Plan. The Diagram legend includes the land
use classifications described below, which represent an adopted component of the Plan.
The Diagram is not parcel-specific and uses on sites less than one acre in size are generally not
depicted. The Zoning Map which will be prepared subsequent to the adoption of the General
Plan will be parcel-specific.
DENSITY/INTENSITY STANDARDS
As required by State law, the land use classifications of the General Plan specify a range for
housing density and building intensity for each land use type. Residential density is expressed
as housing units per gross acre (including public streets and other rights-of-way). Maximum
permitted ratio of gross floor area to site area, called Floor Area Ratio (FAR), is specified for
non-residential uses. FAR is a broad measure of building bulk that controls both visual
prominence and traffic generation. It can be clearly translated to a limit on building bulk in
the Zoning Ordinance and is independent of the type of use occupying the building. These
density/intensity standards allow circulation and public facility needs to be determined.
Density (housing units per acre) and intensity (FAR) standards are for gross developable land
(that is, including proposed streets and other rights-of-way), but excluding areas subject to
physical or environmental constraints, which include ridgelines and steep hillside slopes, creek
corridors and floodways, and areas to be dedicated for greenways or habitat protection. The
density/intensity standards do not imply that development projects will be approved at the
maximum density or intensity specified for each use. Zoning regulations consistent with
General Plan policies and/or site conditions may reduce development potential within the
stated ranges.
The Zoning Ordinance, as amended to implement the General Plan, may provide specific
exceptions to the FAR limitations for uses with low employment densities, such as research
facilities, or low peak-hour traffic generation, such as a hotel or hospital. Intensity standards
for non-residential and mixed-use development are for each entire development site; that is,
intensities on individual parcels may exceed the maximum, provided each overall development
project does not exceed the stipulated intensity. This type of flexibility in density and intensity
standards may also be provided for planned developments in the Zoning Ordinance.
                                                                                                    25

LAND USE CLASSIFICATIONS
The following descriptions apply to land uses indicated on the General Plan Land Use
Diagram. Land use classifications are organized into the following categories: Residential,
Mixed-Use, Commercial, Office/Industrial, and Public/Open Space.
Residential
Rural Residential. This designation is intended to allow opportunities for rural living on lots
ranging in size from 2.5 to 10 acres or more. This land use is around the periphery of the
community because it helps serve as a transition between agriculture/open space and more
intensive urban uses. This type of development helps define the limits of urban development.
Clustered development is encouraged, and smaller lots may be allowed, provided that the
overall density does not exceed 0.2 units per acre, with lower limits applying in the Hillside
Development Zone.
Resort Residential. This designation is intended to allow residential development along the
Lake Success shore and surrounding hillsides. There is an emphasis on creating a resort
community with supporting commercial and recreation uses. Pedestrian-oriented design
standards, including clustered development patterns, will promote sustainable development.
The maximum overall density is 5.0 units per acre, with lower limits applying in the Hillside
Development Zone.
Very Low Density Residential. This designation is typical of large lot or executive home
single-family subdivisions. The maximum residential density is 2.5 units per gross acre.
Low Density Residential. This density represents typical single-family subdivisions. The
maximum residential density is 6.0 units per gross acre.
Low-Medium Density Residential. This density is also for typical single-family subdivisions,
but allows for smaller lots. The maximum residential density is 9.0 units per gross acre.
Medium Density Residential. This density range would accommodate a variety of housing
types, such as small-lot single-family homes, detached zero lot line developments, duplexes,
townhouses, and garden apartments. Pedestrian-oriented design and clustered development
can support higher levels of density. The maximum residential density is 12.0 units per gross
acre.
High Density Residential. This classification is intended to accommodate attached homes,
two- to four-plexes, and apartment buildings. The maximum residential density is 24.0 units
per gross acre.

                                                                          Chapter 2: Land Use Element
Mixed-Use
Downtown Mixed-Use. Downtown Mixed-Use development allows for a mostly vertical mix
of commercial, service, office, and residential uses. The vertical nature of this type of use may
allow for a reduction in the minimum parking requirements. This designation allows a
maximum FAR of 3.0. The maximum residential density is 30.0 units per gross acre.
Commercial Mixed-Use. This designation allows for either horizontal or vertical mixed-use
development. Commercial, service, office, and residential uses are allowed. Buildings more
than one story are strongly encouraged. The designation allows a maximum FAR of 2.0. The
maximum residential density is 24.0 units per gross acre.
Commercial/Office/Industrial
Downtown Retail. Pedestrian-oriented and “Main Street” design standards, a vertical mix of
uses, and the retention of a unique retail environment is the focus in the Downtown area. This
designation allows for a maximum FAR of 3.0.
Retail Centers. Design and use standards will be established for regional shopping centers
located at major circulation intersections. Large format or “big box” retail and auto sales as
well as travel related services, such as hotels and gas stations are allowed. This designation
allows for a maximum FAR of 0.35.
General and Service Commercial. This designation is intended for retail and services uses that
meet local and regional demand. Examples of allowable uses include: equipment rental and
repair, commercial print shops, auto sales, storage facilities, and wholesale businesses, and
specialized retail not normally found in shopping centers. Accessory office uses related to the
primary commercial use are also allowed. This designation allows for a maximum FAR of
0.40.
Neighborhood Commercial. This designation is intended for small-scale commercial
development that primarily provides office space and convenience retail for local
neighborhoods. This designation allows for a maximum FAR of 0.30.
Professional Office. This designation is intended for office complex development, including
professional and medical offices, as well as research and development activities. Small
restaurants, support services, convenience retail and limited medium and high density
residential are also allowed. This designation allows for a maximum FAR of 0.50.
Industrial Park. This designation comprises a mix of light industrial, secondary office, bulk
retail, and service uses. Typical uses include warehouse, mini-storage, research and
development, wholesale, bulk retail, and office space with limited customer access. Other uses
may be allowed, such as commercial recreation, distribution centers, or other uses that require
large, warehouse-style buildings. Small-scale retail and service uses serving local employees
and visitors are permitted as secondary uses. This designation allows for a maximum FAR of
0.40.
                                                                                                   27

Porterville General Plan
Industrial. This designation allows primary manufacturing, refining, and similar activities
including those with outdoor facilities. It also accommodates warehousing, distribution, with
support commercial services and ancillary office space. No retail uses are allowed. This
designation allows for a maximum FAR of 0.60.
Agriculture/Rural/Conservation
Agriculture/Rural/Conservation.             This
designation preserves agricultural and
resource conservation areas. Incidental
residential uses with septic systems are
allowed, subject to health and environmental
standards. Clustered housing is strongly
encouraged because it makes the provision of
other infrastructure, such as roads and
electricity, more cost-effective and limits the
impact on natural resources. Industrial gravel
and aggregate mining is allowed in areas
designated as Mineral Resource Zones.              The General Plan will protect surrounding productive
                                                   agricultural lands.
Public Uses and Open Space
Public/Institutional. This designation is intended for lands owned by public entities, including
the Municipal Airport, City Hall, County buildings, and the hospital. At the Municipal
Airport, industrial park uses will be allowed. It will provide for needed public facilities,
including, but not limited to, recycling centers, sewage treatment ponds, and police and fire
stations. This designation allows for a maximum FAR of 0.25.
Education. This designation is intended for lands owned by public or private entities for
educational purposes, including schools, colleges, vocational training facilities, and
administrative offices.
Commercial Recreation. This designation is intended for campgrounds, off-road vehicle
complexes, and other recreation areas where patrons usually pay to participate. The maximum
FAR is 0.10.
Park. This designation applies to both public and private recreation sites and facilities. It
allows for a maximum FAR of 0.10.

2.4     RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
The General Plan promotes a mix of residential
densities and compact neighborhood design that
provide for efficient use of available land resources
and maintain a compact form that is less intrusive
on the surrounding countryside. The Plan also
provides for a mix of housing types to serve the
needs of all Porterville residents.
Community facilities that are appropriate for a
residential environment, including residential care,
day care, elderly care, and alcoholism or drug
abuse recovery or treatment facilities will be New multifamily development will occur around
allowed within neighborhoods, consistent with neighborhood centers and at other appropriate
State and federal law, because they are considered locations.
“protected” facilities and local zoning can not
exclude them as long as specified standards and
licensing requirements are met.
GUIDING POLICIES
LU-G-6          Provide for residential development with strong community identities,
                appropriate and compatible scales of development, identifiable centers and
                edges and well-defined public spaces for recreation and civic activities.
LU-G-7          Guide new development into compact neighborhoods with a defined, mixed-
                use center including public open space, a school or other community facilities,
                and neighborhood commercial.
LU-G-8          Allow and encourage efficient infill development in existing neighborhoods.
LU-G-9          Provide sufficient land with appropriate parcel sizes to support a full range of
                housing types and prices.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
LU-I-10         Amend the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances to include:
                •   Minimum lot sizes and densities consistent with the Plan’s land use
                    classifications;
                •   Development standards that permit townhouses and zero-lot line attached
                    or detached single-family dwellings on sites designated for low-medium,
                    medium, or medium-high densities;
                •   Development standards that permit second units, small family daycares,
                    and residential care homes in neighborhoods in accord with State law; and
                                                                                                  33

Porterville General Plan
                    •    Sustainable design standards that will achieve compact, walkable
                         neighborhoods and provide an interconnected network of local streets.
LU-I-11             Only allow gated communities in very low density, planned development areas,
                    and Resort Residential areas.
LU-I-12             Require residential development on slopes over six percent to comply with the
                    Hillside Development Ordinance.
                    This ordinance establishes a Hillside Development zoning district with
                    standards and review procedures tailored to the City’s needs and expectation
                    for hillside development.
LU-I-13             Discourage residential development within the Airport Safety Zone. If
                    residential development is approved in the County within the Airport Safety
                    Zone, it must comply with Tulare County Airport Land Use Commission’s
                    land-use compatibility standards and density restrictions.
                    The County is currently preparing an Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
                    which will include updated information for a safety zone.
LU-I-14             Allow residential developments to employ creative site design, landscaping, and
                    architectural quality that blend with the characteristics of each location and its
                    surroundings and offer superior design solutions.
LU-I-15             Adopt community design standards for new residential development.
                    These could include but are not limited to:
                    •    Maximum block length;
                    •    Maximum ratio of block length to width;
                    •    Limited use of dead-end streets;
                    •    Orientation of residential building; and
                    •    Required connectivity.
                    Exceptions may be provided for infill sites and projects in the Hillside
                    Development Zone.
LU-I-16             Establish guidelines and incentives to promote green building techniques and
                    materials in residential development.
LU-I-17             Require that all new subdivisions preserve natural, cultural, and biological
                    resources, including stands of large trees and rock outcroppings, to the
                    maximum extent feasible.
LU-I-18             Protect existing residential neighborhoods from the encroachment of
                    incompatible activities and land uses, and environmental hazards.

LU-I-19          Enforce zoning and development regulations through project review,
                 construction inspections, and code enforcement, with fees to enable full-cost
                 recovery for providing these services.
                 State law allows cities to set permit fees to recover administrative costs.
2.5      RETAIL, COMMERCIAL, OFFICE & MIXED-USE
RETAIL & COMMERCIAL
Clusters of commercial uses are designed to provide goods, services, and employment
opportunities to both local residents and people from surrounding communities. These clusters
are called neighborhood and regional centers. A neighborhood center is composed of a mix of
retail, civic, and service-oriented uses which is often surrounded by higher density housing.
These centers help support local transit and provide places for social interaction for the
neighborhood residents. The Plan provides for new neighborhood centers, located closer to
where people live and designed with the pedestrian in mind.
Attractive, well-designed regional centers are critical in shaping the identity and image of
Porterville. The Plan builds on the regional accessibility of state routes 65 and 190 in order to
plan for regional, auto-oriented commercial development which will capture out-of-town sales
tax revenue.
OFFICE
The General Plan recognizes the need for new office development, both in free-standing office
buildings within existing commercial areas, along arterial streets and in new office parks. Sites
that can accommodate flexible office space facilities will be in demand as the local economy
matures and the City implements the Economic Development strategy described in Economic
Development Element.
The General Plan Land Use Diagram provides sites for both larger site office parks and
smaller, integrated office uses, designated as Professional Office. Smaller sites are typically
expected to be local-serving professional and administrative office environments, such as
medical, real estate, or financial services. Larger sites are envisioned as office parks that draw
employees from a wider area and provide more jobs. Offices are also permitted in
Neighborhood Commercial area, the Downtown Planning Area, and Retail Centers and as
accessory uses in General and Service Commercial areas and Industrial Parks. A vertical mix
of uses where new office uses are located above the first floor or as a secondary use in multi-
tenant buildings can be an efficient use of land and promote retail continuity at the street level.
MIXED-USE
Mixed-Use designations which provide commercial and residential uses in the same area can
help reduce auto dependence, preserve green space and natural resources, and promote
revitalization, economic development, and modestly priced housing. The Downtown Mixed-
Use designation encourages a higher-density, vertical mix of uses with residential or office uses
above ground floor retail or other commercial uses. It also provides for the development of
more multi-family residential within walking distance of Downtown. The Commercial Mixed-
                                                                                                    35
Porterville General Plan
Use designation allows for lower density but multi-story development where the uses may be
either horizontally or vertically mixed.
GUIDING POLICIES
LU-G-10             Foster viable, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood centers with vertically- and
                    horizontally-mixed-use development.
LU-G-11             Foster strong, visually attractive regional commercial centers with a mix of
                    tenants to serve both local and regional needs.
LU-G-12             Promote the location of professional and administrative offices Downtown,
                    near post-secondary education facilities, and in other mixed-use districts.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
LU-I-20             Establish standards for pedestrian-oriented design in neighborhood centers.
                    Pedestrian-oriented design standards may include, but would not be limited to:
                    •    Limitations on maximum block length;
                    •    Minimum sidewalk width;
                    •    Required streetscape improvements, including street trees;
                    •    Building height and articulation;
                    •    Building setbacks;
                    •    Location of entries; and
                    •    Parking location and required landscaping.
                    The City also may provide additional incentives for projects that contribute to
                    the pedestrian, bicycle and transit networks, and/or the open space network.
LU-I-21             Prohibit new strip commercial developments.
                    For purposes of this policy, strip development is defined as a row of at least
                    three stores, where each has direct access to a street with a surface parking lot
                    between the building and the street. There may or may not be an anchor
                    tenant.
LU-I-22             Promote and support the revitalization and infill development in existing retail
                    shopping centers.
LU-I-23             Establish an incentive program that will provide for density and FAR bonuses
                    for mixed-use development that includes amenities for public benefit, such as
                    workforce housing, pedestrian-oriented facilities (outdoor seating, plazas,
                    weather protection, transit waiting areas), historic preservation, cultural
                    facilities, public art and water features, and open space preservation.

LU-I-24         Allow supporting retail, business services and other complementary uses in
                Professional Office districts.
2.6     INDUSTRY
The General Plan proposes to shift the focus of industrial development to areas south of SR
190, particularly around the Airport. Existing, well established industrial areas in other parts
of the City will be retained. Plan policies seek to increase the supply of pre-zoned, “ready-to-
go” job producing land. This will improve Porterville’s competitiveness in the regional
economy by decreasing start-up time for new development. In addition, the Plan reduces the
potential for conflicts associated with industrial uses adjacent to other sensitive uses.
GUIDING POLICIES
LU-G-13         Improve Porterville’s prominence as a major center of economic activity in
                Tulare County.
LU-G-14         Ensure the availability of land and buildings to accommodate new industries
                and the expansion of existing businesses while accounting for market factors.
LU-G-15         Promote clustering of industrial uses into areas that have common needs and
                are compatible in order to maximize their efficiency.
LU-G-16         Discourage industrial development in locations where access and operations
                conflict with neighboring land uses.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
LU-I-25         Establish buffering requirements and performance standards intended to
                minimize harmful effects of excessive noise, light, glare, and other adverse
                environmental impacts.
LU-I-26         Actively promote the annexation           of   industrial   designated     lands   to
                accommodate planned job growth.
LU-I-27         Require Master Plans for new Industrial Parks over a specified size to ensure
                coordination of land use and infrastructure planning.
                The City could waive this requirement where existing infrastructure can
                accommodate the planned industrial use.
LU-I-28         Foster high-quality design and allow secondary uses, such as child care and
                other employee-serving amenities in Industrial Parks, if they complement
                primary use without compromising public health and safety.
LU-I-29         Offer incentives for industrial development projects that contribute to the
                pedestrian, bicycle and transit networks, and/or parks and public open space.
                                                                                                    37

2.7        PUBLIC & INSTITUTIONAL
Public and quasi-public facilities, such as
government            facilities,    hospitals   and
cemeteries, are important elements of
community-building. Sites needed for large
facilities are indicated on the General Plan

Element. For policies related to law enforcement and fire service standards, see the Public
Health & Safety Element.
GUIDING POLICIES
LU-G-17             Provide sufficient land for civic and institutional uses such as police and fire
                    services, water and sanitary facilities, infrastructure and other City services to
                    meet future demand.
LU-G-18             Support the expansion of Porterville’s Sierra View District Hospital and related
                    medical and dental offices in the surrounding area, subject to standards
                    ensuring that surrounding residential areas are not adversely affected.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICY
LU-I-30             Establish appropriate zoning for civic and institutional uses, including
                    development standards that address scale, operation, location, and other
                    characteristics of community facilities, including public and quasi-public
                    facilities that enhance the character and quality of neighborhoods.

2.9      DOWNTOWN PORTERVILLE
Since incorporation in 1902, Downtown
Porterville has been the “heart of the City.”
Main Street forms a spine which supports
significant cultural and governmental
buildings as well as specialty retail stores and
restaurants. Recent street improvements have
increased the pedestrian-friendly aspect of
Main Street with new paving, contrasting
crosswalks, improved lighting and additional
landscaping. Public spaces are regularly
programmed with local music and cultural
events. Plus, most of Porterville’s historic
buildings are in or near Downtown.                   Downtown retail and restaurants
Even with recent improvements, Downtown
is still underutilized. Buildings are aging and require rehabilitation. Streets adjacent to Main
Street have not been upgraded. Incompatible uses and parking deficiencies further inhibit
residents and businesses from fully taking advantage of this resource.
It is a priority for the community to revitalize Downtown. The General Plan Land Use
Diagram includes an overlay for the Downtown Planning Area, where additional planning
efforts will help define the long-term strategy. The General Plan supports creating new
housing opportunities in and near Downtown. New residents will help support local retail and
provide a greater level of around-the-clock activity. Additional street improvements will be
prioritized to expand the pedestrian-friendly areas beyond Main Street. Specific building and
design standards will be written to enhance the character of the area. Efforts will be made to
recruit a wider variety of retail stores, restaurants, and cultural facilities.
Additional policies regarding the economic development of Downtown are found in the
Economic Development Element. Historic preservation is discussed in the Open Space and
Conservation Element.
                                                                                                       39

LU-G-24             Promote public and private development within Downtown that is sensitive to
                    historic sites.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
LU-I-31             Prepare a Downtown Plan with implementing regulations to support
                    pedestrian-oriented, infill development and a mix of office, residential, retail
                    and civic uses.
LU-I-32             Include standards in the Zoning Ordinance for housing and mixed-use
                    development within the Downtown area that address:
                    •    Building setbacks and relationship to the street;
                    •    Outdoor dining areas;
                    •    Street landscaping to create an attractive and livable environment;
                    •    Adequate light, air, ventilation, and noise insulation for residential units;
                    •    Building design, including articulation and quality of materials;
                    •    Ground floor uses;
                    •    Location and quality of parking; and
                    •    Height and setback transitions to adjacent lower density residential uses.
LU-I-33             Continue to improve the appearance of Main Street and other Downtown
                    streets with traffic calming measures, tree planting, attractive landscaping,
                    street furniture, and water features, etc., that will contribute to the creation of
                    a distinctive image for Porterville’s Downtown.
LU-I-34             Utilize redevelopment, or other tools where available, to revitalize and preserve
                    historic buildings.
                    Continue to allow the adaptive reuse of historic buildings. The City could also
                    enable owners to use the State’s Historic Buildings Code as an incentive to
                    upgrade historic buildings.

              Promote a “park once” concept where motorists are able to drive downtown,
              quickly find a parking space and then walk or ride public transit to jobs, shops,
              restaurants and entertainment, without having to get back into their cars until
              they’re ready to leave.
LU-I-37       Update the Redevelopment Project Area plans to support a contemporary mix
              of retail, office and entertainment uses.
              This could include support for a greater variety of apparel stores, bookstores
              and restaurants as well as additional cultural, arts, and entertainment venues
              that offer quality arts and entertainment functions such as live music, theater,
              or comedy.
LU-I-38       Create and maintain an attractive, pedestrian-friendly circulation system to
              provide connections between the downtown pedestrian core, adjacent
              residential, the Transit Center, civic buildings, and parking areas.
LU-I-39       Identify funding mechanisms for improvements within Downtown, including
              streetscape enhancements, public space, façade renovation, parking, etc.
              Explore a wide variety of options, including: redevelopment funds,
              development fees, community facilities districts, public improvements bonds,
              and regulatory programs applicable to new development.
LU-I-40       Seek grants and other funding sources to support the façade, awning, and
              signage improvement program.
              This program could include matching funds, subsidized architecture and design
              assistance, and/or reduced permit fees.
2.10 LAKE SUCCESS RESORT RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY
The Resort Residential Community proposed
adjacent to Lake Success represents a unique
opportunity to plan a new mixed-use Resort
Residential community that is vital, livable,
and walkable while respecting wildlife habitat
and sensitive resources. This General Plan
outlines the policies and elements that will
integrate this site’s importance as an
economic, natural, and community asset.
The City recognizes that development policies
and standards for the Resort Residential
Community must provide flexibility within a
                                                   Lake Success

Porterville General Plan
general framework for land use, open space, and environmental resource management.
Therefore, the site planning policies set forth the basic parameters for more detailed master
planning and development agreements, while establishing the basic character of a Resort
Residential community.
LAND USE MIX
To ensure that the Resort Residential Community attracts high-quality Resort Residential
development, more detailed planning for the area will be required following the adoption of
the General Plan. The additional plans will ensure that desired land use intensities and overall
level of development are attained. In addition, the specific location of development, number of
housing units, variety of land uses, and requirements for community amenities will be
determined.
The proposed land use allocation and development concept (see Tables 2-4 and 2-5) for the
Resort Residential Community could accommodate up to 2,000 new housing units or more if
overall goals are met (while preserving land for open space, parks and recreation facilities,
neighborhood commercial and visitor facilities). The ultimate level of development will depend
on decisions to be made following detailed site planning, analysis of specific land use mixes
within community and neighborhoods, environmental constraints and resource assessment,
the specific character of the visitor-oriented mixed-use area, economic jobs analysis, and
determination of infrastructure costs. It also will depend on the scope of open space, parks,
and recreation facilities planned for the area.

   The maximum number of housing units and resident population may be greater, provided the land use allocations in
 Table 2-5 are not exceeded, the standards set by the City’s hillside development ordinance are met, and level of service
 standards for arterial and collector streets are maintained.
 Source: Dyett & Bhatia, 2007.
The ranges in Table 2-5 reflect the development concept and provide minimum and maximum
levels of development for each type of land use, which will allow for flexibility in master
planning in response to market conditions, infrastructure costs, and site planning policies. The
specific percentages may be adjusted based on a detailed site and market analysis conducted
after General Plan adoption to assess potential level of development.

DENSITY & INTENSITY
Neighborhoods are envisioned to be 80 to 120 acres in size, so that residents would be within
one quarter-mile of a neighborhood center or neighborhood park, thereby reducing the need
for automobile use for some local trips. Each neighborhood should have a mix of housing,
which could be based on residential density allocations or on allocation by basic building type
established in a master plan. The master plan could provide specifically for the goal of housing
mix to be met by a combination of housing types rather than a combination of different
residential densities.

LU-G-25             Create a Resort Residential community at Lake Success that is sensitive to the
                    environmental characteristics of the lakefront and surrounding hillsides.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
LU-I-41             Establish zoning and development standards for a resort residential community
                    that will allow up to 2,000 housing units and up to 100,000 square feet of
                    non-residential space for visitor accommodations, commercial recreation and
                    related supporting uses.
                    Additional density and non-residential floor area may be permitted to enable
                    new development to be self-sufficient and pay for all required infrastructure,
                    community facilities, small-scale visitor-oriented mixed-use center, and open
                    space, provided all environmental impacts are mitigated.
LU-I-42             Establish minimum requirements for specific housing types in the Resort
                    Residential area to ensure that the needs of all economic segments of the
                    community are met.
                                                                                                                     43

Porterville General Plan
                    These should include provisions for some workforce housing at appropriate
                    locations and possibly a requirement that some housing be restricted to seniors
                    to minimize impacts on the school system.
LU-I-43             Require master planning using a specific plan—as authorized by the
                    Government Code—or a similar planning program (e.g. a PD Planned
                    Development Plan).
                    Master planning will enable the City to review and approve details about the
                    location of various land uses, open spaces and linkages, and establish the
                    standards and detailed design guidelines for individual development units with
                    their community. Topics to be addressed will include, but not be limited to:
                    •    Integrating storm drainage requirements in site-specific planning;
                    •    Planning for appropriate habitat conservation to preserve and protect
                         special status species in the area;
                    •    Preparing site-specific standards and financing programs for public and
                         private improvements including new streets, parks and open space systems,
                         street landscaping, drainage, bikeways and pedestrian walkways;
                    •    Creating a streamlined development review process establishing permit
                         review thresholds with clear standards and findings requirements consistent
                         with Plan policies;
                    •    Undertaking a fiscal impact analysis and financial feasibility study,
                         including an analysis of revenues, capital and operating costs, development
                         impact fees, bonding costs, and state and federal funding sources for
                         needed improvements, and parks and recreation facilities. A long-range
                         capital improvement program (CIP) for the Resort Residential Community
                         also should be prepared; and
                    •    Establishing minimum and maximum densities and intensities and
                         allowable uses for individual neighborhoods (e.g., scale and mix within a
                         visitor-oriented, mixed-use center with potential overnight lodging),
                         consistent with the overall land use allocations and limitations based on
                         performance standards and traffic levels of service established in the
                         General Plan and the Hillside Development Ordinance.
LU-I-44             Establish minimum requirements for parks and open space. These will include:
                    •    Providing one or more community-serving recreational facilities, such as
                         tennis courts, golfing opportunities, lakeshore recreation facilities, and
                         community facilities; and
                    •    Providing a minimum 200-foot wide shoreline corridor for public access to
                         and along the lakefront.

                                              HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Providing adequate and affordable housing opportunities is an important goal for Porterville.
However, many factors can limit the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing.
These constraints include market mechanisms, government regulations, environmental
conditions, and the availability of urban infrastructure. This chapter addresses the potential
constraints affecting the development and improvement of housing in Porterville.
A. MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Market constraints significantly affect the cost of housing in Porterville, and can pose barriers to
housing production and affordability. Land and construction costs are key factors determining
housing price. The availability of financing also influences access to housing. All of these
market-related factors have the potential to act as constraints on the production of new housing.
Although such constraints are largely market-driven, jurisdictions have some ability to institute
programs and policies to address the constraints. The discussion below analyzes these market
constraints and where feasible, introduces the activities the City can undertake to mitigate their
impacts.
1. CONSTRUCTION COSTS
Construction costs are the largest component of total costs for a single-family detached unit,
accounting for 30 to 40 percent of the finished sale price. According to RS Means Residential
Square Foot Costs (2008)1, construction costs for an average two-story single-family home
(2,000 square feet of living area) built of stucco on wood frame total $92.01 per square foot in
the Porterville area. For multi-family attached units, construction costs are slightly lower as
developers can usually benefit from economies of scale with discounts for materials and
diffusion of equipment mobilization costs. Density bonuses for senior and affordable housing can
enhance this per-unit cost reduction for multi-family developments. A reduction in amenities and
quality of building materials could result in lower costs and sale prices; however, high quality
design and sufficient tenant amenities are necessary to maintain minimum health and safety
standards.
Construction costs are usually consistent throughout the region and fluctuate in response to costs
of construction materials and labor market trends. The City has little ability in influencing such
cost factors. However, to the extent feasible, the City provides gap financing for affordable

housing projects either as on-/off-site improvements, construction subsidies, or site acquisition
using local, state and federal funds.
2. LAND COSTS
Land costs vary depending on whether the site is vacant or has an existing use that must be
cleared. Land costs are also affected by the presence of site constraints like slopes, rocky soils,
and seismic/flood hazards. Easy connections to urban infrastructure, including roads and
municipal utilities, typically increase land value.
The City faces increasing development pressure with a limited supply of vacant, unconstrained
land. In December 2008, 98 undeveloped residential land parcels were listed for sale, ranging in
price from $45,000 (for ½ acre) to $4.9 million (for 93 acres).2 In recent years, a majority of the
growth and development in Porterville has occurred in the northwest portions of the City.
Porterville’s new 2030 General Plan hopes to redirect future growth into the eastern sections of
the City thereby promoting redevelopment in the downtown area.
Land costs in the City have increased in recent years, but remain relatively low compared to most
other urban areas in California. According to land appraisals conducted by Simpson Housing
Solutions in 2007, vacant parcels in the City zoned for mixed use cost an average of $12.52 per
square foot, up from $11.91 per square foot in November 2005.
The cost differences among properties with similar zonings are due primarily to two factors:
location and availability of infrastructure. Areas toward the edge of the City where infrastructure
is not yet available command lower land costs than in the central City areas, but require more
infrastructure improvements to make the land “developable”, ultimately increasing the cost of
development. Similar to construction costs, the City has little ability to influence the costs of
land. However, to the extent feasible, the City assists with site acquisition and infrastructure
improvements using local, State and federal funds.
3. AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions must disclose information on the
disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race of the applicants. This applies to
all loan applications for home purchases and improvements, whether financed at market rate or
through government-backed programs. Government-backed loans include those insured or
guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Veterans’ Administration (VA),
the Farm Service Administration (FSA), or the Rural Housing Service (RHS).
The primary concern in a review of lending activity is to determine whether home financing is
available to a City’s residents. The data presented in this section include the disposition of loan

applications submitted to financial institutions for home purchase and home improvement loans
in Porterville. Included is information on the percentage of loan applications that were approved
or denied by lenders or withdrawn by applicants.
Home Purchase Loans
In 2007, a total of 1,156 Porterville3 households applied for conventional loans to purchase
homes (Table 1). The overall loan approval rate was 59 percent and 28 percent of the
applications were denied. Typically the reasons for denial are related to credit history,
employment history, and debt-to-income ratio. Only 74 applications were submitted for the
purchase of homes in Porterville through government-backed loans (e.g. FHA, VA) in 2007. To
be eligible for such loans, residents must be lower and moderate income and purchase a home
not exceeding an established cap. Few homes available for sale in 2007 met the cap limit and
therefore government-backed financing was not widely utilized. Among applications for
government-backed home purchase loans in 2007, 54 were approved (73 percent) and eight were
denied (11 percent). Overall, mortgage financing is available to Porterville residents.

Home Improvement Loans
Homeowners typically seek home improvement loans to help them remain in their current
dwellings or to rehabilitate a recently purchased home. Loans are used for a wide range of
improvements, including major rehabilitation (roof or foundation repair), abatement of problems
(termite infestation), and additions to existing dwellings. In general, home improvement loans
are more difficult to secure than home purchase loans, often because home owners have existing
mortgages. As such, many homeowners have high debt-to-income ratios that make it difficult to
qualify for additional loans, particularly at lower income levels.
Porterville applicants were more likely to be denied for home improvement loans than for any
other type of loan. In 2007, 646 households applied for a home improvement loan. About 40
percent of applicants were denied and 44 percent were approved by lending institutions.

  HMDA data do not provide information by city. To compile applications for the City of Porterville, the census
tracts that generally comprise the City are used.

To address potential private market lending constraints and expand homeownership and home
improvement opportunities, the City of Porterville offers a First Time Low Income Home Buyers
Loan Program and a owner-occupied Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program (see Programs 9 and
2, respectively, in Section V of this document). Such programs assist lower and moderate income
residents by increasing access to favorable loan terms to purchase or improve their homes.
Refinance Loans
Relatively low interest rates and a high prevalence of interest-only, adjustable-rate, and balloon-
payment mortgages led Porterville residents to file 3,922 applications for home refinance loans in
2007. Less than one-half (42 percent) of these applications were approved, while 36 percent were
denied. With the recent credit crisis, refinancing activities are expected to fall further.
Foreclosures
With low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero down, interest only, adjustable loans), and
predatory lending practices (e.g. aggressive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization), many
households nationwide purchased homes that were beyond their financial means. Under the false
assumptions that refinancing to lower interest rates would always be an option and home prices
would continue to rise at double digit rates, many households were (and still are) unprepared for
the hikes in interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed rates, and decline in sales prices that set
off in 2006. Suddenly faced with significantly inflated mortgage payments, and mortgage loans
that are larger than the worth of the homes, foreclosure was the only option available to many
households.
In December 2008, 469 homes in Porterville were listed as foreclosures.4 These homes were
listed at various stages of foreclosure (from pre-foreclosures to auctions) and at prices up to
$2,000,000. The high prices of the homes facing foreclosure indicate that the impact of
foreclosure extends not only to lower and moderate income households, but also to households
with higher incomes. DataQuick reports that of the homeowners who default, approximately 20
percent are able to avoid foreclosure by bringing their payments current, refinancing, or selling
the home and paying off what they owe.5 The implosion of the mortgage lending market,
however, may mean that many households, even above moderate income households, will have
difficulty obtaining new mortgage loans or refinancing.

B. GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Local land use policies and regulations can exert significant influence on housing prices and
availability. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit
processing procedures, and other related factors can individually and collectively act as
constraints upon the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing. This section
analyzes Porterville’s land use policies and regulations as potential constraints.
1. LAND USE CONTROLS
Overview of General Plan Land Use Policy
In July 2005, the City of Porterville initiated a comprehensive update of its General Plan. The
Land Use Element of the General Plan (adopted in March 2008) establishes density/intensity
standards for each land use classification. To expand housing opportunities in the City, the
updated Land Use element provides the following residential land use classifications:
    •   Rural Residential – 0.2 du/acre
    •   Resort Residential – 5.0 du/acre
    •   Very Low Density Residential – 2.5 du/acre
    •   Low Density Residential – 6.0 du/acre
    •   Low-Medium Density Residential – 9.0 du/acre
    •   Medium Density Residential – 12.0 du/acre
    •   High Density Residential – 24.0 du/acre
    •   Downtown Mixed Use – 30.0 du/acre
    •   Commercial Mixed Use – 18.0 du/acre
In addition, the City’s Zoning Ordinance will be amended to include use regulations,
development standards, and minimum performance requirements for zoning districts as needed
to implement the new residential land use categories (Resort Residential, Very Low Density
Residential, Low-Medium Density Residential, Downtown Mixed Use, and Commercial Mixed
Use) established in the updated General Plan. The existing Porterville Zoning Ordinance
identifies eight zoning districts where residential development is allowed:
    •   R-A (Suburban Residential)
    •   R-E (One-Family Estate)
    •   R-1-8 (One-Family 8,000-Square-Foot)
    •   R-1 (One-Family)
    •   R-2 (Four-Family)
    •   R-3 (Multiple Family)
    •   R-4 (Multiple Family)
    •   P-O (Professional Office)
Table 2 below shows the rough correlation between the land use categories identified in the
General Plan and the City’s Zoning Ordinance.

               Commercial Mixed Use                 18.0 du/acre       To be created
Planned Development Zone
The Porterville Zoning Ordinance includes a Planned Development (PD) zone to promote
economical and efficient land use, an improved level of amenities, appropriate and harmonious
variety, creative design, and a better environment. This zone is also intended to facilitate diverse
uses and different intensities than would otherwise be permitted within a particular zoning
district. Planned Development districts can be established through an amendment to the official
zoning map. Permitted deviations in the PD zone include:
     •   Reductions or increases in the minimum areas required
     •   Reductions in setbacks
     •   Higher densities
All of these deviations are intended to lower housing costs. The Garden Court Villas is a project
approved in 2008 under the PD designation. The project was granted modifications to several
regulations in the underlying R-2 zone, including minimum yard setbacks, maximum lot
coverage, minimum lot area, and minimum lot width. Additionally, the project provides higher
density housing with several amenities such as a meditation area, pool, and recreation area. Each
of the 49 units include a two car garage with indoor laundry facilities. The shared amenities
allow young families and individuals the opportunity to purchase a new home with great
amenities at market rates.
Urban Development Boundary
Clearly defined urban edges reflect a commitment to focus future growth within the City in order
to prevent urban sprawl and protect environmentally sensitive areas. The Urban Development
Boundary (UDB) is one of the best strategies to achieve this within Porterville. The UDB
protects the health, safety, welfare, and quality of life for residents by concentrating future
residential, commercial, and industrial growth in areas already served by urban services or areas
where such services are to be provided consistent with the General Plan. Since the early 1970s,
all incorporated cities in Tulare County have enacted urban development boundaries, beyond
which urban services and development should not occur. While such boundaries can have
beneficial land use impacts by focusing development within or adjacent to already urbanized

areas, they can also act as a housing constraint, particularly in areas with scarce land resources.
The City’s UDB was most recently amended in 2006. It currently encompasses 12,757 acres,
including 1,580 acres of vacant land. Tulare County Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) allows the UDB to be reviewed and amended every five years to ensure an adequate
land supply is provided to accommodate 10 years of residential land demand and 20 years of
non-residential land demand. With the adoption of the Porterville 2030 General Plan, the City
will begin reviewing and updating the UDB.
Infill Development
The UDB complements the City’s policy of emphasizing infill development. There are more than
700 acres of underutilized land with redevelopment potential in the 2006 UDB boundary.
Although infill development is encouraged throughout the City, the Economic Development and
Land Use Elements of the General Plan provide strategies for fostering a strong Downtown that
is the center of the community and a source of positive identity for the City of Porterville. These
strategies include:
     •   The addition of the Downtown Mixed-Use and Downtown Retail land use categories
     •   The creation of the Downtown Planning Area overlay
     •   The development of a Downtown Plan
2. RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
through the Zoning Ordinance. Development standards specific to each zone district are
designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as
implement the policies of the General Plan. These standards also serve to preserve the character
and integrity of existing neighborhoods. Generally, development standards can limit the number
of units that may be constructed on a particular piece of property. These include density,
minimum lot and unit sizes, height, and open space requirements. By limiting the number of
units that could be constructed, the per-unit land costs would be higher and result in higher
development costs that could impact housing affordability. Specific residential development
standards are summarized in Table 3.
The Porterville 2030 General Plan created several land use designations: Resort Residential,
Very Low Density Residential, Low-Medium Density Residential, Downtown Mixed Use, and
Commercial Mixed Use. The Zoning Ordinance will be updated to establish appropriate
development standards to implement these new land use designations. The City will ensure that
such standards serve to facilitate and encourage the development of housing types, densities, and
characters envisioned in these areas.

Single-Family Residential Development Standards
The R-1 district is the largest in the City and contains by far the greatest number of single-family
residential units of all the districts. Single-family residences can go up to a height of 35 feet,
which can accommodate two stories.
Minimum lot sizes in these four districts range from 6,000 to 20,000 square feet, with most lots
in the City between 6,000 and 8,000 square feet. Smaller lot sizes (as small as 3,200 square feet)
have been allowed within Planned Development zones and overlay areas. City staff has observed
that Porterville’s housing market tends to favor the 6,000- to 8,000-square-foot lot sizes.
Allowable lot coverage is 40 percent in the R-1-8 district and 45 percent in the R-1 district. This
limit, however, may vary within a Planned Development.
As a means of maintaining compatible development and design through adaptive zoning, the City
allows reduced front yards in certain neighborhoods where a clear majority of existing lots in the
vicinity have smaller than required front yards.

Multi-Family Residential Development Standards
Multi-family dwellings can be constructed in the R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones. Multi-family
development is also permitted in the Professional-Office Zone (P-O), with a conditional use
permit, under the same intensities and regulations as in the R-4 zone. Multi-family housing
development is required to have a minimum lot area of 6,000 square feet, with a minimum lot
area per family unit of 3,000 square feet in the R-2 zone, 1,500 square feet in the R-3 zone, and
1,000 square feet in the R-4 zone. In some cases, a conditional use permit may allow the number
of proposed units to exceed the permitted thresholds.
Parking Standards
Porterville’s residential parking requirements are relatively simple and similar to parking
regulations in other Central Valley jurisdictions. These requirements are summarized in Table 4.
All single-family dwellings, mobile homes, and condominiums must have two covered parking
spaces. Garages are preferred, but open carports are allowed. Porterville’s relatively large lot
size accommodates such parking requirements without constraining housing development.
Multiple-family developments must provide one covered space (garage or carport) and one-half
open space per unit, regardless of number of bedrooms. This is a relatively low requirement, as
many jurisdictions typically require two or more spaces per unit with three or more bedrooms.
This requirement is lower than the parking standards established in the State density bonus law.
              Table 4: Parking Requirements
              Type of Residential Development                      Required Spaces

              Condominiums                            2 covered spaces per unit

                                                      1 covered space plus 0.5 open spaces per unit
              Apartments
              Source: Porterville Zoning Ordinance, 2008.
Overall, the parking requirements in Porterville are lenient. Allowing the construction of
carports in lieu of garages can further reduce overall housing cost, as open carport construction is
usually much less expensive than enclosed garage construction.
Zoning Overlays
In addition to the development standards established for the residential and mixed use zone
districts, overlay districts of the Zoning Ordinance provide additional regulations for residential
development. The following zoning overlays apply to residential development in portions of the
City:
Hillside Development Zone - All development within the Hillside Development Zone is subject
to hillside development and design standards. Review criteria and limitations on maximum
density are based on slope.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                                   3-9                       2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

Downtown Planning Area - This overlay is intended to emphasize the Downtown area where
the City wants to promote mixed-use development. Pedestrian-oriented design standards will
apply.
Transition Landscape Buffers - This designation is intended to provide a variable-width
landscaped buffer between industrial and industrial park uses, or heavily traveled highways and
residential land uses. The recommended buffer widths are between 150 to 200 feet. Frontage
roads, orchards, and recreational uses are allowed in these areas.
Density Bonus
Density bonuses and financial incentives or regulatory concessions are granted when a developer
proposes to construct affordable housing. Under the City’s current Zoning Ordinance, developers
of affordable and senior housing can apply for a density bonus from the project review
committee. The amount of density bonus that can be granted is not specified in the Zoning
Ordinance.
Current state law requires jurisdictions to provide density bonuses and development incentives
on a sliding scale, where the amount of density bonus and number of incentives vary according to
the amount of affordable housing units provided. The City’s Zoning Ordinance allows for this
and meets this requirement. In accordance with California Government Code Section 65915, and
shall require a conditional use permit in accordance with Article 21.
3. PROVISIONS FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING TYPES
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development
of a variety of types of housing for all income levels, including multi-family rental housing,
factory-built housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive
housing, and farmworker housing. Table 5 summarizes the City’s zoning provisions for various
types of housing.
Besides single-family homes, the City provides for various other housing types to meet the
special needs of the community, including persons earning lower income, seniors, persons with
disabilities, the homeless, and agricultural workers, among others.
Additionally, the City will rezone land when necessary to meet housing needs per the Regional
Housing Needs Assessement (RHNA). Chapter 4 will further discuss the “Focused Rezone
Progam” and implementation plan.

The Zoning Ordinance allows for "transitional residential uses" where a lower density zone abuts a
higher density zone
Single-Family Dwellings
A “single-family dwelling” is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as “any detached building used
exclusively for occupancy by one family.” This definition does not include bungalows in a
bungalow court, residential condominium units, and mobile homes. Single-family uses are
permitted in all districts, but new single-family units are primarily concentrated in the R-A, R-E,
R-1-8, and R-1 districts, with additional single-family uses in the R-2 district.
Multiple-Family Units
Twenty percent of Porterville’s housing stock in 2008 consisted of multiple-family units.
Multiple-family units are permitted in the R-2, R-3, R-4, and P-O districts. The Porterville
Zoning Ordinance requires conditional use permit for condominium developments in any
residential zone. The CUP process is concurrent with the subdivision map process required for
condominium developments and therefore does not result in delays.
Second Units
A “second unit” is defined as a second permanent dwelling that is accessory to a primary
dwelling on the same site. A second unit or carriage house provides complete, independent living
facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating,
cooking, sanitation, and parking, and if attached to the primary dwelling, is provided exterior
access separate from the primary dwelling. Second units may be an alternative source of
affordable housing to lower income households and seniors.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                                      3-11                        2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

Second units can be constructed with a ministerial permit within the R-A, R-E, R-1-8, and R-1
zones, subject to the following standards:
    •   The total area of floor space of a detached second unit shall not exceed 1,200 square feet
    •   If an increase in FAR is involved, said increase shall not exceed 30 percent of the
        existing living area or the minimum area of an efficiency unit
    •   Second units shall conform to the height, setbacks, lot coverage and other zoning
        requirements of the zoning district in which the site is located
    •   In addition to parking required for the existing residence, an additional one covered space
        for efficiency units and one bedroom units, two covered parking spaces for two, three,
        and four bedroom units, and one parking space per bedroom thereafter
    •   Owner must occupy either primary or second unit
Since 2007, the City has issued building permits for 3 second dwelling units.
Mobile/Manufactured Homes
According to the California Department of Finance, four percent of Porterville’s housing stock in
2008 was comprised of mobile homes, including trailer-style homes and manufactured homes set
on foundations. Manufactured housing and mobile homes can be an affordable housing option
for low and moderate income households.
A mobile home built after June 15, 1976, certified under the National Manufactured Home
Construction and Safety Act of 1974, and built on a permanent foundation may be located in any
residential zone where a conventional single-family detached dwelling is permitted subject to the
same restrictions on density and to the same property development regulations, provided that the
mobile home has received approval of all necessary plan check, site inspections, and receives a
Certificate of Compatibility. Criteria for issuing a Certificate of Compatibility are established in
the Zoning Ordinance to protect neighborhood integrity, provide for harmonious relationship
between mobile homes and surrounding uses, and minimize problems that could occur as a result
of locating mobile homes on residential lots.
Mobile and manufactured homes are permitted in all of the City’s residential zoning districts,
except the P-O zone. Mobile home parks are permitted in the R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 Zones, with
a conditional use permit, on a minimum lot size of 10 acres. Currently, ten mobile home parks
are located in Porterville.
Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities licensed or supervised by a Federal, State, or local health/welfare
agency provide 24-hour non-medical care of unrelated persons who are handicapped and in need
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                           3-12                    2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily
living or for the protection of the individual in a family-like environment. Pursuant to State law,
licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are considered a regular residential
use.
According to the State Department of Social Services, Community Care Licensing Division,
three licensed group homes and 45 licensed adult residential facilities are located in Porterville.
The Porterville Zoning Ordinance permits residential care facilities in the R-3, R-4, and P-O
zoning districts. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to expressly permit residential care
facilities serving six or fewer persons in all residential zones.
Emergency Shelters
Section 50801(e) of the California Health and Safety Code defines emergency shelters as housing
with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months
or fewer by a homeless person. The Porterville Zoning Ordinance does not address the provision
of emergency shelters. Senate Bill 2, enacted in October 2007, requires local governments to
identify one or more zoning categories that allow emergency shelters without discretionary
review. The statute permits the City to apply limited conditions to the approval of ministerial
permits for emergency shelters. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to
accommodate at least one year-round shelter and accommodate the City’s share of the regional
unsheltered homeless population. According to a 2008 study conducted by Kings United Way,
Porterville has an estimated homeless population of 256 individuals.
There is currently one emergency shelter, with thirty-six beds available for the homeless, in the
City of Porterville. The shelter is operated by the CCFCC. The City is in the process of a
comprehensive Zoning Ordinance update which will include and permit by right the development
of homeless shelters within the C-2 and C-3 Zones, consistent with State law. Properties in these
zones are located along public transportation routes and therefore have access to services located
in Porterville and in surrounding communities (such as Visalia). Additionally, these zones
contain properties that are developed with existing low-scale commercial/industrial development
that can be redeveloped or retrofitted for emergency shelter use. A total of 18 parcels (47.39
acres) are zoned Downtown Mixed Use and Commercial Mixed Use and therefore may provide
adequate capacity exists to accommodate the City’s unsheltered homeless.
In updating the Zoning Ordinance, the City will establish objective performance standards in the
following areas to regulate emergency shelters:
    •    The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be served nightly;
    •    Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to exceed parking requirements
         for other residential or commercial uses in the same zone;
    •    The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and client intake areas;
    •    The provision of onsite management;
    •    The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that emergency shelters are not
         required to be more than 300 feet apart;
    •    The length of stay;
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                             3-13                    2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

    •   Lighting; and
    •   Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
Supportive/Transitional Housing Zoning
The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to permit transitional and supportive housing facilities
serving six or fewer clients by right in all residential zones. The City will also amend the Zoning
Ordinance to differentiate transitional/supportive housing in the form of group quarters versus as
regular housing developments. For transitional/supportive housing facilities that operate as
regular housing developments, such uses will be permitted by right where housing is permitted.
For transitional/supportive housing facilities that operate as group quarters, such facilities will be
permitted as community care residential facilities.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct
from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen
and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many SROs
have one or the other. The Porterville Zoning Ordinance does not contain specific provisions for
SRO units. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to specifically address the provision of SRO
units in the Downtown General Mixed Use zone(s) via a Conditional Use Permit. The City will
also establish objective and appropriate development standards in the Zoning Ordinance for SRO
units.
Farmworker Housing
In 2005, 1,184 Porterville residents were employed in the agriculture sector, constituting six
percent of all jobs in the City. Little land within the City limits is designated for agricultural
uses, but the areas surrounding Porterville are some of the most productive agricultural land in
the country.
The new Porterville General Plan includes an Agriculture/Rural/Conservation land use
designation that preserves agricultural and resource conservation areas. Incidental residential
uses are allowed in these areas. Clustered housing, in particular, is strongly encouraged because
it makes the provision of other infrastructure, such as roads and electricity, more cost-effective
and limits the impact on natural resources.
No zoning district is established in the Zoning Ordinance to implement large-scale commercial
agricultural uses. The R-A (Suburban Residential) zoning district allows small scale agricultural
pursuits and includes some properties with “hobby farms,” mostly on five- to ten-acre parcels. A
few larger parcels (ranging from 10 to 33 acres in size) are also zoned R-A. Two of the larger
agricultural operations within the City limits, a sheep ranch and a citrus orchard, which are
relatively small compared to agricultural operations elsewhere in Tulare County, were annexed to
the City under R-1 zoning. These uses have been “grandfathered” as non-conforming uses and
are thus unlikely to expand.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                             3-14                   2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

California law requires that farmworker housing for 12 units or 36 beds be considered equivalent
to an agricultural use or, in other words, permitted by right in agricultural zones.6 As the City
has created a new Agricultural/Rural/Conservation land use, the Zoning Ordinance will be
amended to permit farmworker housing in the implementing zoning district(s).
Furthermore, the Zoning Ordinance allows for a single-family unit in the R-A district for
agricultural employees as an additional use on an otherwise occupied site of at least 10 acres in
area, provided that the unit is located on a minimum 6,000-square-foot site area. This provision
of the code presents confusion with regard to the intent of the district as a suburban residential
district.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The City conducted an analysis of the zoning ordinance, permitting procedures, development
standards, and building codes to identify potential constraints for housing for persons with
disabilities. The City’s policies and regulations regarding housing for persons with disabilities
are described below.
Zoning and Land Use: Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (aka
Lanterman Act), small licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons must be treated
as regular residential uses and permitted by right in all residential districts. The City of
Porterville will need to amend its Zoning Ordinance to be in compliance with the Lanterman Act.
Currently, state licensed residential care facilities are only permitted in the R-3, R-4, and P-O
residential zones. The City has not adopted a spacing requirement for residential care facilities.
Definition of Family: Local governments may restrict access to housing for households failing
to qualify as a “family” by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, a
restrictive definition of “family” that limits the number of and differentiates between related and
unrelated individuals living together may illegally limit the development and siting of group
homes for persons with disabilities, but not for housing families that are similarly sized or
situated.7 The Porterville Zoning Ordinance does not include a definition of family.
Building Codes: The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that regulates
the access and adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. Furthermore,
Government Code Section 12955.1 requires that 10 percent of the total dwelling units in multi-

7 California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.) have ruled an
ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption;
or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of unrelated persons as a single housekeeping unit. These cases have explained
that defining a family in a manner that distinguishes between blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any
legitimate or useful objective or purpose recognized under the zoning and land use planning powers of a municipality, and
therefore violates rights of privacy under the California Constitution.

family buildings without elevators consisting of three or more rental units or four or more
condominium units are subject to the following building standards for persons with disabilities:
     •   The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless exempted by
         site impracticality test.
     •   At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level served
         by an accessible route.
     •   All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an accessible
         route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to this chapter
         may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms, living rooms,
         bedrooms, or hallways.
     •   Common use areas shall be accessible.
     •   If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking is required.
The City has not adopted unique restrictions that would constrain the development of housing for
persons with disabilities. Compliance with provisions of the Code of Regulations, California
Building Standards Code, and federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is assessed and
enforced by the Building Division of the Community Development Department as a part of the
building permit submittal.
Reasonable Accommodation: Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations
(i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be reasonable to accommodate requests from persons with
disabilities to waive a setback or lot coverage requirement to allow for accessibility
improvements for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular modification is reasonable
depends on the circumstances.
There is currently no established process in place and reasonable accommodations are granted on
a case-by-case basis. Requests for reasonable accommodations to address the special needs of
persons with disabilities (such as setbacks and parking requirements) are reviewed and processed
at the staff level. No public hearing is required.
The planning staff and building official assist in making determinations regarding reasonable
accommodations for accessibility requirements. Depending on the types of requests, the
applicant may need to file a request with either the Planning or Building Division. Requests for
relaxed building code standards, as long as such flexibility would not jeopardize health and
safety standards, are granted by the Building Division staff over the counter. Requests for
relaxed zoning code standards are granted by the Planning Division staff over the counter. The
most typical requests in Porterville relate to ramps that extend into the setback areas. As long as
the ramps are uncovered, such requests are usually allowed.
As there is no established procedure in place, no specific fees are required for reasonable
accommodation requests. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to implement a reasonable
accommodation procedure to address reasonable accommodation requests.

4. DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING FEES
Residential developers are subject to a variety of fees and exactions to process permits and
provide necessary services and facilities as allowed by State law. In general, these development
fees can be a constraint to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing because
the additional cost borne by developers contributes to overall increased housing unit cost.
However, the fees are necessary to maintain adequate planning services and other public services
and facilities in the City. The City’s permit processing fee schedule for residential development
is displayed in Table 6. The City updates its planning fees periodically and surveys surrounding
communities to ensure that the City’s fees are reasonable.
Development impact fees are also levied to offset fiscal impacts of new developments.
Development in the City is typically required to pay a range of development fees, including,
water service fee, transportation impact, and storm drainage fee. In Porterville, development
impact fees average about $13,533 for a single-family home and $38,829 per structure for a
multiple-family project. The costs of service and infrastructure are nearly three times as much
for multiple-family projects because in most cases they require larger/increased capacity that
involves higher costs associated with the project. The City does not usually waive fees for the
development of affordable housing. However, redevelopment, HOME, and other funds may be
used to help bridge the financial gap for affordable housing.
As stated, the City Council authorized Staff to proceed with the preparation of an Interim
Urgency Ordinance, and subsequently a permanent ordinance to defer the collection of certain
impact fees to the occupancy of the development. This provision is intended to apply to all types
of development whether it is residential or non-residential. Local developers and consultants
provided feedback on this is prior constraint that has been lifted to allow developers the
opportunity to pay development fees upon occupancy rather than at the time the permits are
issued or at the time plans are submitted for review (does not include "school fees” which the
City does not have control over). The deferral of fees until occupancy will allow the developer
to install infrastructure in suburban/rural areas that would otherwise be a large initial upfront
cost, therefore reducing development of potential affordable housing.
The City conducted a survey of six City’s (Including: Visalia, Hanford, Selma, Tulare and
Lemoore) in the area estimating impact fees for both commercial and residential development
based on simulated projects. The results of the survey have been included as Appendix D. The
City of Porterville ranked fourth lowest in commercial development fees, with estimated at less
than the average for all the cities included in the survey. The City of Porterville ranked second
lowest in Residential Development fees, again averaging less than the median including school
fees.

5. ON- AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
Site improvements such as water, sewer, storm drains, and other infrastructure are important
components that serve new development. Requiring developers to construct site improvements
and/or pay pro-rata shares toward the provision of infrastructure, public services, and processing
will increase the costs of developing homes and the final sales price or rent of housing.
However, payment of fees is necessary to maintain an adequate level of services and facilities,
and more generally, to protect public health, safety, and welfare.
In general, the City requires improvements to all streets, highways, or ways in or adjacent to a
subdivision. Other improvements include:
    •    Undergrounding of Utilities
    •    Grading and improvement of all streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and driveways
    •    Construction of sanitary sewer facilities connecting with the existing city sewer system
    •    Installation of storm water and sewers
    •    Provision of approved water supply capable of supplying required fire flow for fire
         protection
    •    Planting of street trees (Five gallon trees for all lots abutting interior, local and collector
         streets, and 15 gallon trees for parcels having frontage on arterial thoroughfares)
    •    Provision of street signs and ornamental street lighting
Overall, off-site improvements required by the City are similar to those required by other
jurisdictions in the County and are not considered a constraint.
6. BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
The City has adopted the 2007 California Building Codes (which has been in full force and effect
since January 1, 2008). The California Building Codes establish standards and requires
inspections at various stages of construction to ensure code compliance and minimum health and
safety standards. Although these standards may increase housing production costs, these
standards are mandated by the State of California and are intended to provide structurally sound,
safe, and energy-efficient housing.
7. DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is commonly
cited by the development community as a prime contributor to the high cost of housing.
Depending on the magnitude and complexity of the development proposal, the time which
elapses from application submittal to project approval may vary considerably. Factors that can
affect the length of development review on a proposed project include: rezoning or general plan
amendment requirements, public hearing required for Commission/Council review, or a required
Negative Declaration or Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
When residential projects are initiated in the City, specific approvals are required that involve
permits and inspections. The most common housing applications and permit processing times are
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                             3-19                     2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

indicated in Table 7. Also, depending on the level of environmental review required, the
processing time for a project may be lengthened.

                      Source: City of Porterville, (2008).
The City continues to improve its “Plan Check” permit procedure. The entire process now has a
two-week turnaround to developers, in most cases, from the date of submittal. A flowchart
detailing this expedited process can be found in the Appendix. When projects are submitted,to
the City, staff reviews each project for verification of compliance with all applicable state and
local codes. Other projects require additional review by the Project Review Committee (PRC).
The PRC is made up of representatives from each department including Police, Fire, Building,
Planning and Engineering. PRC reviews proposed projects that require additional review, input
and some cases ministerial approval from the City Council. Once a project has received all
necessary approvals the two week “Plan Check” process may begin.
The City Council serves as the Planning Commission and therefore, projects requiring a public
hearing process only need to go before one governing body. Construction of individual single-
family homes requires building permits only and takes between two and four weeks. Multiple-
family apartments require only staff-level reviews (when constructed in zones where they are
permitted by right), with total processing time averaging between four and six months. The City
does not have a design review procedure that may involve multiple rounds of revisions.
C. ENVIRONMENTAL/INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
A community’s environmental setting affects the feasibility and cost of developing housing.
Environmental issues range from the availability of water to the suitability of land for
development due to potential exposure to seismic, flooding, wildfire and other hazards. If not
properly recognized and accommodated in residential design, these environmental features could
potentially endanger lives and property. This section summarizes and analyzes the most pertinent
environmental and infrastructure constraints to housing in Porterville.
1. SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
The City of Porterville contains a wide variety of soil types which have a significant bearing on
land planning and development. Porterville Clay is the most prominent soil type located within
the City, comprising approximately 18 percent of the total area. City Building Code Regulations
require a preliminary soil report for every new subdivision.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                                  3-20           2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

The majority of the City is at elevations between 400 and 800 feet. However, the eastern portion
of Porterville is in the Sierra Nevada foothills where elevations reach almost 1,800 feet above sea
level. Slopes can be greater than 30 percent grade. Development which occurs on slopes greater
than 25 percent exacerbates soil erosion, increases the risk of landslides and wildland fires, and
harms the visual aesthetics of the area. On October 7, 2008 the City Council adopted Ordinance
1747, a Hillside Development Ordinance which includes development, design and landscape
standards for the Hillside Development Zone. The Ordinance will limit the number of housing
units allowed per acre in sloped areas in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare;
protect and preserve natural and biological resources for the long-term benefit of Porterville and
the broader community.
There are no known active earthquake faults in the City. The closest active faults are Owens
Valley fault group and Sierra Nevada Fault Zone (50 miles to the east of the City), the San
Andreas Fault Zone (70 miles to the west), and an unnamed fault group north of Bakersfield (40
miles to the south). Other potentially active faults exist near Tulare Buttes, about 30 miles north
of Porterville. These faults are small and have not exhibited any activity in the last 200 years. It is
possible, but unlikely, that previously unknown faults could become active in the area.
2. FLOODING HAZARDS
Porterville is in the Tulare County Flood Control District. The climate is relatively arid; however,
development continues to increase the amount of impervious surfaces, surface run-off and
therefore storm drainage must be managed. The average annual precipitation in the Porterville
area is approximately 10 inches. However, portions of the Tule River watershed which contribute
to flooding in Porterville have a mean annual precipitation of 40 inches. Eighty–five percent of
the annual precipitation occurs between November and April.
There are two natural channels for storm water discharge in the City, the Tule River and Porter
Slough. Flows in the natural waterways are largely controlled by the Success Dam, but still pose
some flooding hazards, particularly in the lower-lying western portions of the City. Flash
flooding has occurred in low-lying drainage areas at the base of the foothills. The main channel
of the Tule River can pass flows of about 10,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) before extensive
damage occurs. Damage to urban property would occur at flows of approximately 16,000 cfs.
Porter Slough has a designated capacity of 450 cfs and is an officially designated floodway of
Tule River.
There are also seven irrigation ditch companies and storage reservoirs which divert and manage
surface water within the Planning Area. In addition to delivering water for irrigation, the ditches
provide extra capacity to carry peak flood flows and urban storm water runoff. Minor flooding or
ponding may occur on the valley floor if irrigation canals or reservoirs overflow.
In Porterville, the storm flood hazard is considered to be low because the City does not permit
development in the flood plain without adequate mitigation measures. Flood zone mapping by
the Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA) indicates that approximately six percent
of the City is located within the 100-year floodplain and another five percent is located within the
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                           3-21                    2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

500-year floodplain. These two floodplains closely correspond to the watercourses that flow
through the city.
Although subsequent infrastructure and drainage improvements have reduced the threat of
flooding in many areas prone to inundation, the City requires a flood certificate and appropriately
raised floor plates for any development proposed in an identified hazardous flood zone.
3. WILDLAND/URBAN FIRE HAZARDS
Fire hazard potential is largely dependent on the extent and type of vegetation, known as surface
fuels, that exists within a region. Fire hazards are typically highest in heavily wooded,
undeveloped areas as trees are a greater source of fuel than low-lying brush or grassland.
Suburban, urban areas, or rocky barren areas have minimal surface fuels and therefore typically
have the lowest fire hazard.
Due to the wooded nature of the Sierra Nevada foothills and hot summers, land located in the
northeast portion of the City near Lake Success is considered to have a high to very high risk of
fire. The fire season has over 100 days of temperatures in excess of 90 degrees Fahrenheit,
usually between May and October. Forty-three percent of the City is considered to have a
moderate fire hazard.
Even though Porterville is not considered to be a fire-prone city, structural fires pose a greater
risk to life and property than wildland fires. The City of Porterville requires all new development
and subdivisions to meet or exceed the Uniform Fire Code provisions, which address
topography, geology, climate, and development conditions. The Public Works Department and
Fire Department review all development applications during the review process.
Additionally, the City of Porterville met with LAFCO representatives to discuss proposing an
expansion of the City’s Urban Area Boundary and Urban Planning Area past the foothills to the
east of Porterville to Success Lake.
4. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HAZARDS
The California Code of Regulations defines a hazardous material as “a substance that, because of
physical or chemical properties, quantity, concentration, or other characteristics, may either (1)
cause an increase in mortality or an increase in serious, irreversible, or incapacitating, illness or
(2) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or environment when
improperly treated, stored, transported or disposed of, or otherwise managed.” Hazardous wastes
are hazardous materials that no longer have practical use, such as substances that have been
discarded, discharged, spilled, contaminated, or are being stored prior to proper disposal. A
hazardous materials incident involves the uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance during
storage, use, or transport.
Areas where historic or on-going activities have resulted in the known or suspected release of
hazardous materials into the soil and groundwater are identified by Environmental Data
Resources, Inc. In Porterville, contaminated sites are largely associated with leaking underground

storage tanks and are predominately clustered around primary transportation corridors including
State Route 65 (SR 65), Main Street, Henderson Avenue, and Olive Avenue. Most sites are
associated with retail and commercial uses (e.g., gas stations, convenience stores, car washes,
etc.), but a few are associated with local industrial and agricultural uses.
The City’s Emergency Operations Plan also mentions the possibility of illegal drug
manufacturing sites as sources of hazardous materials and incidents. Residue and hazardous
waste are often dumped illegally and pose a threat to public health.
5. INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
Residential development can also be constrained by a limited availability of infrastructure,
including roads, water and sewer lines, and other related facilities. The City has adopted master
plans for its water and sewer systems. These plans reflect anticipated population growth within
the plan period as well as relevant general plan policies (such as the Eastside/Hillside
Development Initiatives). The plans direct infrastructure expansion towards desired areas. All
the sites identified for future residential development in Chapter 4, Housing Resources, are
located within the water and sewer master plan areas. The master plans include technical
strategies and financial mechanisms to bring infrastructure to the growth areas. Specifically, the
City helped fund the extension of infrastructure to the Eastside/Hillside area well in advance of
anticipated development so as to encourage growth in this area rather than in agricultural
flatlands at or beyond the City’s western boundary. The City also adopted reduced water and
sewer truck fees in the Eastside/Hillside areas where the hillside slope is seven percent or greater
and where the development density does not exceed one unit per acre.
Other types of urban infrastructure, such as highways, rail lines, canals, and airports, however,
pose potential constraints upon housing, in that housing near these and other similar facilities is
usually undesirable due to ambient noise, pollution, safety/hazards, or related factors. Many
noise impacts from such facilities can be mitigated on-site with soundwalls, insulated windows,
and other noise-attenuating features. Requirements for such features pose a minor housing
constraint based on costs. However, the proximity to such noise sources is typically reflected in
lower land costs.

                                                        HOUSING RESOURCES
This section analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of
housing in Porterville. This analysis includes an evaluation of the availability of land resources for
future housing development, the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing needs,
the financial resources available to support housing activities, and the administrative resources available
to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs and policies. Additionally, this section presents
opportunities for energy conservation.
A. REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
1. PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodate a share of the region’s
projected housing needs for the planning period. This share, called the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA), is important because State law mandates that jurisdictions provide sufficient land to
accommodate a variety of housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community.
Compliance with this requirement is measured by the jurisdiction’s ability in providing adequate land to
accommodate the RHNA. The Tulare County Association of Government (TCAG), as the regional
planning agency, is responsible for allocating the RHNA to individual jurisdictions within the region.
The RHNA is distributed by income category. For the 2009-2014 Housing Element update, the City of
Porterville is allocated a RHNA of 5,473 units as follows:
     •    Extremely Low/Very Low Income (up to 50 percent of AMI): 1,224 units (22.3 percent)1
     •    Low Income (51 to 80 percent of AMI): 862 units (15.7 percent)
     •    Moderate Income (81 to 120 percent of AMI): 979 units (17.9 percent)
     •    Above Moderate Income (more than 120 percent of AMI): 2,409 units (44.1 percent)
1 The City has a RHNA allocation of 1,224 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units). Pursuant to new
State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing needs based on Census income
distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely low. Extremely low income households
constitute 50.1 percent of the very low income group. Therefore, the City’s RHNA of 1,224 very low income units can be
split between 612 extremely low and 612 very low income units. However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the
RHNA, State law does not mandate the separate accounting for the extremely low income category.

PROGRESS TOWARDS RHNA
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2007 as the baseline for growth projections for the Housing Element
planning period of 2009-2014, jurisdictions may count toward the RHNA any new units built or issued
certificates of occupancy since January 1, 2007. Since January 2007, 3,288 housing units have been
developed, approved, or are under construction in Porterville. These units had the following income
distribution: 51 very low-income units, 162 low-income units, 129 moderate-income unit, and 2,946
above moderate-income units (Table 1).

Units Constructed: According to City records, 359 units have been constructed since January 1, 2007,
64 of which are affordable to lower-income households. The affordable units are part of the Sequoia
Village at River’s Edge development, a multiple-family community consisting of two-, three-, and four-
bedroom apartments. These 64 affordable units are under 55-year restricted covenants, pursuant to the
funding sources used to finance the development of this project.
Units in Development or Under Construction: According to City records, 143 residential units are
under construction in Porterville, none of which are affordable.
Units Approved: In addition, the City approved the development of another 2,786 housing units.
Among the approved projects is the Villa Sienna Apartments, a 70-unit multi-family/professional office
development with all the units deed-restricted as affordable for low income households. Villa Sienna
has received a conditional reservation of $1.2 million in redevelopment housing set-aside funds in
exchange for the deed restriction.
Several apartment developments have also been approved by the City. City staff contacted developers of
three of these apartment developments for projected rents for these units:
    •    Pearson and E Street (Garden Apartments) – Projected rents for the units are $580 for the one-
         bedroom units and $750 for the two-bedroom units.
    •    Grand Villas – Projected rents are $850 for the two-bedroom units
    •    Indiana Street (eight-plex apartments) – Projected rents for the 80 three-bedroom units are
         between $750 and $800.
Based on these rents, the Indiana Street apartments qualify for low income housing at market rents. The
other apartment developments can qualify for moderate income housing at market rents.
Remaining RHNA: The City has already achieved a portion of its RHNA with housing units
constructed, under construction, and approved. Specifically, 3,288 units have been constructed or
approved since January 1, 2007, including 342 units affordable to lower and moderate income

2. RESIDENTIAL SITES INVENTORY
The City of Porterville adopted its new General Plan in 2008. As part of this update, the City provided
additional opportunities for residential development by creating two mixed use designations –
Downtown Mixed Use and Commercial Mixed Use.
A majority of the available sites found in the areas designated “underutilized” are located in medium and
high density residential zones (see appendix). These areas are primarily single level older structures
within the core and some downtown areas of the City. Because most of these underutilized sites are
located within urban and developed areas, most would be eligible for Infill Incentive Grant Program -
Proposition 1C Funds to assist with financing infrastructure improvements necessary to facilitate new
infill housing or mixed-use infill development projects. The Villa Sienna Project is an example of an
approved project in the downtown area that has been awarded over $2.3 million in Proposition 1C
Funding. The project was also awarded USDA funding, Joe Serna Farmworker Grant funding, Low
Income Tax Credits and Porterville Redevelopment Agency funding. The Villa Sienna mixed-use office
and 70-unit apartment project, was proposed on the 2.3 acre former Copeland Lumber Yard that had
been out of business for several years.
Several large underutilized parcels are located around the City, not necessarily in the core or downtown.
These parcels may also qualify for Proposition 1C Funding. These Parcels primarily include medium
and low density residential previously used but currently vacant or abandoned with limited structures.
GIS and field surveys were used to help identify vacant and underutilized properties that can
accommodate residential development. For purposes of this analysis, the following criteria are used:
    •    Parcels designated for Low-Medium Density Residential, Medium Density Residential, High
         Density Residential, Commercial Mixed Use, and Downtown Mixed Use;
    •    For High Density Residential, Commercial Mixed Use, and Downtown Mixed Use, parcel size
         larger than 0.5 acre, or parcel size less than 0.5 acres but still capable of producing 10 or more
         units (the size of a small apartment building);
    •    For Medium Density Residential, which is used to fulfill the City’s moderate income RHNA in
         this analysis, parcels that can accommodate at least five units unless potential exists for lot
         consolidation with adjoining parcels;
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                             4-4                    2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

    •    For Low-Medium Density Residential, which is used to fulfill the City’s moderate and above
         moderate income RHNA, parcels that can accommodate at least five units; and
    •    Land to-improvement value ratio of greater than 1.0 (i.e. the land is worth more than the
         improvements on site).
Residentially designated land, as well as mixed use and commercial properties that allow for residential
development were included in this analysis. In estimating realistic capacity, a density factor at 80 percent
of the maximum permitted densities was used. This 80-percent factor is typical of most suburban
development. As this residential sites inventory focuses primarily on higher density residential uses, this
density factor is reasonable. A detailed vacant and underutilized sites inventory is presented in the
Appendix.
Density and Affordability
Pursuant to AB 2348, the State has established a default density of 20 units per acre as adequate to
facilitate the development of lower (very low and low) housing for jurisdictions in Tulare County.
Under AB 2348, density is equated to feasibility for affordable housing.
In the Central Valley area, particularly small communities such as Porterville, low income housing can
be achieved at much lower densities in the form of single-family homes. Specifically in Porterville, the
64-unit Sequoia Village offers 100 percent affordable single-family homes for very low and low income
households in the Medium Density zone (12 units per acre). In addition, the Grand Avenue Apartments
and Mountain View Apartments projects were proposed by developers at 18 units per acre. However,
due to current market downturn, the Grand Avenue Apartments are not proceeding.
In developing this Housing Element, the City consulted several housing developers active locally
regarding feasible densities for facilitating lower income housing. These developers (Pacific West,
Macfarlane Costa Housing Partners, and Lynx Realty and Management) have expressed interests in
developing affordable housing in Porterville. These developers feel that affordable housing for lower
income households (very low and low) in the form of garden apartments can be accommodated in the
Medium Density Residential zone. Their comment letters are attached to this Housing Element as
Appendix C. However, conservatively, this Housing Element assumes only moderate income housing
potential on Medium Density sites.
In evaluating the City’s growth patterns, market conditions, and housing demands, the City has
determined the following correlation between density and affordability.

VACANT LAND
The inventory identifies approximately 62 acres of residential land with an allowable density of 18 units
per acre or greater (Commercial Mixed Use, High Density Residential, and Downtown Mixed Use). This
land has the capacity to reasonably accommodate a total of 1,212 higher density units for lower income
housing. An additional 125 acres of Medium Density Residential at 12 units per acre can facilitate
moderate income housing, with a capacity of 1,167 units. Table 5 summarizes Porterville’s residential
development potential on vacant land by land use designation and zoning.

UNDERUTILIZED LAND
In addition to vacant sites, future housing units can also be accommodated on underutilized lots where
developments are not built out to the maximum density permitted. With the creation of higher density
land use designations through the General Plan update process, the City created significant future
development potential on existing properties. Land values for these properties appreciated with the
increase in density. The majority of the underutilized residential properties are occupied by old and
often dilapidated single-family homes with large portions of the lot being vacant or used as junk yards.
Underutilized commercial properties are either occupied by older homes or single-story low intensity
commercial uses that are not configured to accommodate modern day commercial or mixed use
developments.
The City’s underutilized sites inventory encompasses 120 acres of land with residential development
potential, about 33 acres have a residential density of 18 units per acre or greater. These underutilized
high density parcels have the capacity to reasonably accommodate 595 units of lower income housing.
An additional 178 moderate income units can be reasonably accommodated on the 19.3 acres of Medium
Density Residential land in the underutilized sites inventory. Low-Medium Density Residential sites can
accommodate 434 above moderate income units. Table 6 presents a summary of the development
capacity on Porterville’s underutilized land.

Trend of Recycling
As the City continues to urbanize, recycling of existing properties into higher intensity uses has become
a necessary trend particularly in the downtown area. Recent redevelopment (and proposed
redevelopment) of existing properties include the following:

It is the City that is actively promoting redevelopment of the downtown area and has achieved marked
transformation of the downtown in recent years.
COMPARISON OF SITES INVENTORY AND RHNA
For the 2009-2014 Housing Element period, the City of Porterville identified properties with a total
existing capacity to accommodate 3,586 additional housing units on vacant (Table 5) and underutilized
(Table 8) sites. In estimating potential units by income range for the 3,586 total estimated units, it is
assumed that:
     •   All of the units in the 18-30 units/acre range are assumed to produce units in the very low and
         low-income category; and
     •   All of the units in the 12-18 units/acre are assumed to produce units in the moderate-income
         category.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                              4-7                       2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

This capacity can facilitate the production of 3,172 lower-income units, 1,107 moderate-income units
and above moderate-income units, providing a surplus of over 1,500 units. Even though not all mixed
use or commercial properties will be developed with a residential component, the City’s sites inventory
has adequate surplus capacity to accommodate the remaining RHNA. Overall, mixed use/commercial
properties offer a potential capacity of 1,723 units. If half of these sites are built with a residential
component, the City still has an excess capacity of over 400 units for lower income housing. Table 8
provides a summary of the City’s available sites and RHNA status.

Notes:
1. Sites at 18+ units per acre are evenly split between very low and low income categories.
2. Sites at 12 units per acre are used for moderate income category.
3. Sites at 9 units per acre are used for above moderate income category.
An analysis was completed using the City’s adopted General Plan and Geographic Information System
(GIS) database to determine the City’s ability in meeting its RHNA allocation. In terms of available
units, sites and available land area, Agencies are mandated to plan and provide for their RHNA
allocation but are not penalized if the market does not achieve the unit numbers by the end of the RHNA
planning period. As shown in the table above, the City was unable to meet its RHNA for lower income
housing with its original inventory analysis and had a shortfall of 132 lower income units. However,
with the implementation of a Focused Rezone Program, within one year of the adoption of the updated
Housing Element, the City shall rezone thirty-six (36) parcels totaling ±168.5 acres of land from Medium
Density Residential and other non-residential uses to High Density Residential to facilitate the
development of additional lower income housing. With the exception of eight (8) parcels on Site 7, all
identified parcels are currently vacant. Site 7 is comprised of 15 parcels, currently developed with
residential uses on eight of the parcels. These structures are in poor to fair condition and are ripe for
redevelopment because all structures are 40-50 years old, surrounded by vacant parcels, do not meet
single family residential standards for lot width and exceed single family residential standards for lot
depth. By rezoning the 168.5 acres, the City will be able to provide a capacity of an estimated ±3,030
units in the lower income category within several sites distributed throughout the city. Compared with
the City’s remaining RHNA shortfall of 132 units, a substantial surplus of overall capacity will result
from this rezoning.
High Density Residential allows up to 24 units per acre. The increased capacity associated with this
rezoning is estimated at 18 units per acre (75% of the maximum density of 24 units per acre permitted in
the High Density Residential designation). Each site within the Focused Rezone Program shall be
capable of accommodating at least 16 units in conformity with the requirements of Government Code
Section 65583.2 (h) and (i).

B. FINANCIAL RESOURCES
As a smaller city, Porterville has limited access to financial resources for affordable housing. The
following list presents the realistic funding available to the City.
1. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT (CDBG)
CDBG is the largest federal housing-related program for affordable housing. It is a "pass-through"
program that allows local governments to use federal funds to alleviate poverty and blight. Cities with
populations of over 50,000 receive CDBG funds directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD), while smaller cities usually use county-administered CDBG funds. HUD
makes allocations based on a formula that takes population, poverty, and housing distress into account.
CDBG funds are used for a variety of housing efforts including activities aimed at reducing costs for
private development (helping fund site acquisition, improvement, and other soft costs); housing
acquisition and rehabilitation through short and long-term loans, grants or loan guarantees; direct
payment of rent or mortgage and housing counseling services; and fair housing activities. CDBG funds
are best used in combination with other subsidy sources or to provide pre-development funding to
initiate housing development.
In 2009, approximately $170,000 in CDBG entitlement funds and program income is available for the
City of Porterville Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program (HRLP). In addition, approximately $70,000 in
CDBG program income is available for the First-Time Home Buyer program. Discretionary income is
limited as the City has received a Section 108 loan for the construction of a much needed
neighborhood/community center, and close to fifty percent of its annual entitlement, approximately
$325,000 is dedicated to repayment of the Section 108 loan.
In addition to the CDBG specifically for the FTHB program, the City has submitted an application to
HCD for Neighborhood Stabilization Program funding. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP)
was established for the purpose of stabilizing communities that have suffered from foreclosures and
abandonment. Through the purchase and redevelopment of foreclosed and abandoned homes and
residential properties, the goal of the program is to provide affordable rehabilitated housing and to
eligible low-income families. The City has applied for $700,699 for financing mechanisms, Purchase
and Rehabilitation, Land-banking, Demolition of Blighted Structures, and Redevelopment of demolished
or vacant properties.
2. REDEVELOPMENT HOUSING SET-ASIDE FUNDS
The Porterville Redevelopment Agency (RDA) sets aside 20 percent of the tax increment revenues to use
for affordable housing. “Tax increment funds” are created through the increased property tax revenues
generated as the result of initial public investment in the redevelopment area, which in turn result in new
private investment in the area. Redevelopment law also authorizes the acquisition and assembly of land
for redevelopment purposes, which can include the construction of new housing, the provision of low- or
no-cost land subsidies for affordable housing, or other forms of assistance in the preservation and
upgrading of the redevelopment project area.

The Porterville Redevelopment Agency has a current balance of $1.1 million in the set-aside funds.
Much of that balance has already been committed to the proposed Villa Siena housing Project. The
Agency anticipates little additional redevelopment set-aside funds available for housing activities during
the planning period of this Housing Element. Future tax increment revenues will primarily be used to
pay debt services incurred for bonds issued to finance various redevelopment programs. Previous set-
aside balance has already been expended or encumbered as follows:
        A substantial portion up to $1.2 million of the set-aside and bond fund balance has been reserved
        for the Villa Sienna mixed use project, a 70-unit multi-family/professional office development
        with all the units deed-restricted as affordable for low income households. The 70 affordable
        units are expected to be completed within the time frame of this Housing Element. Within the
        project, 24 of these units will also serve as replacement units for the single residential occupancy
        units lost at the Porterville Hotel that had HCD covenants recorded on them.
3. HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM (HOME)
The City of Porterville does not qualify to receive HOME funds directly from HUD. However, the City
can apply to the State Department of Housing and Community Development for HOME funds
administered by the State for small jurisdictions. HOME funds administered by the State are awarded on
a competitive basis. Instead, the City applies to the State HCD for HOME grants on a competitive basis.
 In 2004, the City applied and received $1.2 million dollars in HOME funds for the FTHB and HRLP
program. In 2006 $800,000 was awarded for continuation of the FTHB and HRLP programs. Most
recently the City was awarded $800,000 in 2008 for FTHB and HRLP programs.
HOME funds must be spent only on housing, and are intended to provide incentives for the acquisition,
construction, and rehabilitation of affordable rental and home ownership. HOME requires local
governments to provide matching funds, though the matching ratio depends on the specific uses to which
HOME funds are to be put. The federal-to-local matching ratio for tenant assistance is currently four-to-
one, while the match for rental construction is two-to-one. With limited funding resources, the City
often has difficulty meeting the match requirement for HOME funds. However, in the recent past, the
match requirement for the State HOME program has been waived by HUD, allowing the City to apply
for more funds.
4. CALHOME
In 2008, the City applied for funds but was not awarded any FTHB funding in the very competitive
funding cycle. Most recently, the City completed expenditure of the 2005 Cal Home Grant of $500,000
for the First-Time Homebuyer Program. The CalHOME program administered by the State HCD
enables low and very-low income households to become or remain homeowners. Grants are provided to
local public agencies and nonprofit developers to assist individual households through deferred-payment
loans. Grants can be used for first-time homebuyer downpayment assistance, home rehabilitation,
acquisition and rehabilitation, homebuyer counseling, self-help mortgage assistance programs, or
technical assistance for self-help and shared housing homeownership.
5. SECTION 8 RENTAL ASSISTANCE
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                            4-12                   2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT
Section 8 rental assistance is provided to a household in order to bridge the gap between 30 percent of
the household's gross monthly income and the fair market rent of a unit. Although this long-standing
federal assistance program is not expected to increase in size or scope, it remains an important program
for affordable housing by helping to balance household income and housing costs. Section 8 assistance
in Porterville is administered by the Housing Authority of Tulare County. As of December 2008, 585
Porterville households were receiving Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, which accounted for nearly
three million dollars.
6. LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS (LIHTC)
LIHTC represents a significant resource for affordable housing development in Porterville. The City has
five (5) large multi-family complexes that have received LIHTC and provided 383 units. The last one
constructed was Sequoia Village at Rivers Edge, a 64 unit family complex which opened in 2007. While
the City cannot apply directly for LIHTC, the City works diligently with developers proposing affordable
housing projects using LIHTC to package a strong application. The City is currently working with the
developer to assist in the LIHTC application for the proposed 70 unit Villa Siena Complex.
Created by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) program has been
used in combination with City and other resources to encourage the construction and rehabilitation of
rental housing for lower-income households. The program allows investors an annual tax credit over a
10-year period, provided that the housing meets the following minimum low-income occupancy
requirements: 20 percent of the units must be affordable to households at 50 percent of area median
income (AMI), or 40 percent of the units must be affordable to those at 60 percent of AMI. The total
credit over the 10-year period has a present value equal to 70 percent of the qualified construction and
rehabilitation expenditures. The tax credit is typically sold to large investors at a syndication value.
These credits are available for all projects meeting the above-mentioned criteria and are applied for
independently of City programs.
7. PROPOSTION 1C – INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM
Prop 1C Grant funds assist in the new construction and rehabilitation of infrastructure that supports
higher-density mixed-uses, and affordable housing in locations designated as infill development.
Assistance terms for grant amounts for Qualifying Infill Projects: $500,000/$20 million ($250,000
minimum for Rural Areas). Minimum/maximum grant amounts for Qualifying Infill Areas (and Large
Multi-Phase Qualifying Infill Projects scored as Areas): $2 million/$30 million ($1 million minimum for
Rural Areas). Eligible activities include new construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of
infrastructure required as a condition of or approved in connection with approval of qualifying infill
projects or qualifying infill areas. For qualifying infill projects, eligible applicants include a non-profit
or for profit developer either by itself or as a joint applicant with a locality, public housing authority, and
redevelopment agency. For qualifying infill areas, eligible applicants include localities, public housing
authorities, redevelopment agencies, and BIDs as joint applicants with any of the other allowed area
applicants. Applications are invited through the issuance of Notices of Funding Availability (NOFAs).
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                             4-13                     2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

The City assisted in the application for Prop 1C Grant funding to assist with infill development and
provide infrastructure for the Villa Sienna mixed use project. The project was awarded more than $2.3
million in funding for infill development and infrastructure improvements. The City will monitor the
Notice of funding Availability (NOFA) for the State housing bond to determine eligibility and identify
other potential project/programs for funding
C. ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
1. CITY OF PORTERVILLE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT
The Community Development Department is responsible for the general planning and development
review functions undertaken by the City. Specific duties include preparing zoning and subdivision
ordinance amendments and design guidelines for Council approval, reviewing development applications,
conducting investigations, and making reports and recommendations on planning and land use, economic
development activities, Redevelopment Agency efforts, zoning, subdivisions, development plans, and
environmental controls. The Department also coordinates activities with Porterville school districts
related to school sites and the Porterville Municipal Airport in consultation with Tulare County, and the
County’s Airport Land Use Commission.
2. CITY OF PORTERVILLE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
The Porterville Redevelopment Agency oversees housing activities that increase, improve, or preserve
the supply of affordable housing in the City’s redevelopment project areas. The Agency’s housing
activities include:
    •   Funding the Casas Buena Vista project, a single-family development with the majority of the
        units deed-restricted as affordable for low income households;
    •   Making bond funds available for the construction or rehabilitation of multi-family rental housing,
        including the 14-unit St. James Place and the 78-unit Date Avenue Porterville Family
        Apartments;
    •   Making bond funds available for homebuyer assistance in the Redevelopment Project area; and
    •   Using set-aside funds as the required match for the HOME-funded program.
3. HOUSING AUTHORITY OF TULARE COUNTY
The Housing Authority of the County of Tulare provides rental assistance to very low income families,
seniors, and the handicapped throughout the County. The Housing Authority offer many different
programs, including the conventional public housing program, the housing choice voucher program, the
farm labor program for families with farm labor income, and senior housing programs. The Housing
Authority also owns or manages several individual subsidized rental complexes. There are currently 585

Porterville households receiving Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers from the Housing Authority of
Tulare County.
4. NON-PROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS
Due to the high cost of housing development, many communities have found that partnerships with non-
profit housing developers are an effective tool for creating affordable housing units. In recent years, the
City has worked with the following nonprofit housing developers to create affordable housing in the
development of the low-income tax credit projects and are in discussion with both Habitat for Humanity
and Self-Help Enterprises for both new construction affordable projects, rehabilitation projects, and
preservation of housing at risk of converting to current market rates.
In addition, the following agencies have expressed interest in assisting in the preservation of housing at
risk of converting to market rate in Tulare County, including the City of Porterville:
    •   Christian Church Homes of Northern California
    •   Self-Help Enterprises
D. OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Utility-related costs can directly impact the affordability of housing in California. Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new development and requires
adoption of an "energy budget." In turn, the home-building industry must comply with these standards,
while localities are responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations.
The following are among the alternative ways to meet these energy standards.
        •   Alternative 1: The passive solar approach which requires proper solar orientation,
            appropriate levels of thermal mass, south-facing windows, and moderate insulation levels.
        •   Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but has no
            thermal mass or window-orientation requirements.
        •   Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires active solar water heating in
            exchange for less stringent insulation and/or glazing requirements.
Additional energy conservation measures include: (1) locating the home on the northern portion of the
sunniest location of the site; (2) designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into
the building and to reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions; (3) locating indoor areas of
maximum usage along the south face of the building and placing corridors, closets, laundry rooms,
power core, and garages along the north face; and (4) making the main entrance a small enclosed space
that creates an air lock between the building and its exterior; orienting the entrance away from winds; or
using a windbreak to reduce the wind velocity against the entrance.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                           4-15                     2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

The City assists lower income households with energy conservation improvements. The City’s Housing
Rehabilitation Loan Program (HRLP) covers weatherization improvements as eligible activities and with
the new HOME grant funds. The guidelines have been revised to encourage homeowners to incorporate
the list of green improvements into these projects.
Additionally, the City promotes and provides through its Energy Conservation Program, referrals to local
programs including CSET, Proteus, Edison and other agencies for energy conservation and residential
weatherization opportunities. The program extends into the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Loan program
to require the use of recycled materials whenever possible and energy efficient appliances and
equipment. Contractors that bid on HRLP projects must complete a City provided “Green
Improvements” checklist with their bids for a project.

                  EVALUATION OF 2003 HOUSING
                    ELEMENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
In order to develop an effective housing plan for the 2009-2014 period, the City must evaluate
the achievements of the existing housing programs. This assessment allows the City to revise the
programs as necessary to ensure that City resources are being used in the most effective manner
to meet the housing needs of residents.
A.      ACCOMPLISHMENTS SINCE 2003
The 2003 Housing Element had a production goal of 3,453 units in the City. Among these units,
1,029 were designated for very low income households, 714 for low income households, 392 for
moderate-income households, and 1,318 for above moderate-income households. Between 2003
and 2008, the total housing production in the City was 1,638 units, with a majority of units
consisting of single-family homes. Based on listed prices/rents and deed restrictions, the income
distribution of these units was:
        ·   131 units affordable to very low-income households (12 percent of allocation)
        ·   678 units affordable to low-income households (95 percent of allocation)
        ·   603 units affordable to moderate-income households (150 percent of allocation)
        ·   226 units affordable to above-moderate-income households (17 percent of allocation)
Therefore, housing production in the City exceeded the allocation for moderate-income
households, but did not reach the allocation target for very low, low, and above-moderate income
households.
To supplement the City’s limited CDBG and redevelopment housing set-aside funds, the City
continued to apply for funding available under various funding programs. As needed, the City
applied for HOME funds administered by the State HCD. Specifically, to promote affordable
home ownership opportunities in the City, the City continues it’s First-Time Home Buyer
(FTHB) program, and pursued and received funding from various local, State, and Federal
programs. Funding for the FTHB program include:
        •   $800,000 HOME Funds in 2002
        •   $1.2 million HOME funds in 2004
        •   $500,000 CalHOME funds in 2005
        •   $425,000 in RDA set aside/bond funds – used for Casas Buena Vista FTHB
        •   $1.5 million CalHFA HELP Program Loan funds for Casas Buena Vista
        •   Program income from HOME and CDBG funds

The City recognized affordable homeownership opportunities are aspirations of many in the
community. Since 2003, 136 units were assisted with these funding sources. In addition to the
FTHB program, the City joined a joint-power authority with other communities in California to
offer lease-to-own opportunities. The City has also offered homebuyer education classes
monthly to help many understand the process and financial responsibility of home ownership.
In addition, the City continued to operate its Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program (HRLP)
using primarily CDBG and State HOME funds. Since 2003, 30 units have been assisted.
Funding for the HRLP includes:
        •   Annual allocations from the CDBG program
        •   Program income from HOME and CDBG funds
        •   HOME 2002 Grant
        •   HOME 2006 Grant
Preserving the existing affordable housing stock is an important goal in the City. During the last
ten years, two rental projects at risk of conversion to market-rate uses, Evergreen and Alderwood
Apartments, extended their commitment to providing affordable housing opportunities in the
City. Other affordable multi-family and single-family affordable housing projects constructed
over the last five (5) years include the 14 unit St. James Place mixed use project ($1 million in
HOME Funds), Sequoia Village at Rivers Edge ($1 million in HOME Funds), the Date Avenue
Family Apartments ($115, 000 in RDA Funds), and the single-family housing project Casas
Buena Vista, receiving FTHB assistance from all of the City’s FTHB funding sources.

B.      PROGRAMS AND ACTIONS
The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address Porterville’s identified housing
needs and are implemented through a series of housing programs. These programs define the
specific actions the City will undertake to achieve the stated goals and policies. Funding sources
for implementing the eight-year objectives are also listed. These housing programs include
programs currently in operation in the City and new programs that have been added to address
the City’s unmet housing needs. A housing program often implements more than one policy and
sometimes, more than one goal. The programs are categorized by the primary goal for which the
programs are intended.
Goal A:         To preserve the existing housing stock and conserve existing affordable
                housing opportunities.
A.1     Home Rehabilitation Loan Program
This program assists low income single-family homeowners with needed repairs by providing
direct, 30-year, deferred loans of up to $40,000. The funds may be used to correct code
violations, safety repairs, accessibility improvements, lead-based paint, and energy conservation
measures. Currently, there is a long waiting list of applicants for home rehabilitation assistance.
The City is processing loans for applicants on the waiting list and once the list is exhausted the
City will reopen the program for new applications.
        Five-Year Activities:
        • Continue to offer rehabilitation assistance to income-qualified households
        • Continue to market this program at public counters and through other media (e.g.
            newspaper)
        • Depending on the rate of expenditure, re-apply to HCD for additional HOME and
            possibly Cal Home or other state program funds in future years.
        Quantified Objectives:           Assist approximately 10 households with current funding
                                         through April 2011, with an objective of assisting 10
                                         households annually if additional funding becomes
                                         available.
        Funding Sources:                 CDBG entitlement funds and program income;

due to expiration of subsidy contracts. To the extent feasible, the City will work to preserve the
affordability of these units in partnership with the property owners, public agencies, and other
interested parties.
        Five-Year Activities:
        • Monitor the at-risk status of projects annually and contact project owners to discuss
            preservation options and incentives.
        • Work with the HATC to provide technical assistance to tenants regarding the
            availability of Section 8 vouchers in case units are converted to market-rate housing.
        • Work with property owners and nonprofit housing providers to pursue the
            preservation of at-risk units. Pursue State and Federal funding programs to preserve
            the at-risk units either through acquisition and/or rehabilitation, affordability
            covenants, or other means.
        Quantified Objectives:          Work to preserve the affordability of 274 units.
        Funding Sources:                Rural Development subsidy renewals; HUD Section 8
                                        vouchers; State Farmworker Housing funds;
                                        Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside funds; HOME; and
                                        others
        Responsible Agencies:           Community Development Department
Goal B:     To provide adequate residential sites through appropriate land use designation
            and zoning to accommodate the City's share of regional housing needs.
B.1.    Vacant and Underutilized Sites Inventory
As part of this Housing Element update, the City has reviewed its residential land inventory for
vacant and underutilized sites available for housing development within the time frame of this
Element. Since January 1, 2007, the City has permitted and approved 3,288 housing units,
including 1,224 very low, 862 low, 979 moderate, and 2,409 above moderate income units. The
RHNA remaining for the 2009-2014 Housing Element is 2,723 units (1,173 very low, 700 low,
850 moderate, and 0 above moderate units).
The City will ensure an adequate supply of residentially designated land to accommodate the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). In 2008, the City of Porterville adopted a new
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                            6-5                   2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

General Plan that updated and reclassified land use designations for incorporated and
unincorporated land in the Porterville area. The update increased the residential land use
designations of the area. These sites will allow owner-occupied and rental multifamily uses by-
right sufficient to accommodate the remaining need for lower-income households. The sites will
accommodate a minimum of 16 units per site with a minimum density of 20 units per acre and at
least 50 percent of the lower-income need will be on sites designated for residential use only.
         Five-Year Activities:
         • Annually, or upon major General Plan amendments or annexation, update the sites
             inventory and provide information on available sites to interested developers.
         • Identify sites with infill and mixed-use opportunities (see Programs B.2 and B.3).
         • Collaborate with local developers to facilitate affordable housing development by
             providing incentives (e.g. density bonus) and financial assistance when funding is
             available, and mitigating constraints when identified (see Program F.2).
         • Pursue opportunities for annexation within the City’s planning area as identified in
             the General Plan.
         • Within one year of the adoption of the updated Housing Element, the City shall
             implement a Focused Rezone Program to rezone 36 parcels (totaling ±168.5 acres of
             land) from lower density residential and non-residential uses to High Density
             Residential to facilitate the development of additional lower income housing. With
             the exception of eight (8) parcels on Site 7, all parcels identified are currently vacant.
              The program will provide an estimated ±3,030 units in the lower income category
             within several sites distributed throughout the City. A surplus in overall capacity will
             provide potential future development of low income housing allowed by right. High
             Density Residential allows up to 24 units per acre. The increased capacity associated
             with this rezoning is estimated at 18 units per acre (75% of the maximum density of
             24 units per acre permitted in the High Density Residential designation). Each site
             within the Focused Rezone Program shall be capable of accommodating at least 16
             units in conformity with the requirements of Government Code Section 65583.2 (h)
             and (i). Pursuant to State law, high density residential development in these areas
             will be permitted by right without discretionary approval.
         Quantified Objectives:           Provide adequate sites for the remaining RHNA of
                                          2,723 units (1,173 very low, 700 low, 850 moderate,
                                          and 0 above moderate units)
         Funding Sources:                 General fund
         Responsible Agencies:            Community Development Department
B.2      Mixed-Use Development
The City’s Zoning Ordinance permits residential uses above retail uses in the downtown. To
facilitate mixed-use developments, the City offers a variety of incentives:
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                             6-6                      2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

       •    The City has established a parking district to address parking demands in downtown.
             Developments that do not involve an increase in square footage are not required to
            provide for additional parking.
       •    The City has established a new Downtown Mixed Use Zone with development
            standards, policies, and procedures for the downtown area.
       •    For adaptive reuse projects, development application review and approval is
            performed at the staff level as long as the project meets fire, building, and health and
            safety codes, and addresses ingress/egress issues.
       •    A development envelope of 2.0 Floor-Area-Ratio (FAR) is provided.
       •    Potential funding assistance includes redevelopment and HOME funds, as well as
            other available resources.
       Five-Year Activities:
       • Identify potential sites for redevelopment into mixed-use projects by the end of 2009
            and provide the list of available sites to developers to encourage residential
            development.
       • Offer incentives, as appropriate and feasible, to promote mixed-use projects.
       • Pursue additional HOME funds for other mixed-use projects.
       Funding Sources:                 General fund; HOME funds; Redevelopment funds
       Responsible Agencies:            Community Development Department
B.3    Infill Development
The City is in the process of researching the feasibility of various incentives to encourage infill
development. These may include:
       •    Financial assistance to make infrastructure and other public improvements.
       •    Reduce or modify open space, parking requirements, and/or other development
            standards, as appropriate.
       •    Apply for or encourage applications from developers for new State In-fill and
            Infrastructure grant programs.
       Five-Year Activities:
       • If feasible, develop infill incentives by the June of 2010.
       Funding Sources:                 Grants and general fund
       Responsible Agencies:            Community Development Department
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                            6-7                    2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

Goal C:    To expand the City’s low- and moderate-income housing opportunities.
C.1    Home Buyer Assistance
The City recognizes homeownership is a desire of many Porterville residents. Through the First-
Time Home Buyer (FTHB) program and development of affordable ownership housing, the City
extends affordable homeownership opportunities for many lower income households.
       First-Time Low Income Home Buyer Program: Under this program, the applicant
       must be a first-time home buyer that earns 80 percent or less of the area median income.
       The applicant must also be able to qualify with a participating lender for a first mortgage
       and provide a percentage of the down payment from their own personal assets. The City
       provides a secured second trust deed loan to fill the gap, providing down payment and
       closing cost assistance up to $40,000. Existing homes to be financed under this program
       include homes constructed before 1978, as long as the dwelling unit passes a visual
       assessment that reveals no sign of deteriorated paint surfaces that could contain lead
       paint. Since the initiation of this program in 1993, this program has assisted
       approximately 300 families to purchase homes in the City of Porterville.
       Affordable Ownership Housing Development: To expand affordable homeownership
       opportunities in Porterville, the City has assisted with the development of ownership
       housing. Specifically, the City utilized a CalHFA HELP loan to the Redevelopment
       Agency for the development of Casas Buena Vista. A total of 82 affordable ownership
       housing units were made available to low income households and successfully purchased
       using FTHB funds. The City will continue to pursue similar opportunities as funding
       permits.
       Five-Year Activities:
       • Continue to assist income-qualified homebuyers in Porterville through the First-Time
           Home Buyer and other programs.
       • Apply for additional funding under the CalHOME and HOME programs as needed.
       Quantified Objectives:          Assist 10 households to purchase first home with current
                                       available funding through April 2011, with an objective of
                                       assisting 10 households annually if additional funding
                                       becomes available.
       Funding Sources:                CalHOME funds; CDBG program income; HOME funds;
                                       redevelopment set-aside funds and set-aside match for
                                       HOME funds; HOME program income
       Responsible Agencies:           Community Development Department; Community

C.2     Home Buyer Education Classes
The City currently provides home buyer education classes in English and Spanish to low income
persons and families once a month during the evenings. The class provides information on the
advantages and disadvantages of home ownership, how to work with a realtor, what to look for
in selecting a home, understanding the loan and escrow process, and learning how to maintain a
home. Upon completion of the class, the participant receives a Certificate of Completion making
them eligible to participate in the City’s First Time Home Buyer Program.
        Five-Year Activities:
        • Continue to offer Home Buyer Education Class once a month.
        Funding Sources:                CDBG entitlement funds
        Responsible Agencies:           Community Development Department
C.3     Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
The City participates in the County Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC) program. The MCC
program is administered by the Housing Authority of Tulare County (HATC) and allows lower
and moderate income first-time homebuyers to take 20 percent of their annual mortgage interest
as a dollar-for-dollar tax credit against their federal income tax.
        Five-Year Activities:
        • Continue to adopt resolution of approval to participate in this program.
        Funding Sources:                MCC federal income tax credits to provide assistance via
                                        the County program; no funding required from the City
        Responsible Agencies:           City Council
C.4     Section 8 Rental Assistance
The HATC administers the Section 8 Rental Assistance program for Porterville. The Section 8
program extends rental subsidies to very low income households who cannot afford the cost of
rental housing. The Section 8 program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the
current fair market rent established by HUD and what a tenant can afford to pay (typically at 30
percent of household income). As of September 2008, 585 households in Porterville (in both
incorporated and unincorporated areas) receive Section 8 vouchers through HATC.
        Five-Year Activities:
        • Promote the use of Section 8 via City website, newsletter, and brochures at public
            counters.

        •   Encourage property owners to rent units through this program by providing
            information at public counters and referring property owners to the HATC.
        •   Work with affordable housing developers to obtain Section 8 assistance for new
            construction projects by providing letter of support for funding application.

        Responsible Agencies:           HATC; Community Development Department
C.5     Local, State, and Federal Funding
Development of affordable housing in Porterville, particularly for extremely low and very low
income housing, typically requires substantial leveraging with public funds. Often, multiple
layers of funding are required to address the deep subsidies required. Recent affordable rentals
for families (Sequioa Village at Rivers Edge) were developed with Low Income Housing Tax
Credits and affordable single-family homes for families (Casas Buena Vista) were developed
with Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside funds and CalHFA HELP Funds.
The City will continue to pursue available local, state, and federal funding sources in cooperation
with private developers, non-profit housing corporations, the HATC, and other interested entities
to provide affordable housing and to preserve housing that is at-risk of converting to market rate.
 Funding will be targeted to facilitate the development of housing for families (including large
families and farmworker families), seniors, and persons with disabilities. The City has been
successful in obtaining HOME, Cal Home and CalFHA funds to expand affordable housing
opportunities through new construction or downpayment assistance. The City will continue to
monitor the funding availability under these and other available programs and pursue funding as
appropriate.
        Five-Year Activities:
        • Continue to work closely with developers to pursue Low Income Housing Tax
            Credits by expediting project review.
        • Annually identify programs to pursue based on the likelihood of funding, including
            HOME, Cal-Home, CalFHA funds and other State and Federal funds.
        • Pursue funding for extremely low, very low, and low income housing, including
            housing for persons with disabilities.
        Funding Sources:                General fund
        Responsible Agencies:           Community Development Department
Goal D:     To address the housing needs of special populations.
D.1     Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, Supportive Housing
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                           6-10                    2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

State law requires that a jurisdiction specify the zoning district(s) where emergency shelters and
transitional housing facilities for the homeless are permitted. In 2008 an updated General Plan
was adopted and with the adoption of the new General Plan the Zoning Ordinance update was
initiated. The Porterville Zoning Ordinance currently does not specify the zoning district(s) in
which emergency shelters housing are permitted.
The Zoning Ordinance permits institutional uses (including residential care facilities) in R-2 and
R-3 zones through the conditional use permit process. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended
to expressly permit residential care serving six or fewer persons in all residential zones.
Emergency shelters and transitional housing are not expressly identified as uses included under
the category of institutional uses. Transitional housing is allowed in the R-1, R-2, and R-3
residential zones. The Zoning Ordinance update will specify emergency shelters and transitional
housing as institutional uses. Emergency shelters shall be permitted by right in the C-2 and C-3
zones and in the R-3 Zone with a conditional use permit. Conditions for approval will relate
primarily to the performance and operation of the proposed facilities (such as parking
requirements) and will not unduly constrain the development of such facilities. Specifically,
conditions required will be similar to those for similar uses in the same zones, regulating only the
use but not the users. The Porterville City Council serves also as the Planning Commission.
Discretionary permit approval requires only one public hearing.
The City will also amend the Zoning Ordinance to differentiate transitional/supportive housing in
the form of group quarters versus as regular housing developments. For transitional/supportive
housing facilities that operate as regular housing developments, such uses will be permitted by
right where housing is otherwise permitted. For transitional/supportive housing facilities that
operate as group quarters, such facilities will be permitted as community care residential
facilities.
         Five-Year Activities:
         • Amend Zoning Ordinance to incorporate provisions for emergency shelters,
            transitional housing, supportive housing, and residential care facilities for six or
            fewer persons by the end of 2009 (see Program F.1).

         Responsible Agencies:           Community Development Department
D.2      Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
The Porterville Zoning Ordinance does not contain specific provisions for SRO units. The
Zoning Ordinance will be amended to specifically address the provision of SRO units in the
Downtown General Commercial Zone(s) via a Conditional Use Permit process. The City will
also establish objective and appropriate development standards in the Zoning Ordinance for SRO
units.
CITY OF PORTERVILLE                           6-11                     2009-14 HOUSING ELEMENT

         Five-Year Activities:
         • Amend Zoning Ordinance to incorporate provisions for Single-Room Occupancy
             units by the end of 2009 (see Program F.1).
         • Pursue opportunity for acquisition/rehabilitation of old motels and convert to SRO
             units for extremely low and very low income households.

         Responsible Agencies:          Community Development Department
D.3      Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As required by SB 520, the City reviewed its zoning provisions, land use controls, permit and
processing procedures, fees and exactions, and building codes to determine if any governmental
constraint may impede the development and improvement of housing for persons with
disabilities. Based on this review, the City did not identify any specific constraint that may
impede housing opportunities for persons with disabilities. Requests for reasonable
accommodation are reviewed and approved at the staff level. The Zoning Ordinance also
contains provisions for licensed community care facilities that are consistent with State laws.
Through plan checks and building inspections, the City ensures that developers comply with
ADA requirements.
The City will conduct more detailed research for promoting the development of housing for
persons with disabilities. Specifically, as part of the City’s research on incentives to promote
infill and affordable housing, the City will explore techniques and incentives to encourage the
development of housing for persons with disabilities.
         Five -Year Activities:
         • Conduct research and develop infill housing incentives, including techniques to
             encourage housing for persons with disabilities by the end of 2009.
         • Adopt a reasonable accommodation ordinance by the end of 2009 to provide a formal
             and objective process for reviewing and granting reasonable accommodation
             requests.
         • Continue to monitor City development standards and policies to ensure such
             standards and policies do not impede housing opportunities for persons with
             disabilities.

and Safety Code Section 17021.6) requires that farmworker housing for 12 units or 36 beds be
considered equivalent to an agricultural use or, in other words, permitted by right in agricultural
zones.1 As the City has created a new Agricultural/Rural/Conservation land use, the Zoning
Ordinance will be amended to permit farmworker housing in the implementing zoning district(s).
Pursuant to the Health and Safety Code Section 17021.5, the City will also amend the Zoning
Ordinance to permit farm working housing accommodating six or fewer employees as a single-
family use.
        Five-Year Activities:
        • Amend Zoning Ordinance to incorporate provisions for farmworker housing by end
             of 2009 (see Program F.1).
        Funding Sources:                General fund
        Responsible Agencies:           Community Development Department
Goal E:      To assure that all present and future residents have equal access to housing,
             commensurate with the financial capacity, without discrimination.
E.1     Fair Housing
Porterville cooperates with federal, state, and regional agencies to promote open housing choice
and equal housing opportunity. Depending on the nature of the complaints, Porterville currently
refers complaints regarding housing discrimination to the Legal Aid of Central California,
California Rural Legal Aid, and Self Help Enterprises, Fresno County Housing Authority (Fair
Housing Unit), and State Department of Fair Employment and Housing.
        Five-Year Activities:
        • Continue to provide fair housing referrals.
        • Continue to post fair housing posters and referral information at City Hall, public
             counters, and community facilities.

F.1      Zoning Ordinance Revisions
The City of Porterville in currently in the process of completing an update to the Zoning
Ordinance for accuracy and consistency with the General Plan that was adopted in 2008. To
facilitate and encourage the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in
Porterville, the City will address several zoning revisions.
         Five-Year Activities:
         • By the end of 2009, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to:
            a. Second Unit Law
                In accordance with Assembly Bill 1866, the City Zoning Ordinance currently
                contains standards and allows second unit concepts. The City’s Zoning Ordinance
                allows second units, ensuring that development standards and permit procedures
                do not constrain the development and improvement of second unit housing
                concepts.
            b. Global warming Solutions
                In accordance with Assembly Bill 32, mandate for global warming solutions, the
                City is currently in the process of updating it Zoning Ordinance to include efforts
                to minimize greenhouse gases. The City currently notifies developers of the
                Indirect Source Rule regulations and compliance with all San Joaquin Valley Air
                Control Board requirements. All development projects that are submitted are
                reviewed and informed if the rule applies. The Act caps California’s greenhouse
                gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020. This legislation represents the first
                enforceable state-wide program in the U.S. to cap all GHG emissions from major
                industries that includes penalties for non-compliance. It requires the State Air
                Resources Board to establish a program for statewide greenhouse gas emissions
                reporting and to monitor and enforce compliance with this program. The Act
                authorizes the state board to adopt market-based compliance mechanisms
                including cap-and-trade, and allows a one-year extension of the targets under
                extraordinary circumstances.
                Additionally, the Zoning Ordinance update will include green building material
                incentives or alternatives to construction materials.

F.1     Fee Deferral
Similar to much of the Tulare County, given the suburban/rural nature of much of the City of
Porterville, development in the City typically requires infrastructure improvements that add to
the cost of development. To mitigate this impact of the feasibility of development, on Mary 31,
2009, the City Council authorized Staff to proceed with the preparation of an Interim Urgency
Ordinance, and subsequently a permanent ordinance to defer the collection of certain impact fees
to the occupancy of the development. The deferral of fees until occupancy will allow the
developer to install infrastructure in suburban/rural areas that would otherwise be a large initial
upfront cost, therefore reducing development of potential affordable housing.

Goal G:     To Ensure Adequate Services to Infrastructure and Housing.
G.1     Infrastructure Improvements
Infrastructure improvements represent a significant cost factor for housing development in
Porterville. To facilitate the development of affordable housing, the City has provided financial
assistance for necessary infrastructure improvements using redevelopment set-aside funds,
CDBG funds, and other State and federal funds. The City will continue to evaluate appropriate
projects for receiving financial assistance.
        Five -Year Activities:
        • Continue to leverage redevelopment funds, CDBG, and other funding sources for
            necessary infrastructure improvements to encourage the production of affordable
            housing units.
        • Continue to pursue additional funding sources to expand affordable housing
            opportunities.

G.2     Energy Conservation
The City provides referrals to local programs including CSET, Proteus, Edison and other
agencies for energy conservation and residential weatherization opportunities. The effort
extends into the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program (HRLP) to require the use of
recycled materials whenever possible and energy efficient appliances and equipment.
Contractors that bid on HRLP projects must complete a City provided “Green Improvements”
checklist with their bids for a project.

Conserved
The City has a RHNA allocation of 1,224 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units). Pursuant to new
State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing needs based on Census income
distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely low. Extremely low income households constitute
50.1 percent of the very low income group. Therefore, the City’s RHNA of 1,224 very low income units can be split between
612 extremely low and 612 very low income units. However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the RHNA, State law
does not mandate the separate accounting for the extremely low income category.

      Open Space & Conservation
The Porterville Planning Area includes natural resources that are important, not only for their
aesthetic values, but also for environmental quality, habitat protection, recreation, water
resources, and agriculture production. The Open Space & Conservation Element is intended
to establish policies and programs for the conservation, development, and use of open space
and natural resources. Topics addressed include: open space; agriculture and farmland
resources; land resources including soils and minerals; biological resources; water quality; air
quality; and cultural resources.
The three General Plan initiatives this element addresses are: providing Porterville with a
network of parks and open space; protecting ridgelines, visible hillsides, and significant
environmental resources; and protecting community assets. This element also supports rural
conservation within the County through compatible development that preserves natural
features, sensitive habitats, and agricultural resources.
In conjunction with the Land Use Element and the Circulation Element, the policies and
implementation actions of this element become an Open Space & Conservation Action Plan.
The Land Use Element fosters a compact development pattern with strong urban “edges” in
order to protect adjacent agricultural lands, the Tule River Parkway, and hillsides, and
contribute to the sense of place for the community. The new Resort Residential area near Lake
Success will incorporate an open space system of parks, trails, and natural reserves, while
accommodating new housing and recreation opportunities. The expanded and interconnected
trail and circulation network in the Circulation Element links Porterville’s residents directly to
these resources.

Porterville General Plan
6.1        OPEN SPACE
The City of Porterville is located in the
southern portion of the San Joaquin Valley at
the base of the Sierra Nevada foothills. It is
surrounded by farmland. The Tule River
flows down from Lake Success and through
the city. Views extending along the river and
of its heavily vegetated banks contribute to
the scenic quality of the area. Rocky Hill is a
prominent visual landmark and potential
recreation area. The agricultural foundation,
topography and landscape are important not
only for community identity and aesthetic
value, but also for environmental quality,
habitat         protection,  and      recreation    Open space near Porterville
opportunities.
The City of Porterville defines open space as any parcel of land or body of water that is
essentially unimproved and undeveloped, with the exception of designated historical
properties. This includes agricultural land, recreation areas, areas with hazardous conditions,
and conservation areas. Currently there are approximately 21,270 acres being used for
agriculture or are considered rural or conservation uses. In addition, there are about 1,400
acres of other public/quasi-public land which is open space:
•    Parkland – 295 acres
•    Yandanchi Ecological Preserve – 164 acres
•    Lewis Hill Preserve – 107 acres (included in the Agriculture/Rural/Conservation total)
•    Cemeteries – 195 acres
•    Water systems and sewer treatment plant – 725 acres
Tulare County’s Bartlett Park is located near the base of Success Dam; however its future
status is unconfirmed.
The Lake Success recreation areas, along the north-eastern edge of the Planning Area, provide
camping, fishing, picnicking and boating opportunities. Tulare County’s Bartlett Park is
located near the base of Success Dam; however its future status is unconfirmed. In total,
approximately 62 percent of the Planning Area was open space in 2005.
In order to conserve the existing open space and unique landscape features, and protect views,
the City is currently preparing a Hillside Development Ordinance which details design and
planning standards for the foothills area. In addition, the Foothill Growth Management Plan,
an element of the existing Tulare County General Plan, helps guide development in the area.

CLASSIFICATION OF OPEN SPACE
State planning law (Government Code Section 65560) provides a structure for the
preservation of open space by identifying open space categories. An additional category is
proposed for this Plan to help define the urban development edge.
•   Open space for public health and safety including, but not limited to, areas that require
    special management or regulation due to hazardous or special conditions. This type of
    open space might include: earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, floodplains,
    watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks, and areas required for the protection of water
    quality and water reservoirs. In Porterville, this category includes land in the 100-year
    flood plain, slopes with more than 25 percent grade, and land beneath the airport
    approach and departure zones.
•   Open space for the preservation of natural resources, including, but not limited to, areas
    required for the preservation of plant and animal life, such as habitat for fish and wildlife
    species; areas required for ecologic and other scientific study purposes; rivers, streams, and
    creeks, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams; and watershed lands. In Porterville, this
    category includes lands such as those in the valley-foothill riparian habitat, ecological
    preserves, and conservation areas.
•   Open space used for the managed production of resources, including, but not limited to,
    forest lands, rangeland, agricultural lands and areas of economic importance for the
    production of food or fiber; areas required for recharge of ground water basins; marshes,
    rivers and streams that are important for the management of commercial fisheries; and
    areas containing major mineral deposits. In Porterville, this category includes prime
    farmland, farmland of statewide importance, and mineral resource zones.
•   Open space for outdoor recreation, including, but not limited to, areas of outstanding
    scenic, historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation
    purposes, such as access to lakeshores, beaches, rivers and streams; and areas that serve as
    links between major recreation and open space reservations, including utility easements,
    banks of rivers and streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors. In Porterville, this
    category includes areas such as the Tule River Parkway, the Rails-to-Trails bike and
    pedestrian trail, plus existing and proposed parks. Over the long-term, Rocky Hill will
    also provide opportunities for limited outdoor activities, such as hiking and horseback
    riding.
•   Open space for the protection of Native American sites, including, but not limited to,
    places, features and objects of historic, cultural, or sacred significance such as Native
    American sanctified cemeteries, places of worship, religious or ceremonial sites, or sacred
    shrines located on public property (further defined in California Public Resources Code
    Sections 5097.9 and 5097.993). These sites are not included on Figure 6-1, as locations
    are suppressed for their protection.
•   Open space to shape and limit urban form, including, but not limited to, areas such as
    greenbelts and open space corridors established to implement community design goals and
    objectives. In some areas of Porterville, this category includes land designated as Rural
    Residential, as well as open space in other categories.
                                                                                                    113

Porterville General Plan
PLANNED OPEN SPACE NETWORK
Figure 6-1 illustrates a composite of the open space classifications established in State law,
with the addition of the land categorized as Rural Residential in order to shape the urban
form. The illustrated open space resources are not intended to imply that the public interest
would be best served by prohibiting development on all such lands. Rather, these open space
resources likely signify one of three possible scenarios, depending upon the ecosystem fragility,
location, hazard potential, regulatory constraints, and other pertinent factors.
The three possible scenarios are:
•    All development should be prohibited;
•    Development should be permitted on part of the land and the balance preserved as open
     space—a clustering concept; or
•    Development should be permitted subject to site plan review and the imposition of specific
     conditions to protect against hazards, preserve the integrity of the land and the
     environment, and meet specific development and design standards (e.g., for the Hillside
     Development Zone).
Determination of how these open space resources are to be protected will be made on a case-
by-case basis following standards and review procedures established in the Zoning and
Subdivision ordinances consistent with General Plan policies.
Resort Residential Community near Lake Success
Integrating the Lake Success Resort Residential area with the open space network is a very
high priority for future planning efforts. The physical designs of the park and open space
systems for the Resort Residential Community should create a unique image and recreational
space. This includes the connectivity to the Rocky Hill area, its trails, and its other
recreational amenities.
GUIDING POLICIES
OSC-G-1             Protect the Tule River Corridor and Rocky Hill as significant open space
                    resources.
OSC-G-2             Use the open space system to meet multiple needs, including bike and trail
                    linkages, storm water drainage and treatment, wildlife habitat, and active and
                    passive recreation.
OSC-G-3             Design public open spaces as sustainable systems.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
OSC-I-1             Adopt resource protection regulations for Agricultural/Rural/Conservation
                    areas designated on the General Plan Land Use Diagram.
                    This will include City-owned lands used for wastewater reclamation.

                                                    Chapter 6: Open Space & Conservation Element
OSC-I-2  Work with the County with the objective of:
         •   Retaining agriculture and open space areas around the City, consistent with
             the General Plan; and
         •   Notifying the City of development applications to areas adjacent to the
             City’s Planning Area.
         Joint planning agreements or Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) have
         been used successfully in many jurisdictions. This policy is intended to create a
         mechanism to protect the open space, wetlands, and creeks that form the
         backdrop for the City, so that the City can keep a distinct urban edge.
OSC-I-3  Establish a secure funding source for open space acquisition and management.
         Options to be evaluated may include, but are not limited to: a dedication by
         future private development; an increase in the Transient Occupancy Tax; a
         Utility User’s Tax or a Property Transfer Tax. These latter options would
         require voter approval.
OSC-I-4  Establish standards for the management and maintenance of open space within
         subdivisions, and require formation of open space acquisition and maintenance
         districts where necessary and appropriate, to protect open space resources.
OSC-I-5  Require, as a condition of any Resort Residential development, commitments
         to permanent open space, and preservation of ridges and steep hillside land
         that form the scenic backdrop of the Resort Residential district.
OSC-I-6  Support the preservation of the Yaudanchi Ecological Preserve.
OSC-I-7  Use native vegetation, drought tolerant plants, recycled water irrigation, other
         water-saving devices drainage swales and water percolation systems, and
         recycled building materials in public open spaces for ease of maintenance and
         environmental sustainability.
OSC-I-8  Provide a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities through improvements to
         open space and parks, construction of facilities, and sponsoring of programs
         that stimulate active resident participation.
OSC-I-9  Require degraded open space areas be restored to an environmentally
         sustainable condition as part of development approval where these lands are
         proposed as permanent open space in new development.
OSC-I-10 Work with property owners, law enforcement officials, and the public to
         protect open space resources. These efforts will include, but are not limited to:
         •   Soliciting volunteers to remove invasive vegetation;
         •   Removing abandoned items and trash; and
         •   Ensuring no illegal encampments occur on open space areas.
                                                                                             115

Porterville General Plan
OSC-I-11            Support regional and subregional efforts to acquire, develop, and maintain,
                    open space lands.
OSC-I-12            Establish priorities for open space preservation and acquisition based on an
                    evaluation of:
                    •    Significant natural areas that are historically, ecologically, or scientifically
                         unique or are outstanding, important or threatened;
                    •    Wildlife habitats and fragile ecosystems in need of protection;
                    •    Watersheds or significant water recharge areas;
                    •    Lands suitable for recreation such as biking, photography or nature study;
                         and
                    •    Land suitable for agricultural production.
OSC-I-13            Preserve Rocky Hill as an open space resource through the establishment of a
                    conservancy, Open Space District, or other device.
OSC-I-14            Establish incentives to preserve open space in very low density residential areas.
                    One option will be to allow clustering of housing units on smaller lots in return
                    for preservation of common area open space.
OSC-I-15            Preserve open space designated for public safety to minimize damage to people
                    and property resulting from potential hazards. Such hazards include, but are
                    not limited to: quaking, slope collapse, liquefaction, fire, earth sliding,
                    flooding, erosion and siltation, soil compression, lateral spreading, and
                    subsidence.
                    An easement can be used to restrict development near safety hazards, travel
                    networks such as bike or pedestrian paths, as well as near natural resources
                    such as streams that require buffers for water quality protection. The easement
                    does not require the transfer of ownership of property but rather reduces the
                    development potential of the land in order that it may continue to serve the
                    necessary open space purpose.

6.2     AGRICULTURE & FARMLAND RESOURCES
Agriculture is one of the most prominent open
space uses in the Porterville Planning Area.
Agriculture also is an important contributor
to the City’s economy and character.
California law requires that a General Plan
address agricultural resources from both a soil
conservation and open space perspective.
FARMLAND
Farmland across the state has been classified
by the California Department of Conservation
with respect to its potential for agricultural
productivity based on soil type and other           Grazing land near Lake Success
physical characteristics. The State applies
seven farmland categories:
•   Prime Farmland. Land with the best combination of physical and chemical features able
    to sustain long-term agricultural production.
•   Farmland of Statewide Importance. Similar to Prime Farmland but with minor
    shortcomings, such as greater slopes or decreased ability to store soil moisture.
•   Unique Farmland. Land with lesser quality soils used for the production of the state’s
    leading agricultural crops.
•   Farmland of Local Importance. Land of importance to the local agricultural economy as
    determined by each county’s board of supervisors and local advisory committee.
•   Grazing Land. Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of livestock.
•   Urban and Built-up Land. Land occupied by structures with a building density of at least
    one unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately six structures to a 10-acre parcel.
•   Other Land. Low-density rural developments; brush, timber, wetland, and riparian areas
    not suitable for livestock grazing; confined livestock, poultry or aquaculture facilities; strip
    mines, borrow pits; and water bodies smaller than forty acres. Vacant and nonagricultural
    land surrounded on all sides by urban development and greater than 40 acres.
In 2006, farmland, as defined by the State soil categories, accounted for approximately 56
percent of the Planning Area. The remaining 44 percent of the Planning Area is designated as
either urban and built-up, water resources, or other types of soils.
                                                                                                    117

Williamson Act
The California Land Conservation Act, commonly referred to as the Williamson Act, was
enacted in 1965 to preserve agricultural and open space land in danger of premature
conversion to urban uses. Its success has been based on the dual incentives of lowered
property taxes for individual landowners and payments of subventions to counties for some of
the losses of property tax revenues. Currently, approximately 35 percent of the farmland is
designated as Williamson Act land.
FARMLAND PROTECTION ISSUES
Significant agricultural land area within the Porterville Planning Area is likely to be converted
to urban uses over the next 23 years, in order to accommodate the projected growth. At
buildout, 70 percent of the Planning Area will be either urban, water resources or other soil
types, and 30 percent will be in agricultural use. Farmland soils at buildout are illustrated on
Figure 6-2.

Continued conversion of agricultural lands to urban uses and rural residential uses could have
an impact on the County’s agricultural economic base. For that reason, the Land Use Element
establishes a fairly compact urban area, encouraging infill development and new growth
adjacent to or near existing urban uses, thus minimizing sprawl and unnecessary conversion of
agricultural lands. The Open Space and Conservation Action Plan also calls for protection of
surrounding agricultural lands.
GUIDING POLICY
OSC-G-4         Promote preservation of agriculture lands within and adjacent to the Planning
                Area.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
OSC-I-16        Decline requests for annexation of any land subject to an ongoing Williamson
                Act contract.
OSC-I-17        Prohibit the conversion of prime agricultural land for urban development
                through General Plan amendments, after adoption of this General Plan Update,
                unless there are no other feasible alternatives for development.
OSC-I-18        Adopt a Right to Farm Ordinance to facilitate the continuance of agricultural
                activities within the Planning Area until the land is needed to accommodate
                population and employment growth.
                A Right to Farm ordinance will require developers adjacent to sites where
                agricultural uses are being conducted to inform subsequent buyers of potential
                continued agricultural production and the lawful use of agricultural chemicals,
                including pesticides and fertilizers.
OSC-I-19        Work with the County Sheriff and other law enforcement agencies to combat
                vandalism of agricultural activities.
OSC-I-20        Work with Tulare County and non-profit land trusts to establish and fund
                programs for purchase of conservation easements, which may assist property
                owners who want to maintain agricultural and rural land in the Planning Area.

SOILS
The City of Porterville sits on top of the alluvial fans of the Tule River and its distributaries.
The bedrock is present at relatively shallow depths beneath the eastern end of Porterville.
However, the depth to bedrock deepens appreciably to the southwest. There are four general
soil types in the Planning Area. The first is located northeast of the City and is described as
moderately deep to very deep, well-drained, low permeability clay. The second is located to
the south of the City and consists of very deep, moderately well to excessively well-drained,
fine sandy loam. The third, found northwest of the City, is characterized as moderately deep,
well-drained, sandy loam underlain by hardpan. The fourth type consists of rock outcrops of
exposed bedrock found on the slopes of the Sierra Foothills.
                                                                                                    121

Porterville General Plan
Conservation efforts are continually being made to prevent soil erosion and the chemical
alteration of soils caused by overuse, salinization, acidification, or other chemical soil
contamination. It is important to maintain soil quality to sustain plant and animal
productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human health and
habitation. While State and federal laws regulate soil quality, as indicated by the farmland
classification system, local land use planning is important for limiting erosion potential.
Erosion Potential
Erosion is the process by which the soil and rock components of the Earth’s crust are worn
away and removed from one place to another by natural forces such as weathering, solution,
and transportation. Soil erosion can lead to sedimentation of watercourses, eventually having
an adverse impact on water quality and aquatic life. Furthermore, once erosion occurs, it may
be difficult for natural vegetation to reestablish itself. The loss of topsoil to erosion is
detrimental to agriculture and other landscaping. The risk of erosion is greatly increased
during grading and construction activities, and agricultural practices, when soils are loosened
and bare of vegetation.
Soil erodibility can be identified by a specific soil’s “K-Factor.” 5 Values of K range from 0.02
to 0.69, with the higher the value, the more susceptible the soil is to erosion. Soils with K
factors above 0.40 are considered to be the most susceptible to erosion. However, this factor is
only one of the measurements needed to determine overall soil erosion potential. It does not
take the impacts of rainfall, slope above nine percent and groundcover on erosion potential
into account.
There are no soils with a K factor higher than 0.37, as determined by the U.S. Natural
Resource Conservation Service, in the Planning Area. Soils with moderate or moderate-high
erodibility are found throughout the Planning Area. In general, soil conservation is addressed
by the City’s site review and grading plan requirements. Soil erosion potential is mapped in
Figure 7-1, Geologic Hazards, and the acreage of land in each category is summarized in Table
6-3.

MINERAL RESOURCES
The most economically significant mineral resources in Tulare County are sand, gravel, and
crushed stone, used as sources for aggregate (road materials and other construction). The two
major sources of aggregate are alluvial deposits (river beds and floodplains), and hard rock
quarries. Consequently, most Tulare County mines are located along rivers at the base of the
Sierra foothills.
Surface mining in California is regulated through the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act
(SMARA), a State law adopted in 1975 to address the dual goals of protecting the state’s need
for a continuing supply of mineral resources, while protecting public and environmental
health. SMARA mandates that land be reclaimed after mining has ceased. Reclamation plans
often restore land for agricultural uses or as wildlife habitat.
SMARA requires that all cities incorporate into their general plans mapped mineral resource
designations approved by the State Mining and Geology Board. The State Geologist classifies
land in California based on availability of mineral resources. Because available aggregate
construction material is limited, five designations have been established for the classification of
sand, gravel and crushed rock resources:
•   Scientific Resource (SZ) areas contain unique or rare occurrences of rocks, minerals or
    fossils that are of outstanding scientific significance.
•   Mineral Resource Zone 1 (MRZ-1) is an area where adequate information indicates that
    no significant mineral deposits are present or likely to be present. This zone is applied
    where well developed lines of reasoning, based on economic-geologic principles and
    adequate data, indicate that the likelihood for occurrence of significant mineral deposits is
    nil or slight.
•   Mineral Resource Zone 2 (MRZ-2) is an area where adequate information indicates that
    significant mineral deposits are present or there is a high likelihood for their presence and
    development should be controlled.
    -   MRZ-2a: Areas classified MRZ-2a contain discovered mineral deposits that are either
        measured or indicated reserves as determined by such evidence as drilling records,
        sample analysis, surface exposure, and mine information. Land included in the MRZ-
        2a category is of prime importance because it contains known economic mineral
        deposits.
    -   MRZ-2b: Areas classified MRZ-2b contain discovered deposits that are either inferred
        reserves or deposits that are presently sub-economic as determined by limited sample
        analysis, exposure, and past mining history.
•   Mineral Resource Zone 3 (MRZ-3) is an area where the significance of mineral deposits
    cannot be determined from the available data.
    -   MRZ-3a: MRZ-3a areas are considered to have a moderate potential for the discovery
        of economic mineral deposits due to direct evidence of a surface exposure of a geologic
        unit, such as a limestone body, known to be or to contain a mineral resource elsewhere
        but has not been sampled or tested at the current location.
    -   MRZ-3b: Land classified MRZ-3b represents areas in geologic settings which appear
        to be favorable environments for the occurrence of specific mineral deposits. MRZ-3b
                                                                                                      123

Porterville General Plan
           is applied to land where geologic evidence leads to the conclusion that it is plausible
           that economic mineral deposits are present.
•    Mineral Resource Zone 4 (MRZ-4) is an area where there is insufficient data to assign any
     other MRZ designation. 6

As shown in Table 6-4 and Figure 6-3, the area along the Tule River contains various State-
classified mineral resource zones (MRZ-2a, MRZ-2b, and MRZ-3a). While this area was once
suitable for mining operations, it is now surrounded by urban development and as such,
extraction and transport of mineral resources would conflict with the surrounding urban uses.
A total of 890 acres within the Planning Area is located within State-designated mineral
resource zones.
In Tulare County, the Resource Management Agency is the lead agency for processing Tulare
County surface mine reclamation plan applications. 7
The City is responsible for designating Regionally Significant Construction Aggregate
Resource Areas or identifying mineral resources to be conserved. Historically, the quarrying of
magnesite was a significant industry in the City of Porterville. As of 2004, there were three
active construction-grade sand and gravel mining sites in the Planning Area: Porterville Ready
Mix’s Vollmer site near where the Tule River meets the Friant-Kern Canal and two Mitch
Brown sites along the Tule River below Success Dam. In addition to these known
concentrations, there are areas scattered throughout the Planning Area that contain marginal
deposits of feldspar, silica, limestone and other rock products which are not mapped.

Porterville General Plan
GUIDING POLICIES
OSC-G-5             Preserve soil resources to minimize damage to people, property, and the
                    environment resulting from potential hazards.
OSC-G-6             Protect significant mineral resources.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
OSC-I-21            Adopt soil conservation regulations to reduce erosion caused by overgrazing,
                    plowing, mining, new roadways and paths, construction, and off-road vehicles.
OSC-I-22            Continue to require soils and geologic surveys for all proposed development in
                    hillside areas.
OSC-I-23            Require adequate grading and replanting to minimize erosion and prevent
                    slippage of manmade slopes.
                    Plant materials for re-vegetation should not be limited to hydro seeding and
                    mulching with annual grasses. Trees add structure to the soil and take up
                    moisture while adding color and diversity.
OSC-I-24            Require all mining and sand extraction operations to mitigate completely
                    environmental impacts, including operations affecting water quality, habitat
                    preservation, aesthetics and bridge undermining, and to submit reclamation
                    and ultimate use plans for City approval prior to initiating operations.
OSC-I-25            Work with Tulare County to ensure that reclamation and ultimate use plans
                    for mining operations land are consistent with the General Plan.

6.4      BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The City of Porterville Planning Area lies in two primary eco-regions: the larger
Sacramento/San Joaquin Valley (larger western portion of the study area) and the Sierra
Nevada Foothills (located near the eastern boundary). Consequently, the Planning Area
includes a variety of biological habitats ranging from vernal pools/wetland communities to
blue oak woodlands. Both larger eco-regions traverse the study area in a north-south pattern
and include a variety of plant and wildlife species. Numerous special status species occur in
the Planning Area. These species are designated by federal or State agencies as needing
protection due to rarity or threats to their existence.
FLORA
The Sacramento/San Joaquin Valley eco-region includes large agricultural areas, croplands,
orchards, and vineyard habitat types. Vernal pools, including Northern claypan vernal pools,
can be found in and beyond the southern portion of the Planning Area, particularly along the
SR 65 corridor. Seasonal wetlands may occur adjacent to the Tule River, Porter Slough, and
Lake Success. Isolated wetlands also may be found within pasture, grazing or grassland areas.
The Sierra Nevada Foothill eco-region is largely composed of annual grassland areas, with
areas of montane hardwood located in the higher elevations. Areas of valley-foothill riparian
habitat are located in less developed areas around the river and enhance the aquatic habitat of
the Tule River.
Valley Oak trees, which have inherent aesthetic and wildlife value, occur in the Planning Area.
The City of Porterville does not currently have a tree preservation ordinance; therefore,
policies aimed to protect these trees whenever possible are included in the General Plan.
As illustrated in Figure 6-4, portions of the Planning Area provide potential and known
habitat for several special status plant species. These species include: Keck’s checkerbloom
(Sidalcea keckii); Springville clarkia (Clarkia springvillensis); San Joaquin adobe sunburst
(Pseudobahia peirsonii); Striped adobe-lily (Fritillaria striata); Madera leptosiphon
(Leptosiphon serrulatus); Calico monkeyflower (Mimulus pictus); and Spiny-sepaled button-
celery (Eryngium spinosepalum). In addition, elderberry shrubs which support the special
status species, Valley elderberry longhorn beetle, are known to occur in various areas
throughout the Planning Area.
Lewis Hill Preserve
Lewis Hill Preserve was established in 1994 and is now managed by the Sequoia Riverlands
Trust. It is a 110-acre preserve located in the northern portion of the Planning Area which
protects two rare wildflower species, the striped adobe lily and San Joaquin adobe sunburst.
The open grasslands and blue oak woodlands of the southern Sierra Nevada foothills provide
critical habitat for these flowers. 8

FAUNA
The Planning Area provides appropriate habitats for a variety of wildlife species including but
not limited to mule deer, coyotes, grey fox, cottontails, kangaroo rats, scrub jays, herons,
falcons, finches, and sparrows.
As illustrated in Figure 6-4, the Planning Area
provides known or high potential habitat for
various State and federal special status animal
species. These species include: California
condor (Gymnogyps californianus); San
Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica);
Valley         elderberry           longhorn        beetle
(Desmocerus californicus dimorphus); Vernal
pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi);
American badger (Taxidea taxus), Pallid bat
(Antrozous pallidus); Western mastiff bat
(Eumops perotis californicus); Great Blue
Heron (Ardea herodias); Western pond turtle
(Emys marmorata); Tricolored blackbird                          San Joaquin kit fox
(Agelaius tricolor); Morrison’s blister beetle
(Lytta morrisoni); and Molestan blister beetle
(Lytta molesta). 9
In addition, there is potential for a few protected species such as the White-tailed kite (Elanus
leucurus) to be found in the Planning Area. 10
Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle Habitat Conservation Plan
The City is preparing a Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP),
in coordination with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), in order to take a
comprehensive approach to impact analysis and mitigation, and to apply for an Incidental
Take Permit (ITP) for any Valley elderberry longhorn beetle (VELB) that may result from
project activities. The ITP term would be for a period of 25 years. A 7.3-acre Conservation
Area has already been established and will be protected in perpetuity. This area can be
expanded up to approximately 55 acres. 11

 Yaudanchi Ecological Preserve
The 190-acre Yaudanchi Ecological Preserve was
established in 1975 to protect a heron and egret rookery.
The preserve is owned by the California Department of
Developmental Services (DDS) and managed by the
Department of Fish and Game (DFG). Even though the
rookery has since moved about a mile from the preserve, 12
natural riparian and manmade habitat (a small pond)
supports many species including songbirds, raptors, water
fowl, bobcats, gray fox and coyote. DFG maintains a small
parking lot and nature trail for visitors. DFG has recently
partnered with Wild Places, an ecological restoration and
education organization, to restore native habitat and
remove invasive tree species. This work plus new signage
and additional trail maintenance is planned to be
completed by 2008.

Development Affecting Biological Resources
Under General Plan policies, any hillside residential, Resort Residential, or Tule River
Corridor development would have to ensure minimal disruption/loss of habitat that could
support special status animal species. Natural Communities Conservation Plans (NCCP) will
be required for development that would potentially affect sensitive habitat. The Natural
Communities Conservation Planning Act allows a process for developing NCCPs under DFG
direction. NCCPs provide regional protection of wildlife diversity, while allowing compatible
development.
GUIDING POLICY
OSC-G-7              Protect habitat for special status species, designated under State and federal
                     law.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
OSC-I-26             Adopt habitat conservation regulations, including requirements and incentives
                     to incorporate natural wildlife habitat features into new development and
                     public landscapes, parks, and other public facilities.
                     The regulations will require adequate mitigation measures (e.g., selective
                     preservation, replanting, sensitive site planning, etc.) for all development that
                     will adversely impact significant biological resources, consistent with State and
                     federal law.

Porterville General Plan
OSC-I-28            Require protection of sensitive habitat areas and special status species in new
                    development site designs in the following order: 1) avoidance; 2) onsite
                    mitigation, 3) offsite mitigation, and 4) purchase of mitigation credits.
OSC-I-29            Require assessments of biological resources prior to approval of any
                    development within 300 feet of any creeks, sensitive habitat areas, or areas of
                    potential sensitive status species.
                    The term “special status” species includes species classified as rare and
                    endangered. These priorities are consistent with the California Department of
                    Fish and Game guidelines. When habitat preservation on-site is not feasible
                    (i.e., preserved parcels would be too small to be of any value), then off-site
                    mitigation should occur.
OSC-I-30            Adopt regulations to promote water-conserving landscape plans, including the
                    use of drought tolerant plants.
OSC-I-31            Require, as part of the proposed Tule River Corridor Plan, measures to protect
                    and enhance riparian zones, natural areas and wildlife habitat qualities; and
                    establish and maintain a buffer along the river where development shall not
                    occur, except as part of the parkway enhancement (e.g., trails and bikeways).
                    For park improvements and commercial recreation (campground) proposals,
                    the City will require a buffer zone along the river in which no grading or
                    construction activities will occur, except as needed for shoreline uses.
OSC-I-32            Identify and protect wildlife movement corridors that serve critical habitats to
                    minimize wildlife-urban conflicts.
OSC-I-33            Protect, revitalize and expand Porterville’s urban forest through public
                    education, sensitive regulation, and a long-term financial commitment that is
                    adequate to protect this resource.
OSC-I-34            Continue to require street tree planting in new development and support the
                    City’s tree planting fund.
OSC-I-35            Consult with all responsible agencies about wetland and vernal pool habitat
                    potentially affected by development.
                    This consultation will occur as part of the environmental review process.
OSC-I-36            Establish a “no net loss” policy for wetlands and vernal pools, including credits
                    for land banking and off-site mitigation, and maintain a protection zone
                    around wetlands, riparian corridors, and identified habit areas where
                    development shall not occur, except as part of a parkway enhancement
                    program (e.g., trails and bikeways).
                    Protection zones will be determined on case-by-case based on biological studies
                    and field assessment.

6.5      WATER RESOURCES
This section addresses surface and groundwater resources. Water quality standards are
established and enforced by the State and the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control
Board (RWQCB). Water supply, use, and conservation measures are addressed in Public
Utilities Element and the Porterville Urban Water Management Plan. Drainage and flooding
hazards in Porterville are addressed in Public Health & Safety Element.
SURFACE WATER
Hydrologic Features & Supply
The Tule River, which flows through the central portion of the Planning, is one of the
principal watercourses in Tulare County. Under normal conditions discharge in this River is
regulated by Success Dam, located approximately five miles upstream from Porterville. Porter
Slough is a natural distributary of the Tule River and flows through the center of Porterville. It
originates from the Tule River approximately four miles upstream from the City, and returns
to the river approximately 17 miles below its point of origin.
Seven ditch companies divert water from the Tule River and/or Porter Slough at points within
the Planning Area: Pioneer, Campbell-Moreland, Porter Slough, Vandalia, Poplar, Hubbs-
Miner, and Woods-Central. In addition to delivering water for irrigation, these ditches also
provide extra capacity to carry peak flood flows and urban stormwater runoff. The Friant-
Kern Canal defines the western edge of the Planning Area. Water in the Canal is imported
from the San Joaquin River northeast of Fresno and distributed to the western portion of the
Planning Area by the Porterville Irrigation District.
The City is considering purchasing additional surface water from local irrigation and water
districts which have water rights on the San Joaquin River and Tule River.
Surface Water Quality
Both San Joaquin and Tule Rivers water sources originate primarily from snowmelt in the
Sierra Nevada Mountains and as a result have good to excellent water quality. These water
supplies have no restrictions on use for municipal water, but they will require standard water
treatment.
Tule River water is delivered from Lake Success. According to the Lower Tule River Irrigation
District, the Lake periodically experiences turnover episodes which have caused hydrogen
sulfide problems. These turnovers take place in the spring and fall. In the summer and fall, the
lake experiences algae growth problems. These problems can be remedied with water
treatment.
Additional development in watershed areas may cause some water quality degradation in the
San Joaquin and Tule Rivers. However, improved watershed management may prevent further
degradation or even improve the water quality. As a result, it is assumed that the quality of
these surface water sources will remain good to excellent through the next 25 years.
                                                                                                   133
Porterville General Plan
GROUNDWATER
Groundwater Resources
The Porterville area is part of the Tule Sub-basin of the San Joaquin Valley Groundwater
Basin. The area is underlain by an unconfined aquifer which receives groundwater recharge
from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and seepage from the Tule River and irrigation ditches.
The alluvial fans of the Tule River provide highly permeable areas in which groundwater is
readily replenished. Annual rainfall in Porterville usually ranges from eight to 12 inches;
however, there is no estimate of what percentage of rainfall reaches the groundwater supply.
Groundwater levels have declined an average of 0.75 feet/year on well hydrographs completed
by the Department of Water Resources. In addition, well yields have decreased substantially in
the past 10 years. Some City wells have seen capacity reductions from 1,500 gallons per
minute (gpm) to 500 or 600 gpm. New wells typically have capacities of 500 gpm or less.
Groundwater Quality
Groundwater quality in the Porterville area is generally good. Groundwater quality and
quantity is generally better on the western edge of town, and hence most of the production
wells are placed in this area. A few wells have been shut down due to water quality problems.
Wells adjacent to Porter Slough have been closed due to percloroethylene (PCE)
contamination, and a few wells in the downtown area and eastern portion of town have
experienced nitrate problems. In addition, wells in the eastern part of town have nitrate
problems (originating from citrus orchards). All active wells produce water that meets State
and federal drinking water quality standards. The City does not presently provide treatment
for any well water.
Groundwater Management
The Deer Creek and Tule River Authority (DCTRA) is a joint powers authority comprised of
five local irrigation districts in the vicinity of Porterville. The DCTRA adopted a new
Groundwater Management Plan (GMP) in the summer of 2006. The City may consider
becoming a partial or full member of the DCTRA and signatory to the GMP, or the City may
develop their own GMP.
GUIDING POLICY
OSC-G-8             Ensure adequate water quality and supply for the entire Porterville community.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
OSC-I-37            Establish watershed protection standards and review procedures in the Zoning
                    Ordinance to protect groundwater resources.
                    These standards may include requirements for water holding areas such as
                    creek beds, recessed athletic fields, ponds, and other features that serve to
                    recharge groundwater, reduce runoff, improve water quality, and decrease
                    flooding.

                                                     Chapter 6: Open Space & Conservation Element
OSC-I-38 Continue to work with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control
         Board (RWQCB) for short- and long-term solutions for excessive salts in the
         groundwater, and maintain a valid RWQCB permit for all wastewater
         treatment operations.
OSC-I-39 Adopt the Regional Water Quality Control Board’s policies on soil disturbance
         activities in order to minimize the disturbance of soil, vegetation, organic
         debris, and other materials that control runoff.
         These policies include:
         •   Planning and conducting operations and activities in a manner that will not
             disturb extensive areas of soil or that will disrupt local drainage;
         •   Promptly reseeding or stabilizing areas where soil is disturbed to prevent
             erosion;
         •   Establishing restrictions on activities in water protection zones, designated
             by the U.S. Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry and
             Fire Protection;
         •   Stabilizing and maintaining the stream flow regimen and apply soil control
             measures in a timely manner;
         •   Prohibiting organic or earthen material from being discharged into any
             streams or placed at locations where they can pass into streams in
             quantities that could impair any beneficial use of the water; and
         •   Regulating operations and activities that cause increased turbidity levels in
             local streams so that streams are not affected for extended periods or for
             more than ten percent of the time and operations and activities shall not
             violate water quality objectives.
OSC-I-40 Support the identification of degraded surface water and groundwater
         resources and promote restoration where appropriate.
         This will be accomplished as part of the groundwater quality and quantity
         monitoring program.
OSC-I-41 Monitor and enforce provisions to control non-point source water pollution,
         including storm water flows, contained in the United States Environmental
         Protection Agency NPDES program as implemented by the Regional Water
         Quality Control Board.
OSC-I-42 Support the collection of monitoring data for facilities or uses that are potential
         sources of groundwater pollution as part of project approvals, including
         residential and industrial development.
OSC-I-43 Work with agricultural and industrial uses to ensure that water contamination
         and waste products are handled in a manner that protects the long-term
         viability of water resources.
                                                                                              135

Porterville General Plan
OSC-I-44            Work with the Regional Water Quality Control Board to ensure that all point
                    source pollutants are adequately mitigated (as part of the CEQA review and
                    project approval process) and monitored to ensure long-term compliance.
                    The City will develop a priority list of businesses that may impact water quality
                    as a result of the services they provide and give recognition to businesses that
                    actively promote activities that reduce or eliminate storm water pollution.
OSC-I-45            Continue to require use of feasible and practical best management practices
                    (BMPs) and other mitigation measures designed to protect surface water and
                    groundwater from the adverse effects of construction activities and urban
                    runoff in coordination with the Regional Water Quality Control Board.
OSC-I-46            Adopt water well standards meeting the requirements of the State with
                    Department of Water Resources.
OSC-I-47            Prepare a Groundwater Management Plan and develop groundwater
                    monitoring programs with federal, State, and local agencies and the private
                    sector to improve local groundwater pollution detection and monitoring.
                    The Plan will be developed in consultation with the Deer Creek and Tule River
                    Authority.
OSC-I-48            Protect groundwater recharge areas by carefully regulating the type of
                    development within these areas.
                    Regulations may include limitations on structural coverage and impervious
                    surfaces and prohibition of uses with the potential to discharge harmful
                    pollutants, increase erosion, or create other impacts degrading water quality.
OSC-I-49            Promote the combined use of recharge areas, public recreation, wetland
                    mitigation programs and/or banking, as part of the City’s open space or
                    recreational trail system to the extent deemed feasible by good engineering or
                    geotechnical practice.
                    Such programs may be jointly or individually managed by the City of
                    Porterville.
OSC-I-50            Do not allow new septic systems within the City unless wastewater collection
                    facilities are unavailable and the applicant agrees to connect when permanent
                    facilities are constructed.
OSC-I-51            Prior to the approval of individual projects, require the City Engineer and/or
                    Building Official to verify that the provisions of applicable point source
                    pollution programs have been satisfied.
OSC-I-52            Establish requirements for appropriate Best Management Practices to be
                    implemented during construction efforts to control the discharge of pollutants,
                    prevent sewage spills, and avoid discharge of sediments into streets, storm-
                    water conveyance channels, or waterways.

                   The use of pervious materials for runoff channels and parking areas shall be
                   encouraged, such as grass or permeable/porous pavement.
OSC-I-53           Require development to retain areas of open space as natural or landscaped to
                   aid in the recharge and retention of runoff.
                   Use of native and/or drought-tolerant plant materials is encouraged in
                   replanting and hydroseeding operations.
OSC-I-54           Support efforts to create additional water storage where needed, in cooperation
                   with federal, State, and local water authorities. Additionally, support and/or
                   engage in water banking in conjunction with these agencies where appropriate.
OSC-I-55           Participate in the development, implementation, and maintenance of a program
                   to institute recharge aquifers underlying the Planning Area. The program shall
                   make use of flood and other waters to offset existing and future groundwater
                   pumping.
OSC-I-56           Incorporate natural drainage systems and groundwater recharge features into
                   developments where appropriate and feasible.
                   These drainage systems and groundwater recharge features shall be reviewed
                   by the City Engineer and/or Building Official prior to the issuance of grading
                   permits.
OSC-I-57           Update the emergency water conservation plan to include appropriate
                   conservation policies that can be implemented during times of water shortages
                   caused by drought, loss of one or more major sources of supply, contamination
                   of one of more sources of supply, or other natural or manmade events.
                   This update will ensure consistency with the City’s Urban Water Management
                   Plan.
6.6       AIR RESOURCES
Porterville is located in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (SJVAB). The Air Quality monitoring
has been conducted in the SJVAB for the last 15 years. While new and innovative pollution
controls has made the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) a leader
in the rate of improvement, the region is not in attainment and the air basin still has poor air
quality. Much of this pollution is attributed to the valley’s topography, meteorology, and
intensive agricultural uses. In 2006, the major sources of air pollution in the San Joaquin
Valley were heavy duty trucks, other mobile sources, autos and light trucks, and fuel
combustion from stationary sources. 13
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) operates a regional network of air pollution
monitoring stations that provide information on ambient concentrations of criteria air
pollutants and toxic air contaminants. In Tulare County, CARB measures certain air
pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and

Porterville General Plan
particulate matter less than ten microns in diameter (PM-10). Data is collected at five active
air quality stations located in Tulare County. The station closest to Porterville is about 20
miles to the northwest in Visalia on North Church Street.
PHYSICAL SETTING & AIR QUALITY
The SJVAB has an inland Mediterranean climate that is characterized by warm, dry summers
and cooler winters. Summer high temperatures often exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (°F),
averaging from the low 90s in the northern part of the valley to the high 90s in the south. The
daily summer temperature variation can be as high as 30 °F. Winters are for the most part
mild and humid. Average high temperatures during the winter are in the 50s, while the
average daily low temperature is approximately 45 °F.
The vertical dispersion of air pollutants in the valley is limited by the presence of persistent
temperature inversions. Air temperatures usually decrease with an increase in altitude. A
reversal of this atmospheric state, where the air temperature increases with height, is termed
an inversion. Air above and below an inversion does not mix because of differences in air
density thereby restricting air pollutant dispersal.
Wind speed and direction play an important role in dispersion and transport of air pollutants.
During summer periods, winds usually originate from the north end of the San Joaquin Valley
and flow in a south-southeasterly direction through the valley, through the Tehachapi Pass
and into the neighboring Southeast Desert Air Basin. In the winter months, winds occasionally
originate from the south end of the valley and flow in a north-northwesterly direction. Also,
during winter months, the valley experiences light, variable winds, less than 10 miles per hour.
Low wind speeds, combined with low inversion layers in the winter, create a climate
conducive to high concentrations of certain air pollutants.
The SJVAB is basically a flat area bordered on the east by the Sierra Nevada Mountains; on
the west by the Coast Ranges; and to the south by the Tehachapi Mountains. Airflow in the
SJVAB is primarily influenced by marine air that enters through the Carquinez Straits where
the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta empties into the San Francisco Bay. The region’s
topographic features restrict air movement through and out of the basin. As a result, the
SJVAB is highly susceptible to pollutant accumulation over time. Frequent transport of
pollutants into the SJVAB from upwind sources also contributes to poor air quality.
AIR QUALITY REGULATORY SYSTEM
Federal and State laws require emission control measures in areas where air pollution exceeds
standards. The San Joaquin Valley is one of these areas. The federal government, primarily
through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the federal Clean Air Act, sets
standards, oversees state and local actions, and implements programs for toxic air pollutants,
heavy-duty trucks, locomotives, ships, aircraft, off-road diesel equipment, and some types of
industrial equipment. Currently, EPA has established national standards for criteria air
pollutants: ozone (O3); carbon monoxide (CO); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); sulfur dioxide (SO2);
suspended particulate matter (PM-10 and PM-2.5); and lead (Pb).
Pursuant to the California Clean Air Act of 1988, the State government, through CARB and
the Bureau of Automotive Repair, set more stringent State standards, oversees local actions,
and implements programs for motor vehicle emissions, fuels, and smog checks.

                                                         Chapter 6: Open Space & Conservation Element
The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) was established in 1991 to
administer local, state, and federal air quality management programs and implement control
measures. The SJVAPCD is responsible for developing attainment plans for the San Joaquin
Valley Air Basin, for inclusion in California’s State Implementation Plan (SIP), as well as
establishing and enforcing air pollution control rules and regulations. The attainment plans
must demonstrate compliance with federal and State ambient air quality standards, and must
first be approved by CARB before inclusion into the SIP. The SJVAPCD regulates, permits,
and inspects stationary sources of air pollution.
SJVAPCD also administers the Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Program which involves reviewing
new stationary sources to ensure compliance with required emission controls and limits,
maintaining an inventory of existing stationary sources of toxic air contaminants, and
developing new rules and regulations to reduce toxic air contaminant emissions.
Local cities and counties are responsible for implementing air friendly community planning
that promotes pedestrian traffic, commute alternatives and cleaner transit fleets. They can also
regulate odors and nuisances and the release of particulate matter at construction sites.
CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS
As required by the Federal Clean Air Act passed in 1977, EPA has identified six criteria air
pollutants that are pervasive in urban environments and for which State and national health-
based ambient air quality standards have been established. EPA identifies these pollutants as
criteria air pollutants because the agency has regulated them by developing specific public
health- and welfare-based criteria as the basis for setting permissible levels. Ozone, carbon
monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), and
lead (Pb) are the six criteria air pollutants.
Ozone (O3)
Ozone is a respiratory irritant and an oxidant that increases susceptibility to respiratory
infections and that can cause substantial damage to vegetation and other materials. Ozone is
not emitted directly into the atmosphere, but is a secondary air pollutant produced in the
atmosphere through a complex series of photochemical reactions involving reactive organic
gases (ROG) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). ROG and NOx are known as precursor compounds
for ozone. Significant ozone production generally requires ozone precursors to be present in a
stable atmosphere with strong sunlight for approximately three hours. Ozone is a regional air
pollutant because it is not emitted directly by sources, but is formed downwind of sources of
ROG and NOx under the influence of wind and sunlight. Ozone concentrations tend to be
higher in the late spring, summer, and fall, when the long sunny days combine with regional
subsidence inversions to create conditions conducive to the formation and accumulation of
secondary photochemical compounds, like ozone. Ground level ozone in conjunction with
suspended particulate matter in the atmosphere leads to hazy conditions generally termed as
“smog.”
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, is a non-reactive pollutant that is a product of
incomplete combustion and is mostly associated with motor vehicle traffic. High carbon
monoxide concentrations develop primarily during winter when periods of light wind combine
                                                                                                  139

with the formation of ground level temperature inversions (typically from the evening through
early morning). These conditions result in reduced dispersion of vehicle emissions. Motor
vehicles also exhibit increased carbon monoxide emission rates at low air temperatures. When
inhaled at high concentrations, carbon monoxide combines with hemoglobin in the blood and
reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This results in reduced oxygen reaching the
brain, heart, and other body tissues. This condition is especially critical for people with
cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease, or anemia.
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
Nitrogen dioxide is an air quality concern because it acts a respiratory irritant and is a
precursor of ozone. Nitrogen dioxide is produced by fuel combustion in motor vehicles,
industrial stationary sources, ships, aircraft, and rail transit.
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
Sulfur dioxide is a combustion product of sulfur or sulfur-containing fuels such as coal and
oil, which are restricted in the San Joaquin Valley. Its health effects include breathing
problems and may cause permanent damage to lungs. SO2 is an ingredient in acid rain, which
can damage trees, lakes and property, and can also reduce visibility.
Particulate Matter (PM)
PM-10 and PM-2.5 consist of particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter and 2.5
microns or less in diameter, respectively. (A micron is one-millionth of a meter). PM-10 and
PM-2.5 represent fractions of particulate matter that can be inhaled into the air passages and
the lungs and can cause adverse health effects. Particulate matter in the atmosphere results
from many kinds of dust- and fume-producing industrial and agricultural operations, fuel
combustion, and atmospheric photochemical reactions. Some sources of particulate matter,
such as demolition and construction activities, are more local in nature, while others, such as
vehicular traffic, have a more regional effect. Very small particles (PM-2.5) of certain
substances (e.g., sulfates and nitrates) can cause lung damage directly, or can contain adsorbed
gases (e.g., chlorides or ammonium) that may be injurious to health. Particulates also can
damage materials and reduce visibility.
PM emissions in the Planning Area are mainly from urban sources, dust suspended by vehicle
traffic and secondary aerosols formed by reactions in the atmosphere. Particulate
concentrations near residential sources generally are higher during the winter, when more
fireplaces are in use and meteorological conditions prevent the dispersion of directly emitted
contaminants.
Lead (Pb)
Leaded gasoline (which is being phased out), paint (houses, cars), and manufacture of lead
storage batteries have been the primary sources of lead released into the atmosphere. Lead has
a range of adverse neurotoxic health effects for which children are at special risk. Some lead-
containing chemicals cause cancer in animals.

AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Regulation of air pollution is achieved through both national and State ambient air quality
standards and emissions limits for individual sources of air pollutants. As required by the
Federal Clean Air Act, the EPA has established National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(national standards) to protect public health and welfare. California has adopted more
stringent ambient air quality standards for most of the criteria air pollutants (referred to as
State Ambient Air Quality Standards or State standards). In addition, California has
established State ambient air quality standards for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride,
and visibility-reducing particles. Because of California’s unique meteorological problems, there
are considerable differences between State and federal standards currently in effect in
California, as shown in Table 6-5. The table also summarizes the related health effects and
principal sources for each pollutant.
The ambient air quality standards are intended to protect the public health and welfare, and
they incorporate an adequate margin of safety. They are designed to protect those segments of
the public most susceptible to respiratory distress, known as sensitive receptors, including
asthmatics, the very young, the elderly, people weak from other illness or disease, or persons
engaged in strenuous work or exercise. Healthy adults can tolerate occasional exposure to air
pollution levels somewhat above the ambient air quality standards before adverse health
effects are observed.

Attainment Status
Under amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the EPA has classified air basins or portions
thereof, as either “attainment” or “nonattainment” for each criteria air pollutant, based on
whether or not the national standards have been achieved. The California Clean Air Act,
which is patterned after the Federal Clean Air Act, also requires areas to be designated as
“attainment” or “nonattainment” for the State standards. Thus, areas in California have two
sets of attainment/nonattainment designations: one set with respect to the national standards
and one set with respect to the State standards.

and State ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants.

TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS
The ambient background of toxic air contaminants (TACs) is the combined result of many
diverse human activities, including emissions from gasoline stations, automobiles, dry cleaners,
industrial operations, hospital sterilizers, and painting operations.
In 1987, the California State legislature enacted, through Assembly Bill 2588, the Air Toxics
Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act, which requires companies in California to provide
information to the public about emissions of toxic air contaminants and their possible impact
on public health. The SJVAPCD implements this act through the local Air Toxics “Hot Spots”
Program. Toxic air contaminants are pollutants that occur at relatively low concentrations
and are associated with carcinogenic and other adverse health effects, but for which no
ambient air quality standards have been established. Impact is measured as “maximum
individual cancer risk” which is the likelihood that a person exposed to concentrations of
                                                                                                                         143

Porterville General Plan
TACs over a lifetime will develop cancer. As of 2005, there were no facilities located in the
Porterville Planning Area identified as a significant risk. 14
The Air Resources Board maintains an inventory of toxic air contaminants concentrations and
their health risks. Total emissions in the year 2003 from stationary sources of TACs in the San
Joaquin Valley included: 1.34 parts per billion (ppb) of acetaldehyde, 0.46 ppb of benzene;
0.10 of ppb of butadiene, 0.10 ppb of carbon tetrachloride, 0.08 ng/m3of chromium, 0.15
ppb of para-dichlorobenzene, 3.02 ppb of formaldehyde, 0.14 ppb of methylene chloride, and
0.03 ppb of perchloroethylene.
The SJVAPCD regulates toxic air contaminants from stationary sources through their permit
process. Mobile sources of toxic air contaminants are regulated indirectly through vehicle
emissions standards or reactive organic gas (ROG) and through fuel specifications. Cities play
a role in reducing public exposure to TACs by enforcing zoning ordinances and ensuring
proper buffer zones between stationary sources that emit toxic contaminants and sensitive
receptors located down wind.
Asbestos
In 1986, CARB identified asbestos as a TAC based on its classification as a known cancer
causing pollutant. In that process, CARB found that no threshold exposure level could be
identified below which adverse health effects would not be expected. Asbestos occurs naturally
in ultramafic rock (which includes serpentine). When this material is used in unpaved
surfacing and disturbed by vehicles and other means, dust containing asbestos can be
generated. Serpentine soils have been identified in Tulare County. Figure 7-2 in the Public
Health & Safety Element shows areas more likely to contain ultramafic rock. Additional
policies addressing asbestos are also in the Public Health & Safety Element.
SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
Some receptors are considered more sensitive than others to air pollutants. The reasons for
greater than average sensitivity include pre-existing health problems, proximity to emissions
source, or duration of exposure to air pollutants. Land uses such as schools, children’s day
care centers, hospitals, and convalescent homes are considered to be more sensitive than the
general public to poor air quality because the population groups associated with these uses
have increased susceptibility to respiratory distress and other air quality-related health
problems. Persons engaged in strenuous work or exercise also have increased sensitivity to
poor air quality. Residential areas are considered more sensitive to air quality conditions than
commercial and industrial areas, because people generally spend longer periods of time at their
residences, resulting in greater exposure to ambient air quality conditions. Recreational uses
are also considered sensitive, due to the greater exposure to ambient air quality conditions,
and because the presence of pollution detracts from the recreational experience.

GUIDING POLICY
OSC-G-9   Improve and protect Porterville’s air quality by making air quality a priority in
          land use and transportation planning and in development review.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
OSC-I-58  Continue to assess air quality impacts through environmental review and
          require developers to implement best management practices to reduce air
          pollutant emissions associated with the construction and operation of
          development projects.
          The City will use the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
          (SJVAPCD) Guidelines for Assessing and Mitigating Air Quality Impacts for
          determining and mitigating project air quality impacts and related thresholds of
          significance for use in environmental documents. The City shall cooperate with
          the SJVAPCD in the review of development proposals.
          BMPs could include transportation demand management strategies for large
          development projects such as:
          •    Providing bicycle access and parking facilities;
          •    Providing preferential parking for high-occupancy vehicles, carpools, or
               alternative fuels vehicles;
          •    Establishing telecommuting programs or satellite work centers;
          •    Allowing alternative work schedules;
          •    Subsidizing public transit costs for employee; and
          •    Scheduling deliveries at off-peak traffic periods.
OSC-I-59  Require preparation of a Health Risk Assessment for any development subject
          to the Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Act.
OSC-I-60  Require dust control measures as a condition of approval for subdivision maps,
          site plans, and all grading permits.
OSC-I-61  Coordinate air quality planning efforts with other local, regional and State
          agencies.
OSC-I-62  Be proactive in educating the public about the linkages between land use,

6.7      ENERGY RESOURCES
The City of Porterville depends on energy to maintain a vital economy and desirable lifestyle.
It uses electricity and natural gas to light, heat, and cool structures and to power its office
equipment, industrial machinery, public services, and home appliances. Porterville also uses
petroleum products to move people and products along its transportation corridors.
By reducing the amount of energy consumed in housing, commercial structures, public
facilities, and transportation and the energy demand per capita plus using more renewable
sources of energy, the environment and public health will be better protected, Porterville’s
standard of living can be increased, and the cost of new infrastructure to deliver energy to the
city will be reduced. Building design standards which recommend better use of materials and
insulation, plus solar-oriented site design reduces demand for natural gas and heating
products. Transportation and land use measures that support transit and facilitate walking
and bicycling reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Together, these steps will lead to a more
sustainable energy future.
In addition to the policies below, land use and circulation policies in this General Plan
contribute to the goals of reducing energy consumption and per capita energy use.
GUIDING POLICY
OSC-G-10         Reduce and conserve energy use in existing and new commercial, industrial,
                 and public structures.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
OSC-I-66         Adopt guidelines and incentives for using green building standards in new
                 construction.
                 Green building design guidelines may include required and recommended
                 “green” design and construction strategies including: Building Site and Form,
                 Natural Heating or Cooling, Transportation, Building Envelope and Space
                 Planning, Building Materials, Water Systems, Electrical Systems, HVAC
                 Systems, Construction Management, and Commissioning.
OSC-I-67         Incorporate cost-effective energy conservation measures into all building
                 programs owned by the City, including construction, operations, and
                 maintenance.
                 Strategies will include conducting periodic energy audits of public buildings.
OSC-I-68         Publish best practices guide to saving energy on the City’s website and other
                 City publications.
OSC-I-69         Establish regulations to allow flexibility in site planning, solar orientation, roof
                 design, and landscaping to decrease summer cooling and winter heating needs.
OSC-I-70         Ensure City codes allow for environmentally acceptable alternative forms of
                 energy production and green building techniques.
                                                                                                      147

Porterville General Plan
6.8        CULTURAL RESOURCES
One of the General Plan initiatives is to protect community assets, including sites with historic,
archeological or paleontological significance. The lands encompassed by the Planning Area
have a long and rich history of human habitation, including primarily the Koyete Indian sub-
tribe, the Yokuts. Archeological evidence of pre-historic cultures has been documented. A
large inventory of historic homes and buildings provide a visual history of the development of
the City from its first modern settlement to today. The existence of both archaeologically
sensitive areas and historic buildings in Porterville underscores the need for policies that
preserve such aspects of the City’s heritage.
Several State laws, most notably the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), protect
archaeological and historical resources. To preserve historic resources, the State has formed
the State Historical Resources Committee that conducts the State Historic Resource Inventory
and maintains the California Register of Historic Resources, which identifies historic
landmarks and points of interest. The Committee also provides recommendations for the
National Register of Historic Places.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
According to the Southern San Joaquin Valley Archaeological Information Center at
California State University, Bakersfield, 45 archaeological sites have been documented within
the Porterville Planning Area. 15 The main village of the Yokuts, Chokowisho, was located
near Murry Hill north of Porter Slough until the mid-1850s. The Rocky Hill area contains
numerous rock art and bedrock mortar sites, not all of which have been officially recorded.
Most are these sites are from the prehistoric era and contain bedrock mortars, rock art (i.e.
petroglyphs, or pictographs), human burials, village complexes, midden 16 , and artifacts (i.e.
projectile points, pestles, pottery, etc). There are no archaeological sites currently listed on the
National Register of Historic Places.
The Yokuts village of Trawoiu (P-54-000313) contained human remains, bedrock mortars,
pictographs, artifacts and extensive midden. Archaeologists considered this to be a very
important site and recommended that it be protected. The site was compromised when the
landowner constructed a dam which inundated the site.
PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Paleontological resources are the mineralized (fossilized) remains of prehistoric plant and
animal life exclusive of human remains or artifacts. Fossil remains such as bones, teeth, shells,
and leaves are found in geologic deposits (rock formations) where they were originally buried.
Fossil remains are considered to be important as they provide indicators of the earth’s
chronology and history. These resources are afforded protection under CEQA and are
considered to be limited and nonrenewable, and they provide invaluable scientific and
educational data.
15
   The Northwest Information Center does not provide maps showing specific locations in order to protect these sites
  from looting.

   A mound or deposit containing shells, animal bones, and other refuse that indicates the site of a human settlement.

                                                                      Chapter 6: Open Space & Conservation Element
The University of California Museum of Paleontology lists 25 localities where fossils have
been found in Tulare County. However, due to the sensitive nature of these sites, they are not
mapped. 17 Identified fossil types in the County include prehistoric mammals, other
vertebrates, invertebrates and plants.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
Many of the historic resources in Porterville, which date back to the days of its founding in the
late 1800s, are located near Downtown. The City’s historic buildings reflect its changing role
through time as a center of agriculture and commercial activities.
In 1986, the City of Porterville conducted a comprehensive inventory of sites and districts with
potential historic significance. This inventory included an assessment of 337 individual
residences and 89 “special” structures and sites, including churches, schools, museums,
government, and commercial properties. The final evaluation process produced an inventory
of 75 sites that may have eligibility for National Register designation. However, these
properties are not currently listed on the National Register. According to the Southern San
Joaquin Valley Archeological Information Center, many more properties have potential to also
be listed in the national and state registries if they were formally evaluated or re-evaluated.
In total, the Porterville Planning Area contains four National Register Sites and two California
Historic Landmarks. Five of the six historic sites are shown in Figure 6-5.
National Register Sites
The Zalud House is listed in the National
Historical Registry of Old Houses and in the
National Register of Historic Places. Built in
1891, its unique Second Empire architecture
and long family residence makes this a
significant local historic resource. It is now a
museum operated by the City’s Department
of Parks and Leisure Services.
The Porterville Main U.S. Post Office, built in
1933, was placed on the National Register in
1995 for its distinctive art deco architecture.
It still functions as a Post Office.
The First Congregational Church, also known                   First Congregational Church (1909)
as the United Church of Christ, was placed on
the National Register in 1999 for architecture
and its role in local social history. It was built
in 1909.
The address for Tenalu or the Walter Richardson House has been restricted. It was added to
the National Register in 1986 because it was designed by Henry Greene of Greene & Greene
Architects in 1929.

California Historic Landmarks
The Tule River Stage Station (California Historic Landmark #473), located at the intersection
of North Main Street and West Henderson Avenue, represents an emigrant trail stopping place
on the bank of the Tule River from 1854 until the river changed its course in 1862. It was a
Butterfield Overland Mail stage station between 1858 and 1861. R. Porter Putnam, who
founded Porterville in 1864, operated the station between 1860 and 1862.
The First Tule River Reservation (California Historic Landmark #388) was originally
established in 1857. The marker is located at the Alta Vista School at 2293 E. Crabtree
Avenue. Native Americans from a widespread area were brought here. The local Native
Americans, the Koyeti Tribe towards the west and the Yandanchi Tribe toward the east, were
branches of the Yokuts Indians that occupied the San Joaquin Valley. The Tule River Indian
Reservation was moved in 1873 to its present location, 10 miles east southeast of Porterville.
Although the current reservation boundaries are located outside the Planning Area, designated
Tribal Land Sites, including numerous bridges, dams, canals, and historic roads, are situated
within the Planning Area.

Porterville General Plan
GUIDING POLICY
OSC-G-11            Identify and protect archaeological, paleontological, and historic resources.
IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
OSC-I-71            Update the City’s inventory of historic resources to determine sites or buildings
                    of federal, State, or local historic significance.
OSC-I-72            Develop an agreement with Native American representatives for consultation
                    in the cases where new development may result in disturbance to Native
                    American sites.
OSC-I-73            Require that new development analyze and avoid any potential impacts to
                    archaeological, paleontological, and historic resources by:
                    •    Requiring a records review for development proposed in areas that are
                         considered archaeologically sensitive, including hillsides and near the Tule
                         River;
                    •    Studying the potential effects of development and construction (as required
                         by CEQA);
                    •    Developing, where appropriate, mitigation measures to minimize potential
                         impacts; and
                    •    Implementing appropriate measures to avoid the identified impacts.
                    In the event that historical or archaeological resources are accidentally
                    discovered during construction, the City will require that grading activity in the
                    immediate area cease. A qualified archaeologist will then be required to make
                    an immediate evaluation and recommend avoidance measures or appropriate
                    mitigation.
