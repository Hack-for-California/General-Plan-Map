Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                         I Introduction
I.      INTRODUCTION
A.      Purpose of the Housing Element
The Housing Element describes the City’s needs, goals, policies, objectives, and programs
regarding the preservation, improvement, and development of housing within Hermosa
Beach. The Element provides an indication of community housing needs in terms of
affordability, availability, adequacy, and accessibility. The Element provides a strategy to
address housing needs and identifies a range of specific housing programs to meet
identified needs.
The Housing Element is an official municipal response to a growing awareness of the
need to provide housing for all economic segments of the community, as well as a legal
requirement for all California jurisdictions. It provides Hermosa Beach with the opportunity
to plan for the existing and future housing needs in the community. This Element has
been prepared in compliance with the 2013-2021 planning cycle for cities within the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) region. It identifies strategies and
programs that focus on: 1) providing diverse housing sites and opportunities;
2) conserving and improving the existing affordable housing stock; 3) removing govern-
mental and other constraints to housing development; and 4) promoting equal housing
opportunities.
B.      Scope and Content of the Housing Element
The California Legislature recognizes the role of local general plans and particularly the
Housing Element in implementing statewide housing goals to provide decent and
adequate housing for all persons. Furthermore, the Legislature stresses continuing efforts
toward providing affordable housing for all income groups. The California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) also sets forth specific requirements
regarding the scope and content of housing elements, including the following major
components:
      •      An analysis of the city’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
             (Technical Report, Chapter I). The key findings from this section include the
             city’s smaller than average typical household size, very low level of
             overcrowding, generally well-maintained housing stock, and high rate of
             small-scale redevelopment of older housing units;
      •      An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to
             address the City’s housing goals (Technical Report, Chapter II). Key findings
             from this section include the city’s lack of vacant land and minimal financial
             resources for housing assistance;
      •      A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental,
             to meeting Hermosa Beach’s housing needs (Technical Report, Chapter III).
             Key findings from this section include no unwarranted regulatory constraints to
             housing production, but very high land cost which makes affordable housing
             production very difficult;
Housing Policy Plan                              I-1                        September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                          I Introduction
      •      The Housing Policy Plan for addressing the City’s identified housing needs,
             including housing goals, policies and programs (Chapter II of this document);
      •      An evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of previous policies
             and programs in achieving the City’s objectives, and the progress in
             implementing Housing Element programs (Technical Report, Appendix A); and
      •      A parcel-specific inventory of vacant and underutilized land (Technical
             Report, Appendix B).
      •      A description of the public participation process during the preparation and
             adoption of the Housing Element (Technical Report, Appendix C).
C.      Public Participation
Public participation is an important component of the planning process, and this update
to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous
opportunities to be involved in the preparation of the element. Public notices of all
meetings and hearings were published in the local newspaper in advance of each
meeting, as well as posted on the City’s website. The draft Housing Element was made
available for review at City Hall and posted on the City’s website prior to public
meetings. The document was also circulated to housing advocates and non-profit
organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons and special needs
groups. After receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the State Housing
and Community Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element was
prepared and made available for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
Appendix C provides a listing of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation
of this Housing Element update, identification of persons and organizations that were
invited to participate, and a summary of issues raised during the process.
D.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
The Housing Element must be consistent with other elements of the General Plan, which
was last updated in 1994. The Housing Element has been prepared within the context of
the other General Plan Elements and is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth
therein. The Housing Element is closely related to development policies contained in the
Land Use Element, which establishes the location, type, and intensity of land uses
throughout the City. The Land Use Element determines the number and type of housing
units that can be constructed in the various land use districts. Areas designated for
commercial and industrial uses create employment opportunities, which in turn, create
demand for housing. The Circulation Element establishes the location and scale of
streets, highways and other transportation routes that provide access to residential
neighborhoods. Because of the requirement for consistency among the various General
Plan elements, any proposed amendment to one element will be evaluated against the
other elements to ensure that no conflicts occur. If necessary to maintain internal
consistency, amendments to other elements of the General Plan will be processed
concurrently with future Housing Element amendments.
Housing Policy Plan                            I-2                          September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                       I Introduction
Government Code Section 65302 requires that the Land Use Element be reviewed
annually for consistency with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and
state Department of Water Resources (DWR) flood hazard maps, and that amendments
to the Safety and Conservation Elements that are required to address flood hazard issues
be adopted upon the first amendment to the Housing Element after January 1, 2009. The
City will comply with these requirements prior to or concurrent with Housing Element
adoption.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water
and sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these
agencies immediately upon adoption.

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                  II Housing Policy Plan
II.     HOUSING POLICY PLAN
A.      Goals, Objectives and Policies
The purpose of the Housing Plan is to identify those policies and programs that will enable
the City to accommodate its housing objectives during the 2013-2021 planning period.
This section consists of the following:
      •      The Introduction to the Housing Plan provides an overview of the components
             that comprise the Housing Plan;
      •      The Housing Policies outlines those policies that serve as the City’s vision
             relative to the conservation of existing housing and the provision of new
             housing;
The Housing Programs describes those programs that will be effective in the
implementation of the aforementioned policies, including specific actions, objectives
and implementation schedule.
B.      Housing Element Policies
This section establishes the City’s housing policy framework. Section 65583(c) of the
California Government Code requires that actions and policies included in the housing
program address five key issue areas. As a result, the policies that have been included in
the City of Hermosa Beach Housing Element respond to the following issue areas:
      •      The manner in which the City will assist in the conservation of existing housing
             resources, including affordable housing;
      •      The City’s strategy in assisting in the development of new housing
             opportunities;
      •      How the City intends to provide adequate sites to achieve a variety and
             diversity of housing types;
      •      How the City proposes to remove governmental constraints that may impact
             the preservation and development of housing; and,
      •      How the City may help to promote equal housing opportunities.
Issue Area No. 1 - Conservation of Existing Housing
As indicated previously, the City’s proximity to the Pacific Ocean and its desirability as a
place to live and vacation has contributed to the high land and housing costs relative to
the surrounding region. The City, nevertheless, has been successful in maintaining its more
affordable housing through the adoption of ordinances and special land use regulations.
The City of Hermosa Beach remains committed to those efforts designed to preserve and
maintain the existing housing resources in the City, including affordable housing.
Housing Policy Plan                           II-1                           September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                     II Housing Policy Plan
This commitment is underscored by the policies listed below.
        Policy 1.1    The City will continue to encourage the maintenance and
                      improvement of the existing housing stock within the local
                      neighborhoods.
        Policy 1.2    The City will assist in the preservation and enhancement of the
                      housing supply available to senior citizens.
        Policy 1.3    The City will work to minimize the conversion of existing lower-cost
                      rental housing in multiple-family developments to condominiums.
        Policy 1.4    The City will promote and encourage the conservation and
                      maintenance of the existing neighborhoods.
        Policy 1.5    The City will investigate potential sources of funding and other
                      incentives that will assist in the preservation and renovation of older
                      housing units.
        Policy 1.6    The City will continue to implement its current code enforcement
                      procedures as a means to ensure the conservation and
                      maintenance of existing housing resources in the City.
Issue Area No. 2 - Development of New Housing Opportunities
The City’s ability to directly fund the construction of affordable housing is constrained
due to budget limitations. In addition, the construction of affordable public housing
within the coastal zone would not represent an efficient expenditure of public money,
given the relatively high land and development costs in the City. As a result, the City
continues to be an active participant in the development of more affordable housing
through the relaxation of land use controls and other incentives. The City of Hermosa
Beach will continue to assist in the development of new housing for all income groups
through the implementation of the policies listed below.
        Policy 2.1    The City will continue to promote the development of a variety of
                      housing types and styles to meet the existing and projected housing
                      needs of all segments of the community.
        Policy 2.2    The City will continue to encourage the development of safe, sound,
                      and decent housing to meet the needs of varying income groups.
        Policy 2.3    The City will continue to implement the land use policy contained in
                      the City’s General Plan, which provides for a wide range of housing
                      types at varying development intensities.
        Policy 2.4    The City will continue to support and promote home ownership in
                      the community.
        Policy 2.5    The City will continue to cooperate with other government agencies,
                      citizen groups, and the private sector, in order to assist in meeting
                      the existing and future demand for housing.
Housing Policy Plan                              II-2                           September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    II Housing Policy Plan
Issue Area No. 3 - Provision of Adequate Sites for New Housing
The majority of the City underwent development during the early 1900s. More intensive
development followed, and this intensification has occurred up to the present time.
There are few vacant parcels of land remaining in the City, and the majority of the
residential construction that has occurred involved the “recycling” of individual
properties. Nevertheless, the City of Hermosa Beach will continue to explore potential
sites for residential development as a means to achieve a variety and diversity of housing
types.
        Policy 3.1     The City will evaluate new development proposals in light of the
                       community's environmental resources and values, the capacity of
                       the public infrastructure to accommodate the projected demand,
                       and the presence of environmental constraints.
        Policy 3.2     The City will continue to evaluate the General Plan and zoning to
                       ensure residential development standards are adequate to serve
                       future development.
        Policy 3.3     The City will continue to review current zoning practices for
                       consistency with the General Plan as a way to facilitate new mixed-
                       use development within or near the commercial districts.
Issue Area No. 4 - Removal of Governmental Constraints
In previous years, the City has been successful in the conservation of housing, especially
affordable housing, through the implementation of land use ordinances and regulations.
A key component of the City’s housing policy is to assist in the development of more
affordable housing with the use of incentives and other measures. The City of Hermosa
Beach will remain committed to the removal of governmental constraints.
        Policy 4.1     The City will continue to abide by the provisions of the Permit
                       Streamlining Act as a means to facilitate the timely review of
                       residential development proposals.
        Policy 4.2     The City will work with prospective developers and property owners
                       to assist in their understanding of the review and development
                       requirements applicable to residential development in the City.
        Policy 4.3     The City will continue its efforts to educate the community regarding
                       the development standards contained in the City of Hermosa Beach
                       Zoning Ordinance.
        Policy 4.4     The City will continue to evaluate its Zoning Ordinance and General
                       Plan and remove governmental constraints related to development
                       standards. These may include, but not be limited to, parking
                       requirements, allowing affordable housing on commercial sites, new
                       standards for mixed-use development, lot consolidation incentives,
                       and senior housing requirements.
Housing Policy Plan                              II-3                          September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    II Housing Policy Plan
Issue Area No. 5 - Equal Housing Opportunities
Federal and State laws prohibit housing discrimination based on an individual’s race,
ethnicity, or religion. Enforcement of fair-housing laws generally occurs through the
courts, though persons being discriminated against often lack the resources to obtain the
necessary legal protections. As a result, alternative means to obtain assistance must be
made available. Towards this end, the City will continue to cooperate with other public
agencies and non-profit organizations providing this assistance.
        Policy 5.1    The City will continue to provide information and referral services to
                      regional agencies that counsel people on fair housing and landlord-
                      tenant issues.
        Policy 5.2    The City will continue to cooperate with the County Housing
                      Authority related to the provision of rental assistance to lower-
                      income households.
        Policy 5.3    The City will continue to cooperate with other cities and agencies in
                      the area in investigating resources available to provide housing for
                      the area's homeless population.
        Policy 5.4    The City will support the expansion of shelter programs with adjacent
                      cities and local private interests for the temporary accommodation
                      of the homeless population.
Issue Area No. 6 – Sustainability Housing Development
The City works to promote sustainability and energy conservation in a number of ways.
The framework for the revised Hermosa Beach General Plan will be an integrated
blueprint for sustainability and a low carbon future. It will provide specific policy direction
and a framework under which City regulations, programs, and projects work in unison to
ensure land use, transportation, and other aspects City operations support sustainable
development and energy conservation goals. Specifically for the residential sector of the
community, the issue of energy conservation can be addressed at several levels:
community-wide land use and transportation planning, building technology in both new
construction and rehabilitation or remodeling of existing structures, and through lifestyle
options. This is further supported by water conservation and sustainable neighborhood
design.
        Policy 6.1    The City will support sustainable residential development through
                      land use planning, building technology and lifestyle options.
The housing programs that will implement these policies are described in Section II.C
below.
C.      Description of Housing Programs
The programs included in this Housing Element focus on those incentives that will
encourage the private sector to construct affordable housing in the City. As indicated in
the Needs Assessment section of the Technical Report, the City’s RHNA allocation calls
Housing Policy Plan                            II-4                            September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    II Housing Policy Plan
for the construction of 2 new housing units during the 2014-2021 period. The City’s main
challenge in accommodating new residential development is its lack of vacant land. As
a result, the vast majority of new housing development must occur through the
“recycling” of older housing units and redevelopment of underutilized parcels. The lack
of available resources, coupled with high land and development costs, will be a
constraint to the development of new affordable housing. As a result, the focus of the
following programs is to identify strategies to assist the private market in the development
of affordable housing. These programs include:
      •      A program that encourages the development of more affordable housing
             through the use of incentives currently required under state law;
      •      Continuation of support for conversion of the Marine Land Mobile Home Park
             to a resident-owned park and maintenance of the City's Mobile Home Park
             Ordinance;
      •      Programs that promote the implementation of those sections of the City’s
             Zoning Ordinance permitting high density, and thus potentially affordable
             residential development in the R-3, R-P and C-1 zoning districts; and
      •      Programs designed to promote the maintenance of the existing housing stock
             and the protection of existing residential neighborhoods from the intrusion of
             incompatible land uses.
1.      Density Bonus
Program Description: In 2004 the state legislature adopted SB 1818, which overhauled
state density bonus law. The new law required cities to grant a density bonus of up to
35% and other incentives for qualifying affordable or senior housing developments. The
City updated the Zoning Ordinance in 2013 in conformance with SB 1818 to encourage
the development of affordable and senior housing. To help inform developers and
contractors of this incentive program, the City will continue to provide brochures at the
public counter and provide information on the City’s web site regarding the Density
Bonus Program.
Timing: Continue to make information available on the density bonus program through
brochures and the City website throughout the planning period.
Funding: City General Fund. No new funding source will be required.
2.      Housing Sites Database
Program Description: The City will ensure that adequate sites are available to
accommodate its new housing need for the 2014-2021 planning period, and continue to
maintain its comprehensive land use database as means to identify suitable sites for new
residential development. This database provides zoning and other information for every
parcel in the City, and includes information regarding underdeveloped and
undeveloped parcels.

The City will make the database available to property owners, investors, and builders at
the Planning Department counter.
Timing: This is an existing program to be continued.
Funding: General Fund.
3.      Mobile Home Conservation
This program provides for the ongoing maintenance and conservation of the Marine
Land Mobile Home Park located at 531 Pier Avenue. The 60-space park provides housing
for extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households. The Hermosa Court
Recreational Vehicle Park with 19 pads at 725 10th Street also provides transitional
housing space for those persons or households in transition from an RV to apartment or
home. The City's MHP Zoning District requires Planning Commission approval in order to
add or delete spaces in the park, which helps to preserve affordability by discouraging
conversion from single- to double-wide spaces. The Mobile Home Park has obtained
state funding to convert to a resident owned park.
This program was implemented with City Council allocation of over $111,000 and
$1,200,000 awarded under the state’s Mobilehome Park Resident Owner Program
(MPROP). The Marineland Community Association, Inc., the resident association, is in
escrow for purchase of the park from the current owners, with closing anticipated in July
2013.
Timing: This program is ongoing.
Funding: General Fund. No new funding source will be required.
4.      Code Enforcement
Program Description: Chapter 8.28 of the Municipal Code provides for the abatement of
nuisance conditions relating to private property. To ensure that this goal is achieved, the
Code Enforcement Program emphasizes the following:
      •      The City actively pursues Municipal Code violations on a complaint basis, with
             particular emphasis being placed on those areas clearly exposed to public
             view;
      •      All necessary steps are taken to ensure that violations are corrected in an
             expeditious and voluntary manner;
      •      Where appropriate, property owners are informed of available assistance
             programs for lower-income persons who may not be able to afford needed
             improvements or corrections; and
      •      The City utilizes misdemeanor criminal prosecution only when attempts to gain
             voluntary compliance have failed.
The Code Enforcement Program is responsible for enforcing those sections of the
Municipal Code related to property maintenance, including zoning, property

maintenance, illegal units, trash container regulations, construction without permits, and
sign regulations. The Code Enforcement Officer assists and makes recommendations to
other City departments, such as conducting inspections of business licenses, home
occupation offenses, and obstructions in public right-of-way.
Timing: This program is in place and will continue through the planning period.
Funding: General Fund. No new funding source will be required.
5.      Affordable Housing Development Outreach and Assistance
Program Description: This program involves the investigation of potential funding sources
and administrative support to assist private and non-profit organizations in the
development and/or provision of affordable housing. The City will investigate the
feasibility of expanding CDBG funding and Section 8 rental vouchers to qualifying
households. The Section 8 program is one of the major sources of housing assistance for
very-low- and extremely-low-income households. If the City is successful in obtaining
increased CDBG funding and/or expanding Section 8 rental vouchers for residents, this
information will be posted in the Community Center, on the City’s website, in handouts
provided in the information kiosk in the City Hall lobby, and in the local library. Brochures
will also be provided to local service clubs including the local “Meals on Wheels”
program, local dial-a-ride service, the local recreation center, and emergency shelters in
the area.
The City will also provide incentives such as priority processing, fee waivers and deferrals,
and modified development standards to projects with low- or moderate-income units,
and will assist in preparing and processing grant applications for affordable housing
projects to support the development of such units. Project sponsors will be encouraged
to include units for extremely-low-income households where feasible. The City in 2010
conferred with a variety of nonprofits to identify specific actions the City can take to
facilitate the development of affordable housing, including to extremely-low-, very-low-
and low-income households.
Timing: Contact nonprofits annually regarding residential development opportunities.
Funding: This program will be financed through the City’s General Fund and grant funds.
No new funding source will be required.
6.      Fair Housing
Program Description: The City provides assistance to local fair housing organizations to
address complaints regarding housing discrimination within the City and to provide
counseling in landlord/tenant disputes. This program includes a referral service in City Hall
whereby a staff person provides materials (e.g., handouts, booklets, pamphlets) to the
public. This information is also available to the public at the library and on the City’s
website.
Timing: This program is ongoing and will continue through the planning period.
Funding: General Fund. No new funding source will be required.

7.      Zoning for Special Needs and Affordable Housing
Program Description: The Zoning Code encourages the provision of housing for persons
with special needs, including regulations and procedures related to group homes,
emergency shelters, transitional/supportive housing and persons with disabilities.
Timing: Continue to monitor changes in state law regarding regulations related to
persons with special needs and affordable housing.
Funding: General Fund. No new funding source will be required.
8. Facilitate Efficient Use of Sites that Allow High-Density Residential Development
Program Description: This program will facilitate affordable housing development on sites
that allow high-density residential development including reducing constraints posed by
small lot sizes.
a. The City will facilitate lot consolidation by:
        •    Assisting affordable housing developers in identifying opportunities for lot
             consolidation using the City’s GIS system and property database;
        •    Continuing to expedite processing for lot consolidations processed
             concurrently with planning entitlements;
        •    Continuing to provide a graduated density bonus for lower-income housing on
             small lots consolidated into a single building site according to the following
             formula:
              Combined Parcel Size          Allowable Base Density*
              Less than 0.50 acre           33 units/acre
              0.50 acre to 0.99 acre        34.7 units/acre (5% increase)
              1.00 acre or more             36.3 units/acre (10% increase)
              *Excluding density bonus
        •    Publicizing the program on the City’s website, at the Planning counter, and by
             notice to affordable housing providers.
b. The City will facilitate affordable housing development by:
        •    Facilitating pre-application meetings;
        •    Implementing incentives under the Density Bonus law;
        •    Reducing on-site property development standards (e.g. reduced setbacks,
             reduced parking standards) for developments with affordable elderly or
             disabled housing units for small projects below the threshold of the Density
             Bonus law;
        •    Allowing deferral or waiver of City fees necessary to make the project cost-
             effective;
        •    Facilitating permit processing so that developers can take advantage of
             funding opportunities;

             biennially notify affordable housing developers of the City’s housing incentives.
Timing: Implementation of these incentives and procedures throughout the planning
period.
Funding: General Fund. No new funding source will be required.
Program 9 – Sustainable Housing Development
Program Description: In 2013 the City embarked on a comprehensive update to the
General Plan. One of the primary themes of the new General Plan will be community

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                       I Housing Needs Assessment
I.      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends,
such as age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size,
household income, and special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g.,
number of units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally,
the City’s projected housing growth needs based on the 2014-2021 Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent available data from the U.S.
Census, the California Department of Finance (DOF), the California Employment
Development Department (EDD), the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) and other relevant sources. Supplemental data were obtained through field
surveys and from the California Department of Finance.
A.      Population Characteristics
        1.     Population Growth Trends
Located 17 miles southwest of Los Angeles at the southern end of Santa Monica Bay, the
1.3-square-mile City of Hermosa Beach was incorporated in 1907. The city grew very
slowly during the 1990s, having grown less than 2% from 1990 to 2000. Most of the growth
that has recently occurred has consisted of density increases on existing parcels, through
demolition and replacement of existing homes. From 2000 to 2012 the city’s population
increased by about 5%, which was partially attributable to an increase in average
household size. This is in contrast with Los Angeles County, which grew by 7.4% between
1990 and 2000, and an additional 3.8% from 2000 to 2012 (see Table I-1 and Figure I-1). As
an essentially built-out city, there continue to be few opportunities for growth, except
through redevelopment/infill on existing parcels.

        2.     Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family types, income levels, and
housing preference. Table I-2 provides a comparison of the city and county population
by age group in 2010. This table shows that the age distribution of the city’s population is
older than Los Angeles County as a whole, with Hermosa Beach’s population having a
median age about two years older than Los Angeles County. An aging population has
implications regarding the type and size of future housing needs, as well as accessibility.

        3.     Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the city differs from the county in that a lower
proportion of city residents are Hispanic/Latino or other racial minorities. Approximately
81% of city residents are non-Hispanic white, contrasted with 28% for the county as a
whole. The percentage of Hispanics residing in the city, at 8%, is significantly lower than
that of the county with 48% Hispanic/Latino. Asians, at 6%, represent the largest non-
Hispanic minority (Table I-3).

B.      Household Characteristics
        1.         Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Hermosa Beach had 9,550 households as reported in the 2010 Census. Table I-4 provides
a comparison of households by type for the city and Los Angeles County as a whole.
Family households in 2010 comprised approximately 42% of all households in the city, 26%
less than the county. Another significant difference in household composition between
the city and county is the number of single person households (38% city vs. 24%county).
Due to these factors, the city’s average household size is also lower than Los Angeles
County as a whole (2.04 persons per household City vs. 2.98 persons per household
county). These statistics suggest that there is less need for large units in Hermosa Beach
than are needed for other areas of the county.

        2.        Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities strive to have an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for
sale in order to accommodate a range of households with varying incomes, family sizes
and composition, and lifestyles. Table I-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-
occupied and renter-occupied units in the city in 2010 as compared to the county as a
whole. This table reveals a higher level of renters in the city, approximately 3 percentage
points higher than the county, which is common for beach communities.

        3.     Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 residents per room. Overcrowded households are usually a
reflection of the lack of affordable housing (see Section D.4 starting on page I-14 below
for a detailed definition of “affordable” housing). Table I-6 summarizes recent
overcrowding data for the City of Hermosa Beach as reported by the Census Bureau.

Based on U.S. Census standards, Hermosa Beach residents live in relatively less crowded
housing conditions than the rest of Los Angeles County. Recent Census data indicate
that there were no overcrowded owner-occupied units and only 0.3% overcrowded
renter-occupied units in Hermosa Beach. In the county, however, 1.4% of the owner-
occupied units and about 18% of renter-occupied units are considered overcrowded.

        4.      Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community – the
ability of residents to afford housing is directly related to household income. According to
recent Census data, the median household income in Hermosa Beach was$99,976, over
80% higher than Los Angeles County.

        5.      Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table I-8 displays recent Census estimates for overpayment by
tenure. According to SCAG, approximately 41% of renter households and 37% of owner
households were overpaying for housing.
Although homeowners enjoy interest and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to
defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For
lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up, resulting in
overcrowding and related problems.

C.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
        1.     Employment
Employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing needs
during this planning period. Table I-9 shows that the city had a workforce of 13,349
persons, or 80% of the working-age population, as reported by recent Census data. This
table also shows that the city’s population has a much higher participation in the
workforce than the county (80% city vs. 65% county).

According to recent Census data, approximately 61% of the city’s working residents were
employed in management and professional occupations (Table I-10). A low percentage
of workers (under 9%) were employed in service related occupations such as waiters,
waitresses and beauticians. Blue collar occupations such as machine operators,
assemblers, farming, transportation, handlers and laborers constituted approximately 6%
of the workforce.

D.       Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined by the Census Bureau as a house,
apartment, mobile home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if
vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters.
         1.        Housing Type and Growth Trends
As of 2012, 51% of the city’s housing stock was comprised of single family units, while
multi-family units comprised 47% of the total. Mobile homes comprised the remaining 1%.
Table I-13 provides a breakdown of the housing stock by type along with growth trends
for the city compared to the county as a whole for the period 2000-2012.

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                           I Housing Needs Assessment
Between 2000 and 2012, single-family homes represented about 39% of all units built in
the city. The number of mobile homes added to the housing stock totaled 135,
outpacing both the number of single family homes (125) and multi-family units (60)
constructed during this period.
        2.     Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by windows and doors
opening and closing.
Table I-14 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Hermosa Beach compared
to Los Angeles County as a whole as reported in recent Census data.

This table shows that 53% of the housing units in Hermosa Beach were constructed prior
to 1970. These findings suggest that there may be a need for maintenance and
rehabilitation, including remediation of lead-based paint, for a large percentage of the
city’s housing stock. However, due to the city’s relatively high household incomes, market
forces would be expected to encourage more private maintenance, rehabilitation, and
lead paint remediation, as compared to lower-income communities.
A 2003 citywide survey of housing conditions categorized units into the following three
groups:
Housing Element Technical Report                               I-12                          September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                              I Housing Needs Assessment
      •      Good - housing unit appears to be well-maintained;
      •      In Need of Minor Repair - unit exhibits need for repair, which may include
             repainting or other limited maintenance; or,
      •      Major Repair - unit is in need of major repairs, which may include, but not be
             limited to, foundations, roofing materials, etc.
The field survey identified a total of just six units in Category 2 and two units in Category 3.
Given the relatively large number of housing units in the City, the housing stock overall
was found to be very well-maintained. Based on the high property values typical in
beach communities it is estimated that the number of housing units in need of repair is
equal to or less than found in the previous survey.
        3.         Vacancy
Housing vacancy rates as reported in the 2010 Census are shown in Table I-15. The table
shows that vacancy rates in the city were relatively low, with a rental vacancy rate of just
2.5% and an owner vacancy rate of only 1%. The rental vacancy rate for the county as a
whole was somewhat higher, at 5.8% for rental units and 1.7% for owner units. A rental
vacancy rate in the 5% range is considered a healthy market condition allowing for
tenant mobility.

         4.         Housing Cost
a.       Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., county) median income (“AMI”):
      •        Extremely-Low (30% or less of AMI),
      •        Very-Low (31-50% of AMI),
      •        Low (51-80% of AMI),
      •        Moderate (81-120% of AMI), and
      •        Above Moderate (over 120% of AMI).
Housing affordability is based on the relationship between household income and
housing expenses. According to HUD and the California Department of Housing and
Community Development, housing is considered “affordable” if the monthly payment is
no more than 30% of a household’s gross income. In some areas, these income limits may
be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table I-16 shows 2012 affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in Los Angeles County by income category. Based on state-adopted standards,
the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is $633, while
the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $1,054. The maximum
affordable rent for low-income households is $1,686, while the maximum for moderate-
income households is $1,944.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the
maximum home purchase prices by income category shown in Table I-16 have been
estimated based on typical conditions.
                                                             Table I-16

b.       For-Sale Housing
Housing sales price statistics reported by DataQuick Information Systems for the calendar
year 2012 1 showed median sales prices of $1,060,000 for single-family homes and
$758,000 for condos in Hermosa Beach. Based on the estimated affordable purchase
prices shown in Table I-16, it is unlikely that any market rate homes or condos would be
affordable to lower- or moderate-income residents. These data illustrate the fact that in
beach communities, very large public subsidies are generally required to reduce sales
prices to a level that is affordable to low- and moderate-income buyers. At a median
condo price of about $750,000, there is a “gap” of $450,000 between the market price
and the maximum price a moderate-income household can afford to pay for a home.
For low-income households, this gap is $500,000.
c.       Rental Housing
Based on a recent rental survey, typical rents for 2-bedroom units in large apartment
complexes range from $2,300 to $3,000 per month. As would be expected in a desirable
beach community in Southern California, when market rents are compared to the
amounts households can afford to pay (Table I-16, page I-14), it is clear that very-low-
and extremely-low-income households have a very difficult time finding housing without
overpaying. At a rent of $2,300 per month, the gap between market rent and affordable
rent at the very-low-income level is at least $1,000 per month, while the gap at the
extremely-low-income level is over $1,700 per month.
E.       Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Hermosa
Beach residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or
other housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing
needs facing each of these groups.
         1.     Persons with Disabilities
The most recent available Census data found that approximately 1,125 people in
Hermosa Beach between the 16 and 64 years of age, or 15% of the working age
population, reported a work-related disability (Table I-17). Of those aged 65 and over,
959 disabilities were reported. Included within these disabilities are persons whose
disability hinders their ability to go outside the home (3.3% of the working age population
and 17.5% of the senior population). Housing opportunities for the handicapped can be
maximized through housing assistance programs and providing universal design features

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability
of an individual that:
    •   Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and
        physical impairments;
    •   Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
    •   Is likely to continue indefinitely;
    •   Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of
        major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning;
        d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic
        self-sufficiency; and
    •   Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
        interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
Housing Element Technical Report                          I-16                                            September 10, 2013

          assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned
          and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities as a separate category of
disability. According to the U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an
accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be defined as
developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally disabled persons can
live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely
disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The
most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where
medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to
an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four
developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Westside Regional
Center (WRC) located in Culver City (http://www.westsiderc.org/) provides services for
people with developmental disabilities in Hermosa Beach. The WRC is a private, non-
profit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of
services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
There is no charge for diagnosis and assessment for eligibility. Once eligibility is
determined, most services are free regardless of age or income. There is a requirement
for parents to share the cost of 24-hour out-of-home placements for children under age
18. This share depends on the parents' ability to pay. There may also be a co-payment
requirement for other selected services.
Regional centers are required by law to provide services in the most cost-effective way
possible. They must use all other resources, including generic resources, before using any
regional center funds. A generic resource is a service provided by an agency that has a
legal responsibility to provide services to the general public and receives public funds for
providing those services. Some generic agencies may include the local school district,
county social services department, Medi-Cal, Social Security Administration, Department
of Rehabilitation and others. Other resources may include natural supports. This is help
that disabled persons may get from family, friends or others at little or no cost. According
to the latest WRC Performance Report 2, the Center served approximately 7,100
individuals during 2010.
In addition to the services provided by the WRC, City housing programs that respond to
the needs of this population include 5a (Incentives for Affordable Housing), 6a (Section 8
Rental Assistance) and 7d (Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing).

        2.     Elderly
According to recent Census data, there were 1,2274 households (24% of owners but only
5% of renters) in Hermosa Beach where the householder was 65 or older (Table I-18).
Many elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes and/or have a disability. Elderly
homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone.
The housing needs of this group can be addressed through smaller units, second units on
lots with existing homes, shared living arrangements, congregate housing and housing
assistance programs.

        3.     Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. Among both owners and renters, more than 67% of all
households have only one or two members. Less than 1% of renter households had five or
more members, while about 3% of owners were large households (Table I-19). This
distribution suggests that the need for large units with four or more bedrooms is expected
to be much less than for smaller units.

           4.          Female-Headed Households
Recent Census data reported that approximately 4% of owner households and 2% of
renter households in the city were headed by a female (Table I-20). A similar number of
households were headed by single men. While female-headed households represent a
small portion of households, they may have significant difficulties finding affordable
housing, particularly in expensive coastal areas.
                                                                     Table I-20

           5.          Farm Workers
Farm worker households are considered as a special needs group due to their transient
nature and the lower incomes typically earned by these households. Migrant workers,
and their places of residence, are generally located in close proximity to agricultural
areas providing employment. Although agriculture produces a total annual value of
approximately $278 million per year in Los Angeles County, no major agricultural activities
are found in Hermosa Beach or in the surrounding communities. 3 In addition, 2006-2010
ACS data estimated 75 City residents who were employed in the agriculture, forestry,
fishing, hunting and mining industries, although there is a substantial margin of error for
these estimates.
           6.          Homeless Persons
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines the term
“homeless” as the state of a person who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time
residence, or a person who has a primary night time residency that is:
        •         A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
                  temporary living accommodations;
        •         An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
                  be institutionalized; or

          •        A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
                   sleeping accommodation for human beings.4
Although there are myriad causes of homelessness, among the most common are:
          •        Substance abuse and alcohol
          •        Domestic violence
          •        Mental illness
According to the 2011 Homeless Count Report5 by the Los Angeles Homeless Services
Authority (LAHSA), 51,340 homeless persons were identified at the time of the survey. Of
this population, 38% were in shelter facilities and 62% were unsheltered. Hermosa Beach is
located within LAHSA’s Service Planning Area (SPA) 8 – South Bay (see Figure I-2). The
homeless count for SPA 8 found 5,833 single adults, 943 family members, and 12
unaccompanied youth.
LAHSA’s “Opt-In Program” provides local jurisdictions with homeless count numbers
specific to their area or city allowing them to obtain local homeless count information to
more effectively address local homelessness and to report progress to federal, state, and
county agencies to meet funding requirements. The City of Hermosa Beach participated
in the 2011 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, which identified 35 unsheltered adult
homeless persons within the city.
Shelter and service needs of the homeless population are significantly different
depending on the population subgroup. Los Angeles County’s Continuum of Care
approach to homelessness is a coordinated and systematic local approach to meet the
needs of homeless individuals and families within these subgroups, including:
          •        Chronic Homeless Persons;
          •        Episodic Homeless Persons; and
          •        Persons at Risk of Becoming Homeless
The County’s focus is to provide funding for access to mainstream resources such as
income supports, health care, mental health care, substance abuse treatment
programs, child care, and job training placement. 6 These resources serve the existing
homeless population, and also work toward the prevention of homelessness.
Contacts with the City of Hermosa Beach Police Department and the Los Angeles
County Departments of Beaches indicate that transients occasionally pass through the
City. When transients or homeless individuals are encountered, they are referred to the
appropriate agencies for assistance.”

Senate Bill 2 of 2007 strengthened the planning requirements for emergency shelter and
transitional/supportive housing. Unless existing shelter facilities are available to meet local
needs, jurisdictions must designate at least one zone where new shelters may be
established “by-right” (i.e., without a conditional use permit or other discretionary
approval). In 2013 the City amended the Municipal Code to address these new
requirements.
F.      Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
As part of the Housing Element update, state law requires jurisdictions to identify assisted
units that are at risk of conversion to market rate housing during the 10-year period 2013-
2023. According to the Southern California Association of Governments and the
California Housing Partnership Corporation, there are no units at risk in Hermosa Beach.
G.      Low- and Moderate-Income Housing in the Coastal Zone
The majority of Hermosa Beach located west of Valley Drive is within the Coastal Zone.
California Government Code §65590 et seq. prohibits conversion or demolition of existing
residential dwelling units occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families unless
provision has been made for the replacement in the same city or county of those
dwelling units with units for persons and families of low- or moderate-income (excludes
structures with less than 3 units, or less than 10 units for projects with more than one
structure, among other exclusions).
Section 65590(d) further requires new housing development in the coastal zone to
provide housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income, or if not
feasible, to provide such units at another location within the same city or county, within
the coastal zone or within three miles thereof. Due to the exemptions noted above, no
documented affordable units have been constructed in the Coastal Zone. A total of
approximately 850 units were constructed from 1982 through 2012.
No affordable units have been demolished or converted within the Coastal Zone since
1982. The Coastal Land Use Plan (LUP) addresses three primary issue areas: access,
planning for new development, and the preservation of marine-related resources. The
LUP contains policies that may impede the construction of new housing development
within the designated coastal zone of the City. These include policies related to the
preservation of beach access, adequate parking and controlling the types and densities
of residential development within the coastal zone. Coastal policies and standards
controlling mass, height and bulk discourage “mansionization.” Policies do not prevent
residential units above ground floor commercial as allowed in the C-1 zoning district.

H.      Future Housing Needs
        1.       Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within
each jurisdiction for the period January 2014 to October 2021. Communities then
determine how they will address this need through the process of updating the Housing
Elements of their General Plans.
The current RHNA was adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) in October 2012. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the
forecasted growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by a
child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for
employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new
households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing
choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost
due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these
factors – household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the
construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four
income categories on the basis of the county’s income distribution, with adjustments to
avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.
        2.       2014-2021 Hermosa Beach Housing Needs
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) determined the RHNA
housing needs for each city within the SCAG region, plus the unincorporated areas. The
total housing need for the City of Hermosa Beach during the 2014-2021 planning period is
two units, distributed by income category as shown in Table I-21. Pursuant to Government
Code §65583(a)(1) it is assumed that the need for extremely-low-income households is
half of the very-low-income need. A discussion of the city’s net remaining housing need is
provided in the land inventory section of Chapter II.

II.      RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A.       Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
“inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed analysis of vacant land and
potential redevelopment opportunities has been prepared and is described in
Appendix B. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table II-1 below. The table shows
that the city’s land inventory exceeds the RHNA allocation of 2 units for this planning
period.
As discussed in Appendix B, the requirement to demonstrate availability of lower-income
sites is met through zoning that allows redevelopment of underutilized sites at densities
greater than 20 units/acre. In 2004 state law was amended to establish 20 units/acre as
the density deemed appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income house-
holds in small urban cities like Hermosa Beach [Government Code §65583.2(c)(3)(B)]. The
land inventory analysis in Appendix B contains an estimate of the realistic capacity of
potential sites for residential development at densities greater than 20 units/acre. The
analysis notes that high land values have resulted in extensive “recycling” of small
residential parcels to higher-density projects.

A discussion of public facilities and infrastructure needed to serve future development is
contained in Section III.B, Non-Governmental Constraints. There are currently no known
service limitations that would preclude the level of development described in the RHNA,
although developers will be required to pay fees or construct public improvements prior
to or concurrent with development.

B.      Financial and Administrative Resources
        1.     State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) - Federal funding for housing
programs is available from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
During the previous planning period the City received approximately $93,000 per year,
however the latest grant for FY12-13 was about $78,000 and future years are expected to
be even less. In recent years the City has used CDBG funds for ADA compliance retrofits
for the Community Center and Playhouse, City Hall and sidewalk handicap ramps.
The City does not currently participate in other HUD programs such as HOME, Emergency
Shelter Grant (ESG) or Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA).
Section 8 Rental Assistance – The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP)
assists very-low-income senior citizens, families and the disabled with the cost of rental
housing. Generally, a tenant pays 30% of his or her adjusted income towards the rent
and the Section 8 program pays the balance directly to the landlord. Unfortunately, the
need for rental assistance is greater than available resources. The Los Angeles County
Section 8 waiting list for assistance in 2013 consists of approximately 200,000 households.
        2.     Local Resources
As a very small jurisdiction, Hermosa Beach has extremely limited resources for housing
assistance. The only locally-generated source of housing revenue is the Condominium
Conversion fund, which is an "infrastructure fee toward the physical and service structure
of the community from which the development benefits" (Municipal Code Section
17.22.270).
C.      Sustainable Housing Development
The City of Hermosa Beach is working to be a leader in sustainability. The three elements
of sustainability, environment, economy, and are related to the objectives of this housing
element in several ways. Strong, sustainable communities connect housing,
transportation, jobs and equity. They reduce transportation costs for families, maximize
resource efficiency, improve housing affordability, save energy, and increase access to
housing and employment opportunities. This nurtures healthier, more inclusive
communities and housing opportunities. Hermosa Beach can use sustainable
communities strategies and techniques to invest in healthy, safe and inclusive
neighborhoods.
Strategies to increase sustainability are multidisciplinary and should be integrated
throughout all elements of the City’s General Plan. The City is embarking on a major
General Plan/Coastal land Use Plan revision focusing on sustainability and a low carbon
future with an anticipated adoption date in 2016, within this Housing Element planning
period. Therefore, the purpose of this discussion is to recognize this longer term planning
effort while outlining early actions that can be pursued while that process is ongoing.

AB 32 and SB 375
In 2006, the Legislature passed AB 32—The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,—which
requires the State of California to reduce “greenhouse gas” (GhG) emissions to 1990
levels no later than 2020. Passenger vehicles account for 31 percent of the state’s total
emissions. In 1990 greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and light trucks were 108
million metric tons, but by 2004 these emissions had increased to 135 million metric tons.
SB 375 asserts that “Without improved land use and transportation policy, California will
not be able to achieve the goals of AB 32.”
SB 375, passed in 2008, builds on the existing regional transportation planning process
(which is overseen by local officials with land use responsibilities) to connect the
reduction of GhG emissions from cars and light trucks to land use and transportation
policy.
SB 375 has three goals: (1) to use the regional transportation planning process to help
achieve AB 32 goals; (2) to use the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
streamlining as an incentive to encourage residential projects that help achieve AB 32
goals to reduce GhG emissions; and (3) to coordinate the regional housing needs
allocation process with the regional transportation planning process. SB 375 requires
consistency between the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA), which is accomplished through using an “integrated” growth
forecast for use in both of these policy documents.
In 2012 the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) adopted both an RTP
and a RHNA which allocated only two units to the City of Hermosa Beach as its ‘fair
share’ of new housing development that must be accommodated during the planning
period. Local governments help to implement SB 375 by adopting housing elements that
facilitate new housing development in a manner consistent with the growth forecast and
the RHNA. Hermosa’s RHNA of two units reflect that most of the city’s housing
development will be in the form of replacement of demolished units.
As required by SB 375 the South Bay Cities Council of Governments adopted its South Bay
Sustainable Strategy: An Integrated Land Use and Transportation Strategy, 2009, 7 which
focuses on placing housing and jobs in close proximity and accelerating use and
conversion to low carbon transportation modes. Opportunities related to housing may
include ensuring housing is electric vehicle ready, enhancing biking and walking and as
feasible transit connections between housing and workplaces, and ensuring a range of
housing choices for all stages of life, close to jobs.
The City was provided a Sustainability Plan prepared by its ad hoc Green Task Force in
2011, being a plan of local actions the City and people of Hermosa Beach can take to
meet today’s needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
needs. Programs relevant to residential development and neighborhoods include
increasing the feasibility of biking and walking and amending codes to support these
modes, creating streetscape and environments to encourage walking, improve local
transit services, personal choice and workplace programs to reduce commuter trips,

Housing Element Technical Report                     II-3                            September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                           II Resources and Opportunities
promote low emission vehicle use, encourage photovoltaics at home and businesses for
electric vehicle charging, encourage and facilitate renewable energy at home, expand
the use of graywater systems and increase water conservation, adopt an ordinance with
incentives and facilitation for green building retrofits, and improve waste reduction and
recycling at home including a zero waste goal.
The Hermosa Beach Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory prepared in 2010
evaluated greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions from electricity and natural gas use in
homes, finding this sector comprised 24% of the community’s emissions in 2007. The
transportation sector (which includes all sources) comprised 59%. Under a business as
usual forecast, GhG generated by the residential sector would increase 0.3% from 2007
to 2020. The inventory is being updated so that trends and actions can be monitored.
Therefore addressing energy conservation will reduce GhG emissions, increase
sustainability, and reduce housing costs as well as potentially making homes more
comfortable. All of the above are supported by many other initiatives the city is
undertaking.
Energy Conservation Opportunities
Given that future housing growth is projected to be limited, attention should be focused
on redevelopment, rehabilitation and retrofits. As residential energy costs rise, the
subsequent increasing utility costs also reduce housing affordability. Although the City is
fully developed, new infill development, rehabilitation and retrofits provide the City
opportunities to enhance community sustainability and directly affect energy use within
its jurisdiction.
State of California Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential
Buildings were established in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce
California's energy consumption. The standards are codified in Title 24 of the California
Code of Regulations and are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible
incorporation of new energy efficiency technologies and methods. California's building
efficiency standards (along with those for energy efficient appliances) have saved more
than $56 billion in electricity and natural gas costs since 1978. It is estimated the
standards will save an additional $23 billion by 2013 8.
Title 24 sets forth mandatory energy standards and requires the adoption of an “energy
budget” for all new residential buildings and additions to residential buildings. Separate
requirements are adopted for “low-rise” residential construction (i.e., no more than 3
stories) and non-residential buildings, which includes hotels, motels, and multi-family
residential buildings with four or more habitable stories. The standards specify energy
saving design for lighting, walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and
cooling equipment and systems, gas cooling devices, conservation standards and the
use of non-depleting energy sources, such as solar energy or wind power. The home
building industry must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for
enforcing the energy conservation regulations through the plan check and building
inspection processes.

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                              II Resources and Opportunities
In addition to state-mandated Title 24 requirements, Hermosa Beach is participating in a
coalition to collaboratively tackle the issue of energy conservation. 9 The South Bay
Environmental Services Center (SBESC 10) is educating residents, business owners and
public agencies and hosting or making available information about the energy
conservation programs, retrofits and incentives available in the community and how to
incorporate more energy-saving practices into everyday life. Established through funding
from the California Public Utilities Commission, the SBESC includes the 15 cities that
comprise the South Bay Cities Council of Governments (SBCCOG), and is associated with
Southern California Edison and Southern California Gas Company. Member cities include
Carson, El Segundo, Gardena, Hawthorne, Hermosa Beach, Inglewood, Lawndale,
Lomita, Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach,
Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, Torrance, and the Harbor City and San Pedro
communities of Los Angeles.
The City of Hermosa Beach has adopted solar energy and wind energy ordinances to
facilitate their use, and has reduced building permit fees for solar energy systems and
waived the planning fee for wind energy systems. These waivers are reviewed annually.
The City has adopted a water conservation ordinance and a water efficient landscape
ordinance that is significantly more restrictive than required by state law in that
demonstration of drought-tolerant landscaping is required for all new landscaping in
connection with all projects regardless of size or tenancy.
The City adopted increased energy efficiency requirements (Tier 1) as part of the 2010
CalGreen Code. The City is participating in the Los Angeles County Energy Upgrade
Program so that residents and businesses can take full advantage of energy retrofit
programs per AB 811. The City has instituted a fee reduction for LEED or Build-It Green
certified buildings, with this incentive to be reviewed annually.
The City, in concert with the South Bay Environmental Service Center (SBESC) and others,
will continue to participate and host workshops on green building; the City hosted
workshops on solar energy, green building codes, adopted a provision to allow solar
energy systems exceeding height limits, waives plan check fees for installation of solar
systems, waives building permits for electrical upgrades to charge electric vehicles, and
has adopted a form-based zoning district mandating and encouraging green building
provisions. The City became a member of 'Cool Cities' and the City’s ‘Green Building Task
Force' prepared a Sustainability Plan accepted by the City in 2011. The City’s new
Hermosa Beach website and Green Webpage at www.hermosabch.org allow the City to
provide housing information updated on a regular basis.
State policy requires all new residential buildings to be ‘net zero energy” by 2020. On
May 31, 2012 the California Energy Commission (CEC) adopted new energy efficiency
standards for both residential and commercial buildings. The new standards take effect
on January 1, 2014.

Housing Element Technical Report                   II-5                           September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                             II Resources and Opportunities
The CEC’s 2013 Building Energy Efficiency Standards are 25 percent more efficient than
previous standards for residential construction and 30 percent better for nonresidential
construction.
Some of the 2013 changes to residential standards include:
    •   Solar-ready roofs to allow homeowners to add solar photovoltaic panels at a
        future date. The City’s code already mandates this requirement as well as
        requiring solar readiness for solar hot water heating;
    •   More efficient windows to allow increased sunlight, while decreasing heat gain.
        The City’s Cal-Green code already requires 15% efficiency over Title 24;
    •   Insulated hot water pipes to save water and energy and reduce the time it takes
        to deliver hot water;
    •   Whole house fans to cool homes and attics with evening air, reducing the need
        for air conditioning load; and
    •   Air conditioner installation verification to insure efficient operation.
As part of its comprehensive General Plan update, initiated in 2013, the City will focus on
new opportunities to encourage sustainable development. Strategic opportunity areas
include the following:
    •   Land use and transportation planning: opportunities include enhanced bicycle
        and pedestrian modes including implementing the South Bay Bicycle Master Plan
        and improving walkability, improved jobs/housing balance including opportunities
        to foster economic innovation close to home, the potential for mixed use
        development in limited areas, and protection of the marine environment and the
        City’s coastal economy etc.
    •   Building technology: opportunities include incentives for higher-efficiency
        buildings, green roofs, smart buildings, green building programs targeting small
        projects and retrofits, etc.
    •   Lifestyle options: opportunities include improved information dissemination to the
        building community and residents to foster informed choices in site design, home
        construction and remodeling; efficient resource use; improved environmental
        protection (runoff controls, water conservation, measures to reduce greenhouse
        gases); housing options for all stages of life, etc.
Issue Area No. 6 and Program 9 in the Housing Plan describe the City’s policies and
objectives for identifying these and other opportunities for more sustainable
development as part of the General Plan update.

III.    CONSTRAINTS
A.      Governmental Constraints
        1.     Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.      General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the City’s zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
The Hermosa Beach General Plan Land Use Element includes four residential land use
designations, as shown in Table III-1.
                                               Table III-1
                                 Residential Land Use Categories –
                                    Hermosa Beach General Plan
                                                           Maximum
                                         Designation        Density*
                               Low Density                 13 DU/acre
                               Medium Density              25 DU/acre
                               High Density                33 DU/acre
                               Mobile Home                 13 DU/acre
The City of Hermosa Beach General Plan is not considered a constraint to the goals and
policies of the Housing Element as the City’s zoning is consistent with the General Plan
and adequate sites with appropriate densities have been identified to accommodate
the remaining RHNA allocation.
b.      Zoning Designations
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
through the Municipal Code. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan
and are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents. The Municipal Code also helps to preserve the character and integrity of
existing neighborhoods. The Municipal Code sets forth residential development standards
for each zone district.

Code was amended to clarify that the PDP is a site design tool, rather than providing a
means of evaluating whether the type of use should be allowed on a particular site.
The City also has adopted nine specific plan areas (SPAs), in many cases to
accommodate specific commercial or residential development projects. Residential use
is either not allowed in these specific plan areas or the specific plan area was adopted
to specifically accommodate a development project which has been constructed. SPA-
7 and SPA-8 provide a significant number of parcels for commercial development
fronting Pacific Coast Highway.

Zoning for Lower-Income Housing
Lower-income housing can be accommodated in all zones permitting residential use in
Hermosa Beach. These may include second residential units in the R-1A and R-2B zones,
multi-family apartments in the R-3 zone, and commercial/residential mixed-use
developments within the C-1 and R-P Zones. Under state law, the “default density”
presumed to be adequate to facilitate lower-income housing is 20 units/acre in Hermosa
Beach. As noted in Table III-2 (page III-2, the R-2, R-2B, R-3, R-P and C-1 zones all permit
development at greater than 20 units/acre and therefore are considered suitable for

lower-income housing under state law 11. Review of development trends confirms that
actual densities in these zones are typically greater than 20 units per acre.
The City of Hermosa Beach has adopted a lot merger ordinance. Chapter 16.24 of the
Subdivision Ordinance requires continuous lots in the R-1 zone under the same ownership
to be merged if one or both of the lots is substandard (less than 4,00 square feet) in size.
The city initiated a residential lot merger program in 1986. The city adopted lot merger
provisions in 1986 within the Subdivision Ordinance in response to state law, requiring
substandard-size properties under common ownership to be merged. The city
completed a citywide lot merger program in 1989. In 2006 the city became of aware of
several parcels that were not included in the 1989 program, and conducted another
citywide survey (showing 71 lots remained subject to merger—25 separate lots that could
be developed, 46 remnant parcels), and conducted another lot merger program. In
2007 the merger ordinance was amended to reduce applicability to the R-1 properties to
prevent splitting and separation of lots in R-1 neighborhoods, finding that merging lots in
R-2 and R-3 zones has limited or no impact. Therefore, changes to the lot merger
program are not necessary.
                                                        Despite significant land zoned for
                                                        residential uses, Hermosa Beach is
                                                        already one of the most densely
                                                        developed and populated cities in
                                                        Los Angeles County and is essentially
                                                        built-out.    While      rezoning        of
                                                        commercial or industrial areas could
                                                        be considered to provide additional
                                                        housing,    there     are      no    large
                                                        commercial or industrial areas that
                                                        are suitable for this purpose. About
                                                        75% of the city is already residentially
                                                        zoned, with about 35% of this area
                                                        zoned for high-density R-2 and R-3
                                                        development. Approximately 11% of
                                                        the city has commercial zoning, and
just 1% is industrially zoned. The balance of the city is zoned for open space, most of
which is the beach area. The percentage of commercial and industrial zoning is well
below the neighboring cities in the South Bay and the region in general. The City Council
has recognized this imbalance and supports maintaining and where possible
aggregating small lots in commercial areas. As a result, there are no significant non-
residential parcels that can be re-zoned for high-density residential development. In
addition, it is important for the City’s economic viability that existing commercial and
industrial areas be preserved.
The residential land inventory reveals that the majority of potential housing sites are
underused parcels with older homes. While none of these sites are on the City's inventory
of potentially significant historic landmark sites (last updated in the early 1970s), there is a

concern that redevelopment of most of these sites would change the character of the
city's neighborhoods, which are typically a mix of older, often single-story bungalow style
homes, with two- or three-story high-density condo projects, as well as potentially
impacting access on narrow residential streets and other infrastructure. With little room
for street widening in older beach communities, it is important to note that the added
traffic generation of more high-density housing could conflict with other statewide
priorities such as facilitating access to the beach.
In order to encourage and facilitate the production of higher-density affordable housing,
the Housing Plan includes Programs 5 and 8 that will offer assistance and incentives to
developers who provide units affordable to lower-income households.
Special Needs Housing
Under state law, persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities,
persons with disabilities, farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter, transitional or
supportive housing, and low-cost single-room-occupancy units. The City’s regulations
regarding these housing types are discussed below.
       •     Housing for Persons with Disabilities
             State requirements. Health and Safety Code §§1267.8, 1566.3, and 1568.08
             require local governments to treat licensed group homes and residential care
             facilities with six or fewer residents no differently than other single-family
             residential uses. “Six or fewer persons” does not include the operator, the
             operator’s family, or persons employed as staff. Local agencies must allow
             these licensed care facilities in any area zoned for residential use, and may
             not require licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons to obtain
             conditional use permits or variances that are not required of other family
             dwellings.
             In 2013 the Municipal Code was amended to identify definitions and
             standards for group homes and residential care facilities in conformance with
             state law.
             Reasonable Accommodation. The City’s Building Code requires that new
             residential construction comply with Title 24 accessibility standards. These
             standards include requirements for a minimum percentage of fully accessible
             units in new multi-family developments. In order to facilitate the processing of
             requests to reduce architectural obstacles for persons with disabilities, the City
             in 2011 amended the Municipal Code to allow the review of requests for
             reasonable accommodation pursuant to SB 520 of 2001.
             Definition of “Family”. The Municipal Code defines "Family" as “two or more
             persons living together in a dwelling unit, sharing common cooking facilities,
             and possessing the character of a relatively permanent single bona fide
             housekeeping unit in a domestic bond of social, economic and psychological
             commitment to each other, as distinguished from a group occupying a
             boarding house, club, dormitory, fraternity, hotel, lodging house, motel,

             rehabilitation center, rest home or sorority.” This definition is consistent with
             state law..
            Maximum concentration requirements. There are no concentration or
            separation requirements for residential care facilities or group homes in the
            Zoning Code.
            Site planning requirements. There are no special site planning requirements
            (other than parking, height, and setbacks) for residential care facilities in the
            Zoning Code.
            Parking requirements.         The Zoning Code does not specify a parking
            requirement for residential care facilities. The city has not been presented with
            requests for such facilities, therefore parking demand would be determined on
            a case-by-case based on comparison with uses having similar parking
            demand.
      •      Farm Worker Housing
             The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not identify farm worker housing separately
             as a permitted use. However, as discussed in Chapter II, no agricultural
             activities are found within Hermosa Beach or in the surrounding communities.
             Therefore there is no demand for farm worker housing in Hermosa Beach.
      •      Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
             Emergency shelters are facilities that provide a safe alternative to acute
             homelessness either in a shelter facility, or through the use of motel vouchers.
             Emergency shelter is short-term, usually for 30 days or less. Recent
             amendments to state law (Senate Bill 2 of 2007) require that unless adequate
             shelter facilities are available to meet a jurisdiction’s needs, emergency
             shelters must be allowed by-right (i.e., without discretionary review such as a
             conditional use permit) in at least one zoning district, but may include specific
             development standards. In 2013 the Municipal Code was amended in
             compliance with SB 2, to allow emergency shelters by-right in the C-3, SPA 7
             and SPA 8 zones. The C-3 zone encompasses approximately 28 acres while the
             SPA 7 and SPA-8 contain a total of approximately 22 acres. All of these districts
             are adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway, which provides excellent transit
             service.
             Transitional housing is longer-term housing, typically up to two years.
             Transitional housing generally requires that residents participate in a structured
             program to work toward established goals so that they can move on to
             permanent housing. Residents are often provided with an array of supportive
             services to assist them in meeting goals. Under SB 2 transitional and supportive
             housing is deemed to be a residential use subject only to the same
             requirements and standards that apply to other residential uses of the same
             type in the same zone. The Zoning Code was amended in 2013 to provide
             definitions and regulations for transitional or supportive housing consistent with
             state law.

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                         III Constraints
         •       Single Room Occupancy
                 Single-room-occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units that
                 typically rent in the very-low- or extremely-low-income category. SROs are not
                 identified by the City’s Zoning Code as permitted uses within any residential or
                 commercial district, although such facilities may be built in multi-family zones if
                 the applicable development standards are met. The City’s Building Code
                 requires a 600 square-foot minimum for one-bedroom multi-family units and
                 the Zoning Code requires a 900 square-foot minimum for condominiums.
                 California Health and Safety Code §17958.1 allows jurisdictions to permit
                 efficiency units with a minimum floor area of 150 square feet and partial
                 kitchen or bathroom facilities for occupancy by no more than two persons. In
                 order to facilitate the development this source of affordable housing, the
                 Zoning Code was amended in 2013 to add a definition and development
                 standards for SROs consistent with state law.
c.          Off-Street Parking Requirements
The City’s parking requirements for residential zones vary by residential type and housing
product (Table III-4). Two off-street parking spaces plus one guest space are required for
single-family, duplex or two-family dwellings. Multiple dwellings (three or more units) are
also required to have two off-street spaces, plus one guest space for each two dwelling
units. Mobile homes are required to have two spaces per unit. The City adopted a
reduced parking standard for Specific Plan Area No. 6 in conjunction with approval of a
senior assisted living facility, and shared and reduced parking may be approved by the
Planning Commission on a case-by-case basis. State density bonus law (SB 1818)
prescribes reduced parking standards for affordable housing developments, and in 2013
the Code was amended to reduce parking standards for multi-family lower-income and
senior restricted housing, multi-family housing restricted to disabled persons, and single-
room-occupancy facilities.
                                                             Table III-4

d.       Accessory and Second Units
The Zoning Code limits guest houses and accessory living quarters to space within the
main building for someone employed on the premises or temporary use by guests
pursuant to a use permit.
       •     "Guest house" or "accessory living quarters" means living quarters within a
             main building for the use of persons employed on the premises, or for
             temporary use by guests of the occupants of the premises. Such quarters shall
             have no kitchen facilities and shall not be rented or otherwise used as a
             separate dwelling unit. Guest houses and accessory living quarters are subject
             to the issuance of a conditional use permit and are not allowed in accessory
             buildings.
Accessory units differ from second units, which may be rented subject to an age
restriction. In 2013 the City amended the code to allow a maximum 640 square foot unit
on an 8,000+ square foot lot in the R-1 zone subject to a ministerial approval process.
Those portions of the city that are presently zoned R-2 and R-3 typically contain parcels
that are too small to accommodate second units. As a result, the provisions for a second
unit apply only to the R-1 single-family zone. In 1992 the City adopted Ordinance No. 92-
1080 which makes all of the required findings under California Government Code
§65852.2 to preclude the creation of second units in single-family and multi-family zones,
and the City has determined that second units are not suitable on the residential lots in
the City due to impacts on such things as traffic, density, the school system, infrastructure,
sewer, loss of open space, increased impervious surfaces, and increase of solid waste
generation. While the City subsequently conducted an extensive lot merger program
these conditions and the reasons to preclude second units continue to exist.
e.       Density Bonus
Under state law (SB 1818 of 2004), cities and counties must provide a density increase up
to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the Municipal
Code and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of equivalent financial
value) when builders agree to construct housing developments with units affordable to
low- or moderate-income households. The Municipal Code was amended in 2013 to be
consistent with state density bonus law.
f.       Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than on
site, thereby reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the
installation of mobile homes on permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also
declares a mobile home park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and
zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a new mobile
home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code.
Housing Element Technical Report             III-8                          September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                          III Constraints
Mobile homes are permitted in
each of the residential zones,
thereby facilitating the construction
of this type of housing.
One mobile home park is located
in Hermosa Beach (Marine Land
Mobile Home Park), which is owned
by a private, non-profit corpora-
tion. In addition, the adjacent
"State RV Park" is occupied by very-
low-income         households      and
persons in transition to permanent
residency. The City committed to
retaining the Marine Land Mobile Home Park by designating it within the General Plan
and Zoning Code as a Mobile Home Park (MHP) Zone and in 2008 the City Council
allocated over $111,000 from the Condominium Conversion Fund to assist residents with
their acquisition of the Marine Land Mobile Home Park. In December 2008 the project
was awarded $1,200,000 subject to conditions under the state’s Mobilehome Park
Resident Owner Program (see Program 3 in Chapter V).
g.       Condominium Conversions
In order to reduce the impacts of condominium conversions on residents of rental
housing and to maintain a supply of rental housing for low- and moderate-income
persons, the City's Municipal Code provides for a tenant assistance plan that includes the
following:
      a.    An option to first purchase units, including tenant purchase discounts. For those
            who choose not to purchase a unit, the subdivider must provide a method by
            which tenants will be assisted in finding comparable replacement rental
            housing within the area of the conversion, including professional relocation
            assistance.
      b.    A statement of the method by which the subdivider will comply with the
            requirements of Section 66427.1 of the State Subdivision Map Act. Such
            method must provide that no tenant shall be required to move from his or her
            apartment due to the proposed conversion until the expiration of the two-
            month period for exercise of his or her right of first refusal.
      c.    Reimbursement for moving costs incurred, not to exceed $500.00.
      d.    Extension of tenancy to complete school term, if necessary.
Because of these requirements, the potential impact of condominium conversions is not
a significant constraint on the preservation of affordable rental housing. However, the
reimbursement amounts for moving and for rent differentials should be reviewed to
ensure costs have not outpaced reimbursements. This review is incorporated into
Program 8.

h.      Nonconforming Uses and Buildings
The Zoning Code allows residential uses to be rebuilt in the case of destruction or
damage beyond the owner's control provided the nonconformity is not increased.
Nonconforming buildings may expand 100 percent in floor area (existing prior to October
26, 1989, up to 3,000 square feet per unit or 5,000 square feet of total floor area for the
building site). Nonconforming portions of a building with a nonconforming residential use
may be partially modified or altered to the extent necessary to comply with the Uniform
Building Code. Specific rules pertaining to nonconforming parking apply. Building sites
with three or more dwelling units cannot be expanded in floor area unless two parking
spaces per unit plus one guest space for every two units are provided.
                                                    The Zoning Code also allows the
                                                    Planning Commission to validate as
                                                    legal nonconforming residential units
                                                    that can be shown to have been used
                                                    for residential occupancy more or less
                                                    continuously since January 1, 1959
                                                    when City records and actual property
                                                    use conflict. In 2013 the City evaluated
                                                    whether to relax provisions governing
                                                    validation of residential units that
                                                    contribute to the supply of affordable
                                                    rental housing when the use is
                                                    demonstrated to have existed for a
                                                    shorter period of time (to be
determined as part of the city's consideration) than is currently required under the code,
provided the units are improved so as to not be substandard and parking adequate for
the occupancy can be provided and determined to maintain the existing regulations
due to density, parking and issues that would be associated with administration of such a
program.
i.      Building Codes
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such charges to the
Department of Housing and Community Development and file an expressed finding that
the change is needed. The City’s Building Code incorporates the California Building
Code, which includes the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Housing Code. The City’s
Building Code also incorporates the California Building, Plumbing, Mechanical and
Electrical Codes. These are considered the minimum necessary to protect the public's
health, safety and welfare.
The City’s ordinance details the revisions and amendments to the Building Code that
exceed state standards. These amendments are all relatively inexpensive, and most of
the revisions are related to fire alarms, smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, and other basic
safety measures. The City has adopted some local modifications to the 2010 CalGreen
Codes to address drainage, increased demolition diversion, and increased energy

efficiency, among others, however these were determined to not substantially increase
project costs.
j.      Coastal Zone
Policies in the Coastal Land Use Plan are likely to aid in the maintenance of affordable
housing since they discourage “mansionization.” Since the Zoning Ordinance has not
been certified by the Coastal Commission, amendments and projects affecting coastal
resources must continue to be submitted to the Coastal Commission for review and
approval.
        2.     Development Processing Procedures
a.      Residential Permit Processing
State Requirements. State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing
requirements for residential development. Within the framework of state requirements,
the City has structured its development review process in order to minimize the time
required to obtain permits while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
Developer Assistance. Hermosa Beach has prepared permit processing guidelines to
assist residential builders in applying for development permits for single-family residences,
multi-family, and subdivisions. The guides are comprehensive in nature, address the steps,
and check points to be followed. Early consultation with City staff is encouraged to
identify issues as soon as possible and reduce processing time. This consultation (at no
cost to applicants) allows applicants to become acquainted with the information and
fees required by each department and agency. Preliminary site and architectural plans
are also reviewed for consistency with City standards. This conference allows the
applicant to assess the feasibility of the project and make adjustments during the
preliminary planning stages to minimize costs.
Permit Approval Procedures and Timing. Simultaneous processing of required
entitlements (e.g., subdivisions and planned developments permits) is also provided as a
means of expediting the review process. Most projects under the purview of the Planning
Commission are approved or denied within six weeks of filing; a subsequent process
requiring Planning Commission actions to be reported to the City Council and the
appeal period typically consumes about 30 days. Therefore, the process is typically
completed within 3 months from application filing.
        •      Single-Family Detached Units – Applications are reviewed by the Planning
               Division for zoning clearance, and subsequently by the Building Division.
               Processing time is typically three to four weeks.
        •      Condominiums – A conditional use permit, precise development permit
               (PDP) design review, and tentative subdivision map must be approved by
               the Planning Commission; this process is usually completed within three
               months from the date a complete application is received. Once that
               approval is obtained, the building permit application can be
               simultaneously reviewed by the planning and building divisions. The building
               permit process takes about three to six weeks.
Housing Element Technical Report               III-11                       September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                          III Constraints
        •      Multi-Family Projects – A precise development plan (PDP) design review is
               conducted by the Planning Commission. If a conditional use permit is also
               required by the Zoning Code, then it is reviewed by the Planning
               Commission concurrently. Such review is usually completed within three
               months from the date a complete application is received. Once approval
               is obtained, the building permit application can be simultaneously
               reviewed by the planning and building divisions. A structural plan check is
               performed by an outside contractor. The building permit process takes
               about four to six weeks.
        •      Mixed-Use Projects – A precise development plan (PDP) design review is
               conducted by the Planning Commission. If a conditional use permit is
               required by the Zoning Code, concurrent Planning Commission review is
               usually completed within three months from the date a complete
               application is received. The building permit process takes about three to six
               weeks.
        •      Building Plan Check - Plan check for the processing of residential building
               permits is generally four to six weeks, depending on the City’s workload. For
               discretionary permits, there is an initial internal review period of 30 days.
               Building codes are applied to new construction, and projects are
               monitored and inspected under the building permit process. Where no
               permits have been obtained, inspections are made in response to request
               and complaints.
Programs 5 and 9 in the Housing Plan include specific actions the City will take to
streamline the development review process to facilitate the production of affordable
housing.
b.      Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all discretionary development projects under the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Most projects in Hermosa Beach are either
Categorically Exempt or require only an Initial Study and Negative Declaration.
Developments that have the potential of creating significant impacts that cannot be
mitigated require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report. Most residential
projects require a Negative Declaration and take an additional three to four weeks to
complete. Categorically Exempt developments such as second residential units require a
minimal amount of time. As a result, state-mandated environmental review does not
pose a significant constraint to housing development.
        3.     Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are
charged by the City and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit
applications and providing services and facilities such as schools, parks and
infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro-rata share system,
Housing Element Technical Report               III-12                       September 10, 2013

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                                       III Constraints
based on the magnitude of the project's impact or on the extent of the benefit that will
be derived.
Table III-5 shows fees associated with new development within Hermosa Beach. As can
be seen from the table, Park and Recreation and Building Permit fees represent the
largest development fees, although since many projects replace units, credits can be
obtained. For a typical 2,000-square-foot single-family dwelling (excluding any demolition
or entitlement cost), cumulative permit fees are estimated at approximately $20,000 per
unit or $10,000 if the new unit replaced a 1,500-square-foot house (2013). Fees for a 2,000-
square-foot condominium unit (part of a typical two-unit project) that replaced a 1,500-
square-foot dwelling would be about $20,000, or $30,000 if no replacement was involved.
Nearly all multi-family projects are small condominium projects which allow owners to
maximize investment on small lots.
The City periodically evaluates the actual cost of processing the development permits
when revising its fee schedule. The last review was 2012.
In addition to City fees, development fees levied by the school districts and special
districts include the following as of April 2013:
       •     School Fees: $2.63 per square foot
       •     L.A. County Sewer Connection Fee: $2,850 (single family home)
Aside from parkland fees, no other impact fees have been adopted.

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                               III Constraints
The City requires developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to
serve their projects. Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility
extensions, street construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably
related to the project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a
project for rights-of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent
with the Subdivision Map Act.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public
improvements, including street improvements and other public works projects, to
facilitate the City’s continued development according to the City’s General Plan. The
CIP helps to ensure that construction of public improvements is coordinated with private
development.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of
housing, cities have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations
on property taxes and other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.
B.      Non-Governmental Constraints
        1.     Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, or sensitive biological habitat. In many cases, development of these areas is
constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA floodplain regulations, the Clean
Water Act, Endangered Species Act, Coastal Act, State Fish and Game Code and
Alquist-Priolo Act). The City’s Coastal Land Use Plan and General Plan have been
designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and to protect public safety
Environmentally sensitive areas are generally zoned and protected as parklands.
However, a significant portion of the City is within the Coastal Zone wherein impacts to
coastal resources are always of concern. In addition, portions of the city are located on
moderately steep hillsides and some areas are subject to liquefaction. While policies
constrain residential development to some extent, they are necessary to support other
public policies.
        2.     Infrastructure Constraints
With almost 20,000 people living within its 1.3 square miles and virtually no vacant land,
the City’s growth is limited to redevelopment and replacement of existing structures. This
section discusses potential infrastructure constraints on such development.
Water and Wastewater. Water and wastewater systems are generally able to serve
existing demands. Most new development will continue to be replacement of existing
structures, and water and sewer capacities are projected to be sufficient to
accommodate this replacement during the planning period. However, significant
deficiencies in the sewer system exist and rehabilitation is necessary, and new
development may require offsite improvements. In 2009 the City Council approved
Sewer System Master and Management Plans identifying the cost to repair the 80-year-
old system at $9 million over 10 years. City staff met with Los Angeles County Department
of Public Works regarding annexing the city’s facilities into the county’s Sewer

Maintenance District with favorable response. In June 2012, the City Council approved
the first step, County review of City sewer videos to determine deficiencies requiring
rehabilitation prior to annexation. In 2012 the City contracted for limited sewer repair and
replacement. Water infrastructure is replaced and developer improvements are in
accordance with the schedules and requirements of the service providers.
Streets and Parking. One of the primary infrastructure issues associated with the current
level of development is the limited capacity of on-street parking. As a dense beach city
inundated by tourists throughout the summer months, the city lacks adequate parking in
many areas. The City addresses this constraint incrementally by ensuring that all new
developments, both residential and commercial, provide adequate off-street parking so
they do not need to rely on on-street parking.
Streets in Hermosa Beach are subject to high levels of traffic, which would be further
impacted by new development. The great majority of the traffic, especially during the
summer months, consists of through-traffic, over which the City has no control. Because
of the City’s location in relation to the regional freeway system, access to the surrounding
region is limited to the arterial roadways. The many thousands of visitors to the local
beaches also affect parking and other services, in addition to traffic.
Drainage. Finally, urban storm water run-off is a challenging issue because the City is an
ocean front community with over 90% impermeable ground surface. In addition to best
management practices (BMPs) implemented through its regional storm water discharge
permit, the City also requires infiltration basins, when appropriate, with new
developments. The City has adopted rules to allow and encourage pervious surfaces
and also adopted Cal-Green building standards in 2010 exceeding state requirements
by requiring increased permeability or infiltration in connection with new development.
The City has installed an award-winning infiltration project in the downtown area, which
should serve as a model for other areas.
        3.     Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Land values fluctuate with market conditions, and the downturn in the housing market
following the 2008 mortgage crisis had a negative effect on property values. Real estate
professionals have reported that sales and property values are now recovering, however.
Per-unit land cost is directly affected by density – higher density allows the cost to be
spread across more units, reducing the total price. Most new residential development in
the City consists of one to two units per lot, and recent trends indicate redevelopment
projects have been maximizing density.
        4.     Construction Costs
Residential construction costs are estimated by the Community Development
Department at $200 per square foot and higher, usually due to the type of construction
and amenities desired by the developer in this market. Construction cost is affected by
the price of materials, labor, development standards, and general market conditions.
The City has no influence over materials and labor costs, and the building codes and

in the South Bay area. Since most development consists of private redevelopment where
impact fees and major infrastructure or offsite improvements are typically not required, it
is likely that costs are lower than in many cities. The City adopted the 2010 CalGreen
codes with some local modifications; however, no ‘reach’ codes were adopted and
these amendments were carefully reviewed to ensure they were readily achievable and
would not add substantial cost, especially given current economic conditions.
         5.     Cost and Availability of Financing
Hermosa Beach is similar to most other communities with regard to private sector home
financing programs. The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the
availability of real estate loans, although the long-term effects are unpredictable. For
buyers with good credit histories, mortgages can be obtained at very favorable interest
rates.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in
the area (“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing homes,
and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that redlining is practiced in any area of
the city.
C.       Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. Fair housing issues
are addressed in Hermosa Beach through coordination with fair housing organizations to
process complaints regarding housing discrimination and to provide counseling in
landlord/tenant disputes. Anti-discrimination resource materials (e.g., handouts, booklets,
and pamphlets) are made available to the public at City Hall, the library, and on the
City’s website through links to the Housing Rights Center (see Program 6 in the Housing
Plan).

                                     Appendix A
                  Evaluation of the 2008-2014 Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review the housing goals, policies, and programs of the
2008-2014 Housing Element, and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period. This analysis also includes an
assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The findings from this
evaluation have been instrumental in determining the City’s 2013-2021 Housing
Implementation Program.
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
with the source of funding, program objectives, accomplishments, and implications for
future policies and actions.
Table A-2 evaluates the appropriateness of previous goals and policies, and identifies
any changes that are called for in response to the City’s experience during the past
planning period. Based on this evaluation, all of the current Goals and Policies continue
to be appropriate and have been retained.
Table A-3 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the
previous Housing Element.

Hermosa Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                              Appendix B – Land Inventory
                                             Appendix B
                                    Residential Land Inventory
1.      Methodology and Assumptions
State law requires each city to include in the Housing Element an inventory of vacant
parcels having the potential for residential development, or “underutilized” parcels with
potential for additional development or redevelopment. The purpose of this inventory is
to evaluate whether there is sufficient capacity, based on the General Plan, zoning,
development standards, and infrastructure, to accommodate the City’s fair share of
regional growth needs as identified in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).
This analysis represents an estimate of the City’s realistic development potential. Actual
development will depend on the intentions of each property owner, market conditions
and other factors. The detailed methodology and assumptions for the residential land
inventory discussed in Chapter II are provided below.
The City has been allocated a growth need of 2 units during the 2014-2021 projection
period.
For potential new units in a city’s land inventory, state law establishes affordability
assumptions based on density. The “default” density for small metropolitan jurisdictions,
including Hermosa Beach, is 20 units per acre 12. This means that if the General Plan and
zoning allow development at 20 units per acre or greater, these sites are deemed
appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households.
In Hermosa Beach, the following residential zoning                 districts allow multi-family
development at densities greater than 20 units/acre:
                           District      Allowable Density
                           R-2           24.9 units/acre
                           R-2B          24.9 units/acre
                           R-3           33 units/acre
                           R-P           33 units/acre
In addition, the C-1 commercial district allows mixed-use development at a density of 33
units/acre. The allowable densities in all of these districts are significantly greater than the
state default density of 20 units/acre, therefore they are considered suitable for
accommodating the city’s lower-income housing need.
2.      Land Inventory
Table B-1 summarizes the city’s land inventory compared to the RHNA, while potential
sites for residential development are listed in Table B-2 and shown in Figure B-1. Vacant
sites have the potential of 8 lower-income units, which exceeds the RHNA allocation for
the planning period.

                         Public Participation Summary
This summary of Housing Element public-participation efforts describes
opportunities for public involvement along with an explanation of how public
comments were incorporated into the Housing Element. In addition, prior to the
adoption hearings all interested parties were given the opportunity to review the
recommended revisions.
Public participation is an important component of the planning process, and this
update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested
parties, particularly representatives of lower-income and special needs persons,
numerous opportunities for review and comment. Public notices of all Housing
Element meetings and public hearings were published in the local newspaper in
advance of each meeting, as well as posting the notices on the City’s website.
The draft Housing Element was made available for review at City Hall, posted on
the City’s website, as well as at the Public Library. The document was also made
available to housing advocates, mobile home residents, and non-profit
organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons and special
needs groups. Table C-1 on the following page lists persons and organizations
that were sent direct mail notice of public meetings for this Housing Element
update. In addition, public hearings are televised on the local cable channel.
After receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the State Housing
and Community Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element
was prepared and made available for public review prior to adoption by the
City Council.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of
this Housing Element update.
