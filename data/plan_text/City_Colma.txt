                                   5.03.000 INTRODUCTION
                                   5.03.010 PURPOSE
                                   The goals of the Circulation Element are to identify facilities for the
                                   safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible movement of people
                                   and goods through the Town, ensure these facilities reflect the land
                                   uses contemplated by the Land Use Element, and ensure a range
                                   of transportation options are available throughout the Town. The
                                   element accomplishes these goals by describing the Town’s existing
                                   circulation, identifying areas where improvements are required,
                                   and proposing policies and tasks to improve circulation. It includes
                                   a plan of the streets and highways designed to serve the community
                                   in the most efficient manner. Colma’s system is shown on the Land
                                   Use Map (Exhibit LU-2). Guidelines are given for the appropriate
                                   location, size and overall design of roads. Various improvements
                                   are recommended. Included are provisions for pedestrian and bike
                                   facilities and transportation for the entire community.
                                   The California Complete Streets Act requires that Colma plan a
                                   multimodal transportation network that allows for effective travel by
                                   motor vehicle, foot, bicycle, and transit to key destinations within
                                   the community and the larger region. The law emphasizes that cities
                                   prioritize the construction of public improvements that accelerate
                                   development of a balanced, multimodal transportation network.
                                   The element accomplishes this goal in-part through a Complete
                                   Streets Policy. The Town of Colma is committed to improving mobility
                                   whenever possible as capital improvement projects or private
                                   developments are considered. Exhibit C-8 shows the locations of
                                   existing and future bikeways.
                                   The element also defines certain scenic roads in Colma and
                                   recommends measures to maintain and improve their scenic
                                   qualities. Entry points to Colma are identified along selected routes.
                                   Landscaping and other treatments are recommended to enhance

2014                                                                                      Page 5.03.5

these gateways to the community. Scenic routes and gateways are
shown on the Scenic Routes Map (Exhibit C-1).
5.03.020 RELATION TO OTHER ELEMENTS
The Circulation Element is primarily related to the Land Use, Housing,
Safety and Open Space Elements. Circulation routes must consider
the accommodation of public utilities, the intensity and pattern of
land use, and the provision of logical connections among destination
points, retail areas, memorial park locations, as well as concentrations
of residential and employment groups to be served.
5.03.100 CIRCULATION SYSTEM
The street system within Colma is structured around State Highway
82, (El Camino Real) and Interstate Highway I-280, (Junipero Serra
Freeway) which carry traffic into and out of Town. The internal
street system consists of arterial streets, collector streets and local
streets. Usable road width, sight distance, and travel speed generally
decrease as one moves from major highways to local streets. Overall,
the amount of total traffic affecting Colma is anticipated to increase
by 2-3% per year on most streets as a result of increased development
in Colma and in the surrounding areas. This incremental increase
in traffic volume creates pressure for road widening, installation
of turn lanes along certain roads, and the installation of stop signs
and signals at certain intersections. In the following section each of
the major components is analyzed, its operating characteristics are
described and recommendations for improvements are given. Table
C-1 summarizes the operating characteristics of the system.
5.03.101 Capacity and Level of Service (LOS)
The Capacity of a roadway is the maximum number of vehicles that
can be handled in one hour by a given section of road under prevailing
conditions. The conditions which affect capacity include physical
conditions, such as width of roadway, number of lanes, alignment,
grade and surface condition, and operating conditions, such as
number of trucks and buses, traffic interruptions and distribution
characteristics of traffic into lanes. See Table C-1.
“Level of Service (LOS)” describes the general operating conditions
that a driver will experience while driving on a particular street
or highway. Six levels of service are used to describe the driving
experience under various speeds and traffic volume conditions. It is
typically the measure of operating conditions at road intersections.
Levels of service range from A to F, with A being a condition of free
movement, low traffic volumes and high speeds. Level F is a situation
of low operating speed, high volumes and stoppages. With Level
F conditions, traffic volumes are below capacity. Levels of Service

maneuverability is limited by higher volumes, and Level of Service D,
characterized by very limited maneuverability and long delays where
traffic flow is approaching an unstable condition, are the generally

Serramonte Boulevard interchange provides a northbound on-ramp
and a southbound off-ramp only. A northbound off-ramp exists in the
vicinity of D Street at Junipero Serra Boulevard in Daly City.
There are weaving conflicts between the Serramonte Boulevard on-
ramp traffic and the I-280 traffic accessing the D Street (Eastmoor)
and Highway 1 off-ramps. These conflicts could be reduced by
constructing a fly-over for Highway 1 traffic.
5.03.112 State Highway 82 (El Camino Real)
State Highway 82 is a major north/south route extending from San
Francisco, south to San Jose. North of F Street it becomes Mission
Street; south of F Street it becomes El Camino Real. Highway 82 bisects
the Town of Colma with three lanes in each direction, narrowing
to two lanes in each direction south of Mission Road. Most of El
Camino has a 28-foot wide landscaped median. There are overhead
electric, telephone, and cable TV lines along both sides of the street
starting just south of F Street to the Town’s southern boundary. On-
street parking is allowed, but few vehicles park along El Camino Real

                                   because of the small number of business frontages and available off-
                                   street parking. Sidewalks have been installed on the entire east side
                                   of the roadway, but the west side lacks sidewalks north of the Greek
                                   Cemetery Driveway and south of Cypress Lawn (which transitions
                                   into the jurisdiction of South San Francisco). Ultimately, sidewalks
                                   should be constructed on both sides of the street along the entire
                                   length of El Camino Real. Although El Camino Real is a designated
                                   bicycle route, there are no marked bicycle lanes and no sidewalk or
                                   bicycle facilities have been provided north from South San Francisco

                                   driveways onto El Camino Real can be dangerous at times due to
                                   the width of El Camino Real (three lanes in each direction) and at
                                   times the high speeds of traffic. The wide median is important for
                                   the protection it provides. Median landscaping improvements must
                                   not obscure lines of sight. Controls on left-turn movements should
                                   be considered. Likewise, access to parcels fronting El Camino Real
                                   south of Mission Road is potentially hazardous due to poor visibility
                                   caused by the curvature of the road, and the relatively high speed
                                   of traffic. Left turns to and from these parcels should be restricted.
                                   Access to parcels with frontage on both El Camino Real and Mission
                                   Road should be restricted to Mission Road. In general, additional

                                   to protect the greenbelt appearance and to promote traffic safety.
                                   Where possible, access should be from other streets.

                                   The State of California has identified I-280 as a State Scenic Highway
                                   from the Santa Clara County line to the San Bruno City limit. The
                                   section from the San Bruno City limit north through Colma is an
                                   Eligible State Scenic Highway – not officially designated. Although
                                   the State has no jurisdiction over development in Colma, local
                                   consideration should be given to what is visible from the highway.
                                   For the most part there is a sense of open space that prevails except
                                   in the vicinity of Serramonte Boulevard where Colma’s commercial
                                   core is concentrated.
                                   While traveling on I-280, San Bruno Mountain is a major focal
                                   point to views east of the freeway. The existing backdrop of trees
                                   along most cemetery boundaries provides an important buffer at
                                   the edge of urban development. As long as the Town’s open space
                                   character is maintained by retaining large tree buffers and adding

new landscaping with future development, the view of Colma from the freeway
will remain nearly the same.
Landscaping along El Camino Real adds to the road’s scenic quality and
successfully reinforces Colma’s open space character. The median is landscaped
with lawn, which contributes a greenbelt theme. This should be enhanced with
other landscape elements to create a distinctive appearance through Colma.
Tree planting along the roadway and undergrounding of the overhead utility
lines is recommended to better define the corridor and further contribute to
the road’s scenic quality. Site planning criteria for development along the El
Camino Real scenic corridor should be adopted in order to maximize the visual
effects of landscaping.
5.03.114 Entry Gateways
Colma’s image is dependent on what is seen from the road as people approach
and move into the Town. A key feature of Colma’s General Plan is the recognition
of natural gateways to the community along specified routes. Colma’s separate
identity and sense of containment is strengthened by nine gateway locations:
    •	   El Camino Real - North: In median near intersection of B 			
    	    Street
    •	   El Camino Real - South: At Mission Road, in landscaped area

Most of Colma’s natural gateway locations are formally identified with
landscaping and a stone sign which reads, “Welcome to Colma,” but
there are some locations which haven’t yet been formally identified
due to anticipated capital improvement projects or intersection
reconfigurations. Appropriate landscaping and a stone sign reading,
“Welcome to Colma,” should be installed at the following remaining
locations:
    •	   El Camino Real - South: At Mission Road, in landscaped area 	
    	    forming “Y” intersection
    •	   Hillside Boulevard – North: In median near Hoffman Street

The nine gateway locations are shown on Exhibit C-1.
5.03.150 ARTERIAL STREETS
Arterial streets connect Colma’s residential, commercial and cemetery
districts and provide a link to surrounding communities. Arterials
also act as alternative north-south routes should the major highway
system be blocked. Arterial streets should ideally contain two lanes
in each direction with no on-street parking, sidewalks at least five
feet wide on both sides of the street and a minimal number of access
points. A planting strip should be created adjacent to the sidewalk to
enhance the appearance of the road. Existing arterial streets in Colma
may not be built to this standard but any future arterials should have
a minimum 70 foot right-of-way with a minimum roadway width
of 56 feet curb to curb including medians. Some flexibility will be

5.03.151 Junipero Serra Boulevard
Junipero Serra Boulevard (JSB) is a north/south arterial street
extending from Daly City, through Colma, and into South San
Francisco. Traffic signals are located at Serramonte Boulevard, the
entrance to the Serra Shopping Center, Southgate Avenue and Colma
Boulevard. JSB has four lanes of traffic that travel in north and south
directions, with occasional right-turning lanes. The four lanes of traffic
are divided by raised landscape medians. A sidewalk exists along the
vast majority of the east side of the street, along with bicycle paths
                                                                           Junipero Serra Boulevard
that run the entire length of JSB within the Town of Colma. On-street
parking is prohibited along the entire length of Junipero Serra.
5.03.152 Serramonte Boulevard
Serramonte Boulevard is a four lane collector street extending from
St. Francis Boulevard in Daly City to Hillside Boulevard in Colma.
There is a partial interchange with I-280 consisting of a southbound
off-ramp and a northbound on-ramp. Colma’s major retail core,
which includes auto dealerships and shopping centers, is centered
on Serramonte Boulevard between Junipero Serra Boulevard and El
Camino Real.
There are sidewalks along both sides of Serramonte between Junipero         Serramonte Boulevard
Serra Boulevard and El Camino Real, and along the south side only
from El Camino Real to Hillside Boulevard. Currently the low level of
pedestrian activity and the presence of an existing cemetery on the
north side of the road minimizes the need to develop a sidewalk on
both sides. However, the addition of a sidewalk on the north side will
be considered when upgrades to Serramonte Boulevard are needed.
Parking is not allowed along any portions of Serramonte Boulevard.
The lack of left turn lanes to driveways along Serramonte Boulevard
is a potential source of congestion. Loading and unloading of car
carriers or other vehicles on the street is prohibited.
About 700 feet west of El Camino Real, Serramonte Boulevard
passes over a parcel owned by the San Francisco Water Company. A
portion of this parcel has the potential to be an open space amenity.
Landscaping should be required against the retaining wall at the
west edge of the property, along the east edge of the site for runoff
percolation and along the Collins Avenue and Serramonte Boulevard
frontages. The Town should work with the San Francisco Water
Company to determine what improvements are possible.

                                   is controlled by a stop sign. Left turns from Mission Road into the
                                   south bound lane of El Camino Real are prohibited because of poor
                                   sight lines and fast-moving traffic; instead, motorists must make a
                                   u-turn at one of several median breaks on El Camino Real. On-street
                                   parking is allowed on both sides of Mission Road, although there are
                                   time restricted zones in some areas. Most of this route has sidewalks
                                   along both sides of the street. Auto repair uses in this area result
                                   in heavy demand for parking both on-and off-street. A program of
               Mission Road        restriping to add bicycle lanes coupled with sidewalk and landscape
                                   improvements is recommended to improve bicycle, pedestrian and

                                   sidewalk and pavement treatments, street furniture, and decorative

                                   Hillside Boulevard is a north-south arterial roadway connecting Daly
                                   City near the San Francisco city limits, through Colma, to Highway 101
                                   in South San Francisco. Hillside Boulevard has been striped for two
                                   lanes through Colma. Traffic signals are located at Olivet Parkway,
                                   Serramonte Boulevard, and Lawndale Boulevard. The intersections
           Hillside Boulevard      at F Street and at Hoffman Street are controlled by stop signs.
                                   Sidewalks are going to be installed on both sides of Hillside Boulevard
                                   between Serramonte Boulevard and Hoffman Street (these Phase 1
                                   improvements from Hoffman Street to Serramonte Boulevard are
                                   scheduled for construction in the latter half of 2014, see Exhibit
                                   C-3). Future capital improvement plans will incorporate a continuous
                                   sidewalk from Serramonte Boulevard on the west side of the roadway
                                   to Lawndale Boulevard. Hillside Boulevard is a designated bicycle
                                   route with marked bicycle lanes.
                                   5.03.155 Lawndale Boulevard
                                   Lawndale is a east/west connector between Hillside Boulevard and
                                   Mission Road. Pacific Gas and Electric Company have installed gas and
          Lawndale Boulevard       electric transmission lines the entire length of Lawndale Boulevard.
                                   5.03.156 Scenic Corridor - Arterial Streets
                                   Hillside Boulevard is designated a scenic corridor in Colma. It is
                                   located at a higher elevation than the rest of the Town. Therefore, the
                                   drive along Hillside provides unique foreground views of San Bruno
                                   Mountain and panoramic views of Colma, South San Francisco, and
                                   Daly City.
                                   The view to the east along the Hillside Boulevard corridor is mostly of
                                   San Bruno Mountain and open space, including flower growing plots,
                                   cemeteries, and a few houses. The view to the west overlooks Colma

and its surrounding communities (refer to the Scenic Route Map).
Part of this view is blocked by roadside fencing and vegetation, which
emphasizes the view to the east. Consequently this adds variety and
interest to Hillside Boulevard.
As one travels along Hillside Boulevard there is a rural character to the
corridor. There is a sense of separation from the urban development
that surrounds Colma. This atmosphere should be protected if any
development occurs along the Hillside Boulevard scenic corridor.
Special care should be given to the landscape treatment associated
with future uses along this route.                                         Collins Avenue
5.03.200 COLLECTOR STREETS
Collector streets serve the important function of transferring traffic
from local traffic generators such as shopping and employment areas
to the arterials. Collector streets do not form a continuous system
-- otherwise there would be a tendency to use them as arterials. The
Plan for Colma includes collectors serving the Sterling Park residential
area and the Core Commercial area.
The recommended standard for two-lane collectors is a 50-foot right-
of-way with a minimum 36-foot wide roadway, curb to curb. Collector
streets should have a five foot wide sidewalk on both sides of the        Colma Boulevard
street. Four-lane collectors should have at least a 60 foot right-of-
way with a minimum 46-foot wide roadway curb-to-curb. A planting
strip should be created adjacent to the sidewalks to enhance the
appearance of the road. Existing collector roadways serving Colma
have not been built to these standards, but any future collectors
should be. Some flexibility will be needed to match new work to old
work in the field.
5.03.210 Collins Avenue
Collins Avenue is a two-lane road which connects El Camino Real at
its east end with Serramonte Boulevard at its west end. There is an
existing sidewalk along Collins Avenue on the south side of the street
near Junipero Serra Boulevard. In the western portion of Collins
Avenue, parking is allowed only along the south side of the street. The
eastern portion has a wider roadway, sidewalks and parking lanes on
both sides of the street in accordance with the Collins Avenue Plan
Line specifications (refer to Exhibit C-5). Collins Avenue descends
from west to east and is bordered by a steep downslope along most
of its north side.
The Town requires improvements to Collins Avenue as a condition
of approval of new development projects. Improvements have
occurred incrementally and some segments of the street still need
to be improved.

5.03.211 Colma Boulevard
Colma Boulevard is a collector connecting Junipero Serra Boulevard
with El Camino Real. It has two lanes in each direction but widens to
four lanes at the west end for access to abutting commercial uses.
No on-street parking is allowed. A sidewalk exists on the entire north
side of the street. On the south side there is no sidewalk in front of
the Greenlawn Paupers’ Cemetery.
5.03.212 D Street and F Street
F Street provides access to the Sterling Park neighborhood between
Hillside Boulevard and El Camino Real. As part of the Sterling Park Street
Beautification Program, this segment has received improvements
such as street trees, ornamental light fixtures, underground utilities
and special paving.
West of El Camino Real, F Street turns northwest, passes by the Colma

BART station, merges with D Street, and ultimately leads to Junipero
Serra Boulevard and an I-280 on-ramp. Approximately two-thirds of
this segment is part of unincorporated San Mateo County, not within
the Colma Town Limits.
On-street parking is allowed on the F Street portion between Hillside
and El Camino Real, and along some portions between El Camino
Real and Junipero Serra Boulevard. The intersections at El Camino
Real are not aligned, so in effect the two segments function as
two different streets. There is a signal at El Camino Real serving
the western segment and a stop sign at El Camino Real serving the
                                                                                 Clark Avenue
eastern segment.
5.03.213 Clark Avenue
Clark Avenue is two-lane residential collector street running north/
south between A Street in San Mateo County and F Street in Colma
(Clark Avenue extends further north to Fisher Street in Daly City).
Clark Avenue to A Street is a principal route in and out of the Sterling
Park residential area, particularly for residents on D and E Streets.
Sidewalks are provided and parking is allowed on both sides of the
street.
5.03.250 LOCAL STREETS
                                                                          Sterling Park Streetscape
The function of local streets is to provide access directly to abutting
property. Local streets play an important secondary role as locations
for utilities, locations for easements, open space for light and air, and
firebreaks between buildings. Through traffic from one part of the
Town to another is not intended to be carried on local streets.
The recommended standard for any new two-lane local residential
street consists of a 60 foot right-of-way with a paved surface 36 feet
wide, curb to curb. Road width can be reduced in special cases where
no on-street parking is allowed (minimum road width is 28 feet).
Sidewalks should be constructed on both sides of local residential
streets, measuring at least five feet wide.
In 1998 the local streets in the Sterling Park neighborhood were
upgraded through the Sterling Park Street Beautification Program.
Due to existing constraints the improvements resulted in a 30
foot curb-to-curb distance within a 60 foot right-of-way. Initially
conceived of as a utility undergrounding project, the program has
resulted in the installation of street trees, ornamental light fixtures,
and special paving. These improvements have significantly improved
the appearance of the neighborhood, demonstrating how public
works projects can be used to enhance neighborhoods.

                                          Private streets may be permitted for planned residential, commercial
                                          or cemetery developments in Colma. The improved width of private
                                          roads should be designed to accommodate the level of traffic the
                                          road is expected to carry. The minimum standard for a private road
                                          with no on-street parking is a 24 foot wide paved surface from curb to
                                          curb. All curbs should be vertical to facilitate drainage and cleaning.
                                          5.03.252 “Paper” Streets
                                          The Cypress Hills District has a series of public easements remaining
                                          from when the land was originally platted for development. Although
                                          the streets were never built, a number of lots within the platted area
                                          were sold speculatively. These lots, known as “in-holding” lots, have
                                          not been developed, but nevertheless the Town is obliged to maintain
                                          the paper streets as a theoretical means of access. The paper streets
                                          remain on the County Assessor’s maps.The Town supports land owner
                                          applications to abandon paper streets that do not provide access to
                                          in-holding lots, are not needed for utility purposes or are redundant
                                          with other paper streets. Applications are typically considered along
                                          with Lot Line Adjustment requests.
                                          5.03.253 Cypress Hills Access Road (Proposed)
                                          Within Cypress Lawn Memorial Park, a loop road will eventually
                                          extend from the cemetery entrance at Hillside/Serramonte to the

                                          Boulevard. This access loop is intended to provide emergency access
                                          to cemetery properties and the base of San Bruno Mountain. The

road will be a private road, available for police and fire emergency
use but general public access will be resticted.
5.03.254 Decommissioned Landfill/Park Access Road
Access to the decommissioned Hillside Landfill is provided by
a two-lane road (Sand Hill Road; privately owned road). If the
decommissioned landfill is redeveloped in the future, this access
road will become the entrance to the site. The actual configuration
and routing of the road may change depending on final end uses and
conformance to accessability and emergency access standards.
5.03.300 STREET TREES
Street trees can improve Colma’s appearance and provide a link
between cemetery/open space and developed areas, especially
where new development occurs. Street trees can enhance the
building scale and soften the visual impact of development in new
and existing areas, and can also act as a moderator to Colma’s windy
climate. Street trees are an important element of landscape plans
and should be required as a condition of private development, where
possible. A street tree program should be implemented along arterial
and collector streets, where needed. The Town’s Climate Action
Plan encourages/mandates the planting of street trees when street
projects or opportunities exist.
5.03.350 PARKING
5.03.351 Off-Street Parking
Colma’s Zoning Ordinance specifies the size and amount of off-street
parking required for various types of land uses. Off-street parking
keeps the roadways clear, reducing potential conflicts and facilitating
traffic movement. To the maximum extent possible all parking should
be off-street in Colma. On-street parking, where available, should be
oriented primarily to short-term convenience use.
5.03.352 Facilities for the Disabled
The State of California Administrative Code requires that parking
spaces for disabled persons be provided near the entrance to public
buildings, business developments and multiple unit residential
projects. Colma uses these standards for its off-street parking
requirements for the disabled.
Curb ramps are essential for facilitating wheelchair access along
City sidewalks and at street crossings. These facilities should be
constructed at every street intersection whether signalized or not.
Wheelchair access should also be incorporated where driveways

                                   unable to use the regular bus service. In addition, some SamTrans
                                   buses on local routes are equipped with wheelchair lifts.

                                   The Town should encourage the provision of pedestrian trails and
                                   walkways where opportunities arise. Opportunities include walkways
                                   along the open sections of Colma Creek, and a pedestrian path along
                                   the San Francisco Water Company right-of-way between Serramonte
                                   Boulevard and Collins Avenue. Likewise, the Town should maintain its
                                   sidewalk policy, which requires new development projects to provide
                                   sidewalks as a condition of development. Future improvements to
                                   still be considered or constructed are:

                                         upgrades, bike lanes, street parking, a sidewalk on the east side
                                         (there already exists a sidewalk on the west side), high visibility
                                         crosswalks, pedestrian and vehicular lighting, and landscaping
                                         consisting of rain gardens and street trees, were approved as
                                         part of the Capital Improvement Plan in 2013. Improvments will

                                   For the addition of bicycle lanes to existing streets, San Mateo County
                                   has prepared and adopted a comprehensive San Mateo County
                                   Comprehensive Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan (September, 2011 –
                                   prepared by C/CAG). This plan includes proposed segments in Colma.
                                   Within Colma, existing bicycle facilities are currently limited to a
                                   Class II lane along a Hillside Boulevard and Junipero Serra Boulevard;
                                   however, there are several proposed segments in the County’s Plan

      5. Serramonte Boulevard between Hillside Boulevard and
      Junipero Serra: Unclassified on-street. Since Serramonte is
      narrow, steep and with high traffic volumes, any designated bike
      use would need to be studied.
5.03.421 Bikeway Classifications
      Class 1: Bike Path. A separate right-of-way for bicyclists and
      pedestrians with minimal automobile cross-flow, a minimum
      two-way paved width of eight feet.
      Class 2: Bike Lane. A dedicated five foot wide, one-way, striped
      lane for bicyclists within the existing street right-of-way, for
      bicyclists which allows for vehicle parking, pedestrians, and
      automobile crossflows.
      Class 3: Bike Route. Shared right-of-way with signage and
      possibly pavement markings which delineate shared use of the
      roadway with vehicles and pedestrians.
Unclassified on-street lanes would allow for bicycles, but may not
have any regular improvements or signage. See Exhibit C-7 for bicycle
facility design standards.

PROGRAMS
The public road system allows schedule and routing flexibility for
those who use it. In contrast, transportation facilities (such as public
transit) provide for the movement of goods and people generally
along fixed routes and on a fixed schedule. Colma is fortunate to have

access to three different modes of public transportation: air, rail, and
bus. In addition, Colma residents and workers can take advantage of
paratransit opportunities. The Town also has a Transportation System
Management program.
5.03.510 PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
5.03.511 Air Transit
San Francisco International Airport is located approximately six miles
from Colma, east of Highway 101 and adjacent to the Cities of San
Bruno and Millbrae. The airport is a major regional passenger and
cargo air terminal and the seventh most active commercial airfield
in the world. It can be reached by Colma residents via private auto,
SamTrans bus, and BART.
5.03.512 San Mateo County Transit Facilities
San Mateo Transit District (SamTrans) provides bus service throughout
San Mateo County with connections to the Colma, Daly City, and
South San Francisco BART Stations, San Francisco International
Airport, Peninsula CalTrain Stations, San Francisco Greyhound Depot,
and Downtown San Francisco’s TransBay Terminal. It also provides
access to Santa Clara County Transit, with connections in Menlo Park
and Palo Alto.
Colma residents can catch SamTrans Mainline Routes along El
Camino Real or SamTrans Local Routes along El Camino Real and
Junipero Serra Boulevard. Senior citizens and disabled patrons may
ride anywhere in the County for a reduced fare.
5.03.513 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)
The Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) runs trains north and
south through the Colma station. North bound trains pass through
Daly City and San Francisco stations on their way to the East Bay (East
Bay destinations include Richmond, Pittsburg/Baypoint, Dublin and
Fremont), and south bound trains pass through South San Francisco,
San Bruno, and Milbrae stations on their way to San Francisco
International Airport. Trains run Monday through Friday from 4:00
A.M. to midnight and on Saturday and Sunday from 6:00 A.M. to
midnight. The Colma BART station is located at Mission Street and
Albert M. Teglia Boulevard, just north of the Colma Town Limits. The
station has parking for 1400 automobiles.
5.03.514 BART to San Francisco International
In 2003, an 8.7 mile BART extension to the San Francisco International
Airport was completed. In Colma, the extension follows the former
route of the SPRR. This route runs roughly parallel to El Camino
Real from F Street to the Mission Road “Y”, then roughly parallels
Mission Road to the South San Francisco city limits. The extension       Source: 2014 JetHub LLC

                                   of trees and groundcover so that the existence of BART is virtually
                                   undetectable, supporting Colma’s greenbelt theme. BART stations
                                   are in operation at South San Francisco, San Bruno, Millbrae, and
                                   within the airport at the International Terminal. The Millbrae station
                                   is “intermodal,” providing a direct connection to CalTrain.

                                   CalTrain station is located approximately four miles away in South
                                   San Francisco. The station can be reached by Colma residents via
                                   private auto, SamTrans, cycling, or via BART through Milbrae’s BART/
                                   CalTrain intermodal station.
                                   5.03.516 Paratransit
                                   Paratransit can best be described as participant or provider scheduled,
                                   collective transit using smaller vehicles such as vans and automobiles.
                                   Colma is fortunate to have many types of paratransit available for the
                                   benefit of citizens, employees and customers of local establishments.
                                   The following are examples of paratransit operating in Colma:
                                   5.03.516.1 511.org. 511 is managed by a partnership of public
                                   agencies led by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission,
                                   the California Highway Patrol, and the California Department of
                                   Transportation. 511 was developed with the mission to provide
                                   comprehensive, accurate, reliable and useful multimodal travel
                                   information to meet the needs of Bay Area travelers. All Bay Area
                                   transit agencies are partners, so users can find resources for all
                                   modes of transport around the Bay Area.
                                   5.03.516.2 Redi-Wheels. SamTrans provides on-call, curb to curb
                                   service for disabled and elderly residents of San Mateo County. Total
                                   ridership has increased steadily since its first year of service in 1980.
                                   5.03.516.3 Airport Shuttle Services. Numerous airport shuttle
                                   services provide pickup service from or to a home or business in
                                   Colma to or from San Francisco International Airport. Airport shuttles
                                   provides a cost effective and efficient alternative to driving and
                                   parking for airport transfers.
                                   5.03.516.4 Taxis. Private taxi companies are another form of
                                   paratransit in Colma. Colma is served by taxicab companies located in
                                   Pacifica, Daly City, unicorporated Daly City and South San Francisco.
                                   Cumulatively, there are over fifty (50) cabs available for these nearby
                                   companies to serve Colma. Due to the difficulty in monitoring taxi

companies and current satisfactory service, it is the current policy
of the Town to discourage the establishment of a new taxi service in
Colma.
5.03.516.5 Auto Dealer Shuttles. Many of the local auto dealers
provide a shuttle service to customers who are having auto repair
work done on their cars. These shuttles assist individuals who live or
work in Colma or neighboring communities.
5.03.517 Transportation System Management (TSM)
Transportation System Management seeks to limit expansion of
parking and roadway improvements in favor of meeting future
transportation demand by better usage of existing facilities. TSM
includes such measures as car pooling, van pooling, variable work
hours, high occupancy vehicle lanes, park and ride facilities, parking
management, and facilities for bicycle commuters. TSM techniques
generally serve to meet increased demand without large scale
investments to increase capacity. The Town of Colma currently has a
TSM ordinance which outlines the responsibilities and opportunities of
the program within the bay area. Employers of 25 or more individuals
are encouraged to participate in the program to provide information
and alternatives to employees to reduce automobile dependence.
The Town seeks to establish bicycle paths when possible.
5.03.520 CONGESTION MANAGEMENT
New development projects should be reviewed for their impacts on
the transportation infrastructure. The impact of a specific project
can vary depending on its relationship to roadways and public
transportation facilities.
If a new or redeveloped project is projected to add a net 100 or more
trips during any peak period (defined as 6-10AM and/or 3-7PM), a
report must be made to the City/County Association of Governments
of San Mateo County (C/CAG).
Local jurisdictions must ensure that the developer and/or tenants
will mitigate all of the new peak hour trips generated by the project
by selecting one or more of the options that follow. It is up to the
local jurisdiction working together with the project sponsor to
choose the methods that will be compatible with the intended
purpose of the project. Additional measures to those listed below
may be proposed for consideration by C/CAG in advance of
approving the project, this list is not all inclusive:.
1. Reduce the scope of the project so that it will generate less than
100 peak hour trips.
2. Build adequate roadway and/or transit improvements so that

                                   the added peak hour trips will have no measurable impact on the
                                   Congestion Management Program roadway network.
                                   3. Contribute an amount per peak hour trip to a special fund for
                                   improvements to the Congestion Management Program roadway
                                   network. This amount will be set annually by C/CAG based on a
                                   nexus test.
                                   4. Require the developer and all subsequent tenants to implement
                                   Transportation Demand Management programs that mitigate the
                                   new peak hour trips. A list of acceptable programs and the equivalent
                                   number of trips that are mitigated will be provided by C/CAG annually.
                                   Programs can be mixed and matched so long as the total mitigated
                                   trips is equal to or greater than the new peak hour trips generated by
                                   the project. These programs, once implemented, must be on-going for
                                   the occupied life of the development. Programs may be substituted
                                   with prior approval of C/CAG, so long as the number of mitigated trips
                                   is not reduced. Additional measures may be proposed to C/CAG for
                                   consideration. Also there may be special circumstances that warrant
                                   a different amount of credit for certain measures. These situations
                                   can also be submitted to C/CAG in advance for consideration.
                                   5.03.600 SCENIC ROUTES MAP
                                   5.03.610 SCENIC ROUTES
                                   El Camino Real, Hillside Boulevard, and Junipero Serra Boulevard have
                                   been defined as scenic routes through Colma. Key visual features of
                                   each have been described on the Scenic Routes Map. A generalized
                                   view corridor is shown along each of the routes. A more detailed
                                   analysis of each route, for the purpose of establishing precise
                                   boundaries for these corridors, is beyond the scope of the General
                                   Plan, butut an analysis with specific corridor plans should be prepared
                                   in the future. The width of the corridor should be maximized when
                                   scenic quality is high, and minimized where existing development
                                   forms the visual boundary (see Exhibit C-1).
                                   3.611 Protection of the Scenic Corridors
                                   Every effort should be made to protect the overall visual experience
                                   along each of the identified scenic corridors, primarily through
                                   enforcement of sensitive site planning. Distant, panoramic views of
                                   Colma and its environs can be appreciated in a number of locations.
                                   In these locations (see Exhibit C-1), first priority should be in keeping
                                   buildings out of the corridor so that views are not blocked. In some
                                   cases, noise compatibility planning will support this approach. Where
                                   development is permitted in the corridor, landscaping should be
                                   required to screen views of buildings, and to quickly cover any scars

left from grading. The open quality of views should be retained by concentrating
landscape materials near the objects to be screened rather than by creating a wall
of vegetation adjacent to the road.
5.03.620 CRITERIA FOR SITE PLANNING IN SCENIC CORRIDORS
Each development project within scenic corridors should be located, sited and
designed to carefully fit within its environment. The scenic character of the site
should be maintained as much as possible. The following criteria can be applied to
development proposals in meeting the above stated goals.
5.03.621 Site Planning
5.03.621.1 All roads, buildings and other structural improvements or land coverage
should be located, sited and designed to fit the natural topography.
5.03.621.2 All development should be sited and designed to minimize the impacts
of noise, light, glare and odors on adjacent properties and the community-at-large.
5.03.621.3 No use, development or alteration should create uniform, geometrically-
terraced building sites which are contrary to the natural land form or which
substantially detract from the scenic and visual quality of the Town.
5.03.621.4 Development should not contribute to the instability of the parcel
or adjoining lands, and all structural proposals including excavation, proposed
roads and other pavement should adequately compensate for adverse subsurface
conditions. Roads and structures should not be located where downward lateral
forces can adversely effect a slope or creek bank.
5.03.622 Paved Areas
5.03.622.1 The number of access roads to a Scenic Corridor shall be minimized
wherever possible. Development access roads shall be combined, with the intent
of minimizing intersections with scenic roads.
5.03.622.2 Small, separate parking areas are preferred to single large parking lots.
5.03.622.3 Paved areas should be integrated into the site, related to their structure,
General Plan - Circulation Element                                                     Administrative Code
2014                                                                                   Page 5.03.32
        and should be landscaped to reduce their visual impact from scenic corridors. Textured paving
        should be considered.
        5.03.623 Landscaping and Views
        5.03.623.1 Public views within and from Scenic Corridors should be protected and enhanced, and
        development should not be allowed to significantly obscure, detract from, or negatively affect the
        quality of these views. Vegetative screening may be used to mitigate such impacts.
        5.03.623.2 Selective clearing of vegetation, which allows the display of important public views
        may be permitted.
        5.03.623.3 Wherever possible, vegetation removed during construction should be replaced.
        Vegetation for the stabilization of graded areas or for replacement of existing vegetation shall be
        selected and located to be compatible with surrounding vegetation, and should recognize climatic,
        soil and ecological characteristics of Colma.
        5.03.623.4 A smooth transition should be maintained between development and adjacent open
        areas through the use of natural landscaping and plant materials which are native or appropriate
        to the area.
        5.03.623.5 Screening, as required under these design criteria, should not consist of solid fencing,
        rather it should be of natural materials of the area, preferably vegetation appropriate to the area
        in conjunction with low earth berms.
        5.03.624 Architecture
        5.03.624.1 The design of the structure should be appropriate to the use of the property and in
        harmony with the shape, size and scale of adjacent buildings in the community.
        5.03.624.2 The architectural style of new buildings should incor­porate a Spanish Mediterranean
        design theme with pitched roofs and varied horizontal planes to create shadows. Exceptions
        may be approved where this approach would clash with existing structures having historical or
        architectural merit.
        5.03.624.3 Highly reflective surfaces and colors are discouraged.
        5.03.625 Signs
        5.03.625.1 No signs should be permitted within the front setback, or on rooftops. Billboard sings
        and pole signs should not be permitted within scenic corridors.
        5.03.625.2 Signs appropriate for use in a scenic corridor are small identification signs, small
        building face signs and monument signs. Night lighting should be limited to direct spot lighting.

5.03.626 Utilities
5.03.626.1 Overhead utility lines should be placed underground to reduce the visual impact along scenic
corridors.
5.03.626.2 Underground utility lines will be required for all new public and private developments.
5.03.626.3 Public utility structures shall be designed and sited so as to have an uncluttered appearance,
subordinate to the setting.

restriping, accessing above and underground utilities, signalization
operations or modifications, and maintenance of landscaping/
related features.
(4) All Projects and Phases. Complete Streets infrastructure shall
be incorporated into all planning, funding, design, approval, and
implementation processes for any construction, reconstruction,
retrofit, maintenance, operations, alteration, or repair of streets
(specific infrastructure for a given category of users may be excluded
if an exemption is approved via the process set forth in section C. 1
of this policy).                                                                      Bicyclists

5.03.812 Implementation
(1) Plan Consultation and Consistency. Maintenance, planning,
and design of projects affecting the transportation system shall be
consistent with local bicycle, pedestrian, transit, multimodal, and
other relevant plans, except when such consistency cannot be achieved
without negative consequences. In such instances, consistency shall
not be required if the head of the relevant department provides
written approval explaining the basis of such deviation.
(2) Street Network/Connectivity. As feasible, the Town of Colma shall
incorporate Complete Streets features into existing streets to improve       Sterling Park Streetscape
the safety and convenience of users and to create employment,
with the particular goal of creating a connected network of facilities
accommodating each category of users, and increasing connectivity
across jurisdictional boundaries and for existing and anticipated
future areas of travel origination or destination.
(3) Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee Consultation. Since the
Town of Colma is a jurisdiction of fewer than 10,000 people, and does
not have a Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee, the Capital
Improvement Program (CIP) committee comprised of representatives
of the Town’s Public Works, Engineering, Planning, Police, Recreation

                                   contemplated by the Town. The Committee may seek outside input
                                   from the community or other groups as part of their decision making
                                   process.
                                   (4) Evaluation. All relevant agencies or departments shall perform
                                   evaluations of how well the streets and transportation network of
                                   the Town of Colma are serving each category of users by collecting
                                   baseline data and collecting follow-up data on a regular basis.

5.02.220 TEMPORARY USES OF LAND
A minor, short-term, or temporary use of land
may be permitted after consideration of the use,
its proposed location and duration and upon
making a finding that the use will have negligible
or no permanent effects on the environment.
Temporary use permits will normally be
considered only when the use is consistent with
the underlying zoning, such as the use of a
portion of a commercial parking lot for Christmas
Tree sales or a radio promotion. Temporary
permits may, however, be granted even when
the zoning designation would not normally
accommodate the proposed use. Examples
include short term use of open space or
cemetery land for the mobilization of equipment
and supplies needed to construct regional transit
facilities, use of open space or cemetery land
for mobilization of equipment and supplies
needed to repair regional utility infrastructure
or use of an established but unused parking lot
for temporary off-street parking.

                     Colma’s location just south of San Francisco and Daly City makes it a desirable
                     and slightly more affordable location to live than San Francisco, with easy transit
                     into San Francisco from the Colma and South San Francisco BART stations.
                     Colma is also a regional shopping destination for automobiles and retail goods.
                     Colma has limited land available for new development given that about 76% of
                     its two square miles is devoted to cemetery land uses. Remaining land uses
                     include developed residential properties and commercial uses.
                     The San Francisco Bay Area continues to be one of the most desirable and
                     expensive real estate markets in the country. Despite the economic downturn
                     and a lowering of housing prices that began in 2008, rents generally continued
                     to rise throughout region. Housing sales prices have regained losses associated
                     with the recession and most Bay Area homes are too expensive for families with
                     average household incomes to afford. Despite its small size and limited land
                     resources, opportunities exist within Colma to provide new and affordable
                     housing with good transit access.
                     In a collaborative process, the 20 cities of San Mateo County and the County of
                     San Mateo formed a countywide “Sub-region,” an ad-hoc joint powers authority
                     formed to specifically administer ABAG’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation
                     (RHNA) process. From this process, it was determined that Colma’s allocation is
                     59 units, 37 of which are allocated as units affordable to moderate, low, very-
                     low and extremely low income households. The RHNA applies to the years 2015
                     to 2023. No units have been developed within Colma since 2009, leaving an
                     estimated need of 59 units for the 2015 – 2023 period. Colma has the capacity

                          The contents of the 2015 Housing Element include an analysis of population,
                          employment and housing trends, an evaluation of housing needs, statements of
                          goals and policies, a schedule of programs and actions, and an estimate of the
                          number of housing units the Town expects to be developed, improved and
                          maintained in the local housing stock. Programs and policies in the 2009
                          Housing Element were evaluated and modified where necessary to reflect

                     organized into the following sections:

                          Housing Goals, Policies, and Programs
                     Background and History of the Housing Element
                     The Town of Colma has previously adopted several Housing Elements, as
                     follows:
                          •   1991 Housing Element (1988-1995 Planning Period);
                          •   1999 Housing Element (prepared with comprehensive General Plan
                              update, 1995-1999 Planning Period);
                          •   2004 Housing Element (1999-2007 Planning Period); and
                          •   2009 Housing Element (2007-2014 Planning Period; adopted October
                              2012)
                     When referred to in the text of this document, previous Housing Elements will
                     be referenced primarily by date and title and not planning period. This Housing
                     Element is an update and revision of the 2009 Housing Element, adopted in
                     October 2012. This current Housing Element is titled and referenced as the 2015
                     Housing Element throughout this document. The State of California requires
                     housing element updates at regularly designated time periods or when a city or
                     town makes any change in its policies, zoning and land use designations. State
                     law mandates that all cities in the San Francisco Bay Area submit an adopted
                     housing element by January 31, 2015 which takes into account the housing
                     needs assessment numbers allocated to the jurisdiction by the Association of
                     Bay Area Governments, or ABAG for 2015 through 2023.
                     To meet this requirement, policies from the 2009 Housing Element were
                     reviewed, projected housing needs of all economic segments of Colma
                                                                                          P a g e |8

2015 Housing Element

                     evaluated, and new policies and programs aimed at the preservation and
                     improvement of housing have been developed.
                     Related Plans and Programs
                     Relationship to other General Plan Elements
                     The Housing Element is closely related to the Land Use, Conservation/Open
                     Space and Circulation Elements of the Town of Colma General Plan.
                     The Land Use Element sets forth the amount and type of residential
                     development permitted under the General Plan, thereby establishing housing
                     opportunity in Colma. In addition, the Land Use Element contains policies
                     directed at maintaining the existing housing stock, as well as ensuring the
                     quality of new residential development.
                     The Circulation Element contains policies to minimize traffic spillover into
                     residential neighborhoods and includes complete street considerations for
                     alternate transportation such as transit, bicycling and walking. The
                     Conservation/Open Space Element establishes policies to minimize the impact
                     of residential development on sensitive resources, such as ecological habitat,
                     and scenic viewsheds.
                     Finally, the Safety Element sets forth policies to ensure the safety of the Colma’s
                     housing stock through such measures as mitigation of environmental hazards as
                     a condition to development.
                     The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with Colma’s other
                     General Plan elements, and the policies and programs in this Element reflect the
                     policy direction contained in other parts of the General Plan. As portions of the
                     General Plan are amended in the future, this Housing Element will be reviewed
                     to ensure that internal consistency is maintained. It is entirely consistent with
                     the policies and proposals set forth by the Plan.
                     Pursuant to Government Code Section 65400, the City will annually review its
                     progress in implementing this Housing Element and ensuring consistency
                     between this and the City’s other General Plan Elements.
                                                                                              P a g e |9

                     Climate Action Plan
                     The Town of Colma joins a growing number of California cities who have
                     adopted a Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet
                     State emission reduction targets. The Town adopted the Plan in May of 2013.
                     The Plan includes programs such as energy efficiency, water conservation, and
                     improved recycling programs for residents and businesses. Colma will also see
                     an increase of bicycle lanes, green business program participation and a new
                     green building program. These programs not only reduce emissions, they also
                     help residents and businesses save money and conserve natural resources.
                     The 2015 Housing Element is fully consistent with the Climate Action Plan.
                     Housing Element policies that encourage the maintenance and upgrades to
                     existing residences are inherently sustainable since new resources are not used
                     to reconstruct units. New housing units will be required to be constructed to
                     the latest energy and water saving standards, which will make them efficient
                     and economical to maintain.
                     HOPE Plan to End Homelessness
                     HOPE (Housing Our People Effectively) is a ten-year action plan initiated by San
                     Mateo County that brings together the business, nonprofit, and public sector
                     communities to address the challenging issue of homelessness. This plan
                     reflects the Board of Supervisors' goal that housing should exist in our
                     community for people at all income levels and all generations of families,
                     including those who are extremely low-income or who are homeless. To end
                     homelessness, San Mateo County must follow the housing strategy successfully
                     documented in other communities around the country. The HOPE Plan is built
                     around the following two key strategies:
                         •    Housing - increasing the supply of permanent affordable and supportive
                              housing for people who are homeless and developing strategies to help
                              them move into housing as rapidly as possible; and
                         •    Prevention - prevent individuals and families from becoming homeless
                              in the first place by assisting them to maintain their housing. These
                              goals are consistent with the Town of Colma Housing Element.
                                                                                          P a g e | 10

                     Grand Boulevard Initiative
                     The Grand Boulevard Initiative is a coordinated effort of 19 cities (including the
                     Town of Colma), San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, and local and regional
                     agencies united to improve the performance, safety, and aesthetics of El
                     Camino Real. Starting at the northern Daly City boundary (where it is named
                     Mission Street) and ending near the Diridon Caltrain Station in central San Jose
                     (where it is named The Alameda), the initiative brings together for the first time
                     all of the agencies having responsibility for the condition, use, and performance
                     of the El Camino Real. The Grand Boulevard Initiative looks to transform El
                     Camino Real from a suburban, low-density strip commercial highway to vibrant,
                     mixed-use pedestrian-friendly boulevard and destination that links regional
                     transportation improvements and local economic development efforts.
                     Within Colma, much of the El Camino Real is dedicated to cemetery uses and
                     the Town desires development that is respectful of this established land use.
                     However, opportunities exist on the northern edge of Colma for the
                     development of housing across the street and adjacent to the Colma BART
                     station and to the south on Mission Road.
                     Plan Bay Area and Priority Development Areas (PDA)
                     Plan Bay Area is an integrated transportation and land-use strategy through the
                     year 2040 that marks the Bay Area’s nine-county first long-range plan to meet
                     the requirements of California’s landmark 2008 Senate Bill 375. This bill calls on
                     each of the state’s 18 metropolitan areas to develop a Sustainable Communities
                     Strategy (SCS) to accommodate future population growth and reduce
                     greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. Working in collaboration
                     with cities and counties, the Plan advances initiatives to expand housing and
                     transportation choices, create healthier communities, and build a stronger
                     regional economy.
                     The Plan was prepared by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)
                     and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and approved in July of
                     2013. It is the long-term regional land-use and transportation strategy for the
                     Bay Area, and Transportation funding from state and federal sources will be
                     distributed consistent with the plan. In addition, it will be used to determine
                     housing needs allocations for Bay Area jurisdictions, including Colma.

                     which a majority of the new residential development in San Mateo County is
                     expected to be created. The defined ¼-mile buffer around El Camino Real from
                     Daly City to San Jose is a planned PDA to encourage and leverage future growth
                     near transit in existing communities.
                     All of Colma’s new housing is anticipated to be within the PDA area, on El
                     Camino Real or on Mission Road. By placing new housing in this corridor,
                     residents will benefit from good transit options for local and regional travel.

                     Colma will continue to grow over the next 20 years, albeit not as rapidly, to
                     reach a population of 1,874 in 2030.

                      Colma is more diverse than San Mateo County as a whole. Only a third of the
                      residents are white (compared to well over half in the county) and almost half
                      are Asian. Over the past decade, the white population has declined, while the
                      Asian population has grown. Approximately a quarter of the residents are non-
                      white or more than one race. Additionally, 40 percent of the population is
                      Hispanic. Latino or Hispanic is not a separate racial category on the American
                      Community Survey, and so all individuals who identify as Latino or Hispanic also
                      belong to another racial category as well (i.e.- black, white, other etc.).

                      The average age in Colma has decreased notably over the past decade. In 2000,
                      the median age was 37 but in 2011 it was 31. This appears to be due to a growth
                      in the 20-34 segments of the population, which grew from one-fifth of the total
                      population in 2000 to a third in 2011. Almost 30 percent of Colma’s population
                      is comprised of children under 19, and only 12 percent of the population
                      includes seniors over the age of 60. Colma is the only city in San Mateo County
                      whose population has gotten younger.

                     Income Categories
                     The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the
                     California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) use
                     household income categories to help standardize analysis of housing needs. The
                     income categories are summarized below and are based on a household’s
                     percentage of San Mateo County’s Area Median Income (AMI).

2015 Housing Element
                     Though San Mateo County has a robust economy, much of its workforce cannot
                     afford to live within the county. Job growth has been strong, although cyclical, over
                     the past 10 years, and is projected to continue. Housing development has not kept
                     up the pace with the growth in local jobs. According to the Department of Housing
                     (Housing Needs Study, 2007), by 2025, San Mateo County’s supply of housing will
                     only meet one third to one half of the demand. Additionally, 40 percent of new jobs
                     in the county will pay lower income wages.
                     A home meets the standard definition of affordability if it does not cost more than
                     30 percent of a household’s income. A household that spends more than 30 percent
                     of its gross income on housing is considered to be overpaying for housing. Housing
                     that costs more than 30% of household income is a more acute problem for lower
                     income households, since there is less discretionary money for other necessities.
                     While individual household income conditions vary, an example can be useful to
                     illustrate affordability conditions for a low income family in San Mateo County. A
                     four-person family with one parent working fulltime as a cook and the other parent
                     working in retail, can afford a monthly rent of about $1,400 and a home sales price
                     of $222,000. A single parent family with the adult working as a police officer would
                     be considered moderate income, and can afford a monthly rent of about $2,400 and
                     a home costing $374,000. Neither of these example households can afford San
                     Mateo County’s median condominium, costing $579,418, or single-family home,
                     which costs $1,246,121 (SAMCAR), although the example single-parent family can
                     afford the median county rent of $2,234.

                     Colma has more than three times as many jobs as residents, with
                     approximately 2,900 jobs in the town. Colma serves as a regional shopping
                     destination for retail goods and used and new automobiles and automobile
                     services. In addition, Colma serves a regional need for cemetery land and
                     associated services. The town also has a card room, Lucky Chances, which
                     employs over 600 individuals. About 45 percent of the workers in the town
                     make between $1,251 and $3,333/month, and almost 30 percent make
                     more than $3,333 per month. Almost all (99 percent) of the workers in

                     Overcrowded Households
                     According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a unit is considered overcrowded if it the unit
                     is occupied by more than 1.01 persons per room (excluding bathrooms and
                     kitchens). Homes with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered severely
                     overcrowded. Overcrowding increases health and safety concerns and stresses the
                     condition of the housing stock and infrastructure. Overcrowding correlates strongly
                     with household size, particularly for large households.
                     Colma has a small number of overcrowded homes. Almost six percent of owner-
                     occupied homes, or 12 homes, are overcrowded. The vast majority of rental homes
                     are not overcrowded, however, six homes are considered overcrowded and 25
                     homes are extremely overcrowded. The percent of overcrowded households has
                     decreased since 2000, when close to a quarter of the homes were considered
                     overcrowded.

                      Housing Values and Costs
                     With relatively few homes, housing price data for Colma is hard to come by.
                     According to Trulia data from October 2013, the median sale price for a home
                     (including both multi-family and single-family) in Colma is $500,000.
                     Colma’s home prices are below countywide averages for single-family homes, yet
                     above the prices for multi-family homes. Despite the seemingly more reasonable
                     prices, the median home in Colma is unaffordable to most households making less
                     than the median income. A four-person family making moderate income, however,
                     can afford the median home in Colma.

                       Overpayment for Housing
                       A household is considered to be overpaying for housing if they spend more than 30
                       percent of their income on rent or mortgage payments. Almost 70 percent of Colma
                       residents making under $75,000 annually are overpaying for homeownership, and
                       even 20 percent of those making more than $75,000 are overpaying for their
                       homes. All of the lowest income renters, those making under $35,000, are
                       overpaying on rent, and almost 40 percent of those making under $75,000 are
                       overpaying as well.
                       If there is not enough affordable housing in Colma, lower-income people may
                       choose to live elsewhere and commute into the city to work. Those who do live in
                       Colma may live in overcrowded homes, and have extremely limited money to
                       dedicate towards other necessities such as food, transportation, and medical care.
                       Extremely low income households paying more than 50 percent of their income
                       towards housing are at greater risk for becoming homeless.

                            Physical Characteristics
                            Colma’s housing stock has grown even faster than its population. In 2000, Colma
                            had 342 homes, and by 2010 it had 446 homes - an increase of 31 percent. Most of
                            the homes in Colma are single-family detached buildings (percent). There are two
                            newer townhome/attached single family developments with a total of 81 units
                            which account for 18% of the total housing units. Close to 40 percent of homes in
                            Colma have three bedrooms. Half the homes have 1-2 bedrooms.
                                   In 2000, almost half the population owned, while half rented. Due to the
                                   erroneous inclusion of 135 rental units in the housing count for the Town in
                                   the 2010 census, it is not possible to accurately determine how many
                                   properties are owner-occupied and how many are tenant-occupied. Due to
                                   the addition of 81 for sale units between 2000 and 2010, and no new rental
                                   housing, it is likely that the percentage of owner-occupied units has
                                   increased since 2000, and may be consistent with the county average of 59
                                   percent.
                                   Colma has extremely low vacancy rates. According to 2011 data from the
                                   American Community Survey, Colma has no vacant ownership units, and
                                   only a vacancy rate of two percent for rental units. A housing market with a
                                   vacancy rate under five percent is considered to be a tight market. Tight
                                   markets can lead to high housing prices and subsequent higher rates of
                                   overcrowding.

                     HOUSING CONDITIONS
                     In addition to issues with affordability and overcrowding, housing can have physical
                     problems such as age or lack of facilities. One of the best ways to assess the
                     condition of the housing stock is through a windshield tour. However, barring that,
                     the census gives some useful information as to the status of the housing.

                     Approximately 19 percent of Colma’s housing stock has been built since 2000. This is
                     an extremely high percentage: for comparison only approximately five percent of
                     San Mateo County’s housing stock has been built since 2000. An additional 40
                     percent of Colma’s housing stock was built in the 1950s or earlier. Older housing can
                     be more expensive to maintain and renovate.
                     The census tracks other housing problems, including a lack of plumbing and kitchen
                     facilities and found no facilities lacking from homes in Colma.

                     BELOW MARKET RATE HOUSING TRENDS AND CHARACTERISTICS
                     Units offered at rents or sale prices below that which they would command on the
                     open market are referred to as “below-market rate” or BMR units. They are also
                     often referred to as “affordable housing” units. Just over 40 percent of Colma’s
                     households make more than a moderate income, and another 40 percent of Colma’s
                     households are lower income. 20 percent of all households are considered low-
                     income, 13 percent are very low income, and seven percent are extremely low
                     income.
                     There are 18 units that were developed by the Town of Colma with monies from the
                     Town’s general fund in the early 1990’s. The units, located along El Camino Real, are
                     reserved for senior tenants. The below-market rate rents collected from these
                     housing units are paid into the general fund. The Town also purchased one housing
                     unit within a multi-unit complex at 1365 Mission Road, and has dedicated it as a
                     below-market rate unit, renting it to qualifying very low-to-moderate income
                     households.
                     Potential Loss of Subsidized Units
                     Government Code Section 65583 requires local jurisdictions to address the potential
                     conversion of multi-family rental housing that receive governmental assistance
                     under federal programs, state and local multi-family revenue bond programs, or
                     local density bonus programs to no low-income housing use. There are no locally
                     subsidized units at risk in Colma, as the Town has not issued mortgage revenue
                     bonds, has not approved any density bonus units with financial assistance, and has
                     not assisted multi-family housing with redevelopment or CDBG funds.

                              Determination of Housing Needs
                              The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process addresses housing needs
                              across income levels for each jurisdiction in California. All of the Bay Area’s 101
                              cities and nine counties are given a share of the Bay Area’s total regional housing
                              need. The Bay Area's regional housing need is allocated by the California
                              Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), and finalized though
                              negotiations with the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). San Mateo
                              County jurisdictions, through a unique process different from other Bay Area
                              counties, collaboratively developed a formula to divide up San Mateo County’s
                              overall housing allocation among the 21 jurisdictions in the county.

                         Special Housing Needs
                         Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
                         their special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to employment
                         and income, family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics.
                         State Housing Element law states that special needs groups include the following:
                         senior households, disabled persons, developmentally delayed persons, large
                         households, female-headed households with children, students, homeless persons,
                         and farmworkers. This section provides a discussion of the housing needs facing
                         each group.
                         Housing Needs for Senior Residents
                                                   Seniors face many housing challenges as they age,
                                                   including a fixed budget, higher medical costs, and greater
                                                   likelihood of disabilities.   It is estimated that 11% of
                                                   Colma’s population is over the age of 60 (about 160
                                                   individuals)
                                                   Almost a quarter of the seniors in Colma have incomes
                                                   higher than $100,000, but almost half the seniors have an
                                                   income below $50,000.
                                                   Seniors in Colma, like seniors in San Mateo County at
                         large, are significantly more likely to be homeowners than renters. Thus, housing
                         concerns for seniors in Colma might include retrofits to allow seniors to age in place

                    Housing Trends in San Mateo County” document, the county can expect to see a 76
                    percent increase in the number of seniors. A key challenge in the coming years will
                    be how to accommodate the needs of aging residents. For more information about
                    senior trends and preferences, see the 2013 “Key Housing Trends in San Mateo”

                    People Living With Disabilities
                    People with disabilities face many challenges when looking for housing. There is a
                    limited supply of handicap accessible, affordable housing generally, and the supply
                    is especially tight near transit. Being near transit is important because many people
                    with disabilities cannot drive. People with disabilities are also often extremely low
                    income due to the challenge of securing long-term employment, and to higher
                    medical bills. Additionally, because some people with disabilities, particularly
                    developmental disabilities, have lived with their parents they often do not have
                    rental or credit history. This makes it harder for them to compete for the limited
                    housing that is available.

                    A recent state law, SB 812, requires Housing Elements to include an analysis of the
                    special housing needs of people with developmental disabilities. Additionally, SB
                    812 requires that individuals with disabilities receive public services in the least
                    restrictive, most integrated setting appropriate to their needs
                    California defines developmentally disabled as a, “severe and chronic disability that
                    is attributable to a mental or physical impairment. The disability must begin before
                    the person’s 18th birthday, be expected to continue indefinitely, and present a
                    substantial disability.” Some development disabilities cause mental retardation and
                    some do not. Common developmental disabilities include Down’s syndrome,
                    autism, epilepsy and cerebral palsy.
                    People with developmental disabilities in San Mateo County have various diagnoses.
                    The common ones are summarized below. Because people can have multiple
                    diagnoses, the numbers total more than 100 percent.

                    People with developmental disabilities tend to be younger than the general
                    population. There are several reasons for this. For some diagnoses there is a shorter
                    life expectancy. More importantly, starting in the 1990s there was an “autism wave”
                    with many more young people being diagnosed with the disorder, for reasons that
                    are still not well understood. The racial demographics of the developmentally
                    disabled population mirror that of the population of the Bay Area.

                    Many people with developmental disabilities are unable to secure long-term
                    employment. This results in many people relying on Supplemental Security Income
                    (SSI) and many earn 10-20 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI).

                    Trends that are affecting the people with developmental disabilities include
                    California’s moves to reduce institutionalization, ageing family caregivers not being
                    able to continue providing in-house care and the growing wave of people with
                    autism.
                    •     Deinstitutionalization – In 1977, California, passed the Lanterman
                          Developmentally Disabled Services Act, to minimize the institutionalization of
                          developmentally disabled people, help them remain in their communities, and
                          to allow them to live their lives as similar to non-disabled people as possible. To
                          accomplish this end the state has been closing large institutional care facilities,

                                       resulting in more people with disabilities being integrated into the community.
                                       However, this has increased the demand for community based independent
                                       living options to serve the needs of the developmentally disabled.

                                       Disabilities – As displayed in the table below, almost three quarters of people
                                       with developmental disabilities live with a parent or caregiver, and many of
                                       these caregivers are baby boomers. As these caregivers age their ability to
                                       continue to care for their developmentally disabled children will decrease to the
                                       point where it is no longer possible. This trend is also going to be a factor in the
                                       increased need for community-based independent living options for the
                                       developmentally disabled. Many service delivery systems and communities are
                                       not prepared to meet the increasing need.

                                 •     Increasing Numbers of People with Autism - There is a large number of people
                                       with developmentally disabilities that have autism. They have been brought up
                                       as independent members of the community and want to remain independent
                                       and involved in the community. There is a coming need to supply community
                                       based independent living options for these individuals.
                                 Other Disabilities and Policy Recommendations
                                 People in Colma have non-developmental disabilities, such as hearing disabilities or
                                 vision disabilities, as well. Some residents have both developmental and non-
                                 developmental disabilities.

                    In San Mateo County, almost a third of the senior population has some kind of
                    disability. Eight percent of the total population in the county has some kind of
                    disability. The most common disabilities in the county are ambulatory disabilities
                    (four percent of the population) and independent living disabilities (three percent).
                    The census does not have numbers specifically for Colma because it is too small, but
                    the percentages are likely similar to the countywide averages.

                      Note: Some people may have multiple disabilities
                    The three major needs for people with disabilities are low cost (subsidized) rents,
                    handicapped accessible homes, and buildings near public transportation. These
                    needs are very similar to the desires of other segments of the population. Policies
                    that promote affordable housing generally are also good for the disabled
                    community. Specific recommendations from the Golden Gate Regional Center (with
                    a note of Colma’s actions or programs) include:
                       •    Jurisdictions assisting with site identification for low income developments
                            (Colma’s Program 5.5, regular meetings with non-profit developers, Program
                            3.2, Density Bonus allowance and Program 4.3 Emergency Shelters);
                       •    Policies to promote accessible homes (Colma’ Progam 4.1, Reasonable
                            Accommodation and enforcement of building codes related to accessibility);
                       •    Inclusionary zoning (Colma’s Program 3.7, Inclusionary Housing);
                       •    Second units (Colma’s Program 2.1), Second Unit Ordinance); and
                       •    Mixed use zoning (Colma’s Program 3.3, High Density Housing near BART).
                    Additionally, some people with development disabilities need supportive housing
                    that is affordable and located near public transit. In supportive housing, additional
                    services are provided at the home.

                    Female-Headed and Large Households
                    Households headed by a single parent can have special needs due to the economic
                    limitation of earning only one income, and the challenges of childcare without a
                    partner. Although gender equality has made strides over the past 50 years, women
                    continue to earn lower incomes than men. Therefore, female-headed households in
                    particular have specific housing needs that must be addressed. Female-headed
                    households can have special needs that include low cost housing, suitable for
                    children and located near schools and childcare facilities. Innovative, shared living
                    arrangements, including congregate cooking and childcare, could also be
                    appropriate
                    Female-headed households comprise 28 percent of the households in Colma. The
                    most vulnerable female-headed households can be those where women are living
                    with children without a partner. Colma has 90 such households, or 15 percent of the
                    total number of households. An additional, approximately 80 households are
                    headed by women living alone or with other family members. Female-headed
                    households are more likely to be living under the poverty line than other
                    households: 10 percent of female-headed households in Colma are under the
                    poverty line.

                    Large households are defined as households with five or more members living in the
                    same home. Large households are a special needs group because of the difficulty in
                    finding adequate and affordable housing. Many jurisdictions have few large homes,
                    and often these larger homes are significantly more expensive than smaller ones.
                    Large households throughout San Mateo County are much more likely than smaller
                    households to have some kind of housing problem.
                    Colma has approximately 90 large households. In Colma, overcrowding is rare;

                    Housing Needs for Farm Workers
                    Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are
                    earned through seasonal agricultural labor. Most jurisdictions in San Mateo County
                    have no farms or farmworkers; however there are 334 farms and 1,722 farmworkers
                    in the county, primarily located in coastal communities. Of these 1,722
                    farmworkers, 88 are migrant workers and 329 work less than 150 days annually (and
                    are therefore considered to be “seasonal labor”). Farm workers who are migrant or
                    seasonal workers have special housing needs because of their relatively low income
                    and the unstable nature of their job (i.e. having to move throughout the year from
                    one harvest to the next). These workers generally face higher rates of overcrowding
                    and other substandard housing conditions. Continued efforts to provide affordable
                    housing, especially affordable housing suitable for families, will help meet the needs
                    of these Farm workers.
                    The Town of Colma has several commercial container plant nurseries that operate
                    year-round and offer their employees regular pay and benefits. In addition, Colma
                    has two small flower farms that are maintained by individual farmers that lease land
                    and successfully sell their crops to local merchants.

                     Housing Needs for the Homeless
                     All 21 jurisdictions within San Mateo County have adopted the ten-year HOPE Plan
                     (Housing Our People Effectively: Ending Homelessness in San Mateo County),
                     designed to end homelessness within ten years. The HOPE Plan adopts a Housing
                     First policy, which seeks to move homeless people into permanent housing instead
                     of shelters by increasing the stock of affordable and subsidized housing. Although
                     the HOPE planners recognized that there is a lack of needed resources throughout
                     the housing continuum, including emergency and transitional housing, the greatest
                     need and the most effective use of new and/or redirected resources is for creating
                     and sustaining quality affordable housing and supportive housing.
                     According to a 2013 countywide homeless survey there are 2,281 homeless people
                     living in San Mateo County. Close to 90 percent of the homeless population was
                     living in San Mateo County when they became homeless.

                    The homeless in San Mateo are both sheltered, meaning they live in emergency
                    shelters, transitional housing, treatment centers or other similar institutions; and
                    unsheltered, meaning they live on the street, in encampments or in a vehicle.
                    The number of homeless people living on the street in San Mateo County has
                    decreased since 2007. However, the number living in an RV, car or encampment has
                    risen dramatically to just over 40 percent of the total homeless population. The
                    remaining 43 percent are considered sheltered homeless, and live in shelters,
                    transitional housing, motels or institutions.
                    The vast majority homeless people are single adults (who may be living with another
                    adult, but no children). Still, one-fifth of the sheltered homeless are families. Most
                    were white (60%) and male (60-71 percent). Notably, 72 percent of the unsheltered
                    homeless population has an alcohol and drug problem, while only eight percent of
                    the sheltered population has a similar problem.

                    Quantification of Available Homeless Assistance Resources
                    Shelters and homeless assistance programs are the main resources available to
                    homeless residents of San Mateo County. Colma helps to meet the needs of its
                    homeless residents by providing financial support and appropriate referrals to local
                    homeless assistance programs available in San Mateo County, including Shelter
                    Network, the Human Investment Project, North Peninsula Food Pantry and Dining
                    Center of Daly City, and the Second Harvest Food Bank. In addition, Colma permits
                    development of a homeless shelter as a permitted use in the Commercial (C) zone.
                    San Mateo County’s Center on Homeless, a program overseen by the County Human
                    Services Agency, coordinates the provision of homeless services within the County,
                    including those by non-governmental entities. The Center on Homeless provides
                    information to county residents, provides referrals, administers self-sufficiency
                    programs and develops homeless resources. There are also several specialized
                    shelters for persons with substance abuse problems and mental illnesses, as well as
                    victims of domestic violence and youth.
                    The nearest large homeless assistance facility is the Community Service Center in
                    Daly City. The Center is a clearinghouse providing motel vouchers, bus tickets and
                    referrals to the County’s transitional shelters. In addition, this facility provides a
                    Home Sharing service which keeps track of those with living quarters to share.
                    Determination of Unmet Homeless Needs in Colma
                    As of the 2013 San Mateo Homeless Census, 7 unsheltered homeless people were
                    counted in Colma. Homelessness is a regional issue and consideration of the
                    homeless is important in formulating housing policy.
                    Housing Needs for Extremely Low Income Households
                    Extremely Low Income (ELI) households earn 30 percent of the area median income
                    or less. In San Mateo County this amounts to an annual income of $33,950 or below
                    for a family of four. Many ELI households live in rental housing and most likely facing
                    overpayment, overcrowding or substandard housing conditions. Some ELI
                    households are recipients of public assistance such as social security insurance or
                    disability insurance. Housing types available and suitable for ELI households include
                    affordable rentals, secondary dwelling units, emergency shelters, supportive
                    housing and transitional housing.

                     There are 35 ELI households in Colma according to 2010 CHAS data. More than half
                     of Colma’s ELI households face some kind of housing problem: 100 percent of all ELI
                     renter households, and 20 percent of ELI owner households face overcrowding,
                     overpayment, and/or lack complete kitchen or plumbing facilities.

                       ABILITY TO MEET HOUSING NEEDS
                       Residential Land Inventory
                       A key component of the Housing Element is a projection of a jurisdiction’s housing
                       supply. State law requires that the element identify adequate sites for housing,
                       including rental housing and manufactured housing, and make adequate provisions
                       of the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community.
                       This includes an inventory of land suitable for residential development, including
                       vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the
                       relationship of zoning and public services to these sites.
                       Existing Residential Development
                                               Existing housing units are identified on Exhibit H-1, Housing
                                               and Exhibit H-2, Sterling Park Neighborhood. These maps
                                               include all dwelling units constructed prior to 2011. Based on
                                               American Community Survey (2007-2011) and Census
                                               records, there are a total of 463 dwelling units in the Town of
                                               Colma, 274 of which are located in the Sterling Park
                                               neighborhood and the remaining are located outside of

                       Development Potential
                       In total, there are parcels available for the development of approximately 75 new
                       residential units, including 12 single family units and 63 multi-family units. Of these
                       units, there is potential for at least 10 units available to extremely low income
                       households, 10 units to very low income households, 8 units to low income

                    development need for 59 units to be constructed between 2015 and 2023.
                    Adequate Sites Inventory
                    Planning staff inventoried vacant and underutilized parcels in Colma to determine
                    what land is available for development at various levels of density. These density
                    levels were then equated to the affordability levels set during the RHNA process and
                    the number of units which might be developed at each affordability level was
                    estimated. The analysis was also completed using the actual average built densities
                    for developments built on land with various zoning designations; the State has
                    determined that it is not sufficient to simply calculate it at the zoned densities,
                    especially if there are significant differences between zoned and built densities.
                    The Town of Colma’s land inventory for future housing includes property zoned for
                    multi-family use that is currently vacant, as well as land that is underutilized. The
                    adequate sites analysis demonstrates that there is enough land to meet the ABAG
                    Regional Housing Needs Allocation. The analysis for affordable housing units for
                    extremely low, very low, low and moderate income households is based on the
                    assumption that any property zoned to accommodate multi-family development of
                    twelve or more units will produce 20% affordable units through the provisions of
                    the Inclusionary Housing Subchapter 12 of the Colma Municipal Code.
                    The ability to provide affordable units in Colma is more dependent on available
                    financial resources than zoning density. If qualified developments are able to obtain
                    federal tax credits and other funding or incentives, there is a higher probability that
                    more affordable units will be provided than in a development where no government

                      Several sites have development potential, including three parcels located in the
                      Sterling Park neighborhood, two sites located along El Camino Real near the Colma
                      BART Station, and one site located near the intersection of Old Mission Road and El
                      Camino Real. A detailed site inventory describing the development potential of
                      each, as well as site-specific constraints is provided in the following section.
                      A. Sterling Park Development Potential
                      Three separate vacant or underutilized parcels are located within the Sterling
                      Park residential neighborhood. A site analysis has determined that 12 single
                      family detached (SFD) units can be developed on these three parcels, which
                      have a combined total area of 0.91 acre.
                      There are no governmental or site specific constraints impeding the
                      development of these parcels with single family residences. All parcels are
                      designated for single family residential development with a maximum
                      allowable density of 13 units per acre. Sewer and water infrastructure
                      capacity exists to accommodate the potential housing units. This amount of
                      residential development in Sterling Park is already anticipated in the Colma
                      General Plan.

                      Two separate parcels are located along El Camino Real, near the Colma BART
                      Station which is located just outside the Town's municipal boundaries.

                         unincorporated land near the BART Station. Additionally, Colma’s Zoning Code
                         provides density bonus incentives for affordable units.
                         Sandblaster Property – 7773 El Camino Real
                                                A 0.53 acre parcel on the east side of El Camino Real is
                                                bounded by “C” Street to the north and the “D” Street stairs
                                                to the south. This parcel is referred to as the ‘Sandblaster
                                                Property’ due to its past light industrial use. The parcel

                        It should be noted that the project plans submitted in 2007 included this site and
                        the two single family residential lots on C Street, mentioned in the Sterling Park

                        Bocci Property – 7778 El Camino Real
                        A 0.6 acre parcel on the west side of El Camino Real was recently reoccupied by a
                        monument making light industrial operation. The parcel is referred to as the ‘Bocci
                        Property’ due to the family name of the historic monument manufacturing company
                        located there.
                                            The parcel is bounded by the entrance to the Colma BART station
                                            to the north, the BART right-of-way to the west and south, and El
                                            Camino Real to the east. This parcel could be redeveloped with
                                            high-density residential or a mixed use development that includes
                                            high density residential. The property is currently designated for
                                            commercial use, which allows for multi-family residential.
                                            Site-specific constraints on the parcel include its triangular shape,

                        since been withdrawn and a small monument business has leased the property.
                        While the terms of the lease are not known, it is likely that redevelopment of the
                        site with mixed-use (including high-density residential) will not occur while the
                        monument business exists on site. Given the site’s unusual shape and existing
                        access, it is not recommended that residential development occur on the site while
                        the present structures exist.

                                     An additional 3.32 acre development site is located on the north side of
                                     El Camino Real, near its intersection with Mission Road and the
                                     southern Town boundary. This site is referred to as the Holy Cross Site,
                                     as it is adjacent to the Holy Cross Cemetery and is owned by the
                                     Archdiocese of San Francisco. Although the maximum allowable density
                                     of 22 units per acre would allow for up to 73 multifamily units, site
                                     specific constraints reduce the realistic development potential of the
                                     site to approximately 26 dwelling units.
                                                      Site-specific constraints include
                       its narrow and triangular shape, site topography and existing
                       structural encumbrances on the site, including a small
                       reservoir providing irrigation water to Holy Cross Cemetery.
                       While the reservoir may be considered a significant
                       constraint, the property owners have entertained the
                       possibility of relocating or eliminating the reservoir should
                       the property be sold for development. The realistic development potential of 26
                       dwelling units was calculated by evaluating required off-street parking and taking
                       into account the unusual and difficult to develop triangular-shaped site. However, it
                       may be possible to get a greater number of units on the site using the flexibility
                       allowed by the Planned Development zoning designation and creative solutions that
                       may include sub-grade parking.

                    rezoning to a Planned Development land use designation would allow for the most
                    development flexibility in setting standards such as height, setbacks, ingress and
                    egress, and landscaping. The Planned Development designation would be
                    accompanied by plans for development, including site plans, floor plans, elevations,
                    landscaping and other site improvements. Sewer and water infrastructure capacity
                    exists and can accommodate all potential housing units. Development of existing
                    and projected parcels is already anticipated in the Colma General Plan.

                    The Town of Colma will continue to entertain proposals on the various opportunity
                    sites and will work with developers on meeting the Town’s development standards
                    and overall design-related goals. The Planned Development designation allows
                    flexibility in development standards, while not inhibiting the maximum densities
                    allowed by the General Plan. In addition to the single-family residential infill
                    opportunities, the realistic development potential on sites targeted for Planned
                    Development are achievable.
                    In accordance with Government Code Section 65863(b), the City adopted a No Net
                    Loss Program which was added to the Colma Municipal Code in 2013. This program
                    requires that if any identified sites are developed at lower densities than
                    anticipated, that the incremental loss of housing capacity will be accommodated
                    elsewhere by either identifying other sites that have housing capacity or by rezoning
                    sites within the Town to accommodate the lost capacity. One way to accomplish this
                    is to require a minimum density rather than our standard practice of identifying a
                    maximum density for a specific site.

                    GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
                    As part of the Housing Element process, the Town analyzed its Zoning Code,
                    permitting processes, development standards, and building codes to identify
                    potential constraints for the development of housing. Housing Element proposes
                    specific actions and implementation schedules to remove such impediments, where
                    possible.
                    General Plan and Zoning
                    Colma’s General Plan and Zoning Ordinance provide for a wide range of allowable
                    residential densities in both residential and commercial districts. General Plan
                    densities typically determine the maximum number of dwelling units allowed on a
                    specific site. The Zoning Ordinance is consistent with the General Plan. Additionally,
                    the Town has a Planned Development designation which permits relaxation of
                    zoning standards. In the past, the Planned Development designation has been used
                    to develop high density residential projects and is the most successful manner of
                    developing the available parcels identified in the previous section, because of their
                    unique site constraints and small size.
                    As discussed earlier, the Town’s Commercial/Mixed Use and Commercial Land Use
                    Designations sites will accommodate a majority of the housing need for lower
                    income units. The Colma General Plan specifically identifies the Commercial/Mixed
                    Use designation for ground-floor retail/office with residential units above. The
                    mechanism to effectuate a mixed-use development is the rezoning of the property
                    to Planned Development, which maintains the full multi-family allowance in the
                    commercial zone but allows for greater flexibility in development standards to
                    maximize unit yield.
                    This analysis is based upon two assumptions: that the identified sites allowing
                    mixed-use will be developed with the residential uses and developers will build to
                    the estimated realistic densities for each of these sites. The first of these
                    assumptions is prudent in light of recent trends in the Town and sites near the
                    identified sites. Developments near the identified sites were almost exclusively
                    residential use projects or include a small portion of retail/commercial uses.
                    Residential projects have been proposed on two of the sites in close proximity to
                    the Colma BART Station, lending credence toward the sites being developed with
   Town of Colma
2015Housing Element                                                                                    58

                    residential uses. There are several other reasons why the identified sites are likely to
                    develop with the estimated residential capacity during the planning period:
                        1. Areas designated for mixed-use development have no minimum commercial
                             component requirement, so developers are able to develop 100 percent
                             residential (i.e. there is no vertical mixed use requirement) on mixed use
                             sites.
                        2. The Town supports housing in the Town’s mixed-use areas by assisting in
                             site assembly.
                        3. The majority of mixed-use sites are not prime sites favored by commercial
                             establishments.
                        4. The sites are located in close proximity to where other new residential
                             development has been built or approved.
                    Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the identified sites will be developed as
                    residential-use projects, at, or above, the estimated densities.
                    The zoning ordinance sets forth requirements that can affect the type, appearance
                    and cost of housing to be built within the Town of Colma. The zoning ordinance
                    includes standards for development determining minimum lot size, permitted
                    use(s), minimum setbacks, maximum height limits and minimum parking standards.
                    There is no lot coverage limit or floor area ratio standard for residential zoning
                    districts in Colma. The building envelope allowed on a residentially zoned lot in
                    Colma is determined by setbacks and height limits. There are two residentially
                    zoned districts in Colma, the Residential (R) zone and the Residential – Sterling Park
                    (R-S) zone.     The R-zone allows single family dwellings by right (no land use
                    entitlements required) and multi-family dwellings up to six units with approval of a
                    Use Permit provided that the residential density proposed does not exceed that
                    which is specified in the General Plan. The R-S zone allows single family detached
                    dwellings only.
                    Development standards in Colma such as setbacks, building height and off-street
                    parking are similar to or less restrictive than those in surrounding communities and
                    would not be considered unreasonable development constraints. For example, the
                    minimum side yard (10 percent of lot width) can be as narrow as 3.33 feet, which is
                    much smaller than the 10 foot setback required by many San Mateo County

                    jurisdictions. Colma allows a minimum lot size of 3,333 square feet, which is
                    significantly smaller than most jurisdictions. In addition, Colma allows residential
                    development on commercially-zoned parcels, which is a far less restrictive land use
                    policy than found elsewhere in the County. The development standards for
                    residential zones are summarized in the table below.

                    In 2013, the Town adopted manufactured home design standards for the Town’s
                    two single-family residential zoning districts in compliance with Government Code
                    Section 65852.3(a), and are permitted as single-family dwellings.
                    The parking standards are set forth in the zoning ordinance by district, and are
                    defined in Section 5.01.080 of the zoning ordinance. These standards are
                    summarized in the table below.

                      Over 4 Bedrooms add .5 covered or uncovered for each
                      additional bedroom
                    The Zoning Ordinance includes provisions for residential structures existing or
                    approved prior to March 1, 1988. These provisions require only one (1) parking
                    space for each single family dwelling or for a multi-family dwelling having no more
                    than one bedroom and 1.5 covered parking spaces for each multi-family dwelling
                    having two (2) or more bedrooms. If the existing units comply with these provisions,
                    property owners are not required to provide additional parking spaces because of
                    repairs, restoration, remodeling or additions to such units; however, if additional
                    bedrooms are added to an existing single family dwelling, the number off–street
                    parking spaces must be increased by 0.5 covered or uncovered spaces for each
                    bedroom exceeding the total, existing and added, of four (4) bedrooms.
                    The density limits set forth in the Colma General Plan allow 13-30 units per acre in
                    residentially zoned areas, and up to 30 units per acre in the mixed
                    commercial/residential areas. Up to 30 residential units per acre are permitted in
                    certain commercial areas through mixed-use developments, which are established
                    through the Planned Development process. Through the establishment of a Planned
                    Development, standards may vary including those associated with parking, building
                    height, and Floor Area Ratio. Density bonuses are also permitted under specific
                    circumstances.
                    Although development standards and densities are generally less restrictive than
                    those found in other Peninsula communities, Colma’s high proportion of land uses
                    directly related to the large inventory of cemetery land discussed in the preceding
                    section must be viewed as a constraint to future development of housing in Colma.
                    This constraint is not, however, insurmountable in view of the availability of sites
                    identified in this document. Existing residential development standards, such as
                    setbacks, height limits and parking requirements have not constrained housing

                    development in the Town. In many cases, they are less restrictive than other
                    jurisdictions in San Mateo County, resulting in lower costs to develop housing. The
                    flexibility afforded in the Planned Development process allows residential
                    development to achieve maximum densities while balancing livability and
                    habitability standards.
                    Building Codes
                    The California Building Code is used in Colma. The Town’s Building Official verifies
                    that new residences, additions, auxiliary structures, etc., meet all construction and
                    safety standards. Building permits are required for most construction work.
                    Additionally, building code enforcement helps the Town maintain a safe building
                    stock.
                    On- and Off-Site Improvements
                    Site improvements are a necessary component of the development process.
                    Improvements can include the laying of sewer, water, and streets for use by a
                    community when that infrastructure is lacking, and these improvements make the
                    development feasible. Due to the built-out nature of the Town, all of the residential
                    and commercial areas in Colma are already served with adequate streets, sidewalks
                    and infrastructure. This includes sidewalks that only usually require modification to
                    the location of curb-cuts.
                    In areas already served by infrastructure, site improvement requirements vary
                    depending on the existing condition of each project site. Usually, only standard
                    connection laterals are required for most project utilities. The undergrounding of
                    utilities from the nearest pole to the project is required of all projects, and street
                    tree planting may also be required. These costs have not shown to be problematic
                    for any developments in the Town when anticipated and known by the developer
                    early in the process.
                    Permit Processing and Procedures
                    Building permits must be secured before commencement of any construction,
                    reconstruction, conversion, alteration or addition. Approval of permit applications is
                    based on conformity with the Zoning Ordinance, although the City Council has the
                    power to grant variances from the terms of the Ordinance within the limitations
                    provided by law.

                         Two ways of developing housing in Colma include the construction of individual
                         single-family residential units on existing lots or the rezoning of larger properties to
                         a Planned Development (PD) zoning designation for provision of multi-family or
                         higher density housing. The Town of Colma does not have a specific multi-family
                         zoning designation, so the Planned Development designation provides opportunities
                         for multi-family housing. The Planned Development entitlement process requires
                         the approval of a Conceptual Development Plan and a Detailed Development Plan
                         and is subject to evaluation under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
                         Construction of single-family residential units does not require discretionary review
                         and is exempt from CEQA evaluation.
                         The table below identifies various entitlements and the estimated processing time
                         for each. Because many applications require multiple approvals, many of these
                         approvals run concurrently. Variance and Use Permit requests usually take only two
                         to four months to process. Because Colma has no Planning Commission, decision-
                         making is unusually streamlined.
                         Amendments and reclassifications to the Zoning Ordinance can be made by the City
                         Council, subject to applicable provisions of state law and typically take four to six
                         months to review. Procedures for amendments and reclassifications are stated in
                         the Zoning Ordinance.

                         The Planned Development process can be summarized as follows:
                         Once an application for a Planned Development (which consists of a Rezoning and a
                         Use Permit request, at a minimum) is received by the Planning Department, the
                         application is reviewed for completeness and processed as a Conceptual
                         Development Plan.       Environmental review is completed during the Conceptual
                         Development Plan phase. All applications are processed concurrently, and
                         entitlements are generally approved within four to six months of application filing.
                         The final step in the approval process is a Detailed Development Plan.            The
                         development standards that provide a guideline for a Planned Development are
                         those most closely associated with the General Plan land use designation. For
                         example, the properties targeted for mixed-use along El Camino Real are designated
                         as Commercial/Mixed Use in the Colma General Plan. Building heights, floor area
                         ratios and setbacks adopted in the Commercial zoning district would be used as a
                         guideline for a Planned Development.
                         The following is a summary of application fees for Planned Development submittals:

                          Design Review Permit (Major)                       $4,190 deposit
                         While deposits would be due at the time of application submittal, the applicant
                         would receive a refund of any unused monies after completion of the entitlement
                         process.

                    Single-family residential infill construction does not require land use entitlements,
                    and building permit-related fees vary depending on the project’s valuation. Provided
                    that a proposal meet zoning code regulations, additions to and new construction of
                    single family dwellings do not require review or approval by City Council. As noted
                    above, single family dwellings are not subject to CEQA. Processing for a new single
                    family dwelling would begin with building permit submittal and there are no
                    neighborhood noticing requirements.
                    Upon submittal of a building permit application for a single family addition or
                    construction of a new single family dwelling, the Building Department routes the
                    plans and application to the other City Departments for review. At that time there
                    would be a detailed review of the proposed construction to determine if the project
                    meets all municipal code regulations. There are no residential design guidelines for
                    single family additions or new construction. During review of the application by the
                    Planning Department, design of the proposed addition or new construction would
                    consider overall mass and bulk of the project in relation to the surrounding
                    neighborhood. While there is no specific design criteria, impacts of the addition on
                    adjacent properties is considered during the plan check of the building permit
                    application. Plan check comments are returned to the Building Department within
                    10-days of submittal so that comments can be provided to the applicant in a timely
                    manner.
                    Building permit plan check and processing in Colma is efficient and timely. Building
                    permits generally are processed in a few days. Building permits for projects that
                    require approval of entitlements cannot be issued until CEQA review is completed
                    and the City Council approves all entitlement applications. In order to expedite the
                    process leading to construction, it is not uncommon for applicants to submit plans
                    for building permit review while simultaneously proceeding through the CEQA and
                    entitlement processes. Depending on the complexity of a project, building permit
                    issuance ranges from a few days to a few weeks.
                    Fees
                    The cost of development within the Town of Colma includes planning and building
                    plan check fees; permit fees; utility service fees, recycling fees, and school fees. In
                    addition, the Town of Colma imposes a parkland dedication fee for subdivisions
                    (Quimby fee) and if inclusionary housing is not included (where required) then a
                    housing in-lieu fee may also be imposed. Local governments typically assess many

                    different types of residential development fees. These include planning fees,
                    building permit and related fees, capital facilities fees and development impact fees.
                    Planning Fees
                    Planning-related application fees required for development in the Town of Colma
                    fall into two categories: flat fees and deposit against actual costs. Flat fees are
                    charged for processing applications through the Planning Department to develop
                    property. Fees are due and payable upon making application, and are non-
                    refundable. Based upon an analysis of staff hours and comparison with other
                    jurisdictions, the fees set forth do not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of
                    providing the service. The following table summarizes the flat fees applicable to
                    development:

                    Deposit-based fees are required for processing major development applications
                    through the Planning Department. The initial deposits shown below are due and
                    payable upon filing an application, and are based on the typical amount of staff time
                    necessary to process similar applications. If additional staff time is necessary to
                    adequately evaluate an application, additional deposits will be required. In
                    accordance with the Colma ordinance that established the current Master Fee
                    Schedule, the total amount of deposit-based fees shall not exceed three times the
                    initial deposit, plus reimbursable costs. Any unused deposits are returned to the
                    applicant after a decision on the application has been made by the City Council.

                         amount of staff time to evaluate the proposal exceeds the amount of the initial
                         deposit. Any unused deposits are returned to the applicant after a decision on the
                         environmental document has been made by the City Council. The total processing

                         The Town of Colma’s Planning Department is partially funded by application fees
                         and deposits, but the remaining cost of operating the department is subsidized by
                         the Town’s General Fund. An August 2008 study was conducted which evaluated
                         typical planning and building permit fees to construct a new single-family residence
                         in each San Mateo County jurisdiction. In this study, Colma’s fees fell near the low
                         end of the range, considerably lower than most San Mateo County jurisdictions.

                    Residential planning and building fees are broadly required by all jurisdictions in San
                    Mateo County. In Colma, such fees are noted here as affecting development, but are
                    not viewed as a governmental constraint.
                    The following tables provide estimated planning, building and impact fees when
                    compared to other jurisdictions within San Mateo County. The fees are based on the
                    following prototypical projects:
                         •  One single-family residence: A new home on an empty lot in an existing
                            neighborhood, no significant grading or other complicating factors, 2400 sf
                            and 500 sf garage, two stories, four bedrooms, three bedrooms.
                         •  Ninety-Six Units in 16 Buildings on Eight Acres of Land: the project has a
                            total of 145,500 square feet. The construction will be type VN. The building
                            will have no sprinklers and will have HVAC air conditioning.
                    The 96 unit project will require a zoning change: Planned Development Zoning/ PD
                    Permit, and Tentative Map, High Complexity. The project will generate 72 peak hour
                    trips.
                    The project will require significant grading work (5,000CY), and type 1
                    erosion/sediment control.
                    The project will include existing public street frontage, and will need $400,000 of
                    frontage improvements (half street reconstruction). The project will also require the
                    construction of new private streets, which will cost an additional $600,000.
                    The project will require no public landscaping and no traffic signal work.
                    Units:
                    Model A: 28 units, 1250 sf + 500 sf garage, 2 stories, 2 bdrm, 2 bth
                    Model B: 34 units, 1500 sf + 500 sf garage, 2 stories, 3 bdrm, 2 bth
                    Model C: 34 units, 1750 sf + 500 sf garage, 2 stories, 3 bdrm, 2.5 bth

                          Colma’s fees are generally much less than those of other jurisdictions in the County
                          for the single-family home prototype. The impact fees collected by the Town for the
                          96-unit Multi-Family prototype are comparable with surveyed jurisdictions.
                          Generally, the fees collected by the Town are relatively low and are not considered
                          an impediment to development.

                    Notes: Construction Fees- Colma’s costs vary depending on the sewer district. Impact fees- Colma and Foster City listed a school fee, but
                    these were removed for consistency with other jurisdictions. CEQA- Burlingame assumes a higher CEQA cost than the other jurisdictions.
                    Other cities assumed a Negative Declaration or a Mitigated Negative Declaration. Redwood City assumes that a project is downtown;
                    otherwise the CEQA fees are based on cost recovery and can vary dramatically. All EIR related expenses have been separated into their own
                    category.

                    Building Fees
                    Colma, in accordance with the Government Code, enforces the latest edition of the
                    California Building Code to ensure the health and safety of residents of newly
                    constructed housing. The Town’s Building Department enforces the building code.
                    Inspections and approvals are completed promptly and do not add unnecessary
                    delays in the construction of new housing. Fees are assessed for these projects to
                    offset plan check and inspection activities. From time to time, the Town adjusts fees
                    to keep up with inflation. These fees are established in accordance with the
                    Government Code.
                    Building permit fees for new construction and additions are determined in dollars
                    per square foot based on the occupancy of the use, with the final determination for
                    the occupancy made by the Building Official. Permit fees for alternations, reports
                    and interior changes (tenant improvements) are charged on a sliding scale that is
                    based upon the valuation of the project. Plan check fee are 65% of the permit fees.
                    Recycling Fees
                    In March 2004, the Colma City Council passed an ordinance to meet the goals of the
                    California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989. The ordinance requires that
                    at least 50 percent of the waste tonnage from any demolition project, including
                    concrete and asphalt, (or 15% where there is no concrete and/or asphalt) be
                    recycled and/or reused, consistent with the Act. Prior to demolition and building
                    permit issuance, applicants must comply with the Town’s Construction Debris and
                    Demolition recycling ordinance and complete a “Recycling and Waste Calculation
                    Form”. At the time of building permit issuance, the applicant posts a deposit, at a
                    rate of $50 per ton for the percentage of recycled materials calculated. At the
                    completion of the project, it is the contractor’s responsibility to demonstrate that
                    they have properly recycled the correct amount of waste generated by submitting
                    receipts, weight tags, or other records to the Colma’s building department for
                    verification. If it is demonstrated that the construction debris recycling goals were
                    met, the full amount of the deposit is refunded. If the amount recycled is less than
                    the required amount, the Town of Colma retains the $50.00 for each ton not
                    recycled and/or reused. Since waste diversion is broadly required of all jurisdictions
                    under State law, it is noted here as affecting development, but is not viewed as a
                    constraint.

                     Public Works Fees
                     There are also public works fees associated with property development. These fees
                     are charged for processing documents necessary to implement a plan to develop a
                     property. Fees are due and payable upon making application, and are non-
                     refundable. These fees are in addition to any other fees set forth in this schedule.
                     Typical public works fees include sewer connection fees, water meter and service
                     connection fees and sidewalk and special encroachment permits, and the most
                     prevalent associated with residential construction are summarized below.

                     School Fees
                     In 1987, Assembly Bill 2926 amended the California Government Code to authorize
                     school districts to levy school impact fees on new residential, commercial and
                     industrial development. There are four school districts that serve Colma: the
                     Bayshore Elementary School District, Jefferson Elementary School District, Pacifica
                     Elementary School District and the Brisbane Elementary School District. There is one
                     high school district, the Jefferson Union High School District. School fees are
                     collected to offset costs of rehabilitation and maintenance of school buildings. Fees
                     are collected on all new construction projects in Colma and on residential remodels
                     in Colma that add 500 square feet or more. Residential school development fees for

                    Parkland Dedication
                    The Colma City Council adopted Ordinance 641 in 2006 to require dedication of land
                    and/or payment of a parkland dedication fee. The parkland dedication fee applies to
                    projects in Colma that require approval of a tentative map or parcel map for
                    residential uses by one or more dwelling units, but exempts subdivisions containing
                    fewer than 5 parcels and not used for residential purposes. This fee is determined
                    by multiplying 0.003 acres per person in the dwelling unit (which is the same as
                    three acres per 1,000 persons) times the total number of dwelling units in the
                    development times the average number of persons per dwelling unit in the
                    subdivision for which the approval of a map is being sought. The ordinance assumes
                    that the average number of persons in a dwelling unit in the subdivision will be 3.05,
                    which is the average occupancy Based on the 2010 Census and the 2007-2011
                    American Community Survey. In subdivisions over 50 lots, or, in the case of a
                    condominium project, stock cooperative or community apartment project, if the
                    subdivision contains more than fifty (50) dwelling units, the developer shall both
                    dedicate land and pay a fee. The purpose of collecting these fees is to provide park
                    and/or recreational land for use by the residents of Colma. The Colma Parkland
                    Dedication Fee ordinance is based on California State enabling legislation, so it is
                    applicable statewide. Therefore, it is not viewed as a constraint to development, as
                    many communities in the area have adopted the same regulations.
                    Local governments typically assess many different types of residential development
                    fees. These include planning fees, building permit and related fees, capital facilities
                    fees and development impact fees. Residential planning and building fees are
                    broadly required by all jurisdictions in San Mateo County. In Colma, such fees are
                    noted here as affecting development, but are not viewed as a governmental
                    constraint.
                    Governmental Constraints on Homeless Shelter Development
                    The Town of Colma is in compliance with California Government Code 65583 4(A)
                    which requires each community to identify one or more zoning districts where
                    emergency shelters are permitted without a use permit or other discretionary
                    permit.

                    Section 5.03.290 of the Town Municipal Code allows for emergency homeless
                    shelters by right in a Commercial (C) zone.
                    Special Housing Accommodations
                    Reasonable Accommodation
                    Chapter 5.15.010 of the Colma Municipal Code provides reasonable accommodation
                    to people with disabilities and complies with the Fair Housing Amendments Act of
                    1988 and the California Fair Employment Act in the application of the Town’s
                    zoning, land use laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, procedures and
                    practices.
                    A request for reasonable accommodation may include a request for modification or
                    exception to the land use rules for the siting, development and use of housing or
                    housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a
                    person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of that person’s choice.
                    Requests for reasonable accommodation are submitted to the City Planner. No fee
                    is required for submitting a letter of request under this chapter or for filing an
                    appeal.    All requests made in connection with a project or other land use
                    entitlement applications are processed concurrently with review of such
                    application(s). Public notice of the request for reasonable accommodation is
                    transmitted along with the application notice, in the manner prescribed for the land
                    use entitlements associated with the project. A written decision to grant or deny a
                    request for reasonable accommodation is based on consideration of the following
                    factors:
                    1)       Whether the housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an
                             individual with a disability under the Act.
                    2)       Whether the request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make
                             specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Act.
                    3)       Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would impose an
                             undue financial or administrative burden on the Town.
                    4)       Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would require a
                             fundamental alteration in the nature of the Town program or law, including,
                             but not limited to, land use and zoning. If the Town determines that a

                              requested accommodation would result in a fundamental alteration or an
                              undue financial or administrative burden, the Town may take any other
                              action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would
                              nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive equal access to
                              the benefits or services provided by the Town.
                    The City Planner may impose conditions of approval upon granting a request for
                    reasonable accommodation to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would
                    comply with the findings required. A written notice of decision is then issued either
                    granting or denying the request within 10-days of the noticing period. Appeals on a
                    decision made by the City Planner to grant or deny a request for reasonable
                    accommodation may be appealed to the City Manager.
                    Group Residential Care
                    California State law requires that residential care facilities that serve six or fewer
                    residents to be considered a residential property and be treated the same as a
                    single-family home. Therefore, local jurisdictions cannot impose restrictions on
                    these facilities, such as additional parking requirement or conditional use permits,
                    other than the restrictions that apply to other single family homes. Such facilities
                    are however required to have a license to operate from the State (Community Care
                    Licensing) and to meet all of their operating requirements that address health and
                    safety issues.
                    The Town of Colma does not require a conditional use permit for residential care
                    homes for more than six (6) people in all zones that allow residential uses. There are
                    no additional regulations or restrictions on residential care facilities that serve more
                    than six (6) residents, no parking standards that are specific to residential care
                    facilities and no specific development standards. The zoning code does not
                    specifically restrict or prohibit residential care facilities for individuals with
                    disabilities. There are no restrictions on distances of care facilities, as State laws
                    addresses overconcentration of facilities as part of the licensing review and
                    issuance. Currently the State law states that, except for residential care facilities for
                    the elderly and alcohol and drug facilities, which must be located at least 300 feet
                    from a similar facility. Occupancy limits are based on the safety requirements of the
                    fire and building codes.

                    Building Code Considerations
                    Colma’s adopted Building Code did not include any amendments that might
                    diminish the ability to accommodate persons with disabilities. While the Town has
                    not adopted universal design elements that address limited lifting or flexibility (e.g.,
                    roll-in showers and grab bars), limited mobility (e.g., push/pull lever faucets, wide
                    swing hinges) or limited vision (e.g., additional stairwells and task lighting), the
                    Town would not restrict permits that include accommodations for individuals with
                    disabilities.
                    Accessibility retrofits are handled through the standard permitting process. The
                    California Building Code provides an option for meeting code requirements,
                    whereby an applicant submits an alternate “methods and means” checklist to the
                    Building Official noting the proposed design, the typical design and the rationale for
                    the request.
                    A program is included that will provide outreach to local service providers of special
                    needs groups, whereby the Town will assist in the identification and analysis of
                    constraints to the provision of housing for persons with disabilities, including lack of
                    capacity and available resources and unmet needs.
                    Supportive and Transitional Housing
                    State law also requires the Town to explicitly permit supportive and transitional
                    housing and treat these land uses identically to other residential uses in the same
                    zone. For example, a multi-family transitional or supportive housing permitted use
                    in a multi-family zone should be treated the same as any other multi-family use
                    proposed in the zone. The same applies to single-family transitional and supportive
                    housing. Supportive and transitional housing must be subject to the same
                    permitting processes as other housing in the zone without undue special regulatory
                    requirements.
                    Transitional housing is a type of rental housing used to facilitate the movement of
                    homeless individuals and families to permanent housing. Stays are for at least six
                    months and units are re-circulated after a set period or when stability and
                    independence are achieved. Supportive services to gain necessary life skills in
                    support of independent living may be provided.

                    Supportive housing is rental housing with no limit on length of stay linked to a range
                    of support services designed to enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead
                    fuller lives. Typically, supportive housing is targeted to people who have risk factors
                    such as homelessness, or health challenges such as mental illness or substance
                    addiction.
                    Together, supportive and transitional housing are one solution to homelessness.
                    They offer the homeless a means to transition to permanent housing.
                    Supportive and transitional housing facilities shall comply with all federal and
                    California State licensing requirements. Supportive and transitional housing facilities
                    shall comply with all applicable California Building and Fire Codes, including
                    maximum occupancy restrictions.
                    In 2013, the Town of Colma amended its zoning code to permit supportive and
                    transitional housing as a permitted residential use in all zones where residential
                    units are permitted.
                    Inclusionary Zoning
                    Inclusionary zoning programs – including Colma’s – are sometimes perceived as
                    adding to the cost of housing by requiring the market-rate housing units to subsidize
                    the affordable units. This is an area of much dispute, both in the Bay Area and
                    nationally.
                    In a 2009 case entitled Palmer v. the City of Los Angeles (“Palmer”), the California
                    Court of Appeal ruled that the City’s “below market rate” (“BMR”) housing
                    requirement could not be imposed on rental housing projects, because this
                    requirement was preempted by the provision of California Civil Code section
                    1954.52, a statute added by a bill known as the Costa Hawkins Act. This decision has
                    called into question whether the Town of Colma can enforce its inclusionary BMR
                    requirement on rental housing projects.
                    In Colma’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, the requirement to add inclusionary
                    units results in substantial costs to a project compared to being allowed to build all
                    market-rate units. Generally, these costs cannot be passed on to other purchasers
                    because buyers will not pay more due to greater development costs; buyers will pay
                    what the market will bear relative to the desirability of the unit, the location and the
                    community. Nor will the developer build for a less profit (unless the developer is

                    unlucky enough to have purchased land and planned a project under one set of
                    assumptions and conditions and must sell units under a different set of conditions
                    as a result of economic climate or change in Town policy). The land price is the
                    variable that adjusts, over time, to absorb the increased costs of development
                    within the community.
                    If the cost of inclusionary housing programs is not borne by the buyers or renters,
                    but rather the developers (in terms of less profit) or the original landowners (also in
                    terms of less profit), the questions then becomes whether or not inclusionary
                    housing policy unfairly reduces the profit one can realize through development of
                    property. Land is a limited community resource and a jurisdiction such as Colma has
                    discretion in implementing a variety of land use mechanisms that tend to restrict
                    both the value and the particular use of property in order to achieve objectives that
                    meet the greatest overall public good.
                    In most instances, the State HCD has analyzed inclusionary housing programs as
                    potential constraints on development.        While the State indicates that housing
                    element law is neutral regarding mandatory local inclusionary housing programs,
                    the State also notes that there may be tradeoffs that must be discussed in the
                    Housing Element’s constraints section.         However, Colma’s program contains
                    provisions that include incentives and concessions to mitigate these impacts.
                    Constraints, therefore, are offset by such provisions to mitigate them.
                    Due to Colma’s small size, no units have been constructed required under the
                    Inclusionary Housing program which was adopted in January 2006. The Town does
                    not believe that the Inclusionary Housing program will increase housing costs to the
                    consumer. Ultimately, the developer will charge market rate rents and sales prices
                    on the unrestricted units, regardless of the development costs. Although the
                    program may impact the developer’s profit, it is difficult to determine at what point
                    those impacts are great enough to discourage moving forward or decreasing the
                    number of units on a development site. Generally, the cost of land has the most
                    impact on those decisions.
                    According to the Town of Colma’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, the following
                    incentives are expressly identified:
                         (1)   A full or prorated reduction in the number or type (covered or uncovered,
                               tandem, etc.) of off-street parking spaces required per dwelling unit;

                         (2)   Expedited processing by all Town departments before other residential
                               land use applications regardless of the original submittal date;
                         (3)   Deferred payment of all city-required fees on a residential development
                               project until issuance of a certificate of occupancy;
                         (4)   Approval of mixed use zoning;
                         (5)   Financial assistance; or
                         (6)   Any other concession or incentive authorized by state law.
                    In summary, the Town has considered the advantages and disadvantages of the
                    Inclusionary Housing program and has determined that the benefits outweigh the
                    costs, especially since developers are afforded incentives to mitigate the costs.
                    In light of case law, Program 3.2 of the 2009 Housing Element recommended that
                    the Town suspend or repeal the Town’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. As an
                    alternative, the Town is participating in a San Mateo County-wide Nexus Study that
                    will be completed in fall of 2014. The Town will consider the recommendations of
                    the study and consider adoption of fees and amendments of existing Inclusionary
                    Ordinance in 2015.

                       NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
                       State law requires that the Housing Element include a discussion of the factors that
                       present barriers to the production of housing, including government actions and
                       market forces (non-governmental constraints). Identification of these constraints
                       helps cities and towns implement measures that address these concerns and reduce
                       their impacts on the production of housing.
                                                 Land Use Constraints
                                                  The Town of Colma was incorporated for the purpose of
                                                  preserving in perpetuity the use of land for cemeteries.
                                                  Cemetery and related uses has historically been the
                                                  primary and most extensive land use zone in the Town.
                                                  Cemeteries and related land uses comprise 76% of the total
                                                  land area, which leaves little remaining land for
                                                  infrastructure, public facilities, housing and commercial

 constraint on housing In addition to the direct constraints that cemeteries place on housing development,
 development.
                       cemeteries also pose indirect contstraints. Some cultural groups and individuals
                       avoid living near cemeteries or where they are visible. Cemeteries also place
                       considerable fiscal challenges on the Town, which receives no tax revenue from
                       cemetery uses or burials. This financial constraint increases the importance of the
                       Town’s regional commercial uses to fund Town services.
                       While the existence of cemeteries in Colma may constrain housing there, at the
                       same time, it facilitiates housing elsewhere. The Colma cemeteries have made, and
                       continue to make land available for housing in San Francisco and San Mateo
                       Counties.

                    Despite these significant fiscal constraints, there are areas in the Town which are
                    available for the development of high density residential uses and a variety of
                    housing types. Specifically, those areas include the mixed use areas identified along
                    El Camino Real, and the existing Sterling Park neighborhood which has sites suitable
                    for infill single family residential development.
                    Housing Cost and Financing Availability
                    Until mid-2008, home mortgage financing was readily available at attractive rates
                    throughout San Mateo County and California. Rates vary, but ranged around 6.25
                    percent to seven percent from 2006-2008 for a 30 year fixed rate loan (HSH
                    Associates Financial Publishers). However, rates have been as high as ten or 12
                    percent in the last decade.
                    As part of the aftermath of the subprime crisis in 2008, interest rates are very low.
                    In San Mateo County, rates range from 4.0-4.5 percent for a fixed-rate, 30-year
                    mortgage. One remaining challenge is that many mortgages in San Mateo County

                          manufactured homes. More than 65 percent of the loan applications were filed by
                          households earning above a moderate income (greater than 120 percent of AMI).
                          Moderate income households (80-120 percent of AMI) represented 18 percent of
                          loan applicants, low income households (50-80 percent of AMI) represent 12

                          Construction Financing
                          Construction loans for new housing are difficult to secure in the current market. In
                          past years, lenders would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction
                          (loan to value ratio). In recent years, due to market conditions and government
                          regulations, banks require larger investments by the builder.
                          Due to Federal and state budget cuts, affordable housing developers have had a
                          much harder time securing funding. Since 2009, the Federal Government has cut
                          programs such as Community Development Block Grants, HOME, and HOPE VI
                          funding by 27-50 percent (ABAG). Traditionally, these programs have been a large
                          source of affordable housing funds. In addition to Federal cuts, the State dissolved

                    Land costs in San Mateo County are high, due in part to the desirability of housing in
                    the county, and because available land is in short supply. These costs vary both
                    between and within jurisdictions based on factors like the desirability of the location
                    and the permitted density.
                    The following land costs are approximate, and derived from conversations with local
                    developers. For a typical multi-family construction in San Mateo County, land costs
                    add approximately $90,000 per unit. Land for a single-family home often costs
                    $400,000 or more per lot.
                    Construction costs include both hard costs, such as labor and materials, and soft
                    costs, such as architectural and engineering services, development fees and
                    insurance. For multi-family homes in San Mateo County, hard costs account of 60-65
                    percent of the building cost and soft costs average around 15-20 percent (the
                    remaining 15-20 percent is land costs). For single family homes, hard costs often are
                    roughly 40 percent of the total cost, soft costs are 20 percent, and land is 40
                    percent.
                    According to housing developers in San Mateo County, construction costs for multi-
                    unit buildings vary based on the form of parking (structured vs. surface) in addition
                    to other environmental factors such as topography, pre-existing structures etc. For
                    a larger, multi-unit building, costs can vary from $185,000/unit to as high as
                    $316,000/unit. The cost per square foot ranges from $172-$200.
                    For the least expensive production single-family homes, the cost of preparing the
                    vacant land is around $100,000/lot, and the cost of construction is approximately
                    $145/sf. For more expensive, custom homes, however, the construction costs can
                    be higher than $435/sf. In general, soft costs add another approximate third to the
                    subtotal.
                    Environmental Conditions
                    In Colma, residential development is not significantly constrained by local
                    environmental conditions. Geotechnical hazards, noise level incompatibility, and
                    flooding considerations are described in more detail in the following section.

                           Flood Hazard
                          Land subject to flooding is concentrated along Colma Creek, which generally
                          parallels El Camino Real. Box culverts along both F Street and at Mission Road

                    creek channel just south of the future South San Francisco BART Station where the
                    creek has increased capacity. Other locations along the Creek may be subject to
                    minor flooding during a major storm. This constraint could affect new development
                    adjacent to the creek. However, mitigation can be accomplished through the
                    provision of on-site stormwater detention and/or raising ground floor elevation to
                    above the 100-year flood level. None of the Town of Colma is within a 100 year
                    flood zone.
                    Public Transportation
                    Regional public transportation is easily accessible from the major residential area of
                    Colma, at the Colma BART Station at the north end of Town and the South San
                    Francisco BART Station at the south end of Town. The Colma BART Station, located
                    off of El Camino Real and across from the Sterling Park residential area, is expected
                    to encourage private development of higher density residential and mixed uses on
                    parcels adjacent to both the Station and El Camino Real. The South San Francisco
                    BART Station may also continue to stimulate development of higher density
                    residential and mixed uses on and around Mission Road, both within Colma and
                    adjacent areas.
                    Opportunities for Energy Conservation
                    Colma encourages its residents to increase energy efficiency, and provides
                    information to the public on measures one can take to increase energy
                    conservation. The Town expanded its efforts to be a more sustainable community
                    by joining the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), which
                    works collaboratively to identify and to reduce existing greenhouse gas (GHG)
                    emissions. Through this collaboration, the Town has completed a GHG inventory of
                    Colma’s residential and government operations and their GHG emissions. The Town
                    adopted a Climate Action Plan in May of 2013 which includes programs and policies
                    to reduce GHG emissions. Since adoption of the Climate Action Plan, substantial
                    reductions in energy use have been realized town-wide through lighting retrofits.
                    The Town of Colma enforces current State standards for energy efficiency in new
                    construction.    All new construction must conform to the State of California’s
                    residential building standards for energy efficiency (Title 24 of the California
                    Administrative Code). Title 24 Standards were established in 1978 to ensure that all
                    new construction meets a minimum level of energy efficiency standards. In 2004,

                    the Town adopted a Construction Demolition and Debris (CD&D) ordinance that
                    requires the recycling and salvaging of construction and demolition materials. The
                    ordinance reduces the amount of materials sent to landfills and conserves energy
                    through the reuse and recycling of materials. Town staff monitors and enforces the
                    CD&D program, which diverts more than 50% of materials from landfill.
                    Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which supplies all of the electric and gas
                    service to the Town, offers a number of programs that provide residents and
                    businesses with the opportunity to conserve energy. The State Energy Commission
                    also offers rebate programs and other programs for low-income residents.          A
                    program to encourage the use of cool roofing systems and other energy
                    conservation measures has been included in this Housing Element.

                    EVALUATION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE 2009
                    HOUSING ELEMENT
                    State housing element law requires communities to assess their achievements
                    under adopted housing programs as part of the update of an existing housing
                    element. These results should be quantified where possible (e.g. rehabilitation
                    results), but may be qualitative where necessary (e.g. mitigation of governmental
                    constraints). Past accomplishments are compared with what was projected or
                    planned as part of the earlier housing element. Where significant shortfalls exist
                    between what was planned and what was achieved, the reasons for such
                    differences must be discussed.
                    The 2009 Housing Element identified a number of programs designed to facilitate
                    affordable housing and quantified the number of units to be achieved through the
                    various programs. An evaluation of the housing programs included in the 2004
                    Housing Element ultimately informed the policies and programs of the 2009 Housing
                    Element, as several successful programs were carried over to this Housing Element,
                    and some less successful programs were modified.
                    Effectiveness of Previous Housing Elements
                    The previous Housing Elements have been effective in maintaining, improving and
                    increasing the supply of new housing. The lack of new housing during the 2009
                    Housing Element period was caused by the recession and is not a reflection on the
                    effectiveness of the policies.
                    The 2004 Housing Element called for 74 new units. Town records show that 92 new
                    units were built under the 2004 Housing Element, exceeding the goal of 74 units.
                    Therefore, the 2004 Housing Element was highly effective in meeting its RHNA
                    allocation. This success was due to a successful identification of housing sites in the
                    Housing Element and policies favorable to housing development.
                    The main factors that allowed the Town to reach its goal, was the development of
                    63 high density units near the South San Francisco BART Station, the development
                    of an additional 18 townhome units, and the development of several single family
                    units within the Sterling Park neighborhood.
                    The 2009 Housing Element called for 65 units. Due to the recession, only two new
                    market-rate single family residential units were built in 2007. The remaining 63

                    units identified in the element remain vacant. Inquiries have been made regarding
                    the development of the sites, and the Town is optimistic that the sites may be
                    developed under the 2015 Housing Element.
                    Colma is in compliance with Assembly Bill 1233, which requires that necessary
                    rezoning identified by the previous Housing Element be adopted within a specific
                    time frame.
                    Appropriateness of the 2009 Housing Element Policies and Programs
                    Many of the policies and programs of the 2009 Housing Element were deemed to
                    remain appropriate and have been carried over to the 2014 Housing Element. The
                    2009 Housing Element contains a series of Implementation Programs. Table H-51
                    provides a program-by-program review considering progress to date in
                    implementation of these program actions, and the continued appropriateness of
                    identified programs. The results of this analysis form the basis for developing the
                    comprehensive housing program strategy presented in the General Plan Housing
                    Element.

                    the development necessary to meet the 2015 through 2023 need for an additional
                    59 housing units.
                    HOUSING UNIT SOURCES
                    In general, the regional housing need allocation (RHNA) for the Town of Colma will
                    be met through private construction, the provision of density bonuses to qualifying
                    developments, and inclusionary housing requirements. However, in addition to
                    private construction, unit rehabilitation, preservation and affordability may also be
                    provided through the development of second units, the development of subsidized
                    units, participation in home sharing programs, and the rehabilitation and
                    conservation of existing housing stock. A brief discussion of the role each of these
                    will play in meeting the Town’s housing need is provided in the following section.
                    Private Construction
                    The majority of new housing expected to be built in Colma within the planning
                    period is likely to be the result of private construction activity. It is anticipated that
                    there will be a continued interest in development in the vicinity of the two BART
                    stations adjacent to Colma, increasing the likelihood that housing project goals can
                    be reached. Additionally, higher density developments are becoming favored in San
                    Mateo County because of its transportation and mild climate benefits.
                    Second Units
                    The Town currently allows second dwelling units on all residential lots except in the
                    Sterling Park neighborhood. Second units are not permitted in Sterling Park because
                    such development would increase the density of this single-family residential area
                    (Sterling Park’s density is already higher than most suburban residential
                    neighborhoods at 13 units per gross acre). Additional reasons for not allowing
                    second units in Sterling Park include the constraint of Sterling Park’s small minimum
                    lot size (3,300 square feet), compliance with the neighborhood’s expectation that
                    only single dwellings will be constructed on vacant or underutilized lots in the
                    neighborhood, a need to prevent overcrowded use of the neighborhood’s streets

2015Housing Element                                                                                         99

                    which may constrain access by emergency vehicles, and the existing high demand
                    for on-street parking spaces throughout the neighborhood.
                     Subsidized Units
                    Existing subsidized housing units within Colma include 18 units developed by the
                    Town with monies from the Town’s general fund reserved for senior tenants.
                    Additionally, the Town subsidizes one very low-income housing unit within a multi-
                    tenant complex. There are no subsidized multi-family rental units at risk in Colma
                    that receive governmental assistance under any of the applicable federal, state and
                    local programs.
                    Home Sharing
                    An additional method of providing affordable housing is home sharing. Home
                    sharing can be facilitated through the provision of information, referral and
                    matching services. Home sharing may be promoted through occasional
                    announcements in the Town’s monthly newsletter. The Daly City Community Service
                    Center also has a home sharing program as do some nonprofit housing advocacy
                    groups working in the County.
                    The Housing Investment Project (HIP) offers home sharing services in San Mateo
                    County. HIP Housing’s Home Sharing program matches those who have space in
                    their home with those who need an affordable place to live, maximizing housing
                    inventory and turning existing housing stock into a new affordable housing option.
                    It is the only program of its kind in San Mateo County and provides a housing option
                    for over 700 people each year. Over 90% of those using the Home Sharing program
                    are low to extremely low income.              Due to the extraordinarily constrained
                    environment for the developing new affordable housing that exists in San Mateo
                    County, finding creative solutions like Home Sharing is a critical component to a
                    local municipality’s ability to provide fair housing choice and should be part of every
                    municipalities efforts to provide housing for people at every income level (source:
                    February 2014 memo from HIP Executive Director Kate Harr).
                    The Town of Colma supports HIP Housing Home Sharing Program with an annual
                    funding commitment as a means to address the housing needs of those at the
                    lowest income levels including seniors, those living with disabilities, those at risk of
                    homelessness and female head of households.

                    Density Bonuses
                    State law currently permits density bonuses as a way to facilitate the provision of
                    affordable dwelling units. Density bonus incentives are offered to Colma developers
                    who provide inclusionary affordable units in multi-unit residential developments
                    that qualify under the Town’s municipal code. Consistent with Government Code
                    Section 69515 et seq., the developer of a proposed housing project of at least five
                    units must provide housing units affordable to income-qualified households to
                    qualify for a density bonus, concessions or other incentives. The Town’s existing
                    code complies with current State law.
                    Rehabilitation and Conservation
                    The Town promotes rehabilitation and conservation of residential properties
                    through several mechanisms, including participation in the “Rebuilding Together
                    Peninsula” program and promotion of a roommate and home sharing referral
                    program for the elderly.
                    The R-S residential zoning district, applicable to the Sterling Park neighborhood,
                    serves to conserve the homes in the Town’s largest residential neighborhood. This
                    ordinance, as well as street improvements undertaken by the Town to increase
                    street beautification, has encouraged private property improvements in the
                    neighborhood. Additionally, the Town continues to actively pursue compliance by
                    property owners on laws related to property maintenance, which can help to
                    promote rehabilitation of existing housing units.
                    Housing Repair Grant Program
                    In 2002, the Town established a Minor Housing Repair Grant Program concurrent
                    with other neighborhood beautification efforts undertaken by the Town at that
                    time. The program provided grants of up to $1,000 per dwelling unit for minor
                    home repairs such as repair of unsafe walkways and porches, installation of
                    insulation and dual-pane windows, and upgrades and retrofitting for disabled
                    access. Since the program expired in 2003, the Town currently encourages residents
                    to apply for assistance through the Rebuilding Together “Safe at Home” program
                    which is a minor home repair program that helps seniors, families, and people with
                    disabilities live more independently by addressing minor repair needs before they
                    become serious safety or deferred maintenance issues. Advertising of these
                    opportunities is done through the Town’s newsletter.

                    Volunteers tackle repairs such as debris removal, fence repair, basic home
                    maintenance, exterior painting, light yard work, minor plumbing, minor electrical,
                    heating repair, roof repair, window repair/replacement, door repair/replacement,
                    energy efficiency measures, and some accessibility modifications.
                    The Town retains the Minor Housing Repair Grant Program in its Municipal Code to
                    allow for reinstatement of the program when needed and when feasible.
                    Special Needs Housing
                    The Town of Colma facilitates and encourages the provision of housing services for
                    special needs populations, including the disabled, and in 2007 adopted a Reasonable
                    Accommodations Ordinance with establishes a procedure by which residents may
                    apply for reasonable accommodations and equal access to housing.
                    Additionally, pursuant to state law, Colma currently permits licensed community
                    care facilities serving six or fewer persons, to be established by right in all residential
                    zoning districts, and eliminated the definition of “family” in the Zoning Code. Colma
                    is developing standards to facilitate the development of larger community care
                    facilities and transitional housing.
                    Inclusionary Housing
                    In December 2005, the Town adopted an Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance, which
                    requires residential developments with five or more units dedicate at least 20% of
                    the units as affordable, inclusionary units. This ordinance was adopted to further
                    the goals of meeting regional housing needs requirements. The ordinance also
                    allows for developers to pay in-lieu fees to fund affordable housing projects
                    elsewhere in Town through establishment of a Housing Trust Fund.
                    Developers including affordable units within their project are also allowed a density
                    bonus of 20%, meaning that they can construct 20% more units than the underlying
                    zoning would normally permit.
                    Inclusionary owner-occupied units have deed restrictions that ensure their ongoing
                    affordability for 45 years.

                    HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
                    This section describes this Housing Element’s policies and programs, and quantifies
                    the objectives intended to guide housing development in Colma until the year 2023.
                    Many of the following programs are carried over from the 2009 Housing Element.
                    PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
                    Citizen involvement in the preparation of the Colma Housing Element was
                    accomplished through the process of two City Council public hearings, as Colma
                    does not have a Planning Commission. The first public hearing was held on October
                    8, 2014 to discuss the background of the Housing Element, the general topics
                    addressed in the Housing Element, and the proposed housing policies and
                    programs. Public notice of the study session was posted on all official bulletin
                    boards in the community and emailed to housing advocacy groups active in San
                    Mateo County. The draft Housing Element was also posted on the Town's website.
                    Due to the extremely small size of the Town of Colma, community outreach is
                    usually done as part of a Council Study Session. Separate workshops held on specific
                    topics are typically not well attended or effective. Input gained at the Study Session
                    was incorporated into the document and informed the policies and programs
                    included herein (update text if necessary based on Public Hearings).
                    In addition to public hearings, input from housing groups and panels hosted by 21
                    Elements were considered in the preparation of this document. Specifically:
                    Correspondence from Bay Area Building Industry Association (BIA) - The BIA has
                    requested that Housing Elements in San Mateo County address the following
                    impediments to the production of housing (summarized from correspondence):
                         •  Consideration of constraints to housing production and reducing those
                            constraints;
                         •  Consideration of the impacts of an Inclusionary Housing Policy;
                         •  Adoption and use of State Density Bonus Law (Govt. Code 65915);
                         •  Cumulative fee exaction and burden on housing;
                         •  Ongoing fees or tax on housing for ongoing services;
                         •  Cap on number or types of housing units;

                        •    Impediments to infill or transit oriented development;
                        •    Inclusion of PDA areas and density allowance in the General Plan;
                        •    Compliance with the Permit Streamlining Act;
                        •    Quimby Act credit to open space;
                        •    Historic Preservation Policies;
                        •    Use of BAAQMD CEQA Thresholds; and
                        •    Climate Action Plan restrictions.
                    The Town of Colma Housing Element addresses and answers a majority of these
                    questions. Where not addressed specifically, Town of Colma policies and procedures
                    do not act to restrict or unduly burden the production of housing. The Town of
                    Colma does currently have a General Plan restriction limiting the number of building
                    permits per year in its General Plan. This restriction is recommended to be removed
                    at the same time the Housing Element is adopted.
                    Correspondence from the Golden Gate Regional Center – The Golden Gate
                    Regional Center has requested that Housing Elements be in compliance with SB812
                    which requires that the needs of development disabilities be discussed in the
                    current Housing Element.         As a result of SB812, the discussion regarding
                    accommodation of the disabled has been greatly expanded in Colma’s current
                    Housing Element to include all types of disabilities.
                    California Housing Element Policy Best Practices, Version 1.2: This document
                    makes recommendations for policies and policy types. Most of these policy types
                    are included in the Colma Housing Element. The following additional policies were
                    considered but found to not be practical for Colma as discussed below:
                        •    Rent Stabilization. The Town of Colma has only 463 residential units, with
                             less than half being rentals. Establishment of rent control or a rent control
                             board for such a small number of units is not practical. The town relies on
                             the San Mateo County Department of Housing to provide resources to
                             renters. Likewise, the town would look to San Mateo County for direction
                             on this issue.
                        •    Just Cause Eviction Ordinance. Since Colma relies on San Mateo County to
                             provide resources to renters, any policy changes in this area would need to
                             be initiated by the County.

                         •  Condominium Conversion Controls.         Given Colma’s small size and low
                            number of multi-family units, the town has never and never expects to
                            receive a request for a condominium conversion.
                         •  Housing Overlay Zone (HOZ). Given the limited land available for housing,
                            establishment of an HOZ is not necessary. The town uses a streamlined
                            Planned Development rezoning process to provide a flexible tool in the
                            development of affordable housing.
                         •  Commercial Linkage Fee and Housing Impact Fee. The town is participating
                            in the Countywide Nexus Study that will make recommendations for a
                            Commercial Linkage Fee and Housing Impact Fee.
                    HIP Housing – In response to HIP’s February 2014 memo to jurisdictions, the Town
                    of Colma expanded the discussion of HIP Housing’s programs which can be found in
                    the HOUSING PROGRAM STATEGY section of this document. A policy regarding
                    homesharing was included in the 2009 Housing Element (Policy 5.2) and has been
                    included in the 2015 Housing Element (Policy 5.2).
                    Key Housing Considerations
                    By the year 2030, nearly one out of four San Mateo County residents will be over
                    the age of 65. We must prepare for the aging baby boomer population by
                    supporting healthy aging. Communities can support healthy older adults by placing
                    neighborhood services near housing to allow for an easy walk between destinations,
                    and viable public transit. Housing options for seniors can include senior housing with
                    a variety of levels of services provided, assisted living facilities (a growing trend),
                    and aging in place. Universal design (a set of building and design standards that
                    make it easy for someone of any age to occupy a housing unit) can assist with aging
                    in place. Shared housing arrangements (i.e., renting a room in an existing home) can
                    also help meet senior needs.
                    Preserving the existing housing stock in Colma is a high priority. Continued
                    maintenance of the existing housing stock helps provide lower-cost housing and
                    ensures high-quality neighborhoods. Housing activities that help achieve these goals
                    include rehabilitation of single- and multi-family housing, and code enforcement.
                    Through code enforcement, neighborhood, and home improvement programs, the
                    Town maintains a safe and healthy condition of existing housing units.

                    Providing affordable housing is essential for a healthy and balanced community. In
                    addition to a diverse mix of housing types, it is necessary to make housing available
                    for residents of all income levels. Throughout the Bay Area, residents face increasing
                    challenges in finding affordable housing due to high housing demand at all levels.
                    High demand and short supply have driven property values to levels that have shut
                    many families and individuals out of the ownership market as well affordable rental
                    housing. Lower-income families in particular find it difficult to secure decent, safe
                    housing. The Town of Colma works with both nonprofit and for-profit developers to
                    assist in the production of affordable for-sale and rental housing when
                    opportunities arise. Seeking funding from varied sources increases opportunities for
                    the development of affordable housing. Meeting the housing needs of all residents
                    of the community requires the identification of adequate sites for all types of
                    housing. By capitalizing on the variety of options available through the General Plan
                    and continuing to maintain an inventory of potential sites, the Town will ensure that
                    adequate residentially zoned and mixed-use sites are available to facilitate the
                    development of a variety of housing types.
                    Market and governmental factors pose constraints to the provision of adequate and
                    affordable housing. These factors tend to disproportionately impact lower- and
                    moderate-income households due to their limited resources for absorbing the costs.
                    The Town of Colma is committed to removing governmental constraints that might
                    hinder the production of housing. To fully meet the community’s housing needs,
                    the Town must ensure that housing is accessible to all residents, regardless of race,
                    religion, family status, age, or physical disability.
                    Housing Element Goals, Policies, Programs and Objectives
                    Colma’s long-term housing goal is to facilitate and encourage housing that fulfills
                    the diverse needs of the community. The Housing Element identifies long-term
                    housing goals and shorter-term policies to address the identified housing needs. The
                    goals and policies are implemented through a series of housing programs. Programs
                    identify specific actions the town will undertake toward putting each goal and policy
                    into action.
                    The goals, policies, and programs build upon the identified housing needs in the
                    community, constraints confronting the town, and resources available to address

                    the housing needs. This Housing Element will guide Colma’s housing policy through
                    the 2015-2023 planning period.
                    Colma’s housing goals, policies, and programs address the six major housing needs
                    identified by State law:
                        •    Maintain and preserve the existing affordable housing stock
                        •    Assist in the development of affordable housing
                        •    Identify adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing
                        •    Remove constraints to housing development
                        •    Promote equal housing opportunity
                        •    Provide programs to meet other identified housing needs
                    Colma takes a comprehensive approach to housing planning. Housing, land use,
                    economic development, and transportation policies work together to address the
                    total housing need in Colma.
                    Colma has established 7 goals relating to housing. These goals are same seven goals
                    that were included in the 2009 Housing Element. Under each goal, policies related
                    to that goal area listed.
                    Goal A:           Identify adequate sites, with appropriate zoning and development
                                      standards and services to accommodate Colma’s share of the
                                      regional housing needs for each income level.
                    Goal B:           Assist in making available adequate housing to meet the needs of
                                      extremely low, very low, low and moderate income households.
                    Goal C:           Address, and where possible, remove governmental constraints to
                                      the maintenance, improvement and development of housing,
                                      including housing for all income levels and housing for persons with
                                      disabilities.
                    Goal D:           Conserve and improve the condition of the existing housing stock.
                    Goal E:           Preserve assisted housing developments at risk of conversion to
                                      market-rate.

                    Goal F:          Promote equal housing opportunities for all persons regardless of

                    To reach the above identified housing goals, specific housing policies and programs
                    have been identified. TableH-53, below, identifies each housing policy, the specific
                    housing goals that the policies relate to, and the programs implementing the

                                  In light of current case law the town is seeking creative ways to
                                  support inclusionary housing.
                                  The Town is participating in the countywide nexus study to
                                  consider appropriate affordable housing impact fees, commercial
                                  linkage fees, and determine a nexus for an affordable housing
                                  requirement that is fair and equitable. The results of this study are
                                  anticipated in late 2014. Once the study is released, the town will
                                  determine which implementation options are most appropriate.
                                  Separate public hearings and environmental analysis will occur for
                                  implementation of any new fees or changes to the existing
                                  inclusionary housing ordinance.

            independent living and sleeping accommodations in conjunction with shared dining and
            recreational facilities. Congregate care usually implies a higher level of care than
            independent living. (See “Community Care Facility.”)
            Consistent: Free from variation or contradiction. Programs in the General Plan are to be
            consistent, not contradictory or preferential. State law requires consistency between a
            General Plan and implementation measures such as the zoning ordinance.
            County: County with a capital “C” generally refers to the government or administration of a

            additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the
            parcel is zoned, usually in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity at the
            same site or at another location. Under California law, a housing development that provides
            10 percent of its units for moderate income or lower income households, or 5 percent of its
            units for very-low income households, or is a senior housing facility, is entitled to a density

            buildings or causes to be built physical building space for use primarily by others, and in
            which the preparation of the land or the creation of the building space is in itself a business
            and is not incidental to another business or activity.
            Development: The physical extension and/or construction of urban land uses. Development
            activities include subdivision of land; construction or alteration of structures, roads, utilities,
            and other facilities; installation of septic systems; grading; deposit of refuse, debris, or fill
            materials; and clearing of natural vegetative cover (with the exception of agricultural

            Development Fee: (See “Impact Fee.”)
            Development Rights: The right to develop land by a land owner who maintains fee-simple
            ownership over the land or by a party other than the owner who has obtained the rights to
            develop. Such rights usually are expressed in terms of density allowed under existing
            zoning. For example, one development right may equal one unit of housing or may equal a
            specific number of square feet of gross floor area in one or more specified zone districts.

            within which uniform zoning regulations and requirements apply; a zone.
            Diversity: Differences among otherwise similar elements that give them unique forms and
            qualities. E.g., housing diversity can be achieved by differences in unit size, tenure, or cost.
            Duplex: A single building under single ownership that is designed for occupation as the
            residence of two families living independently of each other. No part of a duplex is

            uses or features.
            Environmental Impact Report (EIR): A report required by the California Environmental
            Quality Act for a project, including a General Plan, that may have a significant effect on the
            environment. The report assesses all the environmental characteristics of an area and
            determines what effects or impacts will result if the area is altered or disturbed by a

            Floor Area Ratio (FAR): The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net area
            of the site, expressed in percent. For example, on a site with 10,000 net sq. ft. of land area,
            a Floor Area Ratio of 100 percent will allow a maximum of 10,000 gross sq. ft. of building
            floor area to be built. On the same site, an FAR of 150 percent would allow 15,000 sq. ft. of
            floor area; an FAR of 200 percent would allow 20,000 sq. ft.; and an FAR of 50 percent
            would allow only 5,000 sq. ft. Also commonly used in zoning, FAR's typically are applied on a
            parcel-by-parcel basis as opposed to an average FAR for an entire land use or zoning district.
            Footprint; Building Footprint: The outline of a building at all of those points where it meets
            the ground.
            General Plan: A compendium of town policies regarding its long-term development, in the
            form of maps and accompanying text. The General Plan is a legal document required of
            each local agency by the State of California Government Code Section 65301 and adopted
            by the City Council or Board of Supervisors. In California, the General Plan has seven
            mandatory elements (Circulation, Conservation, Housing, Land Use, Noise, Open Space,
            Safety and Seismic Safety) and may include any number of optional elements (such as Air
            Quality, Economic Development, Hazardous Waste, and Parks and Recreation). The General
            Plan may also be called a “City Plan,” “Comprehensive Plan,” or “Master Plan.”

            Title 42, Chapter 119, Subchapter I, §11302) Includes those who are accommodated with
            friends or others with the understanding that shelter is being provided as a last resort. (See

            Households, Number of: The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more
            persons. The concept of household is important because the formation of new households
            generates the demand for housing. Each new household formed creates the need for one
            additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared by two
            households. Thus, household formation can continue to take place even without an
            increase in population, thereby increasing the demand for housing.
            Housing and Community Development Department of the State of California (HCD): The
            State agency that has principal responsibility for assessing, planning for, and assisting
            communities to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income households.
            Housing Element: One of the seven State-mandated elements of a local general plan, it
            assesses the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the
            community, identifies potential sites adequate to provide the amount and kind of housing
            needed, and contains adopted goals, policies, and implementation programs for the
            preservation, improvement, and development of housing. Under State law, Housing
            Elements must be updated every five years.
            Housing Unit: A house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a
            single room that is occupied as a separate living quarters, or if vacant, is intended for
            occupancy as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the
            occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct
            access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of
            separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupancies whenever possible.

            Impact: The effect of any direct man-made actions or indirect repercussions of man-made
            actions on existing physical, social, or economic conditions.
            Impact Fee: A fee, often called a development fee, levied on the developer of a project by a
            town, county, or other public agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts
            the project will produce. California Government Code Section 66000 et seq. specifies that
            development fees shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service
            for which the fee is charged. To lawfully impose a development fee, the public agency must
            verify its method of calculation and document proper restrictions on use of the fund.
            Implementation: Actions, procedures, programs, or techniques that carry out policies.
            Improvement: The addition of one or more structures or utilities on a parcel of land.
            Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or left-over
            properties) within areas that are already largely developed.
            Infrastructure: Public services and facilities, such as sewage-disposal systems, water-supply
            systems, other utility systems, and roads.

            County will expend effort in the context of striving to achieve a broader goal. An objective
            should be achievable and, where possible, should be measurable and time-specific. The
            State Government Code (Section 65302) requires that general plans spell out the
            “objectives,” principles, standards, and proposals of the general plan. “The addition of 30
            units of affordable housing by 2006” is an example of an objective.

            recreation amenities; and enforcement of covenants, conditions, and restrictions by a
            master community association. In Colma, a Planned Development is permitted certain
            flexibility in the standards of development (such as setback and percentage of lot coverage)

            but is not mandatory. A general direction that a governmental agency sets to follow, in
            order to meet its goals and objectives before undertaking an action program. (See
            “Program.”)
            Poverty Level: As used by the U.S. Census, families and unrelated individuals are classified
            as being above or below the poverty level based on a poverty index that provides a range of
            income cutoffs or “poverty thresholds” varying by size of family, number of children, and

            existing and projected housing need, by household income group, for all localities within a
            region. San Mateo County and its 20 cities have used a provision in the applicable statute
            that allows formation of a subregional organization to accept the county’s RHN from ABAG
            with authority to distribute the total subregional need across the county’s 20 cities and its
            unincorporated areas. Members of the City/County Association of Governments of San
            Mateo County (C/CAG) agreed on and adopted the local distribution of the subregional
            housing need for the individual jurisdictions.

            parent or guardian’s children, one of whom has a chronic, life-threatening illness. “Six or
            fewer persons” does not include the licensee or members of the licensee’s family or
            persons employed as facility staff. (Health and Safety Code, §1568.01) Residential care
            facilities which serve six or fewer persons are considered a residential use of property.
            (Health and Safety Code, §1568.0831)
            Residential, Multi-family: Usually three or more dwelling units on a single site, which may

            housing for low- and moderate-income households in new housing developments and in
            conversions of apartments to condominiums.
            Zoning Map: Government Code Section 65851 permits a legislative body to divide a county,
