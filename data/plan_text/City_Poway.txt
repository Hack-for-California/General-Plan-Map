                  GOALS             POLICIES AND STRATEGIES
The General Plan of the              of
                                City    Poway     is   statement of what the       present residents want
for their  community       in the future       Its fun    ion is to allow the citizens to consciously
consider the      shape   their        will take for t
                                 City                      e foreseeable future and to preserve and
enhance those       qualities they presently find so        appealing It accomplishes this by setting
forth broad     goals translating these goals into specific policy            statements and      specifying
strategies to accomplish the objectives of the plan
The General Plan Guidelines which              were                    the State Office of
                                                      published by                            Planning and
Research in November of 1990 defines                a  general plan    as   a statement of    development
policies     It suggests    that  a  goal  is a  direction setter    It is an ideal future end condition
or  state related to the    public health safety or general        welfare toward which       planning and
planning implementation measures are directed                      A   policy   is defined   as   a specific
statement that      guides    decision                 It indicates
                                         making                       a  clear commitment of the local
legislative body       Strategies    are   the  specific   means   by   which the   City plans   to achieve
its goals
While the California Government Code establishes                   seven     mandatory elements which
must be included in the General Plan it also                 acknowledges that these elements and
others which may be included by choice               are inextricably intertwined      Strategies adopted
to further one goal may affect the attainment of another and goals often deal with issues
which may be discussed in more than one element of the plan To make it easier to see
the overall picture being presented by the general plan therefore                        all of the goals
policies  and    strategies   included   are   presented     here in   one  list   Those  relating  to each
master element will be         repeated    at the end of that document

       Minimize the       consumption of non

   It was   estimated that the regional       overall
  energy       strategy could result         in   net
  consumer savings        of over   9 billion   1982
  constant dollars       by the year 2000
  If  fully implemented the regional overall
  energy strategy has the potential to save
  about 40       percent  of annual natural gas
  consumption        and 17 percent of annual
  electricity consumption      in 1990 and 2000
  The       recommended          overall    energy
  strategy also has the potential to meet
 growth in peak electricity generation
 capacity needs and almost completely
 eliminate the need for expensive oil and
 natural gas fired electricity

2     Lot sizes and     shapes    should allow for    properly spaced buildings provide      areas  for
      landscaping      and reduce conflicts      between incompatible land uses
3     Lot size and      spacing should encourage          a variety   in the  design orientation   and
      placement of      structures
4     Residential      neighborhoods       are  encouraged     to include    an entry  statement and
      exterior walls along      arterial  roadways
5     Lot sizes and      shapes    should follow      a rectangular pattern    with  a lot depth  to lot
      width ratios between 2 1 and 3 1
6     Lot widths and      depths should      be varied where feasible
7     The    use  of rural residential  flag  lots is encouraged    where necessary to reduce land
       alteration for   roadways
8      Lots less than 8 000 square feet in area should utilize more uniform rectangular lot
       configurations Lots in rural residential areas where there is more slope should be
                   to follow the natural contour minimize land alteration and be consistent
       designed
       with the   City s hillside development criteria
9      Within    the   High Valley area boundaries              on  file at the    Planning   Services
       Department the following criteria shall apply
              two net    acres   shall be the minimum lot size
               aU lots  prepared   for division less than    eight net acres in size shall include a
               minimum of     one   contiguous     net acre  building site with an average slope of
               less than 25    percent     and
                              site shall be  logically located in regard    to access consistent with

               or ridgelines
 10     No  existing legally subdivided parcels shall be deemed nonconforming by virtue
        of the slope requirements in the rural residential land use categories
                                                                                                 of new

                  Lot  averaging  shall not result in    an   increase to the overall      density  of the
                  subdivision     The   project proponent shall clearly demonstrate through
                  submission of a  conventional subdivision design that the proposed number
                  of lots could be created without lot     averaging
                  The number of lots allowable shall be calculated based upon the

                  which shall when   appropriate be dedicated in fee to the City
                  Other than dedicated lettered open space lots           no lot may be created which
                  is smaller than the minimum for the zone
                  Lots created  as a  result of lot averaging      may not be further subdivided
 14      Proponents may be required to prove that           a  lot  requested   for subdivision   was  not
         created as a result of lot averaging
 15      Developers shall be required to employ proper site planning so as to minimize                 the
         amount of grading needed for development and utility construction
16       Development sites       and associated       roadways should        be oriented to follow the
         natural terrain to maintain     landform integrity
17       Development should         be concentrated in the least            environmentally sensitive
         locations in order to preserve open space             retain natural vegetation and protect
         natural cultural and historic features
18       Development should be sited to avoid potentially hazardous areas and
         environmentally sensitive areas such as land known to contain large
         concentrations of Friars Formation landslides faults and valuable biological
         resources such as riparian corridors mixed chaparral and coastal

               above slope graded area table To achieve a grading allowance the
               applicant will be required to prepare two concept grading plans one denoting
              the 25     or less driveway and the other a 20       or less driveway slope    The
              difference in the amount     of graded   area  between   the  two concept grading
               plans would not be counted toward the maximum graded area If the quantity
              of material graded to achieve the 20       slope exceeds the maximum allowable
                                                                 the Director of Development
              graded area for the lot by less than 20
               Services may approve the additional grading If the quantity of material
              graded to achieve the 20 slope exceeds the maximum allowable graded
              area for the lot by 20     or more approval by the City Council is required      In
              either case the quantity of material that may exceed the maximum graded
              area is limited to only the quantity of material necessary to reduce the road or
              driveway slope from a maximum of 25 to 20

        expanses of bared earth at any            given time
 6      Topsoil   removed       during grading should be retained and replaced on the landscaped
        areas    of the  building site to minimize the grading and removal of top soil from other
        locations

       or open space     uses
 23    Structures which do not conform to         Poway   Flood Hazard     Management standards
       must be   brought into conformance with these standards if reconstruction rebuilding
       or repairing made necessary by damage will exceed 50 percent of the reasonable
       replacement value of the structure prior to any damage

       administration buildings and schools shall not be located in flood hazard             areas
25     Development     within the 100 year     floodway   is prohibited
26     Development in    the 100 year floodplain may be       approved   if the following conditions
       are  met
             All structures  both  permanent      and temporary   must be raised     one  foot above
             the 100 year flood level
             Information certifying the 100 year flood level must be submitted

      the City Engineer This does not preclude the City from requiring storm drainage
      detention for projects which do not exceed a 10 percent differential increase in
      storm drainage

Policy C    land Use and       Transportation
Ensure that the   City  s transportation  system does not become overburdened
Strateaies
1      Avoid   approving any development that will increase the traffic on a City roadway
       above the existing design capacity at level of Service C unless trafficroadway
       design mitigation is available and or will be implemented to achieve the desired
       Level of Service       Or if no feasible alternatives are  available cumulative land          use
                     roadways    should be assessed to ascertain the contribution of each
       impacts   on                                                                                 new
       use   being  considered
2      Prohibit  development     which will result in Level of Service E       or F at any intersection
       unless    no   feasible  altematives exist and      an   overriding       public need can be
       demonstrated
3       Developments which will result in a concentration of people such as multiplefamily
        residential developments should be located in proximity to commercial services and
        along primary roadway corridors or in other locations of high transit potential or
        access
4       Continue to      develop neighborhood parks in proximity              to residential   areas   to
        encourage pedestrian travel to recreation facilities
 Policy  D   Public Service Constraints
The land use pattem and population should be consistent with the              capability of existing and
 planned public   services and facilities
 Strategies
 1      Development should not overburden the ability of local school districts to provide a
        consistent level of quality educational services and facilities to community residents
        The City supports changes to state law which would remove restrictions on local
        jurisdictions ability to deny development based on inadequate schools
 2       Land  uses    and   development review applications      that are inconsistent with the
                                                                                    service shall not be

          development application which requires community sewer service
5         New   development should not increase overall water consumption All possible
          water conservation techniques shall be incorporated into the design of the project
          and the remaining water requirement shall be offset through contribution to

Strategies
1.        Avoid         approving                any development                        that will increase                        the traffic          on a City roadway
          above          the design                  capacity             threshold              unless             traffic/ roadway                design           mitigation            is
          available            and/ or will be implemented                                  to achieve                  the desired             capacity.          If no feasible
          alternates               are available,                    cumulative                land use impacts                           on roadways                    should          be
          assessed              to ascertain               the contribution                    of each new land use being considered.
2.        Prohibit           development                    which          will     result        in Levels                 of Service (           LOS)         exceeding “              D”
          during           the two                highest             peak          hours           at any intersection                             unless            no feasible
          alternatives               exist       and an overriding                      public         need can be demonstrated.
3.        Developments                       that would                result        in a concentration                           of people,              such as multiple-
          family        residential               developments                     should          be located,                  where        feasible,          in proximity              to
          commercial,                 food, and employment                               uses, as well as in the vicinity                                  of schools,             parks
          and primary                   roadway              corridors,             and other                 locations             of high transit                use such as
          designated                Smart          Growth           locations.
4.        Continue               to develop                  neighborhood                     parks             in proximity                to     residential              areas         to
          encourage                pedestrian              travel to recreation                       facilities.

   Explanation
   Slight
                    means   that soil  properties are generally favorable or in other words limitations are minor
                    and   easily  overcome    and the soil can support a filter field of appropriate size that is
                                         and maintained
                    properly installed
   Moderate and Severe
                    indicate progressively greater limitations and the need for compensating measures In
                    some areas      enlargement of the filter fields suffices but in others limitations may be

Policy B    Waterways      and Water     Quality
The natural character of creeks and channels should be maintained                or  restored to the
greatest  extent             with consideration for    maintaining adequate        flood  protection
                  possible
Development will   comply   with  all State regulations relative  to water  quality protection to the
maximum extent practicable
Strategies
1      Development including       roads should be set back from      riparian corridors a minimum
       distance of 50 feet or a sufficient distance as determined by a qualified biologist to
       avoid damage to these areas These riparian corridors and associated buffer areas
       should be   designated as permanent natural open space easements and the buffer
       areas  should be   vegetated only with appropriate native species as determined by a
       qualified biologist or native plant horticulturist
2      The  preservation and where possible the creation or restoration of areas                 that
       provide important water quality benefits such as riparian corridors wetlands              and
       buffer zones shall be encouraged
3      No  activity or development shall be permitted within the watershed or viewshed of
       Lake Poway which would diminish water quality of the lake or its open space and
       recreational value
4      Disturbances of natural water bodies and natural drainage systems caused by
       development including roads highways and bridges shall be limited to the extent
       practicable
5      Natural locations and rates of      discharge into creeks and channels should not be
       increased without sufficient mitigation to ensure that significant alteration of the
       natural system will not occur
6      Avoid to the maximum extent        practicable development of areas that are particularly
       susceptible   to erosion and sediment loss or establish         development guidance that
       identifies these areas and protects them from erosion and sediment loss
7      The  use of  rip rap in stream channels shall be limited to the minimum area required
       to protect adjacent improvements and stream banks from excessive erosion

January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020.
This document presents a plan to achieve the City’s housing goal, while meeting the
requirements of the State of California (Article 10.6 of the Government Code) and includes:
analysis of the previous Housing Element (2005-2010) and current housing factors (physical,
fiscal, regulatory); identification of constraints to achieving the housing goal; and proposed
modifications and refinements to the objectives, policies and programs identified in the
previous Housing Element. In addition to responding to the requirements of State law, Poway’s
Housing Element demonstrates how the strategies to meet its locally determined housing needs
are addressed through plans, programs and projects.
The goal of the Housing Element Update is to help ensure that suitable, safe housing is
available at a cost that is affordable to all current and future residents of this community.
Toward this end, the City will encourage a variety of individual choices of tenure (i.e. rental,
home-ownership), type and location of housing throughout the community. This Housing
Element, while mandated by State law, also represents a roadmap for Poway to continue
promoting sustainable housing opportunities for all its residents now and into the future.
A.       2005-2010 Housing Element Review
The previous Housing Element (2005-2010) incorporated the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) Plan adopted by the San Diego Association of Governments ( S A N D A G )
Board of Directors. The RHNA r e p r e s e n t s a distribution and allocation of dwelling units
to satisfy housing needs throughout the 19 jurisdictions in San Diego County. The RHNA
process occurs during each Housing Element cycle and the St at e’s Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) delegates the allocation of regional dwelling units to
SANDAG. The RHNA for the previous Housing Element for the projection period of 2003
through 2010 allocated 1,242 new units to Poway, consisting of 285 units for very low income,
216 units for low income, 235 units for moderate income, and 505 units for above moderate
income households. During that same time period, a total of 588 affordable housing units were
constructed, which was 47 percent of the quantified allocation. An evaluation summary of the
goals, strategies and programs of the previous Housing Element is included in Chapter 5 of this
Housing Element Update.
Several of the goals and objectives identified in the previous Housing Element were addressed
through implementation of programs designed to facilitate the support for housing in Poway.
Within the past few years, the City amended its Municipal Code to:
        Implement an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone program; and

        Incorporate State Requirements (Water Conservation Landscape Ordinance, California
         Green Building Standards); and
        Streamline certain permit processes; and
        Modify Density Bonus regulations and Reasonable Accommodation requirements
All of these efforts and actions indicate that the previous Housing Element Update was
successful in promoting and achieving the overall goal for housing in the City of Poway.
B.       Public Participation
The City was diligent with its efforts to achieve public participation of all economic segments in
the development and adoption of the new Housing Element Update. Poway’s outreach program
included workshops where participants provided feedback on housing topics as well as broader
community issues. Various objectives, policies, and programs identified in this Housing
Element Update address the participants’ feedback. More detail on the public participation
process is described in Chapter 1.
C.       State Legislation
The State Legislature took action to eliminate California redevelopment agencies in June 2011.
Ultimately, the legislation was challenged and taken up for immediate review by the California
Supreme Court. While the matter was pending judicial review, all new redevelopment activity
(including housing) was prohibited.        Once upheld by the Supreme Court, the legislation
effectively reached back to January 2011, only giving former redevelopment agencies the
limited ability to make payments and perform obligations that were in effect as of that date.
The City of Poway anticipated the State’s intent to eliminate redevelopment agencies and
formed the Poway Housing Authority in March 1, 2011. On January 13, 2012, the City
designated the Poway Housing Authority as successor agency to the former Poway
Redevelopment Agency and the recipient of the housing assets and liabilities of the former
redevelopment agency.
Redevelopment monies were one of the three main funding sources used to make affordable
developments viable statewide. The others are State bond funds and Federal funds
administered through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The City cannot
directly apply for Federal housing funds as they are administered through the County of San
Diego.
Successor agencies to the former redevelopment agencies were given the ability to pay existing
bonded indebtedness and other enforceable obligations, subject to approval by the State
Department of Finance. Any excess funds not needed for enforceable obligations are then
distributed by the County to other taxing agencies including school districts, thereby providing
relief to the State budget. Unfortunately, there were no provisions when redevelopment was
eliminated to provide ongoing funding for affordable housing. In fact, housing funds that were
held by former redevelopment agencies and not encumbered for housing purposes prior to
January 1, 2011, were returned to the County Auditor-Controllers in November 2012 and
May 2013                                                   Housing Element Update | Page ES-2

City of Poway
Housing Element Update 2013-2020
subsequently redistributed as regular property tax. The only housing funds successor agencies
could retain were those encumbered for debt service or other approved enforceable obligations.
Although the impacts involved in the California Supreme Court decision to eliminate
redevelopment funds may be unknown for several years, many speculate that this decision will
result in a loss of millions of dollars of annual funding designated for affordable housing
throughout California. It is anticipated that new avenues for funding economic development
and affordable housing will be created and tested in the coming years, but because of the
uncertainty of available funds at this time, a conservative approach to affordable housing
programs is recommended throughout this document.
Existing and new legislation relating to the purpose of Housing Elements is described and
considered in the analysis of programs to be implemented for the 2013-2020 Housing Element
cycle. The legislation is identified, analyzed, and a recommendation regarding programs is
listed further in this document in Chapters 1, 3, 5 and 6.
D.       Housing Needs Assessment
The Needs Assessment utilizes socio-economic data to discuss the major components of
housing needs in Poway. In preparing for the next cycle of the RHNA, data has been collected
from a variety of sources to develop a comprehensive assessment of the community.
California’s housing market peaked in the summer of 2005 when a dramatic increase in the
State’s housing supply was coupled with low interest rates. The period between 2006 and 2010,
however, reflects a time of significant change as the lending market collapsed and home prices
saw significant decreases.        Double-digit decreases in median sale prices were recorded
throughout the State until recently. A reduction in the number of sales was a result of
increasingly limited availability of credit. As such, housing production in the last few years has
been limited while the need for affordable housing increased along with high unemployment
rates and foreclosure rates.
The following is a summary of certain demographic criteria that has been evaluated for Poway
in comparison to the San Diego County region:
        A median household income of $96,854 (adjusted for inflation 2010 dollars) which is 35
         percent higher than the region median household income of $62,771 (adjusted for
         inflation 2010 dollars).
        A limited supply of vacant developable residential land.
        A limited supply of redevelopment and infill lands available for residential development.
        An older housing stock, with 58 percent (9,773) of the dwelling units within the City built
         before 1970.
        A median price of dwelling units sold at $448,750 in Poway in 2012, approximately
         $106,000 higher than in the region.
The previous Housing Element (2005-2010) utilized the SANDAG 2030 Regional Growth
Forecast which stated Poway was expected to gain 3,770 new residents and 431 new
dwelling units between 2000 and 2010. Poway experienced notable demographic changes
May 2013                                                    Housing Element Update | Page ES-3

City of Poway
Housing Element Update 2013-2020
since the 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle.         These changes to the City’s population and
housing are summarized below:
       Population in the City decreased from 48,044 in 2000 to 47,811 in 2010.
       Rental housing costs increased from $1,195 per month in 2000 to $1,339 per month in
        2010 (adjusted for inflation 2010 dollars) an increase of 12 percent (depending on
        bedroom number).
       Owner-occupied dwelling units decreased less than one percent.
The Housing Element Update (2013-2020) uses the SANDAG 2050 Regional Growth Forecast,
adopted with SANDAG’s Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) which projects that Poway will
gain 3,326 new residents and 918 new dwelling units between 2008 and 2020. This projection
is consistent with the land use and zoning policies of the City’s General Plan.
E.      Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Programs
In order to achieve suitable, safe housing available to all current and future residents of the
community at a cost that is within the reach of the diverse economic segments that comprise
this community, the City has established objectives and programs to meet its stated goal. The
previous Housing Element objectives were analyzed and have been reorganized with specific
policies and programs.
The new Housing Element Update (2013-2020) for Poway will be similar to the previous
Housing Element except that a new Residential Sites Inventory (Table 4-4 in Chapter 4 and
Table 1 in Appendix A) that identifies all affordable housing sites will be included and Poway’s
housing policies will need to be in compliance with new State mandates. The new update
describes demographic changes, constraints that impact development of housing, refinements
to the City’s objectives and programs to incorporate recent legislation, public participation, and
the recent inventory and assessment of local and regional housing needs.
The State of California recognizes that total housing need may exceed the locality’s ability to
meet those needs with existing resources. For that reason, jurisdictions are required to
estimate and categorize the number of dwelling units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated or
conserved/preserved (quantified objectives) according to each allocated RHNA income level.

City of Poway
1 - Introduction
A.      Purpose and Content of Housing Element
The California State Legislature enacted legislation to assure the attainment of the State
housing goal by requiring that counties and cities prepare and implement housing elements.
The Housing Element Update (2013-2020) for the City of Poway is a required component of the
City’s General Plan and covers the time period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020.
The Housing Element Update is designed to provide the City with a coordinated and
comprehensive strategy for promoting the production of safe, decent and affordable housing
within the community. This document presents a plan to achieve the City’s housing goal while
meeting the requirements of the State of California (Article 10.6 of the Government Code) and
includes:
       Analysis of the previous Housing Element (2005-2010) and current housing factors
        (physical, fiscal, regulatory);
       Identification of constraints to achieving the housing goal; and
       Proposed modifications and refinements to the objectives, policies and programs
        identified in the previous Housing Element.
A priority of both State and local governments, Government Code Section 65580 states the
intent of creating housing elements:
        The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early
        attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
        California family is a priority of the highest order.
According to state law, the Housing Element has two main purposes:
        a.       To provide an assessment of both current and future housing needs and
                 constraints in meeting these needs; and
        b.       To provide a strategy that establishes housing goals, policies and programs.
State law requires that all cities adopt a Housing Element and describe in detail the necessary
contents of the housing element.              This Housing Element Update responds to those
requirements, and responds to the special characteristics of Poway’s housing environment.
This Housing Element Update incorporates the most current data and information readily
available at the time of writing. It also includes an evaluation of the previous Housing Element
(2005-2010) adopted in 2008, an assessment of the current and potential housing actions, and
an assessment of resources of the private sector and all levels of the public sector.
The City of Poway Housing Element Update is an eight-year plan for the 2013-2020 housing
cycle for jurisdictions in the San Diego region. The Housing Element Update serves as an
integrated part of the General Plan, but is updated more frequently, as required by state law, to
ensure its relevancy and accuracy. The Housing Element identifies strategies and programs
that focus on:
                Matching housing supply with need;
                Maximizing housing choices throughout the community;
                Assisting in the provision of affordable housing;
                Removing governmental and other constraints to housing investment; and
                Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.

City of Poway
1 - Introduction
The Housing Element Update consists of the following Chapters:
       Chapter 1 - Introduction: Provides a brief overview of the purpose and background for
        the Housing Element Update.
       Chapter 2 – Community Profile: A profile and analysis of the City's demographics,
        housing characteristics, and existing and future housing needs.
       Chapter 3 – Constraints: An analysis of constraints to housing production and
        retention, including various market, governmental and environmental limitations to
        meeting Poway's identified housing needs.
       Chapter 4 – Housing Resources: An overview of resources available to accommodate
        and provide housing for all income levels, including land available for new construction
        and financial and administrative resources available for housing in Poway.
       Chapter 5 – Program Accomplishments: An assessment of past accomplishments
        and an evaluation of programs that should be continued, modified or added.
       Chapter 6 – Housing Plan: Outlines the City’s overall housing goals, objectives,
        policies, and programs over the housing cycle (2013-2020), and addresses the City's
        identified housing needs and the requirement to comply with State law.
B.      Community Context
The City of Poway incorporated in December 1980 as a full-service, general law City and
operates under the Council/Manager form of government. Poway, with a population of
approximately 47,811 (2010 U.S. Census) residents, is a unique community in San Diego
County. Located in northeast San Diego County, Poway is known as “The City in the Country”
and prides itself on the fact that over half of the City’s 39.4 square-mile area is preserved as
dedicated open space. The community offers a diverse range of housing options, an
outstanding school district, a thriving business park with over 19,000 jobs, a broad range of
dining and shopping opportunities, beautiful parks, over 82 miles of trails, and over 50
community events each year. Figure 1-1 depicts a Vicinity Map of Poway.
Within the City limits are approximately 16,660 (2006-2010 American Community Survey)
housing units. The City’s vacancy rate is approximately less than 4 percent. There is a broad
continuum of housing options available, ranging from multi-family apartments to single-family
homes on large rural parcels. Single-family dwellings make up 79.3 percent of the City’s
housing units.
The City of Poway faces important challenges in its planning for sufficient housing, obtaining
resources for affordable housing, and implementing housing programs for City residents. Rising
housing costs, expanding employment opportunities, limited funding resources, and changing
demographics require that the City develop an approach and strategy to producing housing that
matches the needs of existing and future residents of the community.
Since the 1990’s, Poway has experienced substantial changes in demographics and
employment. One especially significant change is the decline in the number of younger
households and families with children. While new employment opportunities have been created
in Poway in recent years with the development of the Poway Business Park and retail and
services for local residents, many of the jobs pay wages are equivalent to low and moderate
incomes.

City of Poway
1 - Introduction
Another challenge the City is facing is the rising cost of housing in relation to San Diego County
incomes. This combination has led to increasing rates of overcrowding among lower income
renters and overpayment among both renters and home owners. Compounding the City’s
challenge in planning for adequate housing is that the primary growth in housing over the past
decade has been single-family homes that are generally unaffordable to many households in
San Diego County. During the same period, the construction of multifamily housing has
remained a small fraction of overall housing construction, although the City has made significant
progress in encouraging the development of affordable housing through the City’s former
Redevelopment Agency. The City and the former Redevelopment Agency were able to assist in
the construction of over 700 affordable housing units since 1999 and assist nearly 150 other low
and moderate income households through various affordable housing programs.
California’s housing market peaked in the summer of 2005 when a dramatic increase in the
State’s housing supply was coupled with low interest rates. The period between 2006 and
2010, however, reflects a time of significant change as the lending market collapsed and home
prices saw significant decreases, resulting in the 2008 economic recession.            Double-digit
decreases in median sale prices were recorded throughout the State until recently. As such,
housing production in the last few years has been limited while the need for affordable housing
increased along with high unemployment rates and foreclosure rates.
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) developed the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) Plan for the San Diego region utilizing an estimated housing stock
projection for the region that was accepted by the State’s Housing and Community
Development Department (HCD). The RHNA Plan covers an eleven-year projection cycle
(January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2020). In consultation with the County and the cities
within the region, SANDAG assigned a housing production goal to each jurisdiction in the
region. These regional plans typically cover a period that begins two years before the deadline
for the update of a housing element. Therefore, the SANDAG plan covers the planning cycle
from January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2020. As a result of the RHNA allocation, Poway must
accommodate 1,253 additional housing units through the end of 2020, of which 28 percent
should be affordable to households earning 80 percent or less of the San Diego County median
income and 22.5 percent affordable to households earning between 80 and 120 percent of
median income.
The 2013-2020 Housing Element Update addresses these issues by identifying affordable
housing sites in a new Residential Sites Inventory (Chapter 4) and implementing housing goals
and objectives through a comprehensive housing strategy. The creation of a suitable and
effective housing strategy is a complex process, but one defined by the needs of those living
and working within the community. This requires an approach that can produce an equally
diverse range of housing choices, including single-family homes, apartments, housing for
special needs groups, and many others.
C.       State Requirements
The California Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living
environment for every resident as the State’s major housing goal. Recognizing the important
role of local planning programs in pursuing this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities
and counties prepare housing elements as part of their comprehensive general plans. Section
65302(c) of the Government Code sets forth the specific components to be contained in a
community’s housing element.

City of Poway
1 - Introduction
State law requires housing elements to be updated at least every eight years to reflect a
community’s changing housing needs. State law has allowed eleven years for the current cycle.
Poway’s Housing Element was last updated in 2008 for the 2005-2010 planning cycle. A critical
measure of compliance with State Housing Element law is the ability of a jurisdiction to
accommodate its share of the regional housing as determined by a regional housing needs
plan. Table 1-1 below is a list of amendments to State law since the adoption of the previous
housing element, with a brief analysis and recommendations:

City of Poway
1 - Introduction
E.      Relationship to other General Plan Elements
The Housing Element is a component of the General Plan, which in part, provides guiding policy
for residential land use and development in Poway. The General Plan is divided into six master
elements that address both the State-mandated planning issues plus optional subjects that are
of particular concern within Poway. The master elements include: Community Development,
Public Facilities, Transportation, Natural Resources, Public Safety and Housing. Some of these
master elements are further divided into elements: Community Development includes Land Use
and Community Design; Transportation includes Roadways, Public Transit, Bikeways and
Pedestrian Facilities; Resources includes Natural Resources and Prehistoric and Historic
Resources; and Public Safety includes Emergency Services and Hazard Management. State
law requires consistency among elements of the General Plan. Goals and policies contained
within the Housing Element should be interpreted and implemented in a consistent manner with
the goals and policies of the other General Plan elements. To ensure consistency of the
Housing Element with the remainder of the General Plan, a consistency analysis of the entire
document was conducted.
The City will continue to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and other General
Plan elements so that policies introduced in one element are consistent with other elements. At
this time, the Housing Element does not propose significant changes to any other element of the
General Plan. If any elements of the General Plan are amended during the Housing
Element Update cycle (2013-2020), the City will ensure that the Housing Element will be
reviewed and modified, if necessary, to ensure continued internal consistency among elements.
F.      Data Sources and Methodology
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information were used. Wherever
possible, information from the U.S. Census 2010 data provided the baseline for all demographic
information. Additional sources included population and housing data from the California
Department of Finance, SANDAG, housing market data from Dataquick, employment data from
the Employment Development Department, lending data from financial institutions provided
under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), San Diego County Regional Taskforce on
the Homeless (RTFH) and the most recent data available from social service and other nonprofit
and governmental agencies.
Since the 2000 Census, the Bureau of the Census has completely restructured the way it
enumerates the U.S. population. Specifically, the 2010 Census no longer contains the long
form that provided detailed information on socioeconomic and housing characteristics. To
replace the “long form” that occurs only once every decade, the Census Bureau conducted the
American Community Survey for the 2010 Census that took a snapshot of the communities
based on a small sample but relatively frequently. Survey results were then averaged to
provide a description of the community over time.

City of Poway
1 - Introduction
G.      Summary of Findings and Policies
To address community conditions and housing needs identified within this Housing Element
Update, the City has adopted actions to facilitate the development of housing. The actions seek
to accommodate the City’s regional housing needs allocation, assist in the production and
rehabilitation of a wide range of housing and shelter, and establish supportive services for all
income levels and special interest groups. Programs included within the Housing Element
Update include some of the following provisions to achieve the intended goals of the planning
effort:
       Amend the City’s Zoning Ordinance to further facilitate the development of affordable
        housing;
       Amend the City’s Zoning Ordinance to update the density bonus program commensurate
        with state law requirements;
       Provide adequate sites for housing through consolidation of properties and rezoning;
       Pursue state and federal funding opportunities;
       Continue and strengthen collaborative relationships with other public agencies and
        nonprofit organizations that can assist the City in implementing its housing strategy;
       Continue to reduce regulatory barriers to the location and development of housing for
        persons with disabilities;
       Adopt a strategy to increase the availability of housing, meeting the needs of, and
        affordable to, local workers;
       Preserve affordable housing resources in Poway, including older rental housing and
        existing subsidized housing; and
       Promote equal housing opportunity through collaborative efforts with community
        organizations.
H.      Public Participation
As part of the Housing Element Update process, the City utilized several public outreach
methods to engage community involvement including workshops, a Housing Element Update
webpage, public review of the draft document, and public hearings prior to adoption. Local and
regional organizations serving low-income and special needs housing groups and housing
advocates were invited to attend public workshops on the Housing Element Update. The City
has provided information on its website to inform the general public of the importance of
affordable housing to the community.
City Staff held a workshop with the City’s former Redevelopment and Housing Advisory
Committee (RDHAC) on August 8, 2012, and presented a comprehensive overview of the
Housing Element Update process. Staff also held a meeting on September 12, 2012, with
owners of the private properties identified in the Residential Sites Inventory. A broader
Community Workshop was held on September 25, 2012 and provided an overview of the
purpose and contents of the Housing Element, state requirements, the update process, and key
issues for the Housing Element Update, which included the Residential Sites Inventory.
Twenty-six people attended the workshop. During the discussion, several comments were
made related to impacts from traffic, affordable housing density, future funding for new housing,
region-wide “Best Practices” to encourage affordable housing, mixed use regulations and
locating housing near community services.

City of Poway
1 - Introduction
A follow up meeting with the RDHAC was held on October 8, 2012, and provided the committee
with the comments and feedback from the Community Workshop. Staff also described the
questions and comments received from private property owners at the meeting held on
September 12, 2012. RDHAC members discussed some of the proposed locations for potential
affordable housing sites to be included in the Housing Element, as well as constraints to future
funding sources. The City Council also conducted a public workshop on November 13, 2012, to
discuss the purpose and contents of the Housing Element Update, new state requirements, the
update process, and the new Residential Sites Inventory.
For the last several years, the City of Poway has utilized Poway Housing Solutions, a
partnership effort with nonprofit housing organizations that joined together and have been
dedicated to education and outreach related to affordable housing in Poway. The nonprofit
organizations that have joined the City in this effort are Wakeland Housing, Community
Housing Works and San Diego Interfaith Housing Foundation. As of 2012, the group continues
to conduct studies and outreach efforts to educate local residents about the economic, social
and public safety benefits associated with affordable housing.
A summary of comments provided by the community and other interested parties during the
public outreach portion of this process includes:
        1. The potential impact of increased densities on schools, parks, and other public
             services.
        2. The impact of the elimination of redevelopment funding sources from the State.
        3. The impacts of traffic congestion and parking near affordable housing sites.
        4. Utilizing region-wide “best practices” to encourage affordable housing.
        5. Avoiding the concentration of affordable housing sites in south Poway.
        6. Mixed-use development regulations.
        7. Goal to locate housing near community and public services.
Due to the economic constraints that qualify a family for affordable housing, the City has
traditionally located its affordable housing sites in proximity to community services that include
food stores, public transportation, and general retail shopping. In this way, people may choose
to walk or take public transit to the surrounding stores and facilities. The commercial center of
Poway includes a vast combination of general retail, service business, specialty shops, and
restaurants, as well as the public library and other government offices. The proximity and
number of businesses also serves as a good source for local jobs. The local 30-acre Poway
Community Park contains many recreation opportunities for residents of all ages. By City park
standards, the Poway Community Park is classified in the Public Facilities Element of the
General Plan as a community park and has a service radius of two miles. This radius extends
from Oak Knoll Road to Garden Road, north to Twin Peaks Road and South to the Poway
Business Park and includes a majority of Poway’s existing affordable housing projects.
With regard to potential impacts on schools, the City of Poway and the Poway Unified School
District (PUSD) continue to coordinate on-going development activities within the City. Staff
from the City and PUSD worked collaboratively to evaluate potential housing sites and the
impacts on surrounding schools. Valley Elementary School is centrally located within the
Poway Road/Town Center commercial corridor area. While the addition of the children from the
affordable housing complexes has increased attendance, the PUSD maintains the position that
the school is not compromised by the potential for additional students. To reduce potential

future impacts, the City is proposing to locate additional affordable housing sites outside the
enrollment boundaries of Valley Elementary. Proposed locations in Table 4-4 of Chapter 4 are
in Old Poway, along Twin Peaks Road, and on Monte Vista Road, next to Pomerado Hospital.
With regard to reduced parking standards for affordable housing projects, Section 17.08.200 of
the Poway Municipal Code provides for regulatory concessions, including reduced parking
ratios, for affordable housing projects. State law also limits the City’s ability to require parking
for affordable projects. The City has surveyed its existing affordable housing projects and found
that the proportion of single adult households is higher than that in a similar market rate housing
project, contributing to a lower parking demand. Recognizing this, the City has historically
reduced the parking requirements for its affordable housing projects by 20 to 30 percent. The
City has evaluated this reduction and found that these projects function without parking
problems.
On February 5, 2013, the Poway City Council reviewed the Draft Housing Element Update at a
noticed public meeting and authorized the document to be submitted to the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for its 60-day review period. The
City submitted the document to HCD on February 7, 2013. Comments from HCD were received
in March 2013 after which several conference calls were held between HCD and City staff. A
revised Draft Housing Element Update document was submitted to HCD in April 2013 that
addressed their comments to ensure compliance with State Housing Law. Some of these
revisions included additional programs being added to comply with newer State mandates. On
April 5, 2013, the City was advised by HCD that it may proceed with the Housing Element
Update adoption process. The City of Poway, as the lead agency, prepared a Negative
Declaration (ND) in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
proceeded with the required 30-day public review and comment period.
On May 21, 2013, the Poway City Council conducted a public hearing and adopted a Negative
Declaration and approved General Plan Amendment (GPA) 13-002, adopting the City of Poway
Housing Element Update (2013-2020) and GPA 13-003, related text amendment to the
Community Development (Land Use) Element, pursuant to Resolution No. 13-12 and authorized
submittal of the Housing Element Update document to HCD for certification.

Chapter 2
Community Profile
The availability of decent and affordable housing for residents in the City of Poway is an
important housing goal, consistent with State law. This section of the Housing Element
discusses the major components of housing need in Poway. A comprehensive assessment of
housing needs provides the basis for developing responsive policies and programs to
accomplish this goal. This Chapter presents and analyzes Poway’s community profile, which
consists of its demographic, economic, and housing characteristics and their impact on housing
needs. The major components of this assessment are the City’s population, household, land
use, economic, and housing stock characteristics. Each of these components is presented in a
regional context, and, where relevant, in the context of the North County Inland cities. This
needs assessment also serves as the basis for identifying the appropriate goals, policies, and
programs for the City to implement during the 2013-2020 Housing Element cycle. The Housing
Plan of Chapter 6 provides a strategy and implementation to address identified housing needs.
Leading up to the development of the 2010 census, the United States Census Bureau modified
its policies and elected to introduce a more efficient process. These changes resulted in the
development of the American Community Survey (ACS), which was the main instrument in
conducting the 2010 census. The ACS sent to most households requested a limited amount of
information as compared to the previous 2000 Census. As a result, some of the information
provided in this chapter was calculated differently. In addition, data that may have been
included in the previous Housing Element, was not collected for the 2010 Census. In summary,
a true comparative analysis between data from 2000 to 2010 is not achievable for some data.
Demographic information for this Housing Element Update was also collected from the San
Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). In 2011, SANDAG adopted an update to the
2050 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The update included a state-mandated Sustainable
Communities Strategy (SCS) pursuant to the requirements of Senate Bill (SB) 2. The RTP
included a Regional Growth Forecast that was developed by SANDAG and the individual cities
in the region. The 2050 Regional Growth Forecast included in the RTP is the basis for some of
the data included in this chapter.
A.       Population and Housing Characteristics
Understanding the characteristics of a population is vital in the process of planning for the
future needs of a community. Population characteristics affect the type and amount of
housing need in a community. Issues such as population growth, race/ethnicity, age, and
employment trends are factors that combine to influence the type of housing needed in a
community and a household’s ability to afford housing. The following section describes and
analyzes the various population characteristics and trends that affect housing need in Poway.

1.       Population Trends
Between 2000 and 2010, Poway’s population decreased by 233 people, or -0.5 percent (Table
2-1). This decrease followed a slower growth trend than was expected throughout the region,
due to the 2008 economic recession, although Poway was one of only a few jurisdictions that
actually experienced a decrease in population. Other cities in the region also experienced
modest changes to their population. Santee’s increase was very modest (0.8 percent), while
Escondido (7.8 percent), San Diego (6.4 percent) Vista (4.4 percent) more closely followed the
growth of the region as a whole (7.2 percent). San Marcos, on the other hand, had the largest
percentage increase (52.4 percent). In addition to Poway, a few other cities in the region
experienced a decrease in population as well.

According to SANDAG population forecasts, Poway’s population will reach approximately
54,070 by 2020, a 13.1 percent increase over the 2010 population. Poway’s forecasted growth
is larger than its neighboring jurisdictions of Escondido (7.2 percent), San Marcos (8.4 percent)
and Vista (6.6 percent). However, Poway’s forecasted growth is smaller than its neighboring
jurisdictions of San Diego (18.5 percent) and Santee (20.8 percent), and the region as a whole
(17.2 percent).1
2.       Age Characteristics
A community’s current and future housing needs are determined in part by the age
characteristics of residents. Typically, each age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and
sizes, ability to earn incomes, and therefore, housing preferences. As people move through
each stage of life, housing needs and preferences change. Traditional assumptions are that
the young adult population (20 to 34 years old) tends to favor apartments, low to moderate
cost townhomes/condominiums, and smaller single-family units. The adult population (35 to
64 years old) represents the major market for moderate to relatively high cost condominiums
and single-family homes. The senior population (65 years and older) tends to generate

demand for low to moderate cost apartments and condominiums, small single-family homes,
group housing, and mobile homes. In order to create a balanced community, it is important to
provide housing options that suit the needs of various age groups.
Between 2000 and 2010, the City of Poway experienced population changes within several age
groups. For the most part, there has been a decrease in the percentage of families, with
children under five and those aged 5 to 18 dropping (-15.7 percent and -18.5 percent,
respectively) as well as adults ages 35 to 44, which showed the largest decrease (-34.8
percent) (Table 2-2). There was significant growth among young adults ages 19 to 24 (29.7
percent). The largest increases were among people ages 55 to 64 (62.8 percent) and 65 and
older (42.7 percent).

Although the percentage of children has decreased from 2000 to 2010, while the percentage of
young adults has increased, Poway still has a larger share of people under 18 years of age
(27.6 percent) compared with the San Diego region (23.4 percent) (Table 2-3). Poway also has
a larger share of people aged 65 and older (12.3 percent) than the San Diego region (11.4
percent). The median age of Poway residents (41.3) is quite a bit higher than the San Diego
region’s median age (34.6).

3.     Race and Ethnicity
Race/ethnicity of the population is important to an analysis of housing needs and conditions for
several reasons. A community’s racial and ethnic composition may have implications for
housing needs to the extent that different groups have different household characteristics,
income levels, and cultural backgrounds that may affect their housing needs and preferences.
Poway’s population is predominately composed of non-Hispanic whites, but has become more
diverse since the 2000 Census (Table 2-5). Whites decreased from 77.2 percent of the
population in 2000 to 69.1 percent of the population in 2010. The Latino population increased
as a proportion of total population from 10.4 percent in 2000 to 15.7 percent in 2010. Similarly,
Asian or Pacific Islanders increased from 7.6 percent to 10.1 percent of the population, African
Americans decreased slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.5 percent, and people who identified
themselves as being of other races increased from 2.9 percent to 3.2 percent. Native
Americans remained steady at 0.3 percent.

4.       Household Types
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit. Given this
definition, single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood and unrelated
individuals living together all constitute a household. Persons living in retirement or
convalescent homes, dormitories or other group living situations are not considered
households.       Household type and size, income levels, the presence of special needs
populations, and other household characteristics determine the type of housing needed by
residents, their preferences, and their ability to obtain housing that meets their needs. For
example, single-person households, often seniors or young adults, tend to reside in apartment
units or smaller single-family homes. Families typically prefer and occupy single-family
homes. This section details several household characteristics affecting housing needs.

The number of Poway households increased between 2000 and 2010 by 4.3 percent (Table 2-
7). Families, which are defined by the Census as two or more persons sharing a dwelling unit
who are related in some way, comprised an overwhelming majority of Poway households in
2010 (80.2 percent). While the number of total households increased by 661, the percentage of
family households decreased since 2000 (3.0 percentage points). This decrease occurred
amongst both married couple families without children (3.6 percentage points) and married
couple families with children (6.8 percentage points). Also, the proportion of female households
without a spouse decreased (0.1 percentage points), as did the proportion of single female
householders with children (0.6 percentage points). The proportion of non-family households
increased (3.0 percentage points).

While the household population has decreased by 0.7 percent from 2000 to 2010, it still makes
up the vast majority in Poway with 98.8 percent (Table 2-8). The group quarter population has
risen 29.1 percent due to the dramatic increase (294.4 percent) in the non-institutionalized
population.

5.     Household Incomes
Household income is one indicator of the wealth of a community and therefore is directly
connected to the ability to afford housing. As household income increases, the more likely that
household is to be a homeowner. As household income decreases, households tend to pay a
disproportionate amount of their income for housing and the number of persons
occupying unsound and overcrowded housing increases.
For planning and funding purposes, the California State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) has developed the following income categories based on the Area Median
Income (AMI) of a metropolitan area (such as San Diego County):
      Extremely Low Income: households earning up to 30 percent of the AMI
      Very Low Income: households earning between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI
      Low Income: households earning between 51 percent and 80 percent of the AMI
      Moderate Income: households earning between 81 percent and 120 percent of the AMI
      Above Moderate Income: households earning over 120 percent of the AMI
Between 2000 and 2008, approximately 58 percent of Poway households earned moderate or
above moderate incomes (Table 2-9), while 30 percent of households had incomes in the
extremely low, very low, and low income levels. It should be noted that many households may
be considered lower income even if they are rich in assets. In other words, a household could
have a fairly low level of annual earnings, but still be wealthy in other assets.

The vast majority (70.2 percent) of households in Poway are in the above moderate income
level, with owners making up 59.9 percent and renters 10.3 percent (Table 2-10). The higher
median income in Poway is due to: 1) a relatively higher proportion of white-collar professionals
who reside in the community when compared to the region as a whole and 2) home prices in
Poway are, on average, higher than in neighboring communities and require higher incomes to
afford. Owner-occupied households in the above moderate income category make up 59.9
percent of all owner-occupied households in Poway, with households in the extremely low, very
low, low and moderate owner-occupied households having shares of 8.0 percent or less. The
largest proportion of renter households in Poway have above moderate incomes with 42.6
percent, with the other income categories making up between 12.1 percent and 16.8 percent.

Notes: HAMFI is defined as HUD's Area Median Family Income (HAMFI) and is calculated based on the median income
for a metropolitan area, assuming that the income is for 4-person household. HAMFI is the median family income
calculated by HUD for each jurisdiction, in order to determine Fair Market Rents (FMRs) and income limits for HUD
programs. HAMFI will not necessarily be the same as other calculations of median incomes (such as HCD’s State
Income Limits), due to a series of adjustments that are made. State HCD revises its income limits compared to the
HAMFI to reflect certain adjustments per State law and to update HCD’s income limit levels established for California’s
moderate and above moderate income households. HAMFI is adjusted for family size. Income Categories Include:
Extremely Low Income (less than or equal to 30% of HAMFI), Very Low Income (greater than 30% but less than or
equal to 50%); Low Income (greater than 50% but less than or equal to 80% of the HAMFI); Moderate Income (greater
than 80% but less than or equal to 100% of the HAMFI); Above Moderate Income (greater than 100% of HAMFI).
 The percentage of extremely low, very low and low income households in Poway is 22.2 percent
 (Table 2-11). This figure is much smaller than the region as whole (39.4 percent).

6.     Poverty Rate
Poverty is measured by the federal government according to a minimum level of income
necessary to sustain a subsistence lifestyle. According to the 2006-2010 American Community
Survey, 4.3 percent of the population of Poway lived in poverty compared to 4.6 percent in 2000
(Table 2-12).

Approximately 1.5 percent of Poway’s population is under the age of 18 and living below the
poverty level. Poway’s poverty rate was also significantly lower than the countywide rate of 12.3
percent (Table 2-13).

B.      Housing Characteristics
1.      Housing Type
Total housing saw a modest increase overall from 2000 to 2010 in Poway (Table 2-14). Single-
family units increased by 409 units. Multi-family units saw a modest increase of 103 units
during that time. Overall, the total increase in housing units was 762 between 2000 and 2010.

                      reported in ACS 2006-2010.
2.      Housing Population and Tenure
Poway’s rate of homeownership experienced a very slight decrease from 2000 to 2010 (Table
2-15). As the number of dwelling units increased between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of
owners decreased and renters increased.                      Homeowners represented 77.7 percent of
households in Poway in 2000 and 74.4 percent in 2010, while renters increased from 22.2
percent in 2000 to 25.6 percent in 2010.
Total household population saw a modest decrease from 2000 to 2010 in Poway of less than
one percent (Table 2-15). Owner-occupied units decreased by six percent while renter-
occupied units increased by almost three percent. Structure type is no longer reported as part
of the Census. Population in renter-occupied units by structure type is estimated from the 2006-
2010 American Community Survey as a proportion of total households indicated in Households
by Tenure in Table 2-15. Household population differs from Total Population (included in Table

and that may be living in temporary quarters such as facility care homes, or considered
transients. As a result of the change in source, 2000 and 2010 renter by structure type data are
not comparable

percent in 2000 and 1.2 percent in 2010). This trend suggests an increase in the availability of
vacant housing on the market for those seeking to purchase or rent a dwelling. The number of
properties that were rented or sold, but not occupied, and seasonal, recreational, or occasional
use properties increased from 0.2 percent in 2000 to 0.7 percent in 2010.

  Notes: The effective vacancy rate is calculated by dividing the combined number of dwelling units for rent and
  sale by the total number of dwelling units.
From 2000 to 2010, Single family housing vacancy rates ticked up from 1.4 percent to 3.0
percent, Multifamily housing from 2.6 percent to 6.9 percent, and Mobile home and other
housing from 1.6 percent to 8.1 percent (Table 2-18). One measure of the balance between the
supply and demand for housing is the effective vacancy rate, which indicates the actual
percentage of year-round housing units available for sale or rent at a given time, excluding
seasonal housing, second homes, and other unoccupied units that are not on the market for
sale or rent. The effective vacancy rate in Poway was very low in 2000, at 0.8 percent, but it
increased in 2010, to 2.1 percent, due to the increase in the number of dwelling units for rent or
for sale.

4.      Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems (cost burden and
overcrowding) in a community. If housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household
income, there will be a correspondingly higher prevalence of housing cost burden and
overcrowding. This section summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock to Poway
residents.
The data contained in Tables 2-19 and 2-20 include housing values and home sales values.
Housing values represent a point-in-time value of the property and based on data collected by
the County Tax Assessor office for individual properties. Home sales values are based on sales
price transactions. The values in these tables are also expressed in either median (described
as the numeric value separating the higher half of a sample, from the lower half) or average
(described as the mean of a set of numbers, or distribution) number values. Table 2-19
includes median housing value and Table 2-20 includes average homes sales value.
Homeownership Market
Poway’s home values fell mostly within the $200,000 to $299,999 category in 2000 with 32.5
percent of the housing stock total (Table 2-19). However, by 2010, only 2.7 percent of homes in
Poway were within that value range. By 2010, the largest housing value category was $500,000

High home prices in Poway can be explained by the community’s many desirable characteristics
as well as the City’s prevalence of lower density/larger lot zoning and construction of custom
homes. The regional building costs per square foot for a low-rise building are $140, $170 for a
mid-rise building and $200 for a high-rise building (Table 2-21).

 Rental Market
 From 2000 to 2010, there was a 36.8 percent increase in the number of renter-occupied units,
 from 3,446 to 4,714 (Table 2-22). In 2000, 58.0 percent of rents were between $500-$999
 (unadjusted for inflation), and in 2010, 61.2 percent of rents were above $1,500. The median
 rent, adjusted for inflation, rose 12.1 percent in Poway from 2000 to 2010. However, more
 recently, mean market rents fell from 2009 to 2010: -1.9 percent in One bedroom units and -5.2

 Online data resources were also used to understand the current rental housing market in Poway
 (Table 2-24). Websites were searched in December 2012 and rental price information was
 collected for seven apartment complexes within the City. One bedroom units rented for $985 to
 $1,141 per month. Two and three bedroom apartment units are generally more expensive and
 rented at a range from $1,150 to $1,502 per month for a two-bedroom units and from $1,525 to
 $1,724 for a three bedroom unit.

Housing Affordability by Household Income
The affordability of housing is usually expressed as a percentage of one’s gross
income. Most government agencies define affordability to mean that a household
spends no more than 30 percent of its gross income from all household members on
housing costs. Housing costs typically include monthly rent or mortgage payment,
monthly utilities, and (for homeowners) insurance, property taxes, and association fees
(if any). Although this 30 percent rule-of-thumb is the most widely used measure of

 affordability, loan underwriters, rental property owners, and others may use additional
 factors in evaluating a household’s ability to afford housing. These factors may include
 the ratio of long-term debt to income, unreimbursed medical expenses (particularly
 recurring expenses), and other financial obligations that impact a household’s ability to
 devote a defined share of its income to housing costs. Taken together, this information
 can generally show who can afford what size and type of housing and indicate the type
 of households most likely to experience overcrowding and overpayment. A summary of
 Household income for 2006-2008 is provided below (Table 2-25). It shows the tenure
 of the household (Owner/Renter) and the income level.

Notes: HAMFI is defined as HUD's Area Median Family Income (HAMFI) and is calculated based on the median income
for a metropolitan area, assuming that the income is for 4-person household. HAMFI is the median family income
calculated by HUD for each jurisdiction, in order to determine Fair Market Rents (FMRs) and income limits for HUD
programs. HAMFI will not necessarily be the same as other calculations of median incomes (such as HCD’s State
Income Limits), due to a series of adjustments that are made. State HCD revises its income limits compared to the
HAMFI to reflect certain adjustments per State law and to update HCD’s income limit levels established for California’s
moderate and above moderate income households. HAMFI is adjusted for family size. Income Categories Include:
Extremely Low Income (less than or equal to 30% of HAMFI), Very Low Income (greater than 30% but less than or
equal to 50%); Low Income (greater than 50% but less than or equal to 80% of the HAMFI); Moderate Income (greater
than 80% but less than or equal to 100% of the HAMFI); Above Moderate Income (greater than 100% of HAMFI).
 The percentage of extremely low, very low and low income households in Poway is 22.2 percent
 (Table 2-26). This figure is much smaller than the region as whole (39.4 percent).

The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual
household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal housing
assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) developed income limits that can be used to determine the maximum price
that could be affordable to households in the upper ranges of their respective income
categories. Households in the lower end of each category can afford less by comparison than
those at the upper end.
The market-affordability of the City’s housing stock for each income group is discussed below:
Very-Low Income Households: HCD estimated the 2012 San Diego Area Median Income
(AMI) to be $75,900 for a family of four. Very-low income households are classified as those
earning 50 percent or less of the AMI.
Low Income Households: Low income households earn 51 to 80 percent of the County AMI.
Moderate Income Households: Moderate income households earn up to 120 percent of the
County AMI.
Above-Moderate Income Households: Based on the range of prices and median sales prices
for single-family homes and condominiums in Poway, even many above-moderate income
households face limited choices in purchasing a home in the City. Depending on household
size and the number of bedrooms required, above- moderate income households earning as
much as twice the median household income may face difficulties in finding adequately size
homes to purchase that are affordable.

5.      Overpayment
A household is considered to overpay for housing if it spends more than 30 percent of its gross
income on housing. Problems of housing cost burden occur when housing costs rise faster than
incomes and/or when households are forced to pay more than they can afford for housing of
adequate size, condition, and amenities to meet their needs. The prevalence of overpayment
often varies by income, tenure, household type, and household size.
The percentage of Poway households which overpaid for housing was at 36.7 percent by 2008
(Table 2-27). Overpayment affected 10.4 percent of renter households and 26.3 percent of
owner households. Overpayment was much more prevalent among households in the above
moderate income category, making up 18.3 percent of total households, 17.0 percent of which
were owner households. The rest of the income categories of owner households had
overpayment rates between 1.8 and 3.4 percent. Extremely low income renter households had
the highest overpayment rate of 3.0 percent compared to other renter households, and these
rates steadily decreased with an increase in income category to 1.4 percent (the above
moderate income category percentage).

6.      Overcrowding
Overcrowding, usually defined as more than one person per room, exists in only 1.9 percent of
all households in Poway (Table 2-28). Renter households made up a larger share of
overcrowded housing in Poway with 1.5 percent of all households being overcrowded,
compared to owner households of 0.4 percent.

In terms of tenure, overcrowding is more prevalent in the higher income categories, with
moderate and above moderate income levels making up 71.0 percent of overcrowded
households in Poway. The number of households increased from 2000 to 2010, but the number
(as well as the percentage) decreased for all categories of overcrowding over that time span
(Table 2-29).

         Notes: Overcrowding is defined as a unit being occupied by 1.01 persons or more per room.
In 2000, 4.9 percent of Poway’s households had more than 1 person per room, but in 2010 that
number fell to 2.0 percent. Poway’s 90 overcrowded households with extremely low, very low
and low income make up 0.6 percent of its housing stock, as compared to the San Diego
region’s 4.0 percent of housing being overcrowded within the same income categories (Table 2-

30). Overcrowding is significantly higher among renters because they tend to have lower
incomes than homeowners, and because renters often cannot secure housing of adequate size.

7.       Age and Condition of Housing
Homes that are 30 years old or older are generally at the greatest risk of being substandard
and/or subject to deterioration associated with improper maintenance and repair. Homes with
the greatest need for rehabilitation or replacement are likely to be: 1) older mobile homes, 2)
multifamily rental housing constructed prior to 1970, and 3) single-family homes constructed
prior to 1960 and occupied by lower-income households. Homes in potential need of
replacement are most likely to be mobile homes built before 1960 and other housing
constructed prior to 1940. In 2010, 58.7 percent of the housing stock in Poway was over 30
years old, with 20.1 percent over 40 years of age (Table 2-31).

The City has not conducted a housing condition survey to estimate the number of housing units
needing rehabilitation or replacement. Because nearly 80 percent of the City’s housing was
built since 1970, Poway is not likely to have a significant housing rehabilitation or replacement
need in the immediate future. The need for rehabilitation or replacement of older residences at
the end of the current planning period will become greater. Dwelling units that have building
materials such asbestos and lead-based paints as well as failing plumbing fixtures are the most
likely to require rehabilitation or replacement in the coming years. The City has evaluated
selected characteristics related to existing housing conditions collected from the 2006-2010
American Community Survey including occupied housing units without complete plumbing
facilities, kitchen facilities or telephone service. Additional data was reviewed from the City

building permit records over the last five years pertaining to additions, remodels or replacement
of kitchen, bathroom or other plumbing facilities within a dwelling unit. The City analyzed this
data and estimates that approximately one and one-half percent of existing dwelling units
currently need rehabilitation or replacement.
C.      Employment Trends
Employment has an important impact on housing needs. Incomes associated with different jobs
and the number of workers in a household determine the type and size of housing a household
can afford. In some cases, the types of employment themselves can affect housing needs and
demand (such as in communities with military installations, college campuses, and large
amounts of seasonal agriculture). Employment growth typically leads to strong housing
demand, while employment contractions lead to a decline in housing demand.
The three largest occupational categories employing Poway’s Labor Force are Manufacturing
(12.1 percent), Professional, Scientific, Management and Administration (15.2 percent) and
Educational, Social and Health Services (17.3 percent) (Table 2-32). The industries with the
largest gains in residents in Poway were Wholesale trade (42.3 percent), Construction (27.0
percent), and Professional, Scientific, Management and Administration (23.1 percent). The
industries with the largest losses of Poway residents were Agriculture, Forestry and Mining (-
457.1 percent), Armed Forces (-84.3 percent), and Information and Communications (-62.5
percent).

in 2020, while the San Diego Region’s jobs/housing ratio will also drop to 1.20, showing that
housing unit production will grow faster than jobs in the next decade. All of Poway’s 31,176 jobs
in 2008 were civilian, non-military jobs (Table 2-35).

The occupations of Poway residents are not necessarily an accurate indicator of the City’s local
economy, the types of employers and jobs they offer, and the pay levels of these jobs. Because
Poway seeks to provide housing opportunities for individuals who work in the City, it is important
to understand who these workers might be and their income levels. According to the City of
Poway, the Poway Business Park, a 700-acre complex, is the largest employment center in the
City with over 500 businesses and more than 17,000 employees. Larger employers in the City
include General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc., First American Credco, Geico, Teledyne,
Delkin Devices, and SYSCO Food Services.

D.         Housing Needs
1.       Regional Housing Needs Allocation
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) has determined that
the San Diego County regional fair-share of the statewide forecasted growth for the 2013-2020
housing element cycle is 161,980 units. As described in the Executive Summary, a jurisdiction’s
share of affordable housing for the new RHNA 2010-2020 cycle is allocated by the San Diego
Association of Governments (SANDAG) based on the maximum number of affordable
units/opportunities a jurisdiction can provide given the financial resources and regulatory
measures available during the housing element cycle. Poway was assigned a future housing
need of 1,253 units for the 2013-2020 housing element cycle, representing 0.8 percent of the
total regional housing need. Of the 1,253 units allocated to the City, Poway must plan for units
affordable to all income levels (Table 2-36).

2.       Special Needs Groups
Some segments of the population may have more difficulty than others in finding decent,
affordable housing due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one’s
employment and income, family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics, among
other factors. Consequently, certain residents in Poway may experience a higher prevalence of
housing overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems. “Special needs” groups
include the following: senior-headed households, single-parent households, large households,

Senior Headed Households
Senior-headed households often have special needs due to their relatively low incomes,
disabilities or limitations, and dependency needs. The population over 65 years of age is
considered senior and has four main concerns:
         (1) Income: People over 65 are usually retired and living on a fixed income; and
         (2) Health Care: Because the elderly have a higher rate of illness, health care is
             important; and
         (3) Transportation: Many seniors use public transit; and
         (4) Housing: Many live alone and rent.
Elderly family households make up 12.1 percent of the population. Approximately 3.5 percent of
the population is elderly family householders who have incomes in the extremely low, very low,
and low categories (Table 2-38). Elderly non-family households make up 9.7 percent of the
population, with 6.7 percent of the population being elderly non-family householders with
extremely low, very low, and low income levels.

Notes: HAMFI is defined as HUD's Area Median Family Income (HAMFI) and is calculated based on the median income for a
metropolitan area, assuming that the income is for 4-person household. HAMFI is the median family income calculated by
HUD for each jurisdiction, in order to determine Fair Market Rents (FMRs) and income limits for HUD programs. HAMFI will not
necessarily be the same as other calculations of median incomes (such as HCD’s State Income Limits), due to a series of
adjustments that are made. State HCD revises its income limits compared to the HAMFI to reflect certain adjustments per
State law and to update HCD’s income limit levels established for California’s moderate and above moderate income
households. HAMFI is adjusted for family size. Income Categories Include: Extremely Low Income (less than or equal to 30%
of HAMFI), Very Low Income (greater than 30% but less than or equal to 50%); Low Income (greater than 50% but less than or
equal to 80% of the HAMFI); Moderate Income (greater than 80% but less than or equal to 100% of the HAMFI); Above
Moderate Income (greater than 100% of HAMFI).
    Single-Parent Households
    Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of their greater
    need for day care, health care, and other facilities. Female-headed households with children in
    particular tend to have lower incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this group.
    Approximately 10.8 percent of Poway’s family households were headed by single parents in
    2010, the large majority of which were headed by females (69.5 percent) (Table 2-39).
    However, single fathers increased by 6.5 percent from 2000 to 2010, while single mothers
    decreased 15.2 percent.

Large Households
Large households (with five or more members) are identified as a group with special housing
needs based on the limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing units. Large
households are often of lower income, frequently resulting in the overcrowding of smaller
dwelling units and, in turn, accelerating unit deterioration. Most Owner households had sizes of
2 persons, with 27.8 percent. Approximately 6.6 percent of renter households had sizes of just
one person, the most of all renter households (Table 2-40). With owner and renter numbers
combined, a two person household was the most common with 32.3 percent.

Because over 81 percent of the City’s housing stock has three or more bedrooms, and because
only 11.4 percent of Poway households are large households, Poway’s housing stock is roughly
adequate to meet the needs of larger households (Table 2-42). However, lower income large
renter-households may have greater difficulty securing adequately sized units than other large
renter-households.

Owners of small family households make up 44.1 percent of total households in the City of
Poway, and 40.4 percent of total households are owner-occupied small family households that
have income levels of moderate and above (Table 2-43). Small family households occupied by
renters make up 10.6 percent of all households. Owner occupied large family households make
up 8.2 percent of total households, and renter occupied large family households make up only
3.5 percent of all households.
Nearly 12 percent of Poway households were classified as “large households” from 2006-2008.
A large majority (79.5 percent) of these households owned the units they occupied. The
housing needs of large households are typically met through larger units. While over 78 percent
of occupied housing units in the City had more than three bedrooms (adequate size for larger
households), only a small portion of these units (3.5 percent) were occupied by renters.
Because over 78 percent of the City’s housing stock has three or more bedrooms, and because
only 16 percent of Poway households are large households, Poway’s housing stock is roughly
adequate to meet the needs of larger households. However, lower income large renter-
households may have greater difficulty securing adequately sized units than other large renter-
households.

             Notes: HAMFI is defined as HUD's Area Median Family Income (HAMFI) and is
             calculated based on the median income for a metropolitan area, assuming that the
             income is for 4-person household. HAMFI is the median family income calculated
             by HUD for each jurisdiction, in order to determine Fair Market Rents (FMRs) and
             income limits for HUD programs. HAMFI will not necessarily be the same as other
             calculations of median incomes (such as HCD’s State Income Limits), due to a
             series of adjustments that are made. State HCD revises its income limits compared
             to the HAMFI to reflect certain adjustments per State law and to update HCD’s
             income limit levels established for California’s moderate and above moderate
             income households. HAMFI is adjusted for family size. Income Categories Include:
             Extremely Low Income (less than or equal to 30% of HAMFI), Very Low Income
             (greater than 30% but less than or equal to 50%); Low Income (greater than 50%
             but less than or equal to 80% of the HAMFI); Moderate Income (greater than 80%
             but less than or equal to 100% of the HAMFI); Above Moderate Income (greater
             than 100% of HAMFI).

Owner occupied households make up 76.0 percent of the household stock, and renter occupied
households the other 24.0 percent. The most common household size by owners is 4
bedrooms, making up 35.9 percent of the household stock. Renter occupied households are
typically smaller, with 2 bedrooms making up the largest share with 7.4 percent of the
household stock (Table 2-44).

Persons with Disabilities (including Developmental Disabilities)
Disability is a physical or mental condition that substantially limits one or more major life activity.
Physical disabilities can hinder access to housing units of conventional design, as well as limit
the ability to earn adequate income.
No updated data on disabilities is available from the 2010 Census or 2006-2010 ACS for
Poway. The 2005-2007 ACS defines six types of disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-
care, go-outside-home, and employment. The Census defines sensory and physical disabilities
as “long-lasting conditions.” Mental, self-care, go-outside-home, and employment disabilities
are defined as conditions lasting six months or more that make it difficult to perform certain
activities. A more detailed description of each disability is provided below:
        Sensory disability: Refers to blindness, deafness, or severe vision or hearing
         impairment.
        Physical disability: Refers to a condition that substantially limits one or more basic
         physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
        Mental disability: Refers to a mental condition lasting more than six months that
         impairs learning, remembering, or concentrating.
        Self-care disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to dress, bathe, or get
         around inside the home.
        Go-outside-home: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to go outside the home
         alone to shop or visit a doctor’s office.
        Employment disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to work at a job or
         business.
The Census estimates that 12 percent of Poway residents over 5 years of age had a disability in
2000. The Census tallied the number of disabilities by type for residents with one or more
disabilities; a person may have more than one disability. Among the disabilities tallied, 10.2
percent were sensory disabilities, 22.0 percent were physical disabilities, 15.8 percent were
mental disabilities, 7.4 percent were self-care disabilities, 18.0 percent were disabilities that

Of the 47,669 people in Poway where disability status can be determined, 5.4 percent have a
disability, and 71 percent of those are 16 and older. (Table 2-46). Of all Poway residents over
the age of 16 that have a disability, 59 percent are employed, 2 percent are unemployed, and
39 percent are not in the labor force.
Senate Bill 812 requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of persons with
disabilities, including developmental disabilities. Many developmentally disabled persons can
live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. While there is no
reported data available from the 2010 Census, the City contacted the San Diego Regional
Center (SDRC) and requested current available information. The SDRC reported that in 2012,
a total of 235 disabled residents living in Poway were serviced.

Persons with Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability”
means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
      Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
       impairments;
May 2013                                                              Housing Element Update | Page 2-37

                                                                          Community Profile
        Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
        Is likely to continue indefinitely;
        Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of
         major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d)
         mobility; e) self- direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-
         sufficiency; and
        Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
         interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
         assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and
         coordinated.
The Census does not collect or report statistics for developmental disabilities and no other
source is known to have this data for Poway. Many developmentally disabled persons can live
and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled
individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely
affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and
physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the
first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the
person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult. Four
factors – affordability, design, location and discrimination – significantly limit the supply of
housing available to households of persons with disabilities. The most obvious housing need
for persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes
are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be adaptable
to widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and
other features necessary for accessibility. The cost of retrofitting a home often prohibits
homeownership, even for individuals or families who could otherwise afford a home. Few
lenders and/or programs will combine mortgage financing with affordable financing for
accessibility improvements. Furthermore, some providers of basic home buying services do not
have offices or materials that are accessible to people with mobility, visual, or hearing
impairments.
Location of housing is also an important factor for many persons with disabilities, as they often
rely upon public transportation. Furthermore, the 2010 San Diego Regional Analysis of
Impediments to Fair Housing Choice prepared by the San Diego Fair Housing Resources Board
concluded: “Discrimination against people with disabilities has become an increasing fair
housing concern…”
Services are typically provided by both public and private agencies. State and federal
legislation mandate that a specified proportion of units in new or rehabilitated multifamily
apartment complexes be accessible to individuals with limited physical mobility.
Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the fields,
processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When workload

                                                                                  City of Poway
                                                                           Community Profile
increases during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor, often
supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant workers, defined as
those whose travel distance to work prevents them from returning to their primary residence
every evening.
Determining the true size of the agricultural labor force is problematic. For instance, the
government agencies that track farm labor do not consistently define farm-workers (e.g. field
laborers versus workers in processing plants), length of employment (e.g. permanent or
seasonal), or place of work (e.g. the location of the business or field). There are no agricultural
businesses in Poway. According to the 2006-2010 American Community Survey, only 14
residents of Poway were employed in farming, forestry, or fishing occupations.
Pursuant to the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the Health and
Safety Code), employee housing for agricultural workers consisting of no more than 36 beds in
a group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a single-family or household is
permitted by right in an agricultural land use designation. Any employee housing providing
accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be deemed a single-family structure within a
residential land use designation, according to the Employee Housing Act. Employee housing
for six or fewer persons is permitted wherever a single-family residence is permitted. To comply
with State law no conditional use permit, variance, or other permit can be required for employee
housing that is not required for a single-family residence in the same zone.
The City has no agricultural zones. The City’s Zoning Ordinance permits agricultural uses in all
residential zoning districts. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to add a definition for
agricultural housing as well as clarify the provision for agricultural worker housing in the City’s
residential zones pursuant to State law.
Students
Poway is located in a region with numerous community colleges and universities. Closest to
Poway are Miramar Community College (eight miles), California State University at San Marcos
(19 miles), Palomar Community College (20 miles), San Diego State University (20 miles), and
Grossmont Community College (22 miles),
Nearly eight percent of Poway residents were enrolled in college in 2000, which is slightly lower
than the proportion of college students countywide (nine percent). San Diego State University is
the largest university in the San Diego region, with approximately 30,000 students. The
university provides housing for an estimated 10 percent of enrolled students. Typically,
students have low incomes and therefore can be impacted by a lack of affordable housing,
which can often lead to overcrowding within this special needs group.
Many State and federal programs are not available to students. However, City housing
programs designed to expand affordable rental housing opportunities in the City will help
expand housing options for students.

With the long-lasting recession, homelessness is a persistent issue in the San Diego
region. However, budget cuts at the federal, State, and local levels have impaired the ability of
local governments in addressing the homeless needs.
Section 65583(a)(7) of the Government Code mandates that municipalities address the special
needs of homeless persons within their jurisdictional boundaries. “Homelessness” as defined
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), describes an individual (not
imprisoned or otherwise detained) who:
        Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and
        Has a primary nighttime residence that is:
             o A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary
                living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and
                transitional housing for the mentally ill);
             o An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended
                to be institutionalized; or
             o A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
                sleeping accommodation for human beings.
This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing, unless it has been
officially condemned; persons living in overcrowded housing (for example, doubled up with
others); persons being discharged from mental health facilities (unless the person was
homeless when entering and is considered to be homeless at discharge); or persons who may
be at risk of homelessness (for example, living temporarily with family or friends).
Assessing a region’s homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature of the
population. The Regional Task Force on the Homeless (RTFH) is San Diego County’s leading
resource for information on issues of homelessness. RTFH is a public/private effort to build a
base of understanding about the multiple causes and conditions of homelessness.
Based on information provided by individual jurisdictions, the majority of the region’s homeless
is estimated to be in the urban areas, but a sizeable number of homeless persons make their
temporary residence in rural areas (Table 2-47). RTFH compiles data from a physical Point-In-
Time (PIT) count of sheltered (emergency and transitional) and street homeless persons. The
2012 RTFH Count provided a statistically adjusted homeless population of seven (7) persons in
Poway.

3.      Disproportionate Needs
The US Census Bureau developed the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS)
for HUD to provide detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of
households. These data are based on the 2006-2008 CHAS and are displayed in Table 2-48.
The CHAS details the following housing problems: 1) units with physical defects (lacking a
complete kitchen or bathroom); 2) overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one
person per room); 3) housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross
income; or 4) severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross
income.
The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure. Some highlights
include:
       Overall, 38.8 percent of all households experienced some type of defined housing
        problem.
       Roughly 92 percent of extremely-low income households and 73.4 percent of low
        income households experienced housing problems.
       About 48.4 percent of all renters and 35.8 percent of all owners experienced housing
        problems.
       The percentage of both owners and renters experiencing housing problems decreases
        with every increase in income level.

Notes: Housing problems include, but are not limited to, 1 or more of the 4 housing unit problems: units with physical
defects (lacks complete kitchen or plumbing facilities); overcrowded conditions (has more than 1 person per room);
housing cost burden (including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income); and severe housing cost burden (including
utilities exceeding 50 percent of gross income).
Notes: HAMFI is defined as HUD's Area Median Family Income (HAMFI) and is calculated based on the median income for
a metropolitan area, assuming that the income is for 4-person household. HAMFI is the median family income calculated
by HUD for each jurisdiction, in order to determine Fair Market Rents (FMRs) and income limits for HUD programs. HAMFI
will not necessarily be the same as other calculations of median incomes (such as HCD’s State Income Limits), due to a
series of adjustments that are made. State HCD revises its income limits compared to the HAMFI to reflect certain
adjustments per State law and to update HCD’s income limit levels established for California’s moderate and above
moderate income households. HAMFI is adjusted for family size. Income Categories Include: Extremely Low Income (less
than or equal to 30% of HAMFI), Very Low Income (greater than 30% but less than or equal to 50%); Low Income (greater
than 50% but less than or equal to 80% of the HAMFI); Moderate Income (greater than 80% but less than or equal to 100%
of the HAMFI); Above Moderate Income (greater than 100% of HAMFI).

E.       Affordable Housing Inventory
Market housing prices in Poway are often too high for lower income households to afford. In
many communities such as Poway, housing affordable to low and moderate income households
cannot be built without governmental assistance. Because of its significance, this section
identifies the publicly assisted rental housing in Poway, evaluates the potential for those units to
convert to market rates during the current period, and analyzes the cost to preserve those units.
In addition, this section discusses the availability of Section 8 vouchers within Poway. As of
2012, Poway had 11 assisted housing developments that provided 742 affordable housing units
(Table 2-49).

1.       At-Risk Multifamily Units
State law requires that the City identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
affordable multi-family rental units that are eligible to convert to market rate uses due to
termination of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions during the
next ten years. Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers the period from January 1, 2013

through December 31, 2022. Consistent with State law, this section identifies publicly assisted
housing units in Poway and analyzes their potential to convert to market rate housing uses.
Within the 2013-2022 “at-risk” housing analysis period, no properties are considered at risk of
converting to market-rate housing.

Chapter 3
Constraints
An important goal for the City of Poway is the provision of an adequate supply and range of
housing opportunities. Market, governmental, infrastructure, and environmental factors may
constrain the provision of adequate and affordable housing. These constraints may result in
housing that is not affordable or available to low and moderate income and special needs
households, or may render residential construction economically infeasible for developers.
Actual or potential constraints to the provision of housing affect the development of new housing
and the retention of existing units for all income levels. Both governmental and non-
governmental constraints can affect the cost, supply, and demand for housing. Governmental
constraints can include such factors as government land use controls and development
standards, while non-governmental constraints would encompass factors such as market
mechanisms, physical or environmental constraints, and the health of the economy. This
chapter addresses those constraints that are relevant to the people who live and work in Poway.
A.      Governmental Constraints
The intent of local government regulations is to protect public health and safety and ensure a
decent quality of life for the community. The City’s General Plan supports the community's
desire to retain Poway’s rural character. The City’s basic land use philosophy is that the
majority of future development in the City should be single-family residential development.
Within the framework of this broad philosophy, the City also attempts to fulfill its responsibility
under state law to accommodate its share of the countywide housing need for all income
groups.
Local policies and regulations can affect the cost and availability of housing and, in particular,
the provision of housing affordable to low and moderate income households. Land use controls,
site improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, and other
factors can constrain the development, retention, and improvement of housing. This section
discusses potential governmental constraints as well as policies that encourage housing
development in Poway.
State and federal regulations also affect the availability of land for housing and the cost of
producing housing. Regulations related to environmental protection, prevailing wages for
publicly assisted construction projects, construction defect liability, building codes, and other
topics have significant, often adverse impacts on housing cost and availability. Perhaps one of
the greatest constraints to the production of housing affordable to lower-income households is
the chronic shortage of State and federal financial assistance for such housing.
While constraints exist at other levels of government, the City has little or no control over these
regulations and no ability to directly mitigate their effects on housing. This section of the
Housing Element, therefore, focuses only on policies and regulations that can be mitigated by
the City.

1.      General Plan Land Use Policies and Categories
Poway’s land use policies and development regulations are set forth primarily in three
documents: the Land Use Element of the General Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and the
Subdivision Ordinance. The Land Use Element contains the majority of City policies that guide
residential development, although other elements of the General Plan (Circulation, Safety,
Conservation, Open Space, and Noise) also affect land uses to varying degrees. General Plan
policies are implemented through several local ordinances, primarily the Zoning and Subdivision
ordinances. Other City ordinances, such as those relating to health and safety and noise, also
affect land uses to a lesser extent. This section focuses on the General Plan land use
categories and their relationship to the City’s zoning districts.
Table 3-1 summarizes the general land use and corresponding residential zones. The next
section describes these zones in greater detail.

Ordinance No. 283
In November 1988, the voters of Poway adopted an initiative (Proposition FF) that requires a
vote of the people before lands in the rural residential, open space, and planned community
categories can be re-designated to a denser category or before any changes can be made to
slope or other criteria that would result in the allowance of greater density. Proposition FF was
enacted by the City Council as Ordinance 283. The Ordinance affects the City Council's ability
to rezone land to densities that are compatible with the development of affordable housing or to
attach the Affordable Housing (AH) overlay to parcels in these categories.
The vacant land covered by Proposition FF is primarily environmentally sensitive, steeply
sloping land at the edge of the urban area (Figure 3-1). It has been identified as regionally
important open space under the Multiple Species Conservation Plan. As such, it would not be
an appropriate location for higher density housing. Most land with access to sewers, City water,
and public transportation, including the sites identified for lower and moderate income housing
in the new Residential Sites Inventory in Table 4-4 in Chapter 4, are not located within the area
subject to the provisions of Proposition FF. As a result, Proposition FF will not impact the City’s
ability to meet its obligation to provide adequate sites to accommodate its fair share of regional
housing needs for lower and moderate income households.

2.      Zoning Standards
Zoning ordinances establish the amount and distribution of different land uses within Poway,
while subdivision regulations establish requirements for the division and improvement of land
and associated easements and right-of-ways.
Residential uses in Poway are permitted in a number of zones. The Zoning Ordinance identifies
eight residential zones, five commercial zones that permit residential uses, and a mixed-use
zone, which also allows residential uses. Table 3-1 above groups these zones by the
generalized land use category.
The RR-A, RR-B, and RR-C Rural Residential zones are areas of very low-density residential
uses with minimum lot sizes ranging from 40 net acres to one net acre and maximum densities
of one unit per acre. These zones are regulated by special Ordinance No. 283 (Prop FF), which
was described previously in this chapter.
The RS-1, RS-2, RS-3, RS-4 and RS-7 zones are intended for single-family residential uses.
RS-1 is a low-density residential designation, which allows for single-family housing at a density
of one dwelling unit per net acre of land. RS-2 is also a low-density residential designation but
allows for single-family residential development at densities of two units per net acre. The RS-3
low to medium-density residential designation allows for single-family residential development
with minimum lot sizes of 15,000 square feet and a maximum density of three units per net acre.
The RS-4 zone is intended as a medium-density area for single-family residential development
on minimum lot sizes of 10,000 square feet and maximum densities of four units per net acre.
The RS-7 medium to high density zone is intended as an area for single-family residential
development on minimum lot sizes of 4,500 square feet and a maximum density of eight units
per net acre.
The Residential Condominium (RC) zone permits up to 12 units per acre, and the Residential
Apartment (RA) zone permits up to 20 units per acre. In addition to these residential zoning
designations, the City also allows multi-family residential development in several commercial
zones: Mixed Use (MU); Commercial Office (CO); Community Business (CB); Town Center
(TC); and Commercial General (CG). The Zoning Ordinance currently does not have
development standards for residential uses in the commercial zones. The City is currently
evaluating development standards for mixed use projects. The Zoning Ordinance will be
amended in the future to include appropriate development standards within these zones. The
use of a specific plan in commercial and mixed use zones will be used to establish development
standards as well.
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
through its Zoning Ordinance. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the General
Plan. The Zoning Ordinance also helps preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods.
The development standards described in Table 3-2 can affect the ability of landowners to
construct and maintain housing. The following section examines each of the standards and
May 2013                                                     Housing Element Update | Page 3-5
reaches conclusions regarding their impact, if any, on housing within Poway.
Residential Density: The Poway General Plan allows for residential densities ranging from less
than one dwelling unit per acre up to 20 dwelling units per acre. Densities are set forth in the
General Plan as well as the Zoning Ordinance. Based on the City’s experience with acquiring
sites for affordable housing, increasing baseline residential density is not an effective way to
provide affordable housing. The City has found that as allowable density increases, land value
also increases, making it more difficult for the City and affordable housing developers to acquire
sites. As discussed below, the Density Bonus and an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ)
provide the opportunity to increase density while eliminating potential for land speculation and
ensuring the provision of affordable housing.
Lot Size: The Zoning Ordinance sets minimum lot sizes for residentially zoned properties. The
minimum lot size for residential zones varies from 4,500 square feet in the RS-7 zone to four
acres for the RR-A zone (all based on slope criteria). Minimum lot sizes within the RC and RA
zones are two and three acres, respectively. If an existing lot does not conform to the minimum
lot size, a single unit can still be constructed if other requirements, such as setbacks, are
maintained or a variance is granted. It is important to note that the RC and RA zones do not
allow single-family dwellings.
Yards and Setbacks: Yard and setback requirements established in Poway's Zoning Ordinance
range from 18 to 40 feet for front yards, zero to 20 feet for side yards, and 15 to 50 feet for rear
yards. Exceptions exist for corner lots, with setbacks increasing for homes adjacent to two
streets. In the RC and RA zones, any building exceeding 15 feet in height must be setback 50
feet from any single-family zone, while buildings less than 15 feet in height must maintain a
minimum setback of 25 feet from any single-family zone to provide for an adequate buffer
between uses. Landscaping is also required to buffer RC and RA lots adjacent to single-family
zones. These setback requirements are similar to those of many communities, and do not pose
a significant constraint to housing development.
Building Coverage: The City imposes reasonable limits on building coverage. In the RR-A, RR-
B, RR-C, RS-1, RS-2, RS-3, and RS-4 zones, 35 percent of the lot may be covered by one-story
buildings. In zone RS-7, 50 percent of the lot may be occupied by buildings. In RC and RA
zones, the maximum coverage is 40 percent. With consideration of minimum lot sizes in each
of these zones, this coverage allowance is sufficient to accommodate the range of permissible
densities within each zone on most lots. There are approximately two to three square miles of
RS-7 land in Poway, most of which is in already developed areas. There is more RS-7 land
than there is land in the RS-1, RS-2, RS-3, and RS-4 zones individually, and less RS-7 land
than there is land in the RR-A and RR-C zones individually. The amount of land in the RS-7
zone is comparable to the amount of land in the RR-B zone. While the RS-7 zone allows for
greater lot coverage than the other zones, much of the land in this zone is already developed.
Much of the undeveloped land in Poway is in the RR-A zone.
Affordable housing is most feasible in the RS-7 zone due to the zone’s larger minimum lot size
and larger maximum lot coverage, the availability of water and sewer and appropriate streets.
The relative lack of available land in this zone constitutes a constraint.

Building Height: Zoning standards allow for residences up to 35 feet or two stories in height,
whichever standard results in a lower height, in all residential zones and other zones that permit
residential uses. The Solara project is an example of a development that achieved a density of
22.4 units per acre within the height limit. Many other projects built in recent years including
Hillside Village and Brighton Place have achieved higher densities within the height limit as well.
In preliminary workshops regarding the future Monte Vista development, the City Council
expressed a willingness to allow 3 stories within the 35 feet height limit for portions of the
development. Therefore, the height limit does not constrain property owners’ ability to achieve
maximum densities in any residential zone on regular shaped lots.
Parking: Two off-street parking spaces per unit are required for RR-A, RR-B, RR-C, RS-1, RS-
2, RS-3, RS-4, and RS-7 zones. Parking must be provided within the same lot as the main
building or structure. For residential uses, parking cannot be located in required front or side
yard setback areas. Based on review of parking standards from other jurisdictions in the region,
Poway’s parking requirements for single family units are consistent with other jurisdictions.
Parking standards vary by unit size within the RC and RA zones. In the RC zone, 1.75 spaces
per one-bedroom unit, 2.25 spaces per two-bedroom unit, and 3.0 spaces per three-bedroom
unit are required. Requirements within the RA zone are less stringent, demanding 1.5 spaces
per one-bedroom unit, 2.25 spaces per two-bedroom unit, and 2.75 spaces per three bedroom
unit.
Poway’s parking standards for one-bedroom multifamily units are lower than standards for
similar units in other San Diego region jurisdictions. Moreover, the City’s requirements for two-
bedroom multifamily units are highly comparable to the requirements of its neighbors. However,
the requirements for multifamily units with three or more bedrooms are substantially higher in
comparison to other jurisdictions in the region.
An example of the City’s flexibility in applying parking standards is the Affordable Housing
Overlay Zone (AHOZ). This zone may be applied in areas near services and public
transportation, which enables lower income households to be less auto-dependent and can also
allow a reduction in the required parking while increasing development density. The City has
demonstrated a willingness to reduce these standards where appropriate to facilitate the
development of affordable housing. For example, the Solara development, built in 2007, was
approved with a 30 percent reduction in parking. Without this reduction, the 56-unit project for
low and very low income households would have required 130 parking spaces, but the project
was approved with a 90-space requirement.
Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ): To provide adequate sites for affordable housing
development and to ensure that any increased densities allowed are used for the provision of
affordable housing, an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) was established in the Zoning
Code for Low Income (AH-L) and Moderate Income (AH-M) households. This included
providing flexible development standards that will allow the densities up to 30 dwelling units per
acre. Placement of an AHOZ designation was completed in 2012 on six (6) publicly-owned
sites. An AHOZ may be applied to property within any land use category, including non-
residential categories, but not including the Open Space or Rural Residential categories.
Additionally, AHOZ development standards allow for development concessions consistent with
May 2013                                                     Housing Element Update | Page 3-7

density bonus regulations.
The Poway Municipal Code (PMC) was amended in 2012 to provide development incentives on
AHOZ sites to encourage affordable housing that is consistent with State law. As described
above, development standards include allowing densities up to 30 dwelling units per acre on
properties that have the AHOZ applied on them. These properties may also be designed as
part of a mixed use development as described in Chapter 4. AHOZ properties that include Very
Low and Low Income households (AH-L) will use development and performance standards
consistent with the Residential Apartment (RA) zone. AHOZ properties that include Moderate
Income Households (AH-M) will use development and performance standards consistent with
the Residential Condominium (RC) zone. Waivers or reduced standards, incentives and
concessions may also be applied to AHOZ sites and shall be consistent with density bonus
provisions as stated in PMC 17.26.680 through 17.26.720. As described under the parking
section above, reduced parking standards were included in the Solara affordable housing
development, built in 2007. Under application of density bonus provisions, reduced parking
standards are provided at the following rate - zero to one bedroom dwelling unit: one on-site
parking space; two to three bedrooms: two on-site parking spaces; and four or more bedrooms:
two and one-half parking spaces. Where appropriate, the City will continue to consider reduced
parking standards. Other development standards for AHOZ sites include: street design
standards to be consistent with City specifications; provision of on-site amenities such as
community buildings, common open space areas, tot lots or playgrounds, outdoor barbeques,
and family picnic areas and incorporation of seating areas such as patios or balconies at
individual units.

3.      Permitted Residential Uses
Housing Element law requires jurisdictions to identify adequate sites through appropriate zoning
and development standards to encourage the development of various types of housing for all
economic segments of the population. The City implements this State law requirement through
zoning standards for various types of housing. Residential types analyzed below include single-
family dwellings, second dwelling units, manufactured housing, mobile home parks, special
needs housing, residential care facilities, multi-family dwellings and mixed-use.
Single-Family Dwellings: Detached single-family dwelling units are permitted in all residential
zones.
Second Dwelling Units: Second dwelling units, also referred to in the Zoning Ordinance as
accessory apartments, may be located on the same lot as an existing single-family dwelling
except in those areas of the City determined by resolution of the City Council to be inappropriate
for second units. A resolution determining in which areas second units are not allowed is
adopted annually by the City. The resolution designates areas of the City without adequate
water, sewer, or other municipal services for second units or in which second units would have
a significant adverse impact upon traffic flow. Second living units in these areas are not
permitted. The resolution contains the criteria used to judge whether infrastructure in an area is
sufficient to support second dwelling units and discusses which areas are not served to this
level. The City Council then votes on the resolution, and it becomes law for another year once
the previous resolution expires; when the City council votes down the resolution, the resolution
must be modified accordingly and returned to the City Council in due time to replace the
previous year’s resolution. As a result of the update to the Transportation Element in 2010,
second dwelling units are now permitted in larger areas of the City. In all other residential areas
not designated as unfeasible for second dwelling units, they may be permitted where the
following standards are met:
   1) Approval of a building permit in accordance with Title 15 of the Poway Municipal Code;
   2) Does not exceed one story in height unless it is contained within or is an addition to a two-
       story primary dwelling unit;
   3) Complies with all the development regulations for residential zones, including those
       pertaining to lot coverage and setbacks;
   4) One additional on-site covered parking space shall be provided; and
   5) The floor area does not exceed 25 percent of the floor area contained in the primary unit
       (not including garage area) or 1,500 square feet, whichever is less.
The City’s standards for second dwelling units do not constitute a constraint on the provision of
this type of housing.
Manufactured Housing: Manufactured homes certified under the National Manufactured
Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. Section 5401 et seq.)
installed on a foundation system pursuant to Section 18551 of the California Health and Safety
Code on individual lots are treated as a standard single-family residential development. No
additional standards required for approval or construction of units. The City’s standards for
manufactured housing do not constitute a constraint on the provision of this type of housing.
May 2013                                                     Housing Element Update | Page 3-10

Mobile Home Parks: The City's Zoning Ordinance permits mobile home parks in all residential
zones with the granting of a Conditional Use Permit subject to development standards
described in the Mobile Home Park (MHP) Zone. The (MHP) zone only allows mobile home
parks and very limited other uses. Requirements for mobile home parks include the submittal of
a preliminary drainage plan, undergrounding of all utility lines, four to six foot fencing
surrounding the development, and street signs at all intersections. Additional requirements
include 400 square feet of open recreational area for each mobile home space, onsite laundry
facilities, and supplemental parking for large items (boats, RVs, trailers) at a rate of one space
per 10 mobile home lots. Required parking for residents is identical to the requirements for
multifamily residential development, which requires two spaces per dwelling unit (one space for
one-bedroom units), plus 0.5 spaces per unit for guest parking.
The development standards for mobile home parks are consistent with the health and safety
needs of residents of the community and surrounding developments, and are not overly
burdensome or restrictive. These standards allow for development of mobile home parks in
most zones and offer flexibility in design and scale of development. These restrictions are not
considered a constraint to the production of mobile home parks. Requirement of a Conditional
Use Permit is consistent with State law. The City’s standards for mobile home parks do not
constitute a constraint on the provision of this type of housing.
Residential Care Facilities: Residential care facilities are facilities of any capacity that provide
24-hour non-medical care for those who are unable to provide for their own daily needs.
Residents may be physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and/or mentally disabled.
Licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are included in the City’s
definition of “family” and are therefore permitted in all residential zones in accordance with the
provisions of State law. Licensed residential care facilities for seven to 15 persons are
conditionally permitted in the RS-2, RC, and RA zones. The City’s standards for residential care
facilities do not constitute a constraint on the provision of this type of housing.
Special Needs Housing:           State law requires that cities identify sites that are adequately
zoned for the placement of special needs housing. Additionally, cities must not unduly
discourage or deter these uses. The City will continue to comply with the provisions of Senate
Bill 2 as it pertains to special needs housing.
        Emergency Shelters: An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to
         homeless families and/or homeless individuals on a limited short-term basis. The
         Zoning Ordinance permits homeless shelters as a Temporary Use in all residential and
         commercial zoning districts. The City’s zoning ordinance does not include any
         discretionary review process for homeless shelters or transitional housing. In addition,
         the Poway City Council has waived the fees associated with the Temporary Use Permit
         process for Emergency Shelters in Poway. Religious facilities have used this provision
         in the past to provide temporary homeless shelters during inclement weather. Because
         many religious facilities have halls with kitchen and restroom facilities, they are able to
         serve as inclement weather housing without structural modification.
May 2013                                                       Housing Element Update | Page 3-11

     The City participates in the North County Regional Winter Shelter Program to provide
     shelter, case management and social services to homeless persons. The program
     includes permanent and rotating/temporary sites.
       Homeless Shelters: To comply with the Senate Bill 2, local governments must identify
        one or more zoning districts that allow year-round homeless shelters without
        discretionary review. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to accommodate
        at least one year-round shelter and accommodate the City’s share of the regional
        unsheltered homeless population. Program 16 and 17 in Chapter 6 will require the City
        to amend its Zoning Code within one-year of adoption of the Housing Element to
        explicitly address compliance with SB 2 and homeless shelters. Objective development
        and management standards will be established in the Zoning Code including:
                The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by the
                 facility.
                Off-street parking based on demonstrated need.
                The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client intake
                 areas.
                The provision of on-site management.
                The proximity to other homeless shelters provided that shelters are
                 not required to be more than 300 feet apart.
                Length of stay.
                Lighting.
                Security during hours that the homeless shelter is in operation.
    The City will permit homeless shelters by right, without discretionary review within the
    Residential Apartment (RA) Zone consistent with State law. RA zones are located in
    several areas around the City. Many properties zoned RA are located along transit
    corridors and are in proximity to community services, employment areas and shopping
    centers. Several parcels in the RA zone are underutilized and can be redeveloped in the
    future to include a year-round homeless shelter to accommodate the City’s homeless
    population.        There are also RA zoned properties containing existing residential
    developments that can be modified to add a year-round homeless shelter to accommodate
    the City’s homeless population, as required by State law.
       Transitional and Supportive Housing: This type of housing (including Single Room
        Occupancy) is defined in Section 50675 of the State Government Code in the definition
        of “Family” and “Household.” Senate Bill 2, which took effect in January 2008, sought to
        ensure that local governments do not unreasonably deny approval for transitional
        housing or supportive housing and clarifies that jurisdictions must treat transitional
        housing and supportive housing meeting the Health and Safety Code definition of
        regular housing in the same manner as any other residential use within the same zone.
        Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not directly address supportive housing.
        Transitional Housing is a type of supportive housing used to facilitate the movement of
        homeless individuals and families to permanent housing. The time frame for Transitional
May 2013                                                      Housing Element Update | Page 3-12

         Housing is typically at least six months. This housing type can be similar to group
         quarters with beds, single family homes and multi-family units, but may also include
         supportive services to gain necessary skills with the goal of independent living.
         Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the homeless,
         people with disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. State law
         defines “supportive housing” as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is
         occupied by low income persons with disabilities, including developmental disabilities,
         and that is linked to on-site or off-site services that assist the supportive housing
         resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his
         or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community (California Health and
         Safety Code Section 50675.2).
         State law also requires that local governments do not unreasonably deny approval for
         transitional housing or supportive housing and clarifies that jurisdictions must treat
         transitional housing and supportive housing in the same manner as any other residential
         use within the same zone. Transitional and supportive housing are considered
         residential uses. As such, they are allowed in all zones allowing residential uses subject
         only to the same standards that apply to the same type of housing in the same
         zone. Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not directly address supportive
         housing. The Zoning Code will be amended to specifically define Transitional and
         Supportive Housing.
        Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Units: SRO units are one-room units intended for
         occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct from a studio or efficiency unit, in
         that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen and bathroom. Although
         SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many SROs have one or the
         other. The City’s Zoning Code allows SRO’s, along with hotels and motels, in certain
         commercial zones subject to the same development standards as other residential uses
         in Poway’s commercial zones. The City will amend its Zoning Code to clarify the definition
         of Single Room Occupancy and facilitate the provision of SRO’s pursuant to AB 2634
         (Housing for Extremely Low Income Households).
In past years, the City has worked with local service organizations to provide transitional and
other special needs housing units within the City. Currently, the City provides four (4)
transitional and eight (8) special needs housing units. Despite the City’s demonstrated ability to
provide transitional housing units, the Zoning Ordinance does not explicitly identify zones where
these facilities are permitted or conditionally permitted. Pursuant to Program 16 in Chapter 6,
the City will revise its Zoning Ordinance to address the provision of special needs housing.
Agricultural Worker Housing (Employee Housing Act)
Pursuant to the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the Health and
Safety Code), employee housing for agricultural workers consisting of no more than 36 beds in
a group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a single-family or household is
permitted by right in an agricultural land use designation. Any employee housing providing
accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be deemed a single-family structure within a
residential land use designation, according to the Employee Housing Act. Employee housing
May 2013                                                     Housing Element Update | Page 3-13

for six or fewer persons is permitted wherever a single-family residence is permitted. To comply
with State law no conditional use permit, variance, or other permit can be required for employee
housing that is not required for a single-family residence in the same zone.
The City has no agricultural zones. The City’s Zoning Ordinance permits agricultural uses in the
all residential zoning districts. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to add a definition for
agricultural housing as well as clarify the provision for agricultural worker housing in the City’s
residential zones pursuant to State law.
Multifamily Units: Multifamily units are permitted in the RC and RA zones. Rental multifamily
housing is a permitted use in both zones, but condominiums are only permitted in the RC zone.
Condominium conversions are conditionally permitted in the RC zone. The RC zone has a
maximum of 12 units per acre and a minimum lot size of two acres, while the RA zone has a
maximum of 20 units per acre and a minimum lot size of three acres. The RC zone also has
slightly higher minimum parking requirements per unit. In both zones, uses that “are
complimentary to, and can exist in harmony with” the primary use of each zone are permitted,
including single family dwellings. The allowance of multi-family rental housing in the RC zones
prevents the existence of this zone from being a constraint on multi-family rental housing.
Mixed Use: Residential uses are conditionally permitted within the Mixed-Use (MU) and other
commercial zones (CO, CB, TC, and CG). The Zoning Ordinance does not include specific
standards on the type and density of residential uses within these zones. This may be a
constraint on residential development in mixed use developments. The City will study these
zones and update the Zoning Ordinance to include appropriate development standards for
mixed use development (see Program 16 in Chapter 6). The use of specific plans in
commercial zones and the MU zone may also include specific development standards for
residential uses within those zones. There has been little to no residential development in
commercial zones in Poway in the past, so there is no precedent on which the City can base
standards for current or future development of this nature.
Table 3-3 shows the permitted residential uses for each zoning designation. Residential uses
are permitted where the symbol “P” appears and subject to a conditional use permit where the
symbol “C” appears. Where the symbol “X” appears the use is prohibited. A use that is not listed
is not permitted.

4.      Site Improvement Standards
Site improvements and property dedications are important components of new development.
The following list summarizes required dedications for new subdivisions:
       Reservation of sites by the subdivider on or off of the subdivision site for parks,
        recreational facilities, libraries, or other public uses. Where a park, recreational facility,
        fire station, library, or other public use is shown on an adopted specific or general plan,
        adequate sites must be reserved in accordance with applicable policies and standards.
       Dedication for streets, alleys, drainage and water easements, public utility easements,
        easements for recreation trails, equestrian trails, open space, sewers, bicycle paths, and
        transit facilities (including bus turnouts, benches, shelters, and landing pads). The need
        for trail dedications is determined by designated trail connections included in the
        Transportation Element of the General Plan, amended in 2010 and 2012.
       Dedication of parkland at a ratio of five acres per 1,000 residents or payment of in-lieu
        fees (or a combination of both) sufficient to acquire five acres per 1,000 residents,
        consistent with the Quimby Act. Land for the park must be conveyed directly to the City
        prior to or concurrent with final map/parcel map approval. A ratio of five park acres to
        every 1,000 residents, in accordance with the adopted Park and Recreation Element of
        the City’s General Plan is used to compute the amount of land to be dedicated.
May 2013                                                       Housing Element Update | Page 3-15

      Dedicated parkland must be at least two acres and include at least four of the following
      amenities: Children’s Play Apparatus Area, Landscape Park-like and Quiet Areas,
      Family Picnic Area, Game Court Area, Turf Playfield, Swimming Pool (42 feet by 75 feet
      with adjacent deck and lawn areas), Recreation Center Building. The following formula
      is used to calculate the fee for each proposal: Fee per dwelling unit = (total cost for year
      for parks & recreation development) divided by (General Plan’s designated ultimate
      population minus current population; difference divided by average population per
      dwelling unit.) At the time of filing a tentative tract map or a tentative parcel map for
      approval, the City determines whether dedication of property for park and recreational
      purposes or in-lieu fees are necessary. If the City desires dedication, the area is
      designated on the tentative tract map or tentative parcel map when deemed complete for
      submission. The City Council determines whether to require land dedication, payment
      of fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, by consideration of the following:
             Parks and recreation element of the general plan;
             Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision
              available for dedication; and
             Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for subdivision
Improvements required of new subdivisions are summarized as follows:
     Improvement of public and private streets to provide suitable access and traffic
      circulation, including the construction and paving of streets, alleys, paths, accessways,
      private streets and easements, and the construction of sidewalks, curbs and gutters,
      driveway approaches, transitions and other street work appurtenant thereto, and the
      execution of a Road Maintenance Agreement covering the maintenance of all non-
      dedicated streets and accessways;

        separation, beautification, or for the control of erosion and sloughage onto public
        sidewalks or streets.
Street improvement standards typically have the greatest impact on housing costs. The cost of
providing streets for new residential developments, in turn, is primarily influenced by the
required right-of-way width, pavement width, pavement improvement, and landscaping
standards, which typically reduce the buildable area of the lot.
Title 12 of the Poway Municipal Code (Streets and Sidewalks) includes the City’s standards for
construction of streets. Streets are classified as Urban, Semi-Rural, Dedicated Rural, and Non-
dedicated Rural. Typical residential development will include provisions for minor streets and
collector streets, each of which has a right-of-way of 50 to 60 feet, including pavement, curbs,
gutters, and sidewalks (Table 3-4).

5.      Permit and Impact Fees
Requiring developers to construct on-site improvements and/or pay pro rata shares toward the
provision of infrastructure, public services, and school facilities will increase the cost of
developing homes and the final sales price or rent of housing. However, the payment of fees is
necessary to maintain an adequate level of services and facilities, and more importantly, to
protect public health and safety.
Development impact fees offset the costs of improvements serving the development. Permit
fees cover administrative review of the development by the planning, building, and engineering
staff. The City's fee schedule is based on anticipated costs associated with review and
approval of proposed projects. Poway’s current development fee schedule, approved in 2010,
is summarized in Table 3-5.

The San Diego Building Industry Association (BIA) prepares a survey of development impact
and permit issuance fees for San Diego region jurisdictions. Typically, this survey is conducted
every three years. As part of its most recent survey conducted in 2012, the BIA compared the
permit issuance fees of the region’s jurisdictions for a 4-bedroom/3-bath/2700-square-foot
prototypical single-family home (Table 3-6). The total of all impact fees for Poway was $33,513,
which included $8,460 in school fees imposed by the Poway Unified School District (PUSD).
May 2013                                                          Housing Element Update | Page 3-19

Among the seven participating jurisdictions in northern San Diego County, fees in Vista were the
lowest ($17,791), while fees for the prototype home in the City of San Diego were the highest
($56,751).
Although development fees are a constraint on the provision of housing, Poway’s fees for
single-family residences are consistent with other jurisdictions. The City’s Inclusionary Housing
In-Lieu Fee it collects on single-family residential development was reduced during the previous
housing cycle. Poway also imposes a Habitat Mitigation In-Lieu Fee ($17,000 per acre), which
is applicable as mitigation if a property impacts natural biological habitat. If the parcel is located
within the Mitigation Area, as recognized by the Poway Subarea Habitat Conservation Plan
(PSHCP), then onsite mitigation may be applicable.
Fees that Poway imposes for subdivision processing, plan check application processing,
development impacts, building permit issuance are used to pay for the necessary local
infrastructure needed to support the development and cover the costs of processing the
necessary permits. As stated above, Poway’s fees for a typical home are comparable to the
fees required by other jurisdictions and, in many cases, substantially less than other North
County Inland jurisdictions. Based on information collected from local developers, an analysis
of permit costs and fees was conducted, which shows that the cost of permits and fees is
approximately eight percent of the total project cost. As a result, the analysis suggests that
Poway’s fees are not considered a constraint to housing development.
The BIA survey conducted in 2012 did not include a comprehensive analysis for a multi-family
prototype for North County Inland cities for purposes of fee comparisons. As noted in Table 3-
5, multi-family projects in Poway are also subject to development impact fees for traffic
mitigation, park mitigation, fire protection drainage, water service improvements and sanitary
sewer service improvements in addition to planning and building fees. These fees are needed
to cover the costs associated for the project development. The City analyzed the fee
information for multi-family in Table 3-5 along with the current building valuation fees that the
City’s Building Division collects for multi-family developments. Based on that data, it is
estimated that the cost of permits and fees imposed by the City is approximately six to seven
percent of total development costs. This analysis, similar to the single-family development
costs, suggests that the City’s fees are not considered a constraint to housing development

6.       Development Permit Procedures and Timeframes
Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to ensure that residential
construction proceeds in an orderly manner. However, the time and cost of permit processing
and review can be a constraint to housing development if they place an undue burden on the
developer.
The City applies a relatively uniform permitting and review process for all residential
applications, tentative maps, conditional use permits, development reviews, and variances. The
City does not have a Planning Commission, thus reducing the time involved in the project
application and approval process. Staff level review and approval is acceptable for permits for
the construction of one dwelling unit and minor proposals that are considered incidental to the
existing building or surrounding community. This process only applies to projects that are
consistent with zoning and General Plan land use designations. The majority of single family
homes are processed under a Minor Development Review Permit (MDRA) which is staff
approval. The processing timeline for a staff approved MDRA varies depending on the
complexity of the site to be developed. As the City nears build out, easily developed sites are
becoming rare. The processing time for a staff-approved MDRA typically ranges from 4 to 6
weeks.
Tentative subdivision maps require City Council approval. The process from submittal of a
complete application to City Council hearing typically takes 12 weeks for a tentative subdivision
map and is summarized in Figure 3-2.
Applications for multi-family developments require a similar process as single-family
applications, except that a Development Review (DR) approval by the Poway City Council is
required pursuant to the City’s Municipal Code. The process, from submittal of a complete
application to City Council hearing, is the same as the single-family application process, but
typically takes 6 to 10 weeks due to the additional time needed for the City Council public
hearing. Multi-family developments for affordable housing will be allowed by right pursuant to
California Government Code Section 65583.2(h) and 65583.2(i). The City’s General Plan and
Municipal Code will be amended to ensure it complies with State Law.
During the consideration of a multi-family development project, subject to a DR, the City Council
evaluates the project application against the qualitative objectives described in the DR
procedure listed in PMC Section 17.52.010. These objectives ensure that the proposed project
support the implementation of the City’s General Plan including maintaining importance of visual
appeal and aesthetics, environmental soundness, economic stability, property values and
harmonious appearance of structures and property (i.e. landscaping, signage, streets, parking
areas, etc.) The City has been very successful in approving high quality projects for years and
has maintained a long track record for approving projects. In addition, development projects are
not burdened by unreasonable development conditions and developers find that there are no
general constraints to development.
All development applications are routed to the City’s Development Review Committee (DRC),
after the initial application submittal. The DRC is comprised of the City’s Planning staff,
Engineering staff and one representative from Safety Services and Public Works. Within 30
May 2013                                                   Housing Element Update | Page 3-22

days from the date the application is submitted, the applicant is notified of any deficiencies. The
applicant prepares the additional information and resubmits the application. The City has
another 30 days to review the resubmittal for completeness. When the application is deemed
complete, the plans are distributed to the appropriate City departments for conditions of
approval. If the project is a staff level approval, the staff planner issues a letter of approval,
typically within a week of receiving the conditions. If City Council approval is required, the staff
report is prepared and the item is heard within two to three weeks of completion of the staff
report.
In the past few years, the City has made changes to the Municipal Code to streamline several
development review processes. These modifications resulted in savings of time and cost for
applicants. The City continues to evaluate its codes and procedures to reduce processing time
and costs.

7.       Building Code and Enforcement
The City has adopted the 2010 California Building Code, Part 2, Title 24 of the California Code
of Regulations with the deletion of the administration chapter of the 1997 Uniform Building
Code. The City has also adopted the 2010 California Electrical Code, California Plumbing
Code, California Mechanical Code, and California Energy Code, with minor amendments,
notably deletion of the administration chapters. The building code is determined by the
International Conference of Building Officials and the State of California. The only significant
local amendments that the City has adopted is requiring ignition-resistant construction - Class 1
building materials, Class A roof covering materials and residential fire sprinkler system
installation.
When a code violation is suspected, residents may file a complaint with City staff, who will
usually seek the assistance of a Code Compliance Officer to determine whether the complaint is
a code violation or another type of violation. Reports of code violations are assigned to a Code
Compliance Officer for investigation. The City Planner oversees Poway’s Code Compliance
Officers.
If a property is found to be in violation, the Officer leaves a courtesy notice with the property
owner. The Officer attempts to speak to the property owner directly, but leaves a notice at the
front door of the homes if the property owner is not available. A copy of the pertinent code
section is also left with the notice. The notice includes a compliance date, which is determined
by the degree of the violation. Health and safety violations require quicker remediation than
other types of code violations. The goal is to achieve voluntary compliance by having the
property owner address the violation without further City involvement.
The Code Compliance Officer returns to inspect the property after the compliance date. If the
violation has been addressed, the case is closed. If the violation persists, a courtesy letter is
issued with another compliance date. If the violation has not been remediated after the second
compliance date, a notice of violation is issued and a third compliance date is set. A second
notice of violation is issued with a threat of sanction if the problem is still not addressed. If the
violation is not addressed by the fourth compliance date, the City could deem the property a
public nuisance to allow the City to address the issue and/or abate the nuisance and attach a
lien for payment of the costs incurred or issue a citation. In Poway’s experience, by the time an
administrative citation is issued, the property owner either complies or files an appeal with the
City Council.
Enforcement of City codes is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of residents
and are therefore a necessary constraint on housing development. The City’s code
enforcement procedures provide residents with the opportunity to appeal notices of violation at
any time.

8.       Relief from Governmental Constraints
Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ)
To provide adequate sites for affordable housing development and to ensure that any increased
densities allowed are used for the provision of affordable housing, an Affordable Housing
Overlay Zone (AHOZ) has been established in the Land Use Element of the General Plan and
the Zoning Code for Low Income and Moderate Income households.
An AHOZ for the Low Income category was previously established in the Land Use Element of
the General Plan. Pursuant to Program 15 of the previous Housing Element, the General Plan
and Zoning Code were amended in 2012 to create an AHOZ for the Moderate Income category
and to modify the provisions in the Low Income category. This included providing flexible
development standards that will allow the densities up to 30 dwelling units per acre noted in the
Residential Sites Inventory. Also, Program 17 in the previous Housing Element resulted in an
amendment to the General Plan designation and zoning to apply an AHOZ on some publicly-
owned sites in 2012. A total of six (6) properties now include an AHOZ. An AHOZ may be
applied to property within any land use category, including non-residential categories, but not
including the Open Space or Rural Residential categories.
The AHOZ for the Moderate Income category is designed to function much like a density bonus
through a specific plan. Typically, a specific plan is processed concurrently with all other land
use entitlements, so there is no additional processing time. The original amendment to the
General Plan and Zoning Code removed the requirement for a specific plan for the Low and
Very Low Income category. In order to ensure both the initial and continued affordability of
housing constructed under the AHOZs, deed restrictions are required which guarantees that
resale prices or rents will not exceed affordable levels and that future residents will have
appropriate incomes to correspond with the price or rent restrictions.
The City will amend the General Plan and Land Use Designation on all remaining properties
identified in the new Residential Sites Inventory (Table 4-4) in Chapter 4 to place an AHOZ for
Low Income households or Moderate income households. The AHOZ will allow the densities
required to meet the City’s Regional Housing Needs allocation. The underlying zoning on these
sites will not change. During this process, evaluation of the current development standards
within the AHOZ for Low Income and Moderate Income households will be analyzed and
amended as necessary.
Density Bonus Ordinance
Developers of affordable housing are entitled to a density bonus and/or equivalent concessions
or incentives under certain conditions. State law regarding density bonus was amended in 2009
to reduce the amount of units that a developer must provide in order to receive a density bonus
and required a number of regulatory concessions or incentives (i.e. reduction of development
standards), depending upon the percentage of affordable units that the developer provides.
State law was also amended to establish a sliding scale for determining the density bonus
developers are eligible to receive. The maximum density bonus a developer can receive is 35
percent when a project provides either 10 percent of a proposed project for very low income
May 2013                                                   Housing Element Update | Page 3-26

households, 20 percent for low income households, or 40 percent for moderate income
households. The legislation also imposed other modifications to Density Bonus Law including
incentives for housing with child care facilities, a new land donation rule, and statewide parking
standards. The City revised its density bonus ordinance in 2009 to be consistent with State law.
Nonconforming Uses
Existing homes located in non-residential areas are considered non-conforming uses.
Whenever a non-conforming structure is destroyed by fire, or any other calamity, to the extent of
50 percent or less, the structure may be restored. When the destruction exceeds 50 percent or
the structure is voluntarily razed or is required by law to be razed, the structure may not be
restored. The Zoning Ordinance specifically exempts residential structures including multifamily
from these requirements.
The City identified six (6) properties where commercial businesses were located on
residentially-zoned land. The municipal code allowed them to remain for 15 years. In 2011, all
of the property owners were notified that the non-conforming uses needed to be abated. A
General Plan and Zone Change was processed for three of the properties to change the land
use to commercial to match the existing development. The other three properties were given
abatement letters. Two of the properties have converted to residential uses consistent with the
zone and the third property is in the process of converting to a residential use.
Variances
A variance is a discretionary permit issued by the City Council allowing deviation from
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance allows for the issuance of variances
for properties subject to special conditions related to size, topography, location, or surroundings.
Variances are only granted in the event that special conditions exist and the strict application of
the Zoning Ordinance requirements prevents the property from participating in the privileges of
surrounding properties that are subject to the same zoning ordinances.
Reasonable Accommodations for Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As part of the Housing Element update, the City conducted a comprehensive review of its
development ordinances and planning policies for their potential to affect persons with
disabilities. The results of this review are discussed below.
Poway permits residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons and licensed by the State
within all of its residential zoning districts by right. State licensed residential care facilities
serving seven or more persons are conditionally permitted in the RS-2, RC, and RA zones.
Residential care facilities include facilities that provide 24-hour non-medical care to persons in
need, emergency shelters, home finding agencies, or residential service facilities for homeless,
disabled, infirmed, or mentally challenged adults and children. The City does not have any
siting requirements between group home facilities.
Accessory uses such as wheelchair ramps are permitted within all residential zones as
incidental structures related to the residence. Building procedures within the City are also
May 2013                                                      Housing Element Update | Page 3-27
required to conform to the California Building Code, as adopted in the City's Municipal Code.
Standards within the Code include provisions to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities.
Reasonable accommodation refers to the need for disabled and special needs residents to alter
their homes or be permitted exceptions to the strict application of zoning standards to allow for
access, mobility, and use of their homes. Persons with disabilities or their representatives may
request reasonable accommodations, including exceptions to zoning standards (setback, yard,
parking, height, lot coverage, etc.). Zoning and building codes, and the City's approach to code
enforcement, allow for special features that meet the needs of persons with disabilities without
the need for zoning variances. City staff is available to provide assistance regarding the
procedures for special accommodations under the City's Zoning Ordinance. In 2009, the City
amended the Municipal Code to add regulations and procedures for reasonable
accommodations, pursuant to Program 10 in the previous Housing Element. This action is
consistent with Government Code Section 65583.
B.      Environmental, Infrastructure, and Public Service Constraints
Environmental factors and a lack of necessary infrastructure or public services can constrain
residential development in a community by increasing costs and reducing the amount of land
suitable for housing construction. This section summarizes and analyzes the most pertinent
constraints to housing. Future residential development will be faced with challenges regarding
supportive public infrastructure extensions and expansions.
1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental concerns can constrain housing in two ways: (1) land availability is limited from
development and (2) costs are increased due to efforts to mitigate environmental impacts.
Many environmental features may constrain development in Poway: habitat for
threatened/endangered species, steep slopes, floodplains/wetlands, geologic constraints, and
cultural resources (historic or pre-historic structures or sites).
The City is responsible for implementing flood control measures within Poway. Significant
portions of the City are affected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) 100-
year floodplain designation. Approximately 1,810 residential properties are impacted by a
floodway within the City.
The vast majority of Poway’s undeveloped land is located within the Poway Subarea Habitat
Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation Plan (PSHCP) Mitigation Area. The
Mitigation Area comprises approximately 53% of the 25,047 total City acreage. The PSHCP is
necessary to allow for the incidental take of listed species by public projects and private
projects. The PSHCP fulfills requirements pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Federal Endangered
Species Act (ESA); Sections 2081 and 2835 of the State Fish and Game Code and the
California Endangered Species Act (CESA); and the State of California’s Natural Communities
Conservation Planning (NCCP) Act of 1991. It is also consistent with regional and subregional
planning efforts within San Diego County pursuant to the NCCP Act. Collectively, these laws
and planning efforts require protection and management of sufficient, interconnected habitat
May 2013                                                       Housing Element Update | Page 3-28

areas to support listed species in exchange for allowing limited take of the species or its habitat.
Because these areas are designated for very low density residential uses, habitat constraints
within these areas are minimal as individual homes and limited access roads are permitted
provided construction avoids environmentally sensitive areas.              However, the habitat
conservation requirements mean that 13,307 acres of potentially developable residential land
can only be built at densities that would make housing unaffordable to all but above-moderate
income households.
Based on development patterns and the constraint of undevelopable land area within areas of
the City that are impacted by Proposition FF and the PSHCP, the City moves closer to build-out.
Sites identified for higher density development in Section 4, Housing Resources, are located in
urbanized areas and not unduly constrained by floodplains, biological resources, or other
environmental constraints. Steep slopes, geologic constraints, and cultural resources are listed
as potential constraints, but there is not information with which to reach a conclusion as to
whether these are actual constraints. Based on the best available data provided through
SANDAG in 2010 using the City’s Geographic Information System, the City has approximately
6,201 acres of vacant developable land remaining in Poway.

The City of Poway relies on two surface water sources: water imported from the San Diego
County Water Authority and local rainfall captured by Lake Poway. The imported water
comprises the majority of Poway’s water supply, accounting for 99.5 percent of the raw water
supply. Additionally, recycled water is used in the Poway Business Park for landscape
irrigation, accounting for approximately four percent of Poway’s overall water use.
The majority of the raw water purchased from the San Diego County Water Authority is imported
from the Northern California Aqueduct and Colorado River Systems. These sources of water
are pumped to the Lester J. Berglund Water Treatment Plant and Lake Poway for storage. The
Treatment Plant has a capacity of 24 million gallons per day (mgd) and the lake has a storage
capacity of approximately 3,300 acre-feet of water. For calendar year 2012, average Water
Treatment Plant daily potable water production was approximately 9.71 mgd.
The City of Poway Water Master Plan, prepared in 2001, assumed build-out population of
55,000 persons by 2020, consistent with the City of Poway General Plan. At that time, water
consumption of 250 gallons per capita per day was assumed. Therefore, upon build-out of the
General Plan, 13.75 mgd of water would be required. Based on Poway’s estimated population
of 48,382 in 2012 (based upon 2010 census numbers), at 250 gallons per capita per day, 12.1
mgd would be required.
However, based on significant water cost increases in recent years and an emphasis on
maximizing water efficiency, Poway’s overall water use has decreased significantly since 2009.
Additionally, a recent California law mandates urban water suppliers reduce overall water use
by 20% by 2020. Based on this legislation, Poway’s 2020 water use efficiency target,
May 2013                                                   Housing Element Update | Page 3-29

established in the City’s 2010 Urban Water Management Plan, adopted in June 2011, is 215
gallons per capita per day.
Adequate facilities and supply are anticipated to be in place to meet forecasted water needs.
Sewer Service
The City maintains and operates nearly one million linear feet of wastewater conveyance
pipeline and five (5) active lift stations within its service area. For wastewater treatment, the
City is part of the Metropolitan Wastewater Joint Powers Authority, which includes the City of
San Diego and 11 other municipalities and special districts. The City of San Diego operates the
regional wastewater conveyance and treatment facilities.
Poway owns 5.894 mgd of capacity in the City of San Diego’s Metropolitan Wastewater System,
and 5.0 mgd in the City of San Diego municipal system. Poway also has 0.05 mgd of capacity
at the City of Escondido’s Hale Avenue Recovery & Reclamation Facility (HARRF), which
handles wastewater treatment for Rancho Bernardo and a portion of flow from two small areas
in the northern portion of Poway.
For FY 2012, Poway’s average daily wastewater flow conveyed to the City of San Diego Trunk
Sewer for conveyance to regional treatment facilities was 3.005 MGD.                  In addition,
approximately 0.05 MGD was treated at HARRF.
Using conservative growth assumptions and SANDAG population projections, City flows in 2030
are estimated to be 4.27 mgd. Poway’s current contracted capacity is adequate to
accommodate the additional flow.
Drainage Facilities
In Poway, runoff from storm drains enters eight drainage basins, but the majority of drainage is
collected in three major creeks: Poway, Green Valley and Sycamore. Water from all of the
creeks eventually flows into three Poway watersheds.
Developers of property located within a designated planned local drainage (PLD) area pay a fee
to provide necessary storm drainage facilities including underground storm drain pipelines,
catch basins, detention basins, and other facilities that may be needed to serve proposed
development. The fees are based upon estimated costs of necessary facilities and are
apportioned within each PLD area based on benefits accrued to a property or need for facilities
created by a project. Stormwater pollution prevention and flood control facilities are necessary
to promote public safety and welfare and are therefore not an undue constraint on housing
production.

 C.      Market Constraints
Market constraints include the cost of land, cost of construction, and availability of financing
within a community. These market constraints can result in housing that is not affordable to low
and moderate income households or may render residential construction economically
infeasible. Knowledge of non-governmental constraints can assist a jurisdiction in developing
and implementing responsive housing programs.
California’s housing market peaked in the summer of 2005 when a dramatic increase in the
State’s housing supply was coupled with low interest rates. The period between 2006 and
2010, however, reflects a time of significant change as the lending market collapsed and home
prices saw significant decreases, resulting in the 2008 economic recession.          Double-digit
decreases in median sale prices were recorded throughout the State until recently. As such,
housing production in the last few years has been limited while the need for affordable housing
increased along with high unemployment rates and foreclosure rates.
1.       Availability and Cost of Financing
The availability and cost of financing affects both the developer’s ability to construct housing
and the consumer’s ability to purchase or improve a home.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race/ethnicity of
the applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases and improvements,
whether financed at market rate or with government assistance.
The disposition of loan applications submitted to financial institutions for home purchase and
home improvement loans within Poway is shown in Table 3-7. Included is the number of loans
that are approved and denied based on type of loan. The status of other loans indicates loan
applications that were neither approved nor denied, but were incomplete or were withdrawn by
the applicant.
Home Purchase Loans
In 2009, 1,970 Poway households applied for a new loan. These included Federal Housing
Authority (FHA) or Veterans Administration (VA) purchase loans, Conventional Loans,
Refinance Loans or Loans for Home Improvement. Of this total, 212 were approved, 387 were
denied and 360 were either not accepted, deemed incomplete or withdrawn.
The economic recession of 2008 had a significant impact on the housing market over the last
several years. Even though record low interest rates on loans existed and home values
decreased significantly, other market constraints such as loan requirements and income
instability have had an impact on attracting more home buyers into a home purchasing market,
adding another significant constraint to the purchase of homes for those needing affordable
housing.

2.      Development Costs
Development costs are key factors in determining housing affordability. Development costs
include the price of raw land, improvements, labor, and construction.
Land Costs
A sample review (Table 3-8) of property listings for land in Poway indicates that few unimproved
residential lots are available for purchase. Properties with the lowest values in Poway are
typically larger lots in outlying areas with no urban services and low physical capability for
residential development. Property with the highest values in Poway are typically those that are
"ready to build" with urban services and/or zoning entitlements. The sample listings in Table 3-8
are all single-family lots that may not be ready-to-build. The average per acre price of these
properties is $144,132 in January 2013.

Labor Costs
Labor Code Section 1720, which applies prevailing wage rates to public works of over $1,000,
defines public works to mean construction, alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work
done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds. For example, public
transfer of an asset for less than fair market value, such as a land write-down, would be
construed to be paid for in part out of public funds and trigger prevailing wage requirements.
While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages varies based on the skill level of the
occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case of
affordable housing projects, prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the number
of affordable units that can be achieved with public subsidies. The following types of projects
are not required to pay prevailing wages:
       Residential projects financed through issuance of bonds that receive an allocation
        through the State; or
       Single-family projects financed through issuance of qualified mortgage revenue bonds or
        mortgage credit certificates.
Construction Costs
Construction factors such as type of construction, custom versus tract development, materials,
site conditions, finishing details, amenities, square footage, and structural configuration, can
increase the cost of housing. The International Code Council (ICC) provides estimates for the
average cost of labor and materials for typical Type V wood frame housing. Estimates are
based on “good” quality construction, providing for materials and fixtures well above the
minimum required by State and local building codes. According to the ICC’s local chapter
estimates, the average per square foot cost for good quality housing is approximately $200-
$250 for single-family housing and $175-$200 for multi-family housing.
A reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials can result in lower sales prices and
rental rates. The increased use of prefabricated factory-built or manufactured housing, which is
permitted in all residential districts in the City (consistent with California law), may provide for
lower-priced housing by reducing construction and labor costs.
Although construction costs are a significant portion of the overall development cost, the City
can do little to mitigate its impact. Because construction costs in Poway are similar to those in
the area, the cost of construction is not considered a major constraint to housing production.

 Chapter 4
 Housing Resources
This Chapter summarizes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing in Poway. The analysis includes an evaluation of the adequacy of the
City’s land inventory to accommodate Poway’s regional housing needs goals for the 2013-2020
housing cycle. Financial resources available to support housing activities and the administrative
resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs are also analyzed in
this Chapter.
A.       Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
Future housing need refers to the share of the regional housing need that has been allocated to
Poway.      The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) assigns a
numeric regional housing goal to the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). State
law requires that individual communities play an active role in ensuring that enough housing is
available to meet expected population growth in San Diego County. Approximately every eight
years, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) is authorized to set forth specific
goals for the amount of new housing that should be produced in each member jurisdiction
over a specified time period, in this case 2013-2020. SANDAG is then mandated to allocate the
housing goal to city and county jurisdictions in the region. In allocating the region’s future housing
needs to jurisdictions, SANDAG is required to take the following factors into consideration pursuant
to Section 65584 of the State Government Code:
         •      Market demand for housing;
         •      Employment opportunities;
         •      Availability of suitable sites and public facilities;
         •      Commuting patterns;
         •      Type and tenure of housing;
         •      Loss of units in assisted housing developments;
         •      Over-concentration of lower income households; and
         •      Geological and topographical constraints.
The new Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) for the SANDAG region was adopted in
October 2011. This RHNA covers an 11-year planning period (January 2010 through December
2020). The major goal of the RHNA is to assure a fair distribution of housing among cities and
counties within the San Diego region, so that every community provides an opportunity for a mix of
housing for all economic segments. The housing allocation targets are not building requirements,
but goals for each community to accommodate through appropriate planning policies and land use
regulations. Allocation targets are intended to assure that adequate sites and zoning are made
available to address anticipated housing demand during the planning period. Overall, the region
needs to plan for an additional 161,980 units for the 2013-2020 cycle. This number was
adopted by SANDAG in conjunction with the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) in 2011. The
allocation is based on the maximum number of affordable housing units/opportunities each
jurisdiction can provide given the financial resources and regulatory measures available during
the housing element cycle. The City of Poway’s share of regional future housing needs is a total of
1,253 new units representing 0.8 percent of the total regional housing need. The 1,253 units
allocated to Poway must be planned for units affordable to all income levels. This allocation is

distributed into four (4) income categories as shown (Table 4-1). The RHNA includes a fair share
adjustment which allocates future (construction) need by each income category in a way that
meets the State mandate to reduce the over-concentration of lower income households in one
community. The City is not required to build these units, but must show it has sites with
adequate zoning and development standards that could accommodate the housing units during
the current cycle.

1.    Credits towards the RHNA
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2010, as the baseline for growth projections for the Housing
Element planning period of 2013-2020, jurisdictions may count the number of new units built or
issued certificates of occupancy since January 1, 2010, toward their RHNA. According to City of
Poway’s Building Division data, 162 building permits for new residential housing units (including 52
acquisition/rehabilitation units) were issued since January 1, 2010 as follows:
       2010: 90 dwelling units [77 – Brighton Place (31 Very Low and 46 Low); [13 Above
        Moderate]
       2011: 10 dwelling units [10 Above Moderate]

The New Construction Credits in the above Table 4-2 include the construction of two affordable
housing developments. Brighton Place was newly constructed in 2010 and included a total of 77
affordable housing units (31 Very Low Income and 46 Low Income). Orange Gardens, which was
previously a market-rate apartment development, was recently converted to a 52 unit affordable
housing development (26 Very Low Income and 26 Low Income) through an
acquisition/rehabilitation program and is eligible for site credits through the State’s Adequate Site
Program Alternative.
Over the last several years, affordable housing projects in Poway that have been built include
Parkview Terrace, Brookview Village, Hillside Village, Los Arcos Senior Housing and Solara.
Recently built projects include Orange Gardens and Brighton Place. These two developments
have similar densities to those projects built in previous years. Many of these developments were
approved with the Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ), which originally allowed up to 25
dwelling units per acre. The densities of the projects described above are listed in Table 4-3
below.

2.    Residential Sites Inventory
Pursuant to State law, the City must show that it has adequate sites with proper zoning and
development standards that could accommodate Poway’s regional housing goal identified in
Table 4-1. The new Residential Sites Inventory (Table 4-4) table is an important component of
the Housing Element Update and lists sites for Very Low Income (includes Extremely Low
Income), Low Income and Moderate Income households. The Residential Sites Inventory for
Above Moderate Income properties is included as Table 1 in Appendix A. In preparing the
inventory, the City completed a thorough analysis of properties in the City. This included
conducting a review of vacant and underutilized properties within the City using the City’s
Geographic Information System (GIS), County Assessor’s parcel data, aerial photos, and field
surveys. The focus of the land inventory was on properties that have the following characteristics:
       Vacant residentially zoned sites;
       Vacant non-residentially zoned sites that allow residential uses;
       Underutilized residentially zoned sites, which may be developed at a higher density; and
       Non-residentially zoned sites that could be redeveloped or rezoned for residential use.
The focus of the land inventory was targeted on available vacant and underutilized properties
zoned residential, mixed use, or commercial that allows residential development, and could
accommodate additional housing densities to meet the City’s RHNA. A goal for the identification of
Very Low, Low and Moderate Income households was to identify publicly-owned properties as a
priority and minimize the number of privately-owned properties in the new Residential Sites
Inventory. All of the properties were evaluated in accordance with State law (Government Code
Section 65583) and the Adequate Sites Program. The City’s analysis for the sites identified for
Very Low, Low and Moderate Income households identified those sites with the greatest potential
for multi-family housing development. The sites included in the new Residential Sites Inventory
exhibited one or more of the following characteristics on each property:
       Owned by the City of Poway or the Poway Housing Authority;
       Adequately sized to accommodate multi-family housing (including parcels that could be
        combined);
       Limited amount of physical environmental constraints, including lands with sensitive habitat,
        wetlands, floodplains, steep topography, and archeological resources;
       Accessible to and from the local circulation system and neighborhood community services;
       Accessible to water and wastewater lines and other public infrastructure;
       Located adjacent to properties with similar densities and could maintain land use
        compatibility; and
       Zoned for or allows residential development.
The majority of remaining vacant residential land in the City is within the rural areas and is not
appropriate for the higher densities required for moderate, low, or very low income housing units.
These properties have significant development constraints such as steep topography, are located
within the Habitat Mitigation Area of the PSHCP, have poor access, may not be served by City
water as currently planned, are not served by City sewer, and are not located in proximity to
transit service or neighborhood commercial services. Many of these properties are also subject
to Proposition FF, which would require a vote by the residents of Poway for any density increases
in the Rural Residential zones and Open Space zones, or to add residential units in the Business
Park (South Poway Specific Plan). Due to these constraints, there is limited vacant land in the
City suitable for the development of multi-family housing.

                                                                    4 ▪ Housing Resources
The new Residential Sites Inventory for Very Low, Low and Moderate Income households
identifies the individual properties and includes other parcel information for each property. Of the
28 parcels identified in the inventory, ten (10) of the properties were included in the previous
Housing Element Update cycle. Five of those ten are privately-owned and are split among three
ownerships. The inventory includes 18 new properties, of which 12 parcels are privately owned;
however, the 12 parcels are split among only five ownerships. All of the sites in the inventory are
proposed to have an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) applied on them. Six (6) of the
sites already have an AHOZ. Table 4-4 shows the Assessor’s Parcel Number, zoning, owner
and/or current use, address or location, anticipated number of dwelling units per acre, and total
unit capacity per income category for each parcel. The “Net Acreage” field in Table 4-4 refers to
the amount of land on the parcel which does not have physical constraints that prevent
development from occurring. The physical land constraints include presence within the floodway,
presence of easements and/or right-of-ways, or steep slopes. The “Parcel” field in Table 4-4
refers to the number representing each individual parcel in Figures 4-1 through 4-7.
The new Residential Sites Inventory list for Above Moderate Income households is identified in
Table 1 of Appendix A. This list identifies mainly vacant land within a variety of residentially-
zoned areas including Rural Residential-A (RR-A), Rural Residential-B (RR-B), Rural Residential-C
(RR-C), Residential Single Family-1 (RS-1), Residential Single Family-2 (RS-2), Residential Single
Family-3 (RS-3), Residential Single Family-4 (RS-4) and Residential Single Family-7 (RS-7).
There are some properties on the list that are zoned Planned Community (PC), Planned
Residential Development (PRD), Residential Condominium (RC) and Open Space – 1 Dwelling
Unit (OS-1DU). These zoning districts all allow residential uses. Overall this inventory has the
capacity to accommodate the 618 Above Moderate Income units required by the RHNA.

3.    Realistic Density Calculation
Sites for Very Low, Low and Moderate Income Housing
All of the properties identified in Table 4-4 allow residential development. The assessment of
each of the sites contained later in this section is a response to the State requirements for site
analysis. Because the City of Poway and the Poway Housing Authority control several of the sites
in the Table, it is expected that the maximum feasible unit yields will be met. As is shown in the
site inventory analysis later in this section, the City can meet the Housing Element requirements
with the current site inventory as proposed.
The Housing Element Update identifies a maximum density of 30 dwelling units per acre for some
of the very low, low and moderate income sites. The City will utilize the site plan evaluation
completed for the Solara affordable housing project, built in 2007, as a realistic density calculation
tool, which is representative of the other properties in the inventory. The Solara site is irregular in
shape, but has good access and did not require additional dedications for public improvements.
Solara was constructed at a net density of 22.4 dwelling units per acre, with a height limit of 35 feet
within 2 stories, lot coverage of 50%, reduced setbacks, and a reduced parking ratio of 1.6 spaces
per unit.
Similar concept designs were prepared in past years on other affordable housing sites identified in
the previous Housing Element utilizing modified development standards similar to Solara.
Placement of AHOZs on the sites will allow a maximum density of 30 units per acre, which will
allow the potential of reduced development standards to achieve that density.
In addition, the City will continue to evaluate establishing standards for residential development in
the MU, TC, and CO zones. The City will amend the zoning ordinance to establish development
standards for mixed use projects in each of these zones to facilitate the conversion of
commercial sites to commercial and residential (see Program 16 in Chapter 6).
The sites listed in Table 4-4 represent a realistic unit yield for the reasons summarized below:
       The majority of the sites identified are infill properties with access to existing public
        infrastructure (streets, sewer, water, etc.). The others are vacant and may need sewer
        and water service line extensions.
       While individual environmental review will be conducted prior to development of each site,
        some of the sites listed have environmental constraints that would limit the unit yield.
       As an added incentive, the AHOZ densities of up to 30 dwelling units per acre would be
        allowed on the properties that allow mixed use development. It is highly likely that the
        highest economic potential will be residential development as part of a mixed use
        development given the scarcity of vacant land in Poway as well as the San Diego region
        that would support multi-family development.
Sites for Above Moderate Income Housing
Consistent with HCD Guidelines, methodology for determining realistic capacity on each identified
May 2013                                                        Housing Element Update | Page 4-15

                                                                                     City of Poway
                                                                      4 ▪ Housing Resources
site must account for land use controls and site improvements. The Residential Sites Inventory
for Above Moderate Income, Table 1 in Appendix A, utilizes a conservative estimate to
demonstrate realistic capacity for development in residential zones. This estimate is based on
existing patterns of development in residential areas and was derived using analysis of densities
on properties in residential areas.
Most residential zone districts in Poway establish a maximum range of allowable density. For
example, density within the R-4 zone has a maximum of four (4) dwelling units per acre. For
purposes of calculating the realistic capacity of sites in Table 1 of Appendix A, Residential Sites
Inventory for Above Moderate Income, the maximum allowable density was used in these districts
but site constraints were also considered.
4.   Site Analysis
        Site 1 (Park and Ride)
        This site is zoned Residential Single Family (RS-7). This site is vacant and owned by the
        City of Poway. This site was identified for affordable housing in the previous Housing
        Element. The site is located adjacent to other residential neighborhoods.
                    Environmental Constraints: None
                    Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity:         The site is vacant, but is
                     considered an infill property that is surrounded by residential development.
                     Water and sewer will be extended at the time of construction.
                    Method used to calculate Realistic Capacity: The existing RS-7 zone allows for
                     up to 8 dwelling units per acre. While the site is over 6 acres in size, 2 net
                     acres was used to calculate the unit yield due to the irregular shape of the
                     parcel and the fact that a portion of the property is located within City right-of-
                     way. An AHOZ was placed on the site in 2012, which allows for up to 30
                     dwelling units per acre. This site is targeted for 16 Moderate Income affordable
                     housing dwelling units.
        Site 2 (Twin Peaks)
        This site is zoned Residential Single Family (RS-4). This site was identified for affordable
        housing in the previous Housing Element. This site is vacant and is owned by the Poway
        Housing Authority.
                    Environmental Constraints: Approximately 0.38 acres of the 2.15 acre site is
                     located within a flood plain. As a result, approximately 1.8 acres is developable.
                     The site is a current brownfield site and has an active remediation process
                     associated with it.
                    Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity: The site is an infill property that
                     is surrounded by development. Water and sewer will be extended at the time
                     of construction.
                    Method used to calculate Realistic Capacity: It is anticipated that this site
                     would be developed with moderate income housing at a density of 12-20
                     dwelling units per acre which is comparable to the City’s density for
May 2013                                                         Housing Element Update | Page 4-16

                                                                                  City of Poway
                                                                   4 ▪ Housing Resources
                   townhome/condominium developments that have been built in the City. A net
                   acreage of 1.8 acres, which excludes the area in the flood plain, was used to
                   calculate the density. An AHOZ was placed on the site in 2012. This site is
                   targeted for 22 Moderate Income affordable housing dwelling units.
      Site 3 (Monte Vista)
      This site is zoned Commercial office (CO). This site was identified for affordable housing in
      the previous Housing Element. This vacant site is owned by the Poway Housing Authority.
      Predevelopment planning of this site had occurred and an Exclusive Negotiating
      Agreement (ENA) had been completed, but since expired.
                  Environmental Constraints: None
                  Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity: The site is an infill property that is
                   surrounded by office, hospital and residential uses. Water and sewer will be
                   extended at the time of construction.
                  Method used to calculate Realistic Capacity: The capacity assumptions take
                   into account the development standards that have been approved on
                   previously built affordable housing projects within the City.        As discussed
                   earlier in this section under Realistic Density Calculation, a maximum density
                   of 30 dwelling units could be met with a portion of the project at 3 stories or 35
                   feet in height and with underground parking. A targeted density range of 20-30
                   units per acre is proposed for this site. An AHOZ was placed on the site in
                   2012. This site is targeted for 41 Low Income affordable housing dwelling units.
      Sites 4 and 5 (Community Business/Mixed Use South - Town Center Planning
      Area)
      These parcels are located within the Town Center Planning Area (Figure 4-7). Site 4 is
      zoned Community Business (CB) and contains an existing Bowling Alley. Site 5 is zoned
      Mixed Use and contains an existing Recreational Vehicle storage and a car rental business.
      These sites were identified for affordable housing in the previous Housing Element. Both
      properties are privately owned. Both properties are considered underutilized with the
      current land uses on them. Within the past several years, Poway has experienced
      significant interest from development teams interested in acquiring properties that allow
      mixed use development for the purpose of building multi-family housing.
      The opportunity for mixed use development in the commercial areas of Poway was
      established in the mid 1990’s in response to economic studies that showed the amount of
      commercially zoned land on Poway Road exceeds the retail demand of the local
      population. There is limited infill retail potential along Poway Road due to small size lots,
      irregular parcel configurations and ingress/egress issues. Because of these geographic
      constraints these properties do not yield enough contiguous developable property to meet
      the demands of many types of commercial developments. The demand to re-develop
      underutilized commercial properties with multi-family residential has increased significantly
      due to the lack of residential land in the region.
      Site 4, which is zoned Community Business, allows mixed use development including
      residential uses. The adjacent Site 5 is zoned Mixed Use and also allows for residential
      uses. Both sites are located immediately to the west of other sites discussed below.

          Environmental Constraints: None. Both properties are currently developed
           and are considered infill properties appropriate for conversion to residential
           uses.
          Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity: Both sites are infill properties
           surrounded by developed parcels. Water and sewer is currently provided to
           both sites and both have good access off of a major arterial, Poway Road.
          Method used to calculate Realistic Capacity: The capacity assumptions for
           these properties take into account the development standards that have been
           approved on previously built affordable housing projects within the City. As
           part of this Housing Element Update, these sites are proposed for
           AHOZs to be applied to allow densities of up to 30 dwelling units per acre.
           Site 4 is targeted for 49 Moderate Income units and Site 5 is targeted for 28
           Moderate Income dwelling units.

      Site 6 (Mixed Use South/Town Center Planning Area)
      This site is zoned Mixed Use (MU), which allows for residential uses. This site was
      identified for affordable housing in the previous Housing Element. This vacant site is
      owned by the Poway Housing Authority. It is also located within the Town Center
      Planning Area.
                 Environmental Constraints:     None. While currently vacant, the property was
                  previously developed.
                 Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity: This property is an infill parcel
                  and is surrounded by developed parcels. Water and sewer is currently provided
                  to both sites and both have good access off of a major arterial, Poway Road.
                 Method used to calculate Realistic Capacity: The capacity assumptions take into
                  account the development standards that have been approved on previously built
                  affordable housing projects within the City. An AHOZ was placed on the site in
                  2012 allowing up to a maximum of 30 dwelling units per acre. A targeted
                  density range of 20-30 units per acre is proposed for this site.       This site is
                  targeted for 40 Low Income affordable housing dwelling units.
      Sites 7, 8, and 9 (Mixed Use North)
      These properties are all zoned Mixed Use (MU), which allows for residential uses. These
      sites were identified for affordable housing in the previous Housing Element. All three of
      these properties are also privately owned. Site 7 contains an existing wood lot and
      firewood sales are conducted from the site. Sites 8 and 9 are under the same ownership
      and are occupied by existing equipment and RV rental businesses.
                 Environmental Constraints: None
                 Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity: All of the sites are considered infill
                  properties that are surrounded by commercial and residential development.
                  Water and sewer will be extended at the time of construction.

                  applied to allow densities of up to 30 dwelling units per acre. Site 7 is targeted
                  for 10 Moderate Income units. Site 8 is targeted for 30 Moderate Income units.
                  Site 9 is targeted for 21 Moderate Income dwelling units.
      Site 10 (County Yard)
      This site is zoned Community Business (CB) which allows mixed use developments with
      residential uses. This site is owned by the Poway Housing Authority and was formerly
      used as a public bus yard. It is currently being used as a commercial business and
      storage yard. The site is located adjacent to single family homes, office uses, a

                   into account the development standards that have been approved on
                   previously built affordable housing projects within the City. An AHOZ was
                   placed on the site in 2012 allowing up to a maximum of 30 dwelling units per
                   acre. A targeted density range of 24-30 units per acre is proposed for this site.
                   This site is targeted for 54 Very Low Income affordable housing units.
      Site 11 (Mixed Use North-Tarascan)
      This site is zoned Mixed Use (MU), which allows for residential uses. This site is owned by
      City of Poway and currently used as an overflow parking lot for the Poway Community
      Park. It is located adjacent to single family homes, fast food restaurants, and an
      equipment rental business.

                   Housing Element Update, this site is proposed for an AHOZ to be applied
                   to allow densities of up to a maximum of 30 dwelling units per acre. A targeted
                   density range of 22-30 units per acre is proposed for this site. This site is
                   targeted for 34 Very Low Income affordable housing units.
      Sites 12-16 (Mixed Use South)
      All of these sites, except for Site 16, are zoned Mixed Use (MU), which allows for
      residential uses. Site 16 is zoned Community Business (CB), which also allows for mixed
      use, including residential uses. These properties are within the Town Center Plan area.
      Site 12, 13, 14, and 15, are either owned by the City of Poway or the Poway Housing
      Authority, while site 16 is privately owned. Site 12 is currently used as a storage facility,
      while sites 13, 14, and 15 are occupied by office and other professional uses. Site 16 is
      currently used as an automotive repair center. Site 12 is approximately 1.8 acres. Site
      13 is approximately 0.3 acres.          Site 14 is approximately 0.3 acres.          Site 15 is
      approximately 0.3 acres. Site 16 is approximately 0.7 acres.

                  account the development standards that have been approved on previously
                  built affordable housing projects within the City. An AHOZ was placed on Site
                  14 in 2012 allowing up to 30 dwelling units per acre. As part of this Housing
                  Element Update, all of the other sites are proposed for an AHOZ to be
                  applied to allow densities of up to a maximum of 30 dwelling units per acre. A
                  targeted density range of 20-30 units per acre is proposed for Site 12. Site 12 is
                  targeted for 40 Very Low Income units. Site 13 is targeted for 7 Very Low
                  Income units. Site 14 is targeted for 4 Low Income units. Site 15 is targeted for
                  9 Very Low Income units. Site 16 is targeted for 10 Moderate Income affordable
                  housing units.
                 It is anticipated that these parcels will be developed as a mixed use project. Any
                  project approved for these sites will be required to comply with the regulations of
                  the City’s Municipal Code and California Government Code Section 65583.2(h)
                  and 65583.2(i). The project will accommodate the housing need for very low,
                  low and moderate income households. The site, with the application of the
                  AHOZ, will permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily residential uses. To
                  comply with State law, these sites require a minimum density of 20 dwelling
                  units per acre and a minimum of 16 units per site. The AHOZ will permit
                  densities up to 30 units per acre. Sites 13, 14 and 15 will be combined to total
                  20 affordable units (16 very low income and 4 low income) to ensure compliance
                  with State law. At least 50 percent of the very low and low-income housing need
                  shall be accommodated on sites designated for residential use and for which
                  nonresidential uses or mixed-uses are not permitted
      Sites 17-24 (Oak Knoll)
      All of these sites are zoned Residential Single Family (RS-7), which allows for densities of
      up to 8 dwelling units per acre. The parcels range from approximately 0.5 net acres to 1.5
      net acres in size. All of the sites are privately owned by one owner.        Sites 17, 18, 19,
      20, and 21 are vacant and remain undeveloped, while sites 22, 23, and 24 are occupied by
      single family homes. The sites are adjacent to commercial uses and residential uses
      including single family homes, apartments, and vacant parcels.
                 Environmental Constraints: Site 18 has a small area of riparian habitat upon it,
                  while Site 20 is on a hill with elevations ranging from 462 to 514 feet. A portion
                  of Site 21 is within the 100 year floodplain. To the north of Site 21 is a known
                  archaeological site. A portion of Site 20 contains archaeological resources.
                 Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity: As stated above, Sites 17, 18, 19,
                  20, and 21 are vacant and remain undeveloped, while sites 22, 23, and 24 are
                  occupied by single family homes. The undeveloped sites are not currently
                  served by water or sewer, while the developed sites are. All of the sites have
                  access off of Oak Knoll Road.

                  units per acre to maintain land use compatibility with surrounding densities and
                  the underlying zoning of RS-7. All of the sites are proposed for Moderate
                  Income dwelling units and will have a range of 4 to 12 units each. A total of 77
                  Moderate Income units are proposed on a total of approximately 9.25 acres.
      Site 25 (Espola at Twin Peaks)
      This site is zoned Residential Single Family (RS-4). The site is approximately 4.85 acres,
      however due to an existing floodway/floodplain on the southern portions of the site,
      approximately 2.2 acres are developable. This site is privately owned and is currently
      developed as a soccer park. It is located adjacent to a church, gas station, and single
      family homes.
                 Environmental Constraints: Slightly more than half of the property is located
                  within the 100 year floodway, as a result approximately 2.2 acres is
                  developable.
                 Existing and Planned Infrastructure Capacity: The site is a developed property
                  that is surrounded by institutional, commercial and residential development.
                  The site is served by water and sewer and has its access off of Espola Road.
                 Method used to calculate Realistic Capacity: The capacity assumptions take
                  into account the development standards that have been approved on
                  previously built affordable housing projects within the City. As part of this
                  Housing Element Update, this site is proposed for an AHOZ to be applied
                  to allow densities of up to 30 dwelling units per acre. The site is adjacent to
                  another site (Site 2) identified for Moderate Income affordable housing. As the
                  site has an underlying zoning category of RS-4, the Site is targeted for 8-12
                  dwelling units per acre to maintain land use compatibility with the surrounding
                  neighborhood. This site is targeted for 10 Moderate Income affordable housing
                  units.
      Site 26 (Midland at Hilleary)
      This site is zoned Commercial Office (CO), which allows mixed use development including
      residential uses. The site is 1.0 acre in size. This site is privately owned and is currently
      developed with office uses. It is located adjacent to retail uses, single family and multi-
      family homes. The site is considered underutilized for its current land use.
                 Environmental Constraints: None
                 Existing and Planning Infrastructure Capacity: The site is a developed property
                  surrounded by commercial development, single-family and multi-family
                  residential uses. The site is served by water and sewer and has its access off

                     to allow densities of up to 30 dwelling units per acre. As the site has an
                     underlying zoning category of CO, the site is targeted for 8-12 dwelling units per
                     acre to maintain land use compatibility due to other residential uses adjacent to
                     it. This site is targeted for 9 Moderate Income affordable housing units.
         Site 27 (Orange Gardens)
         This site is zoned Residential Apartments (RA). As part of the site inventory, this existing
         project, which contained 55 market-rate apartments, was recently converted to 52
         affordable housing units (26 very low Income and 26 Low Income) through an
         acquisition/rehabilitation program and is eligible for site credits through the Adequate Sites
         Program Alternative pursuant to Government Code Section 65583.1.
         Site 28 (Brighton Place)
         This site is zoned Residential Apartments (RA) and includes two parcels. Both parcels on
         the site total approximately 4.0 acres. This site was included in the previous Housing
         Element, however, was not built during the previous RHNA cycle. As part of the site
         inventory, this project was newly constructed in 2010. The development includes a total of
         77 affordable housing dwelling units, which includes 31 Very Low Income units and 46
         Low Income units and is eligible for site credits in the new RHNA.
Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ)
As indicated above, an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) will be placed on the properties
in the site inventory to ensure they will develop at the densities identified. An AHOZ for the Low
Income category was previously established in the Land Use Element of the General Plan. As part
of the previous Housing Element implementation in Program 15, the General Plan and Zoning
Code were amended in 2012 to create an AHOZ for the Moderate Income category and to modify
the provisions in the Low Income category. This included providing flexible development standards
that will allow the densities noted in Table 4-4 of this chapter. Also, Program 17 in the previous
Housing Element resulted in an amendment to the General Plan designation and zoning on some
publicly-owned sites in 2012. A total of six (6) properties now include an AHOZ. An AHOZ may
be applied to property within any land use category, including non-residential categories, but not
including the Open Space or Rural Residential categories.
The AHOZ for the Moderate Income category is designed to function much like a density bonus
through a specific plan. Typically, a specific plan is processed concurrently with all other land use
entitlements, so there is no additional processing time. The original amendment to the General
Plan and Zoning Code removed the requirement for a specific plan for the Low and Very Low
Income category. In order to ensure both the initial and continued affordability of housing
constructed under the AHOZs, deed restrictions are required which guarantees that resale prices
or rents will not exceed affordable levels and that future residents will have appropriate incomes to
correspond with the price or rent restrictions.
Application of the AHOZ on existing and future sites will be implemented pursuant to the
regulations of the City’s Municipal Code and California Government Code Section 65583.2(h) and
65593.2(i). The City’s General Plan and Municipal Code will be amended to ensure it complies
with State Law. Projects using the AHOZ will accommodate 100 percent of the housing need
identified for the sites in the Residential Sites Inventory. These sites will also permit owner-
occupied and rental multifamily residential uses by right. To comply with State law, these sites
require a minimum density of 20 dwelling units per acre and a minimum of 16 units per site. The
placement of an AHOZ on these sites will allow a density of up to 30 dwelling units per acre. At
least 50 percent of the very low and low-income housing need shall be accommodated on sites

                                                                   4 ▪ Housing Resources
designated for residential use and for which nonresidential uses or mixed-uses are not permitted.
Mixed Use
Another technique for increasing the affordability of housing is to allow residential units
in addition to commercial development on property zoned commercial. In Poway, there is a Mixed
Use District comprising approximately 17 acres and located on Poway Road. Sites 5, 6, 7, 8, and
9 and 12-16 in Table 4-4 are zoned Mixed Use. In addition to the Mixed Use District, “mixed use
development” is allowed with a conditional use permit in the City’s Commercial Office, Community
Business, Town Center and Commercial General Districts. All existing commercially zoned
property is served by necessary and adequate public facilities and services. Mixed use
development can work very well because it makes commercial services more easily accessible to
the residents and provides a core of customers for the businesses. It can be particularly
appropriate for affordable housing because the unit yield associated with the housing is more
compatible with commercial areas than with many other land uses. In addition, it can reduce the
residents’ reliance on automobiles, which can reduce living costs.
The properties that allow mixed use development are located on Poway Road in the center of the
City. They are located within or adjacent to the City’s Town Center Planning Area that is the
subject of a future master planning effort intended to stimulate redevelopment of this area as
discussed above. It is anticipated that parcels on the south side of Poway Road (Sites 12-16) will
be developed as a mixed use project. Any project approved for these sites will be required to
comply with the regulations of the City’s Municipal Code and comply with California Government
Code Section 65583.2(h) and 65583.2(i). For the properties that are zoned Mixed Use, it was
assumed that 75 percent of the parcel would develop as residential and 25 percent as commercial.
However, the actual ratio will be determined on a case-by-case basis. A retail/commercial
component exceeding 20 to 25 percent of the building square footage or lot area is generally
considered not supportable due to the lack of remaining area for developing housing. Therefore, a
ratio of 75 percent residential,      coupled with 25 percent retail/commercial, is the generally
accepted threshold for Mixed Use development in the San Diego region but would not be required.
This will require additional analysis and may be determined on a case-by-case basis for individual
developments. A zoning ordinance amendment will be processed to include development
standards for the mixed use zone and for mixed use development (see Program 16 in Chapter 6).

Sites for Above-Moderate Income Housing
The above-moderate income remaining RHNA needs will all be accommodated by vacant lower-
density single-family sites. The assumed density on each of these sites is at the lower end of
the allowable density range for each zone. The density factor for the RR zones shows the
permitted densities that were calculated by averaging the RR-A, RR- B and RR-C zones density
factor for the steepness of the slopes (0.5 and 0.25 respectively) and the presence of City
water on any given lot.
4.       Adequacy of Sites to Meet Regional Fair Share Allocation
The sites listed in Table 4-4 do not have the capacity to meet the RHNA for very low, low, and
moderate income households under existing conditions. These sites will have the capacity to
meet the regional housing goal for very low, low, and moderate income households with
implementation of the Programs in Chapter 6. The sites in Table 4-4 have the capacity to meet
the regional housing goal for above-moderate income households.
5.     Suitability of Sites and Availability of Infrastructure
All of the sites listed in Table 4-4 can be provided with water, sewer, drainage, and other facilities
and services between 2013 and 2020 (See Chapter 3.0, Constraints) and adequate water supply,
water filtration capacity, and sewer treatment capacity exists to serve the RHNA through 2020.
Currently, City services exist on or can be extended to each site. Public infrastructure
improvements required of new developments, impact fees, and planned city improvements of
facilities helps ensure that services and facilities are available to both current and future
residents. Parks, schools, emergency services facilities, and other public facilities are also
extended in this manner.
C.     Financial Resources
The City of Poway has access to several federal and local resources to achieve its housing and
community development goals. Specific funding sources will be utilized based on the eligibility and
requirements of each project or program.
As discussed in the Executive Summary of this document, the State Legislature took action to
eliminate California redevelopment agencies in June 2011. The City of Poway anticipated the
State’s intent to eliminate redevelopment agencies and formed the Poway Housing Authority in
2011. In 2012, the City designated the Poway Housing Authority as successor agency to the
former Poway Redevelopment Agency and the recipient of the housing assets and liabilities of the
former redevelopment agency. Redevelopment monies were one of the three main funding
sources used to make affordable developments viable statewide. The others are State bond funds
and Federal funds administered through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
City cannot directly apply for Federal housing funds as they are administered through the County
of San Diego.
Unfortunately, there were no provisions when redevelopment was eliminated to provide ongoing
funding for affordable housing. It is anticipated that new avenues for funding economic
development and affordable housing will be created and tested in the coming years, but
because of the uncertainty of available funds at this time, a conservative approach to affordable
housing programs is recommended.

                                                                     4 ▪ Housing Resources
1.    Section 8 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance
The Housing Choice Voucher Program is funded by HUD and administered by the County of San
Diego. According to the County, 167 households in Poway continued to receive Section 8
assistance through the end of 2012. Among these voucher recipients, 151 were small families and
16 were large families. These numbers include 79 elderly individuals. In addition to the County
program, Poway Villas, a Project-Based Section 8 program, has 59 households that have Section
8 assistance.
2.    Redevelopment Agency Set-Aside Funds
As discussed above, the Poway Redevelopment Agency was eliminated in 2011. Prior to
elimination of redevelopment agencies, State law required the City of Poway to set aside a
minimum of 20 percent of all tax increment revenue for Low and Moderate affordable housing.
The set-aside of Lower and Moderate Income Housing Fund was used for activities that increase,
improve or preserve the supply of affordable housing. Redevelopment law required that all new or
substantially rehabilitated housing units developed or otherwise assisted with the agency’s set
aside funds must remain affordable to the targeted income group for at least 55 years for rental
and 45 years for ownership housing. Funds from redevelopment were the primary funding source
for the City to assist in the development of affordable housing. Until new funding resources are
identified, availability of funding for new affordable housing projects is unknown.
3.    Inclusionary Housing In-Lieu Fund
The City of Poway has an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance which requires that 15 percent of all
new dwelling units constructed must be affordable to very low income households for multi-family
construction, and low income households for single-family construction. Whereas multi-family
developments must provide the Inclusionary units as part of each individual development,
developers of single-family units may elect to pay an “in-lieu” fee to meet the 15 percent
requirement. The In-Lieu Fee collected from single-family developments by the City was reduced
in 2009. The City has used these funds for the Supporting Home Ownership in Poway (SHOP)
First Time Homebuyer Assistance Program. A total of approximately $618,698 remains in the
City’s Inclusionary Housing In-Lieu Fund balance as of January 2013.
D. Administrative Resources
In past years, several public and private sector organizations have been involved in housing and
community development activities in Poway. Organizations that have been involved include, the
North County Interfaith Council, Community Housing Works, San Diego Interfaith Housing
Foundation, Wakeland Housing and Development Corporation and Community Housing of North
County. These organizations are involved in the improvement of the housing stock, expansion
of affordable housing opportunities, preservation of existing affordable housing, and/or provision of
housing assistance to households in need. In Poway, the primary agency that administers
housing programs is now the Development Services Department, which serves as staff to the
Poway Housing Authority.

E.   Opportunities for Energy Conservation
1.   General Design Standards
There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing homes. New buildings,
by design, can easily incorporate energy efficient techniques into the construction. According
to the Department of Energy, the concept of energy efficiency in buildings is the building
envelope, which is everything that separates the interior of the building from the outdoor
environment: the doors, windows, walls, foundation, roof, and insulation. All the components of
the building envelope need to work together to keep a building warm in the winter and cool in the
summer.
Constructing new homes with energy-conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing
structures, will result in a reduction in monthly utility costs. There are many ways to determine
how energy efficient an existing building is and, if needed, what improvements can be made.
Examples of energy conservation opportunities include installation of insulation and/or
storm windows and doors, use of natural gas instead of electricity, installation, or retrofitting of
more efficient appliances and mechanical or solar energy systems, and building design and
orientation which incorporates energy conservation considerations.
The California Green Building Standards Code (Cal Green), Title 24 of the California
Administrative Code, effective in January 2011, establishes energy conservation standards that
must be applied to all new residential and commercial buildings. The regulations specify energy
saving design for walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment
and systems, gas cooling devices, conservation standards and the use of non-depleting energy
sources, such as solar energy or wind power. Compliance with the energy standards is achieved
by satisfying certain conservation requirements and an energy budget.
Many modern building design methods are used to reduce residential energy consumption and
are based on proven techniques. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
    1. Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out
        during the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven
        building techniques in this category include:
                   Location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to
                    minimize solar gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
                   Use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and
                    tiles that absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
                   Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat
                    exchange between the interior of a home and the exterior;
                   Location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take
                    advantage of natural air flow (particularly cool evening breezes);
                   Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window
                    openings during the summer but allow solar gain during the winter; and
                   Zone heating and cooling systems, which reduce heating and cooling in the

                                                                                   City of Poway
                                                                       4 ▪ Housing Resources
                    unused areas of a home.
    2. Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior
        temperature. Examples include:
                   North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling;
                   Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
                   Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and
                    evening breezes.
                   Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures.              Such
                    techniques include:
                       Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
                       Use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
                       Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
    3. In addition to natural techniques, a number of modern methods of energy conservation
        have been developed or advanced during the present century. These include:
                   Use of solar energy to heat water;
                   Use of radiant barriers on roofs to keep attics cool;
                   Use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity;
                   High efficiency coating on windows to repel summer heat and trap winter
                    warmth;
                   Weather-stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss;
                   Use of natural gas for dryers, stovetops and ranges;
                   Use of energy efficient home appliances; and
                   Use of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators to reduce hot water use.
 2.   California Building Code Standards for Energy Efficiency
The California Energy Code (CEC) (California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 6 is part of the
California Building Code (Title 24). It applies to all occupancies that applied for a building permit
on or after January 1, 2011, and remains in effect until the next edition is complete and adopted.
The CEC covers the following topics:
       Requirements for the manufacturing, construction, and installation of systems, equipment,
        and building components;
       Mandatory requirements for space-conditioning and service water- heating systems and
        equipment;
       Mandatory requirements for lighting systems and equipment for nonresidential, high-rise
        residential, and hotel/motel occupancies;

        Performance for prescriptive compliance approaches in non-residential, residential high-
         rise, and hotel/motel occupancies;
        Additions, alterations, and repairs in non-residential, residential high-rise, and
         hotel/motel occupancies;
        Mandatory features and devices in low-rise residential buildings;
        Performance and prescriptive compliance approaches for residential buildings; and
        Additions and alterations in existing low-rise residential buildings.
3.     State Energy Conservation Programs
The California Department of Community Services and Development is partnered with a
network of local community service agencies that assist low-income households to administer two
energy conservation programs for low income households. These are the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Energy Low-Income Weatherization Assistance
Program (DOE-LIWAP). LIHEAP provides financial assistance to low-income households to offset
the costs of heating and/or cooling their residences. DOE-LIWAP provides installation and
weatherization measures that increase the energy efficiency of residences occupied by low-income
persons.
4.     SDG&E Residential Energy Conservation Programs
SDGE/MAAC Weatherization Program
The Metropolitan Area Advisory Committee (MAAC) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E)
jointly facilitate a weatherization program for residences in the San Diego region. The City
Building Division refers homeowners and tenants to this program if their units lack heat or have
broken or single pane windows.
2010 California ENERGY STAR® New Homes Program
SDG&E administers the California ENERGY STAR® New Homes Program. This is a program
intended to encourage builders to construct single family and multi- family dwelling units that
use a minimum of 15 percent less energy than the standard design required by the 2010
California Energy Efficiency Standards. EPA also currently uses this same standard of using 15
percent less energy as the new ENERGY STAR® Homes baseline for California.
Residential Energy Standards Training
SDG&E offers seminars on technologies that result in greater energy efficiency and can reduce
the cost of complying with State energy standards. The training program is marketed to
architects, designers, builders, energy consultants, engineers, HVAC contractors, building
department inspectors, and plans examiners.
Lighting Turn-In Program
SDG&E’s Lighting Turn-In Program replaces resident’s incandescent bulbs with more energy-
efficient compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) for free, as funding is available. Residents can access
the program via community events that are held throughout SDG&E’s service area and

coordinated through an extensive network of community organizations and government agencies.
SDG&E also offers rebates for single-family and multi-family dwelling unit residents for certain
improvements in their units that lead to greater energy efficiency. These improvements include
the purchase and installation of energy efficient appliances and the replacement of old light bulbs
with Energy Star energy efficient light bulbs.
Sustainable Communities Program
This program promotes green building design practices in SDG&E’s service area and provides
incentives for qualified projects that greatly exceed the 2010 California Energy Efficiency
Standards and obtain LEED® certification. This program is voluntary and not required.
5.    Energy Efficient Development in Poway
An example of the City’s commitment to encouraging energy efficient development is the Solara
apartment development, which opened in 2009. This 56 unit complex is affordable to low and
very low income families. The project incorporates energy efficient and onsite renewable energy
infrastructure. Solar photovoltaic panels, producing a target of 100% of the project’s annual
electricity load, were installed. The project was one of the first in the State of California to
implement renewable energy systems at this level. The benefits include stable utility costs
over time with the resulting lower utility costs paid by residents providing the ability to set unit
rents at a higher level without increasing net housing costs. The design and construction of the
project incorporates all five of the traditional green building categories: site location, water
efficiency, energy and the atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality.

Chapter 5
Program Evaluation/Accomplishments
Government Code Section 65588(a) requires each jurisdiction to review its housing element
frequently to evaluate:
       The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, policies and programs in
        contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal;
       The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community’s housing
        goals and objectives; and
       The progress of the city, county or city and county in implementation of the housing
        element.
This section documents the City’s programs under the 2005-2010 Housing Element with respect
to the actions and objectives contained therein. This section describes the relative success of
the City’s efforts to implement the 2005-2010 programs, and contains recommendations for
program retention, revision, deletion or addition to address current and projected needs and
state requirements between 2010 and 2020.

                                           Program Evaluation/Accomplishments
1.      Overall Effectiveness
The City did not meet the goals and objectives of the previous 2005-2010 Housing Element for
total dwelling unit production. The financial crisis that the nation and California experienced
between 2006 and 2010, resulting in the recession of 2008, had a significant impact on the
housing market. As such, housing production in the last few years has been limited. The City
was able to meet a substantial portion of low income dwelling units. Of the 285 Very Low
Income dwelling units identified in the previous RHNA, 225 were constructed (79 percent) within
Poway through the end of 2009. In addition, of the 216 Low Income Units allocated from the
previous RHNA, 43 units (20 percent) were constructed. Of the 235 Moderate Income units, 33
dwelling units were constructed (12 percent). Finally, of the 505 Above Moderate income units
allocated, 292 were constructed from the previous RHNA.
The City made a significant start toward its affordable housing goals by implementing a number
of programs including the establishment of Affordable Housing Overlay Zones (AHOZ),
Municipal Code amendments including flexible development standards to facilitate the
development of affordable housing and to attract supportive businesses and other community
services. Although the actual production fell short of goals, much of the effort in the 2005-2010
Housing Element cycle has set the stage for the implementation of potential affordable housing
expansion to key areas of the City including the mixed-use district and the Town Center
Planning Areas, which will be a key program during the 2013-2020 Housing Element cycle.
2.      Goals, Policies and Strategies
The goals, policies and strategies contained in this section describe the general vision for
Poway during the previous 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle to satisfy the community’s
housing needs and meet the requirements of State law. These goals, objectives, and policies
were followed by the programs that were proposed to be implemented to meet this vision.
The 2005-2010 Housing Element’s primary goal for the City of Poway was to “…provide
adequate housing opportunities to meet the needs of current and future residents”. To this end,
the City strived to maintain a reasonable balance between rental and ownership housing
opportunities and to encourage a variety of individual choices of tenure, type, and location of
housing throughout the City. To achieve this goal, the policies and strategies outlined in the
2005-2010 Housing Element were incorporated into the Housing Programs.
3.      Program Review
Overall, these goals, objectives, and policies were retained, but some modifications were
conducted. The recent Needs Assessment shows that Poway has a greater need for
“ownership” Moderate Income housing because most dwelling units constructed during the last
Housing Element cycle were affordable to low income households. Due to elimination of
redevelopment agencies, available funding is not known at this time, which will have a
significant impact on retention of many programs. In order to address this funding shortfall, the

                                            Program Evaluation/Accomplishments
City will continue to consider all potential funding resources including semi-annually refer to the
State of California’s Department of Housing and Community Development’s (HCD) Program
Directory to expand its potential funding sources and determine the availability of funding.
Table 5-2 below lists the previous Housing Element programs and describes specific actions
the City of Poway proposed to carry out during the previous 2005-2010 Housing Element cycle
to satisfy the community’s housing needs and meet the requirements of State law. These also
include accomplishments to certain programs. Each housing need and requirement in the
2005-2010 Housing Element was followed by programs that were proposed to be implemented.

 Program 2 – Rehabilitation Loans    During the previous housing cycle, the City
 for Low and Moderate Income         continued the Residential Rehabilitation Loan
 Households                          Program for low- and moderate-income
 (Rehabilitation Loan Program)       households, which provided loans of up to
                                     $10,000 for rehabilitation of single-family homes
                                     or mobile homes occupied by low income
                                     homeowners. This was an on-going program
                                     funded by Community Development Block Grant
                                     (CDBG) funds. During the previous housing
                                     cycle, 27 loans were approved. This
                                     accomplishment addressed Policy A1.
                                     This program was discontinued in 2011 due to
                                     the reduction in available funding. The City will

                                     park it owned, Poway Royal. The park sale was
                                     structured to preserve affordable rents for
                                     existing residents for a period of time and
                                     required     $1M    in    capital    repairs    and
                                     improvements to the park. The City provided
                                     rental assistance to 25 residents until the park
                                     was sold. These 25 residents will continue to
                                     receive reduced rental rates.

                                      of affordable housing projects and programs
                                      described in Chapter 6. The current balance of
                                      housing in-lieu fees available is $618,698. During
                                      the previous housing cycle, the City reduced the
                                      in-lieu fee it collects.      As a result of the
                                      Palmer/Sixth Street Properties vs. City of Los
                                      Angeles court ruling and the increased cost of
                                      inclusionary housing to developers, the City will
                                      continue to evaluate its existing inclusionary
                                      housing ordinance. Addresses Policies B1 and

 Program 20 – Redevelopment Agency    In 2009, the City and former Redevelopment
 Implementation Plan                  Agency updated the Implementation Plan for
                                      2010-2014.      The Plan included goals and
                                      objectives for future affordable housing,
                                      commercial       revitalization,     and      capital
                                      improvements. This program addresses Policy
                                      A6.
                                      This program will be modified. The City and
                                      Housing Authority will continue to evaluate
                                      legislation    and    legal     interpretations    of
                                      redevelopment law to determine the need and
                                      extent of an Implementation Plan in the future.

 Program 22 – Emergency Housing    This program will be retained. State law requires
                                   that cities identify sites that are adequately zoned
                                   for the placement of special needs housing,
                                   which      includes      homeless     shelters   and
                                   transitional and supportive housing. Additionally,
                                   cities must not unduly discourage or deter these
                                   uses.
                                   The Zoning Ordinance permits homeless shelters
                                   as a Temporary Use in all residential and
                                   commercial zoning districts. The City’s zoning
                                   ordinance does not include any discretionary
                                   review process for homeless shelters or
                                   transitional housing. In 2011, the City Council
                                   waived the fees associated with the Temporary
                                   Use Permit process for Emergency Shelters in
                                   Poway.
                                   Through the use of Community Development
                                   Block Grant (CDBG) funds, the City participates
                                   in the North County Regional Winter Shelter
                                   Program. The program operates from November
                                   to March annually to provide shelter, case
                                   management and social services to homeless
                                   persons. The program includes permanent and
                                   rotating/temporary sites. Additionally, each year
                                   in the previous housing cycle, religious facilities
                                   in the City hosted temporary shelters for
                                   approximately six weeks. At least three (3)
                                   shelters were available in Poway during
                                   inclement weather. This effort is part of the
                                   Interfaith Shelter Network’s Rotational Shelter
                                   Program, which involves approximately 120
                                   congregations county-wide.
                                   In conjunction with other North County inland
                                   jurisdictions, Poway proposes to continue
                                   participation in the North County Winter Shelter
                                   Program and coordinate with the Regional Task
                                   Force on the Homeless.            The City will also
                                   include transitional and supportive housing as
                                   defined in Section 50675 of the State
                                   Government Code in the definition of “Family”

 Program 23 – Provision of Transitional  This program will be retained. As funding allows,

                                         groups and agencies to provide additional
                                         transitional housing for families pursuant to State
                                         law.      In previous years, the City’s former
                                         Redevelopment Agency implemented this
                                         program through the use of low-mod funds and
                                         private donations. There are three transitional
                                         housing units that were previously established at
                                         Parkview Terrace and Hillside Village. One
                                         additional transitional housing unit was
                                         established at the Solara project during the last
                                         housing cycle, in 2009. Additionally, there are
                                         eight special needs units that were established at
                                         the Special Friends Group Home in 2003.

                                         Providing for Transitional and Supportive housing
                                         in the next housing cycle is dependent on
                                         available funding. While the City was been able
                                         to maintain this program in the past, the
                                         elimination of redevelopment agencies has made
                                         available funding unknown at this time. The City

 in the Mixed Use District             elimination of redevelopment agencies, the ability
                                       to assemble available land will be very limited.
                                       However, the former Redevelopment Agency
                                       acquired several parcels in the Mixed-Use zone,
                                       specifically in the Town Center area, for
                                       affordable housing and mixed-use development.
                                       These areas offer potential infill development and
                                       are located in proximity to public transit,
                                       commercial and other community services.
                                       Some of these properties have had an Affordable
                                       Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) established on
                                       them. The AHOZ allows flexible development
                                       standards including higher densities if developed
                                       with affordable housing. Some of the properties
                                       are owned by the City and others by the Housing
                                       Authority. It is unknown how many, if any, of the
                                       City-owned parcels will be retained. When
                                       proposed for development, the City will
                                       encourage mixed-use with affordable housing,
                                       pursuant to the AHOZ.
                                       The City continues to focus on properties in the
                                       Mixed Use zone and Town Center area. As
                                       funding becomes available, the City will look
                                       again at acquiring property in these areas and
                                       will continue to evaluate this program. The City

 Chapter 6
 Housing Plan
This Chapter of the Housing Element Update sets out the City's long-term housing goals and
identifies a menu of shorter-term objectives, policy positions, and action programs which can be
utilized to achieve these long-term goals. The goals, objectives, policies, and programs comprise
a broad-based program for the creation of housing opportunities throughout the City. Through this
element, the City demonstrates its understanding of the existing housing conditions, as well as its
understanding of the need for a substantial commitment of City resources to provide additional
housing opportunities.
A.       Fiscal Caveat
The City acknowledges that the housing program is but one of a large number of programs
competing for limited fiscal resources of the City. Because of this, it is not possible to subject this
program to strict budgetary scrutiny. In addition, there may be legal requirements affecting future
encumbrances of funds, as well as demands in other areas requiring the City to make difficult
decisions on budgetary priorities.
Since the previous Housing Element cycle, State legislation on primary funding sources for
affordable housing have been significantly impacted. As discussed in the Executive Summary
of this document, the State Legislature took action in 2011 to eliminate California redevelopment
agencies. Ultimately, the legislation was challenged and taken up for immediate review by the
California Supreme Court. While the matter was pending judicial review, all new redevelopment
activity (including housing) was prohibited. The City of Poway anticipated the State’s intent to
eliminate redevelopment agencies, and formed the Poway Housing Authority in 2011. In 2012,
the City designated the Poway Housing Authority as successor agency to the former Poway
Redevelopment Agency and the recipient of all housing assets and liabilities in the City.
For years, redevelopment monies were one of the three main funding sources used to make
affordable housing developments viable statewide. The others are State bond funds and
Federal funds administered through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
City cannot directly apply for Federal housing funds as they are administered through the
County of San Diego.
Unfortunately, there were no provisions when redevelopment was eliminated to provide ongoing
funding for affordable housing. The City is hopeful that new avenues for funding economic
development and affordable housing will be created and tested in the coming years, but
because of the uncertainty of available funds at this time, a conservative approach to affordable
housing programs is recommended throughout this chapter.
While the City embraces the housing programs contained in this chapter, it should be recognized
that these programs are intended to provide the most opportunities possible for housing rather
than any set minimum of housing units. The City will continually research and evaluate potential
funding sources including referral to the State of California’s Department of Housing and

mean that the City has any diminished commitment or diminished obligation to responding to

B.      Goals and Policies
This section establishes a policy framework to guide City decision making to meet identified goals.
Housing Programs (subsection C) contains the actions the City of Poway will take to promote
housing and shelter opportunities for all segments of the community.
There is one Goal stated in this section, which is referenced from the General Plan Introduction
Chapter. The Goal is described as a general desire to achieve opportunities for housing. It
reflects a final statement of what the City hopes to achieve. How the goal will be achieved is
established via the policies, strategies, and, most importantly, action programs.
Policies are statements on the position the City takes to implement an objective. Policies
contained in the Housing Element are important statements as they reflect the City's official
position on a matter. Future development must be consistent with these policies.
Strategies are general courses of action the City follows from which it crafts specific actions
implemented in the programs.
The goal, policies, and strategies shown below are those that relate directly to issues discussed
in the Housing Element. The various elements of the General Plan are intended to be
consistent with each other and should be interpreted to be consistent. Goals and policies
contained in other elements will also support those included here. A complete listing of all
goals, policies, and strategies is contained in Section II of the General Plan.
GOAL 11.         IT IS THE GOAL OF THE CITY OF POWAY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE
                 APPROPRIATE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET THE NEEDS

C.      Housing Programs
The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address Poway’s identified housing
needs and are implemented through a series of housing programs offered by the City. Housing
programs define the specific actions the City will undertake to achieve the stated goals and
policies. Each program identifies the following:
    FUNDING: indicates the source of funds to be used for each program. Where a funding
    source indicates General Fund it is to mean that the program uses existing staff or resources
    and is funded by the General Fund. Some funding sources indicate the use of State or
    Federal funds. Where these funds might become unavailable, implementation of these
    programs may not be possible. It is important to note the elimination of redevelopment funds,
    the primary source of funds used for affordable housing in Poway, as described earlier in this

CONSERVATION OF EXISTING HOUSING
The preservation of existing housing and neighborhoods is vital to the attainment of the Housing
Element Goal and should be accomplished through programs that protect the integrity of
neighborhoods and encourage housing rehabilitation. It is as important to maintain existing
affordable situations as it is to create new housing opportunities, because the loss of existing
affordable housing only exacerbates existing unmet needs. The maintenance of housing in
terms of minimum safety and sanitary conditions is also important. The following programs are
aimed at maintaining the affordability and livability of the City's housing stock.
Program 1 – Rehabilitation Loans for Low and Moderate Income Households
(Rehabilitation Loan Program)
As funding is available, continue the Affordable Rehabilitation Loan Program for low and
moderate income households, which provides loans of up to $10,000 per loan for rehabilitation
of single-family homes occupied by low income homeowners. The funds for rehabilitation are
given in the form of a loan that is non-interest bearing and is forgiven over a ten-year period.
This program was funded with County Community Block Grant Funds but was discontinued in
2011 due to reductions in funding. If funding becomes available, the City will consider resuming
this program and issuing rehabilitation loans.

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HOUSING
Program 10 – Development of New Rental Housing
As funding is available, the Poway Housing Authority will assist the development of new rental
housing. The Housing Authority will consider the provision of land through partnerships with
local non-profit developers should additional sources of financing become available to develop
Housing Authority owned sites earmarked for affordable housing. The improvement of
infrastructure and amenities surrounding each new development project will be addressed to
ensure these are functional and sufficient to serve any proposed project as well as to provide for
the revitalization of neighborhoods when possible. City staff always works closely with all
developers to leverage financing, maximize site yield, and expedite processing for affordable
housing developments. City staff will work closely with nonprofit developers to assure that they
have all resources necessary to successfully build and manage existing and future affordable
housing.
The 77-unit Brighton Place housing development, completed in 2012, is a good example of this
in action. Early site due diligence was enabled by a predevelopment loan provided by the
former Poway Redevelopment Agency to the nonprofit developer, San Diego Interfaith Housing
Foundation (Interfaith). The Agency’s total investment of more than $5 Million plus land
donation and intense support for the tax credit application, allowed the project to qualify for
approximately $11 Million in Federal tax credit funding. Additionally, City staff worked diligently
with the development team to ensure entitlements, permits, inspections and Certificates of

Occupancy were expedited, allowing the project to be completed on time and under budget.
The investment and process described for the Brighton Place project are typical of Poway’s
involvement with affordable housing and will be applied to other future affordable housing
projects to the extent possible.
Any Housing Authority participation towards the development of affordable housing will require a
regulatory agreement or other form of enforceable affordability control stipulating the long-term
use restrictions will be recorded against each property. Structuring the financial assistance
such that the property cannot be sold without the consent of the Housing Authority provides
further assurance that the affordability controls on the property are protected. Management
plans for each development will be required to assure proper management and maintenance.
Affordable housing developments will employ energy efficient design principles and provide on-
site energy generation to the extent possible. The design of new rental housing shall comply
with the City’s General Plan and be sensitive to the surrounding neighborhoods. The target
income levels of this program are households earning up to 80 percent AMI. When possible,
amenities including childcare facilities, units designed for disabled persons, and transitional
housing units will be provided. The Housing Authority will continue to contact affordable
housing developers active in Poway and in San Diego County to solicit development proposals
as funds become available.

Program 11 – New Ownership Housing
As funding is available, the Poway Housing Authority will facilitate the construction and
development of new affordable ownership housing through placement of the Affordable Housing
Overlay Zone (AHOZ) designation on several parcels throughout the City. The optional
increased density would allow property owners to consider affordable housing ownership
development. The City will also assist affordable housing developers with application to any
potential leverage funding sources, include local, State and Federal grant programs.

Program 12 – Amend the General Plan Land Use Designation and Zoning on the
Properties Identified in the new Residential Sites Inventory to include an Affordable
Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) for Lower Income Households and Moderate Income
Households
The City will amend the General Plan and Land Use Designation on properties identified in the
new Residential Sites Inventory (Table 4-4) in Chapter 4 to place an Affordable Housing Overlay
Zone (AHOZ) for Low Income households or Moderate income households. Application of the
AHOZ on existing and future sites will be implemented pursuant to the regulations of the City’s
Municipal Code and California Government Code Section 65583.2(h) and 65583.2(i). The City’s
General Plan and Municipal Code will be amended to ensure it complies with State Law.
Projects using the AHOZ will accommodate 100 percent of the housing need identified for the
sites in the Residential Sites Inventory. These sites will permit owner-occupied and rental
multifamily residential uses by right. To comply with State law, these sites require a minimum
density of 20 dwelling units per acre and a minimum of 16 units per site. With the application of
the AHOZ, these sites will permit densities up to 30 dwelling units per acre. At least 50 percent
of the very low and low-income housing need shall be accommodated on sites designated for
residential use and for which nonresidential uses or mixed-uses are not permitted. The AHOZ
will allow the densities required to meet the City’s Regional Housing Needs allocation. A total of
six properties were assigned an AHOZ in 2012. The appropriate AHOZ will be placed on all
remaining sites in order to achieve the unit yield identified in Table 4-4 in Chapter 4. The
underlying zoning on these sites will not change. During this process, evaluation of the current
development standards within the AHOZ for Low Income and Moderate Income households will
be analyzed and amended as necessary.

Program 13 – Mixed Use Development Standards
The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to include development standards for mixed use
developments in the City’s commercial and mixed use zones where mixed use development is
currently allowed with a Conditional Use Permit. The mixed use development standards will
include a minimum residential development ratio. The City will also amend the Zoning
Ordinance to include flexible development standards for projects within the City’s Mixed Use
Zone to encourage the development of affordable housing in these areas.

Program 14 – Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
The City of Poway has an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance which requires that 15 percent of all
new dwelling units constructed must be affordable to very low income households, for multi-
family construction, and moderate or low income households, for single-family construction.
This Ordinance is discussed in Chapter 3 of this Element. As an option, the Ordinance also
allows payment of an In-Lieu fee to meet the requirement for single-family developments. There
is no In-Lieu fee option for multi-family construction, therefore, the units must be provided as
part of each individual development. The Housing Element previously identified the purpose of
the In-Lieu fee to buy down above market rate housing, and make it affordable to households
with very low incomes. Above market rate housing is highly priced. Therefore, to buy down
these properties and make them affordable to very low and low income households would result
in the production of a very limited number of dwelling units with the In- Lieu fees collected. The
Inclusionary Ordinance allows for the In-Lieu fees to be used to buy down housing or to assist
development of new housing that are affordable to very low, low, and moderate income
households.
In 2009, the Palmer/Sixth Street Properties vs. City of Los Angeles court ruling found that
inclusionary housing requirements on rental developments violate the Costa-Hawkins Rental
Act of 1995, thereby invalidating many local jurisdictions’ inclusionary requirements for rental
housing. The City will continue to collect In-Lieu fees to be used in support of affordable
housing projects and programs described in this chapter. As of January 2013, the City has an
In-Lieu Fee balance of $618,698. The City reduced the In-Lieu Fee it collects during the
previous housing cycle. As a result of the Palmer/Sixth Street Properties vs. City of Los
Angeles court ruling and the increased cost of inclusionary housing to developers, the City will
continue to evaluate its existing inclusionary housing ordinance with respect to future affordable
housing rental properties.

Program 15 – (Former) Redevelopment Agency Implementation Plan
Prior to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies in California in 2011, the primary source of
funds for Poway assistance to the development of low and moderate income housing was the
former Poway Redevelopment Agency. The former Redevelopment Agency adopted a
Redevelopment Implementation Plan, 2010 through 2014 in December 2009. The plan included
goals and objectives for future redevelopment activity and affordable housing development.
Unfortunately, when redevelopment agencies were eliminated, there were no provisions to
provide ongoing funding for affordable housing or redevelopment activity. The City is hopeful
that new avenues for funding economic development and affordable housing will be created
and tested in the coming years.

Program 16 – Zoning Amendments for Special Needs Housing
The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to address the provision of special needs housing,
which includes but is not limited to, emergency shelters for homeless persons, transitional and
supportive housing, housing for persons with disabilities (including developmental disabilities)
and agricultural worker housing. State law requires that cities identify sites that are adequately
zoned for the placement of special needs housing. Additionally, cities must not unduly
discourage or deter these uses. The City will continue to comply with the provisions of Senate
Bill 2 as it pertains to special needs housing.
Emergency Shelters:
The Zoning Ordinance permits homeless shelters as a Temporary Use in all residential and
commercial zoning districts. The City’s zoning ordinance does not include any discretionary

Council has waived the fees associated with the Temporary Use Permit process for Emergency
Shelters in Poway.
The Zoning Code also provides under Section 17.08.090 (G) Residential Uses, the following
land use: "Residential Care Facilities licensed by the State for seven to fifteen residents" in the
Residential Single-Family 2, Residential Condominium, and Residential Apartment zones with
an approved Conditional Use Permit. In addition, Residential Care Facilities with six or fewer
residents are permitted by right in residential zones.

Homeless Shelters:
To comply with the Senate Bill 2, local governments must identify one or more zoning districts
that allow year-round homeless shelters without discretionary review. The identified zone must
have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one year-round shelter and accommodate the
City’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless population. The City will amend its Zoning
Code within one-year of adoption of the Housing Element to explicitly address compliance with
SB 2 and homeless shelters. Objective development and management standards will also be
established in the Zoning Code
The City will permit homeless shelters by right within the Residential Apartment (RA) Zone
consistent with State law. RA zones are located in several areas around the City. Many
properties zoned RA are located along transit corridors and are in proximity to community
services, employment areas and shopping centers. Several parcels in the RA zone are
underutilized and can be redeveloped in the future to include a year-round homeless shelter to
accommodate the City’s homeless population. There are also RA zoned properties containing
existing residential developments that can be modified to add a year-round homeless shelter to
accommodate the City’s homeless population, as required by State law.
Transitional and Supportive Housing, Housing for Persons with Disabilities, including
Developmental Disabilities and Single Room Occupancy:
The City will also include as defined in Section 50675 of the State Government Code the
definition of “Family” and “Household.” The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to add
definitions for Transitional and Supportive Housing pursuant to the Health and Safety Code
Section 50675.14(a)(B)(2). Transitional and Supportive housing is currently permitted by right
where all residential housing is permitted, and subject to the same development standards as
other residential housing development. Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units are one-room
units intended for occupancy by a single individual. The City’s Zoning Code allows SRO’s,
along with hotels and motels, in certain commercial zones subject to the same development
standards as other residential uses in Poway’s commercial zones. The City will amend its
Zoning Code to clarify the definition of Single Room Occupancy and facilitate the provision of SRO’s
pursuant to AB 2634 (Housing for Extremely Low Income Households).
Agricultural Worker Housing
Pursuant to the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the Health and
Safety Code), employee housing for agricultural workers consisting of no more than 36 beds in
a group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a single-family or household is
permitted by right in an agricultural land use designation. Any employee housing providing
accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be deemed a single-family structure within a
residential land use designation, according to the Employee Housing Act. Employee housing
for six or fewer persons is permitted wherever a single-family residence is permitted. To comply
with State law no conditional use permit, variance, or other permit can be required for employee
housing that is not required for a single-family residence in the same zone.
The City has no agricultural zones. The City’s Zoning Ordinance permits agricultural uses in the
all residential zoning districts. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to add a definition for

Objective:                       Amend Zoning Code to provide for regulations that comply with
                                 State Law regarding special housing needs. Addresses Policy B3.

Program 17 – Provision of Special Needs Housing
The City will continue to address the provision of special needs housing, which includes but is
not limited to, emergency shelters for homeless persons, transitional and supportive housing,
and housing for persons with disabilities (including developmental disabilities). State law
requires that cities identify sites that are adequately zoned for the placement of special needs
housing. Additionally, cities must not unduly discourage or deter these uses. As stated in
Program 16 above, the City will continue to comply with the provisions of Senate Bill 2 as it
pertains to special needs housing.
Emergency Shelters:
The Zoning Ordinance permits emergency shelters as a Temporary Use in all residential and
commercial zoning districts. The City’s zoning ordinance does not include any discretionary
review process for homeless shelters or transitional housing. In addition, the Poway City
Council has waived the fees associated with the Temporary Use Permit process for Emergency
Shelters in Poway.
Through the use of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, the City participates in
the North County Regional Winter Shelter Program. The program operates from November to
March annually to provide shelter, case management and social services to homeless persons.
The program includes permanent and rotating/temporary sites.
Additionally, religious facilities in the City host temporary shelters for approximately six weeks
each year. At least three (3) shelters are available in Poway during inclement weather. This
effort is part of the Interfaith Shelter Network’s Rotational Shelter Program, which involves
approximately 120 congregations county-wide.
Homeless Shelters:
To comply with the Senate Bill 2, local governments must identify one or more zoning districts
that allow year-round homeless shelters without discretionary review without discretionary
review. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one year-
round shelter and accommodate the City’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless
population. As described in Program 16, the City will amend its Zoning Code within one-year of
adoption of the Housing Element to explicitly address compliance with SB 2 and homeless

shelters. Objective development and management standards will also be established in the
Zoning Code
Transitional and Supportive Housing, Housing for Persons with Disabilities, including
Developmental Disabilities and Single Room Occupancy:
The City will continue with the provision of Transitional and Supportive Housing (including
Single Room Occupancy) as defined in Section 50675 of the State Government Code in the
definition of “Family” and “Household.” As described in Program 16, the City will amend the
Zoning Ordinance to add definitions for Transitional and Supportive Housing. Transitional
Housing may be used for a homeless individual or family transitioning to permanent housing.
The time frame for Transitional Housing is typically at least six months. This housing type can
be similar to group housing or multi-family units, but may include supportive services to gain
necessary skills with the goal of independent living. Supportive Housing typically has no limit on
length of stay and is typically linked to either on-site or off-site supportive services. Supportive
Housing may also include Persons with Disabilities, including Developmental Disabilities.
Services for Supportive Housing includes assistance in housing, living and working within the
community and/or improving health, monitoring case management treatment and life skills. As
funding is available, the City will continue to work with appropriate support agencies to provide
this Transitional and Supportive Housing. Currently, the City provides four (4) Transitional and
eight (8) Special Needs Housing Units. Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units are one-room
units intended for occupancy by a single individual. The City’s Zoning Code allows SRO’s,
along with hotels and motels, in certain commercial zones subject to the same development
standards as other residential uses in Poway’s commercial zones. The City will amend its
Zoning Code to clarify the definition of Single Room Occupancy and facilitate the provision of SRO’s
pursuant to AB 2634 (Housing for Extremely Low Income Households).

provided in the form of a deferred payment loan, which carries restrictions requiring that the
home be sold to other qualifying buyers. In doing so, the house is required to remain affordable
for a minimum of 45 years. The sale price will be less than the fair market value of the home
and is calculated using the annual percent increase or decrease of the Area Median Income.
Staff will continue to service the existing loans and ensure re-sales are sold in conformance with
Program requirements. The future of potential new loans is uncertain as funding will be limited.

As funding is available, in conjunction with the SHOP Program, continue offering single-family
rehabilitation loans with the Home Enhancement Loan Program (HELP) in an amount of up to
$20,000 for homes acquired with City assistance. The funds for rehabilitation were given in the
form of a loan that is non-interest bearing and is forgiven over a ten-year period. This program
is also for low and moderate income households earning between 70 to 120 percent of area
median income, adjusted for household size. Low income households below 70 percent of area

Program 21 – Evaluate Community Land Trusts
The City may explore the potential of community land trusts that may serve as stewards for
additional owner-occupied affordable housing for Low and Moderate Income households. A
community land trust is a nonprofit organization formed to hold title to land to preserve its long-
term availability for affordable housing and other community uses. A land trust typically
receives public or private donations of land or uses government subsidies to purchase land on
which affordable housing can be built. In this model, homes are sold to lower-income families,
but the community land trust retains ownership of the land and provides long-term ground
leases to homebuyers. The City may evaluate potential community land trusts through such
actions as: (1) offering Housing Authority-owned properties; (2) directing local, State and
Federal funds designated for first-time homebuyer subsidies; (3) encouraging partnerships with
local affordable housing developers; (4) providing grant funds; and (5) consideration of
developing a partnership to monitor compliance of outstanding City first-time homebuyer loans
and other agreements with long term affordability requirements that are enforceable by the City.

Program 24 – Assemble Available Land in the Mixed Use District
With the elimination of redevelopment agencies in California, the City’s ability to continue to
assemble available land in the Mixed-Use Zone and the Town Center Planning Area will be
very limited. However the former Poway Redevelopment Agency acquired several parcels in
the Mixed Use Zone, specifically in the Town Center area for the development of affordable
housing and mixed use. These areas offer potential infill development and are located in
proximity to public transit, commercial and other community services. Some of these properties
are owned by the City of Poway and others are owned by the Poway Housing Authority. All of
these, in addition to properties identified in the Residential Sites Inventory will have an AHOZ
applied. This will help facilitate mixed use development in the future. It is unknown, how many,
if any, of the City-owned parcels will be retained by the City. The City will encourage mixed-use
with affordable housing, pursuant to the AHOZ on the properties. The City continues to focus on
properties in the Mixed Use Zone and Town Center area. As funding becomes available, the
City will evaluate acquiring additional properties in these areas and will continue to evaluate this
program.

Through the Housing Solutions Alliance, the Housing Authority will work with local developers to
present information to local civic and business organizations, provide information to local
residents and businesses and seek supporters of affordable housing goals. The group will
issue press releases to local newspapers, conduct events to celebrate affordable housing
success stories and develop factual information about Poway’s affordable housing communities.

D.         Quantified Objectives
The City of Poway has established quantified (numerical) objectives for several program
categories (Table 6-1) to provide measurable standards for monitoring and evaluating program
achievements. Quantified objectives have been established for accommodating the City’s share
of future housing needs under the SANDAG Regional Housing Allocation Plan, new housing
construction, housing rehabilitation, the preservation of existing affordable housing, and
homebuyer assistance. The future housing needs objective addresses the City’s ability to
accommodate housing based on the availability of appropriately zoned vacant and underutilized
land, with public services and facilities. These homes may or may not be built depending on
market trends and the availability of funding to developers of affordable housing.
