City of Laguna Hills General Plan introduction
                                               a blueprint for creating the view envisioned by the community. The
                                               General Plan and its maps, diagrams, and the development policies form
                                               the basis for the city’s zoning, subdivision, and public works actions.
                                               Decision makers and city staff use the goals, policies, and programs of the
                                               General Plan as a basis for making decisions.
                                               The General Plan is considered comprehensive because it addresses a wide
                                               range of issues that affect the city such as the physical development of the
                                               jurisdiction or social concerns that can affect the overall quality of life.
                                               The General Plan is considered a “long-term” plan since it looks 20 years
                                               or more into the future. Each jurisdiction can establish a time horizon
                                               that best fits its individual needs. The State General Plan Guidelines
                                               recommend that General Plans be updated every 5 to 10 years to ensure
                                               that they remain relevant—to reflect local physical and demographic
                                               changes and broader changes in culture and technology.
                                               Seven specific “elements” in California planning law are mandatory
                                               for General Plans: land use, housing, circulation, conservation, open
                                               space, noise, and safety. These issues directly affect the community’s
                                               neighborhoods and quality of life. A local jurisdiction may adopt a
                                               General Plan in the format that best fits its unique circumstances. In
  Civic Center                                 doing so, the jurisdiction must ensure that the General Plan and its
                                               component parts comprise an integrated, internally consistent, and
                                               compatible statement of development policies and implementation
                                               programs to achieve its vision. The Laguna Hills General Plan is intended
                                               to be an active and evolving Plan, guiding the community and decision
                                               makers in prioritizing issues related to land use, capital improvements, and
                                               budgeting.
                                               It is not unusual for new information to become available following adoption
                                               of an updated General Plan. Alternatively, the vision for the community
                                               may change over time, and as a result, General Plans are periodically
                                               reviewed and updated to reflect the community’s changing needs.
                                               Organization of the
                                               Laguna Hills General Plan
                                               The Laguna Hills General Plan is organized into 10 sections. The sections
                                               include this introduction, seven General Plan elements, a General Plan
                                               Implementation Program, description of related plans and programs, and a
                                               glossary of terms used throughout this General Plan.
                                               The seven General Plan elements encompass all of the elements required by
                                               California General Plan law. The Laguna Hills General Plan combines the
                                               mandatory Open Space and Conservation Elements required by State law, and
                                               includes a separate, optional element on Community Services and Facilities.

The seven General Plan elements in the Laguna Hills General Plan
include:
•	        Land Use
•	        Mobility
•	        Conservation and Open Space
•	        Community Services and Facilities
•	        Safety
•	        Noise
•	        Housing
The seven elements are generally organized in a similar format. Each
element contains an Introduction, Background, and Plan section as
described below.
Introduction. This section indicates the purpose of each element and
how it will help Laguna Hills achieve its vision for the community as
articulated through the eight Guiding Themes.
Background. This section provides the reader with the existing
conditions and/or the environmental setting particular to that element
topic. Additionally, this information helps the reader understand the
rationale and the content for the Plan section.
Plan. The Plan section is composed of three sections: issues, goals and
policies, and approach. The issues section describes issues and concerns
expressed by the community, City staff, and the City Council. The issues
and concerns are also expressed in the Guiding Themes. The goals and
policies section sets both broad and specific direction for the future of the
City based on the identified issues and concerns. The approach section
provides a general description and summary of the City’s course of action         The Seven General Plan Elements

                                               Glossary. This section provides definitions for technical terms used
                                               throughout the General Plan.
                                               Planning Area
                                               The City of Laguna Hills is located in the San Joaquin Hills in southern
                                               Orange County, approximately 60 miles south of Los Angeles and 70
                                               miles north of San Diego. Laguna Hills is bounded by the cities of Irvine
                                               and Lake Forest to the north; Interstate 5 (I-5) and the cities of Mission
                                               Viejo and Lake Forest to the east; the City of Laguna Niguel to the south;
                                               and, the cities of Aliso Viejo and Laguna Woods to the west. Regional
                                               access is provided by I-5 and the San Joaquin Hill Transportation Corridor
                                               (State Route 73).
                                               Laguna Hills contains approximately 6.6 square miles of land or 4,234
                                               acres. Figure I-1 depicts the location of Laguna Hills in the region.
                                               The planning area for Laguna Hills consists solely of areas within the City

                                               History of Laguna Hills
                                               Laguna Hills is built on one of the major land grants developed during the
                                               Rancho Era.  Following Mexico’s independence from Spain in 1821, those
                                               who had served in the government or who had friends in authority, were
                                               given vast lands for cattle grazing. Rancho Lomas de Santiago, Rancho
                                               San Joaquin, and Rancho Niguel covered much of the western portion
                                               of the Saddleback Valley. Don Juan Avila was granted the 13,000-acre
                                               Rancho Niguel on which Laguna Hills is located.
                                               In 1874, Lewis Moulton purchased Rancho Niguel from Don Juan
                                               Avila and increased the original grant to 22,000 acres.  Moulton and his
                                               partner, Jean Piedra Daguerre, used the ranch to raise sheep and cattle.
                                               The Moulton Ranch was eventually subdivided in the early 1960s, part of
                                               which is recognized as Laguna Hills.
                                               Incorporation efforts began in 1987 and on March 5, 1991, the goal
                                               of incorporation was finally achieved with 86 percent of the residents
                                               voting in favor of forming the City of Laguna Hills. On December 20,
                                               1991, Laguna Hills officially became a City. Shortly after incorporation,
                                               the City undertook an extensive research and public outreach process to
                                               develop its first General Plan. The City formed a General Plan Advisory

City of Laguna Hills General Plan introduction
                                               Committee (GPAC), which ensured valuable citizen input into the
                                               development of that Plan. Additionally, the City Council conducted a
                                               series of workshops, which included the opportunity for the general public
                                               to provide comments and input on the General Plan Program.
                                               The first General Plan was organized into five chapters and set major goals
                                               for land use, housing, growth management, fiscal management, circulation
                                               and transportation, infrastructure, open space, air quality, and noise. On
                                               June 28, 1994, the General Plan was adopted by the City Council and has
                                               guided growth and development in Laguna Hills since that time.
                                               Since adoption of the City’s first General Plan, two key annexations
                                               occurred.  On November 14, 1995, the City Council approved annexation
                                               of the north Laguna Hills area, which became part of the incorporated
                                               City on July 1, 1996. The annexation added approximately 755 acres of
                                               land with various designations such as residential, mixed use, commercial,
                                               open space and parks. On September 18, 2000, with the overwhelming
                                               support from the 1,800 residents, the “Westside” Annexation Area officially
                                               became part of the incorporated City. The annexation added 149 acres of
                                               residential land, which includes the Aliso Viejo Community Association’s
                                               Sheep Hills Park. The original incorporation boundaries plus these two
                                               annexation areas form the City’s Planning Area addressed in this Plan.
                                               Community Participation
                                               This is the first comprehensive revision of the General Plan since the City’s
                                               first General Plan was adopted in 1994. The General Plan is based on
                                               extensive research and analysis of existing conditions, changing local and
                                               regional conditions, evolving trends in urban planning, and a collaborative
                                               partnership with community members through an extensive public
                                               participation process.
                                               COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
                                               At the heart of the update to the Laguna Hills General Plan was an
                                               extensive public involvement process. Throughout the General Plan
                                               process, the General Plan consultant and City staff team engaged the
                                               community and its decision makers in numerous workshops, stakeholder
                                               meetings, study sessions, and public hearings to understand the vision and
                                               desires for the future of Laguna Hills. Hundreds of residents, employees,
                                               business owners, and other stakeholders spent numerous fruitful hours
                                               sharing ideas, expressing views, debating policies, and making hard
                                               decisions with the intent of creating a General Plan that is right for
                                               Laguna Hills. The policy framework in the General Plan reflects the
                                               priorities, needs, and aspirations of those involved in the process. The

input received from community members is expressed in a set of Guiding
Themes that provides a foundation for the City’s long-range goals.
The public participation program included the following major
components.
General Plan Advisory Committee
Consisting of 18 members, the GPAC served in an advisory role to City
staff and the City Council during the General Plan process. The GPAC
was appointed by the City Council and made up of a cross section of
representatives of Laguna Hills residents, businesses, and organizations.
Throughout the process, the GPAC worked with staff to address
issues associated with the General Plan, including a variety of land use
alternatives, housing, mobility, open space, environmental issues, and
goals and policies refinement.
The GPAC had a total of eight meetings beginning in 2007 and
concluding in August 2008, all of which were open to the public.
Community Workshops
From September 18, 2007, to May 22, 2008, the City conducted a series
of three community workshops involving the broader community, using
hands-on activities, expert guest speakers, and focused dialogue sessions.
The purpose of the workshops was to encourage residents and other
stakeholders to identify issues and opportunities to address in the General
Plan and to solicit input on the General Plan Program.
Newsletters
The City used a series of newsletters to inform residents of the General
Plan Program and opportunities for input. The newsletters also served
as an invitation to the public workshops. The first newsletter was sent
to every household in the City. Subsequent newsletters were sent to
households indicating an interest in receiving General Plan Program
updates.
Public Hearing and Adoption
The final step in the General Plan process was public hearings on the Draft
General Plan and the Program Environmental Impact Report (PEIR).
This hearing process resulted in revisions to the General Plan based on
City Council direction. After final review, the City Council adopted the
General Plan, superseding the previous General Plan as the City’s official
guide for growth and development.

A City Prepared for the Future
Managing growth and proactively meeting residents’ needs are key issues
for the future of Laguna Hills. Residents recognize the need to provide
housing opportunities for all segments of the community. In addition,
the need to continually improve municipal services and facilities (such
as water, sewer, trash, library, sports facilities, and animal services) is
important to the City’s welfare. The City will continue to look for
opportunities to integrate City services with the best technology available.
Maintaining community connections is important as development
occurs in Laguna Hills. Attention should be paid to the amount, type,
and design of new development to ensure compatibility with existing
neighborhoods and to create new gathering spaces.
Expanding local retail will reduce residents’ shopping trips to adjacent
cities, increasing local tax revenues, reducing vehicle trips, and enhancing
overall quality of life.
Focused Revitalization in Commercial Corridors
Promoting revitalization that enhances the public realm, expanding the City’s
unique offerings, and cultivating environmental and economic sustainability
are important goals of the General Plan. Some of the commercial and
business centers have aged and are ripe with opportunities for new
activity and redevelopment. At the same time, many residents are wary of
development out of scale and character with the community and instead
prefer development (of neighborhood centers) that is locally oriented (as
opposed to regionally oriented).
People recognize that goals for development in the northern area of the City
may vary from those for the central/southern portions.  “Neighborhood
centers” in the central and southern areas of the City are envisioned as
walkable environments serving one or more neighborhoods and integrating
a mix of uses, such as shopping, services, culture and civic facilities, housing,
and/or small parks and plazas.  To the north, the Laguna Hills Mall and
business park sites may be more suitable for greater amounts of employment
and services that serve both local and regional markets. The future of
the Mall may be as a “town center/urban village” with retail, restaurants,
entertainment, gathering spaces, and residential activity. Integrating the
town center with the hospital area and the Laguna Hills Transit Center
will allow people to live close to work and to use transit or walk to reach
destinations. Redevelopment of older, underutilized business parks in
the “north district” will result in new environments with rejuvenated
employment and shopping opportunities mixed with residences.

City of Laguna Hills General Plan introduction
                                               Efficient Transportation System
                                               Safe, well-functioning roads are essential and significantly contribute to
                                               people’s day-to-day experience in the City. The impact of traffic volume,
                                               speed, accidents, and congestion are significant issues for Laguna Hills’
                                               residents, employees, and businesses. The General Plan strategically links
                                               land use and transportation to make efficient use of existing capacity.
                                               General Plan goals, policies, and programs for mobility emphasize
                                               pedestrian paths, bikeways, equestrian trails, and transit that connect
                                               neighborhoods to commercial districts, other activity centers, and regional
                                               transportation systems. The General Plan also establishes policies to
                                               address congestion points throughout the City, regional traffic impacts,
                                               and coordinated signalization to enhance smooth traffic flow.
                                               Strong Community Identity
                                               Bolstering the unique attributes of Laguna Hills is an important goal
                                               Citywide. The City will benefit from a defined consistent character that
                                               connects to the City’s origins and culture, while reflecting its natural
                                               setting. General Plan goals and policies promote more identifiable local
                                               facilities (such as the Civic Center and community centers) and defined
                                               streetscapes that tie neighborhoods and districts within the City together.
                                               Efforts also focus on City beautification. Reinforcing identity Citywide
                                               will also help to better knit together the northern and southern portions of
                                               the City and strengthen community connections.
                                               Healthy and Supportive Community for Families
                                               and People of All Ages
                                               Attention to the needs of all community members, including seniors,
                                               children, persons with special needs, and residents of all ages, is an
                                               important value in Laguna Hills. This is evident in the great schools,
                                               senior activities, and recreation opportunities available in the community.
                                               These qualities will be maintained and expanded. Residents also recognize
                                               the need for opportunities for increased physical activity and desire to
                                               maintain and increase access to parks and recreational amenities to foster
                                               healthy lifestyles within the community.
                                               Protecting Environmental Resources and
                                               Preserving Open Spaces
                                               Laguna Hills’ natural amenities are highly valued. The community
                                               is envisioned as a healthy and clean environment where resources are
                                               protected. This includes preservation of existing open spaces, parks, trails,
                                               and creeks, and the conservation of energy and water resources. Reducing
                                               air and noise pollution and improving recycling efforts are also goals of the
                                               community.

Maintaining Safety within the Community
The City’s neighborhoods will be secure. People of all ages will be safe
walking or bicycling to schools, recreation, or work. Problems with traffic
and speeding cars need to be addressed by traffic calming measures to
improve the overall safety of the community. Laguna Hills also has a very
low crime rate, and residents want that low rate maintained.
Sustaining Community Connections as Laguna
Hills Advances
The City will strive to protect the small town atmosphere that residents
identify with living and working in Laguna Hills. Residents feel
connected to the community and local government and enjoy knowing
their neighbors and their neighborhoods in addition to participating in
civic life. Planning will focus on fostering a community feel that creates
opportunities for community connections (both social and physical).
General Plan goals and policies will foster more community traditions and
events by creating additional community activity centers (where residents
can congregate), and by establishing physical connections between the
residents and the community activity centers.
Using the General Plan
The City’s General Plan is intended for use by all members of the
community, including residents, businesses, developers, and decision
makers. The organization of the General Plan allows users to find topics
or sections that interest them and to quickly review City policies. Readers
should keep in mind that policies throughout all elements are interrelated
and should be examined comprehensively and must be considered together
when making planning decisions.
While the Plan’s narrative text and maps frame the key proposals, the
essence of the Plan lies in its goals, policies, and implementation programs.
These are declarative statements that set forth the City’s approach to
various issues. Goals, policies, and implementation programs are described
as follows:
•	   Goals are statements that describe in general terms a desired future
     condition or “end” state. Goals describe ideal future conditions for a
     particular topic and tend to be very general and broad.
•	   Policies provide guidance toward a specific course of action for
     decision makers to achieve a desired goal.
                                                                                                                        I-11

City of Laguna Hills General Plan introduction
                                               •	   Implementation Programs identify the specific steps to be taken
                                                    by the City to implement the policies. They may include revisions
                                                    of current codes and ordinances, plans and capital improvements,
                                                    programs, financing, and other measures that should be assigned to
                                                    different City departments after the General Plan is adopted.
                                               The adopted General Plan is a dynamic, not static, document. State law
                                               allows up to four General Plan amendments per mandatory element per
                                               year.  Most amendments propose a change in the land use designation of a
                                               particular property (and thus propose a change to the Land Use Element).
                                               As time passes after a number of such amendments, the City may find
                                               it desirable to revise portions of the General Plan text to reflect the land
                                               use map changes or other changing circumstances or philosophy. The
                                               City should comprehensively review the Plan every 5 years to determine
                                               whether it is still in step with community values and physical and
                                               economic conditions.
                                               Documents Related to the
                                               General Plan
                                               Although the General Plan serves as the primary means to help the
                                               City implement its vision, several other documents that serve as
                                               implementation tools are needed to ensure that the goals and policies
                                               identified in the General Plan are fully realized. The General Plan is
                                               implemented in tandem with a number of federal, State, regional, and
                                               local plans and regulations. These applicable plans and programs are
                                               summarized in Appendix A of this General Plan.

                                               Report (EIR)
                                               As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), an
                                               Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is prepared for the General Plan.
                                               The EIR is a separate document that describes environmental conditions
                                               in the City, assesses the possible effects that future development pursuant
                                               to the General Plan will have, identifies actions that will be undertaken to
                                               reduce these impacts, and evaluates the comparative impacts of alternatives
                                               to the General Plan.  Many of the policies in the General Plan serve as
                                               mitigation for potential impacts. The document is a “program level” EIR,
                                               meaning that it examines the general nature of impacts at a Citywide
                                               scale. The findings of the EIR help determine the appropriate level of
                                               environmental review that should be performed when subsequent projects
                                               consistent with the General Plan are proposed. Although the EIR is
                                               certified by the City Council, it is not adopted as a policy document.

                                           This Element describes both existing and future land use activities
                                           and unifies the other elements of the General Plan by providing an
                                           overall policy context. The Land Use Element deals with the central
                                           issues of development and growth, and the quality of the community,
                                           and helps define the desired balance among the social, environmental,
                                           and economic costs and benefits associated with growth. Most of the
                                           Guiding Themes that were described in the Introduction section of the
                                           General Plan are manifested in this Element.
                                           The Land Use Element identifies the distribution, location, and intensity
                                           of all land use types throughout the City. Text, maps, and diagrams
                                           establish the direction for land uses within the City and describe how
                                           these uses are integrated with other General Plan Elements and policies.
                                           Background
                                           The City of Laguna Hills has a variety of land uses, including residential,
                                           commercial, office, mixed use, public and institutional, open space and
                                           recreational, as well as planned community areas. The predominate land
                                           use in Laguna Hills is moderate to low density single-family homes. This
                                           contributes to the small-town character many residents identify with
                                           Laguna Hills. The City contains a range of housing types, including
                                           single-family detached and attached homes, apartments, condominiums,
                                           and mobile homes located throughout the City.
                                           Nonresidential uses in the City, such as commercial and office,
                                           provide valuable revenue to the City and provide jobs and services for
                                           the community and region. Most commercial uses in the City are
                                           concentrated along Interstate 5 (I‑5) and the major roadways. The City
                                           is almost entirely built out, although there are a few undeveloped large lot
                                           residential parcels scattered throughout the southern portion of the City.
                                           Several patterns of development exist throughout the City of Laguna
                                           Hills. The next section more fully describes how land is used in the
                                           northern, central, and southern portions of the City. Surrounding land
                                           uses in adjacent communities are also described. Figure LU-1 depicts the
                                           location of the northern, central, and southern portions of Laguna Hills.
                                           Northern Land Uses
                                           The northern portion of the City is generally located between Ridge
                                           Route Drive and Lake Forest Drive. A variety of uses are located here,
                                           including a mobile home park designated as High Density Residential,
                                           open space and park areas, neighborhood and freeway commercial
                                           centers, and a designated Mixed Use area. The Mixed Use area provides

the City with various goods and services needed to support the
local community, including administrative and professional offices,
institutional and government uses, business support uses, restaurants,
personal services, and retail stores.
Central Land Uses
The central portion of Laguna Hills is generally located north of La Paz
Road and south of Ridge Route Drive. This area of the City contains the
City’s downtown Urban Village, low, medium-low, and medium density
residential neighborhoods. The medium density neighborhoods contain
multi-family housing such as apartments and condominiums.
Pockets of this area also contain apartments and condominiums primarily
southwest of Moulton Parkway. This area is designated as High Density
Residential. Two apartment communities in this area, Rancho Moulton
and Rancho Niguel, provide government-assisted affordable housing
opportunities to Laguna Hills residents.

                                           throughout this area, which provides valuable services to the surrounding
                                           neighborhoods. These sites provide retail, markets, commercial services,
                                           restaurants, commercial recreation, professional and business offices,
                                           financial institutions, and automotive sales. There are medium-intensity
                                           commercial sites along I-5 serving the needs of the motoring public both
                                           in Laguna Hills and surrounding areas.
                                           This area of the City is also home to Laguna Hills High School, north of
                                           La Paz Road, as well as two elementary schools, The Community Center
                                           and Sports Complex, and several neighborhood parks. Cultural resources
                                           are located along Coastal Street, and a historic adobe structure is located
                                           near Aliso Creek.
                                           Urban Village
                                           The civic and retail heart of Laguna Hills, the Urban Village, is also
                                           located in the central portion of the City (see Figure LU-2). This area is
                                           generally bounded by Paseo de Valencia on the north and west, Los Alisos
                                           Boulevard on the south, and I‑5 on the east. This area is anchored by the
    Figure LU-2                            Laguna Hills Mall and Saddleback Memorial Medical Center and is home
    Urban Village Area                     to several retail stores as well as medical services and offices. The Laguna
                                           Hills Civic Center is also located within this area. The Urban Village

Southern Land Uses
The largest residential development in Laguna Hills is the Nellie Gail
Ranch community. This community is bounded by I-5 on the east,
State Route 73 (SR-73) on the west, and La Paz Road to the north.
Located on 1,350 acres, Nellie Gail Ranch consists of 1,407 lots and
is a mixture of tract and custom homes on large lots in an equestrian
setting, with homes ranging from 1,700 to 17,000 square feet. The land
use designation for this area is Estate Residential. Nellie Gail Ranch
has an equestrian center, 20 miles of equestrian trails, and several parks
and community areas, as well as substantial open space. The majority of
Nellie Gail Ranch is developed, but there are a few vacant, buildable sites
located throughout the community.
In addition to Nellie Gail Ranch, the southern portion of the City
contains a few residential neighborhoods containing single-family
detached homes, designated as Low and Medium-Low Density
Residential. Community Commercial and Freeway Commercial uses
serving local and regional residents are also located in the southern
portion of the community.
Surrounding Land Uses
The cities of Mission Viejo and Lake Forest border Laguna Hills on
the east. These cities are primarily residential, although there are a
number of offices and businesses providing shopping and employment
opportunities. Immediately north of Laguna Hills is the City of
Irvine. Irvine provides much of the employment opportunities in the
region, including large business parks, a commercial airport, and a
university. To the west and south of Laguna Hills are the cities of Laguna
Woods, Aliso Viejo, and Laguna Niguel, which are also predominantly
residential communities with areas dedicated to office, business park, and
commercial developments.
West of Laguna Hills is the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. This 6,500-
acre regional open space preserve provides Laguna Hills residents with
numerous recreation opportunities within a short distance from the City.
Land Use Plan
The Land Use Plan describes the major concepts and land use system
that guide future growth and development of Laguna Hills. The Land
Use Plan for Laguna Hills builds upon the City’s strengths by protecting
established residential neighborhoods, yet providing opportunities to
enhance and beautify the City by sustainable planning, integrating the
City through physical and social connections, and strengthening the
                                                                                                                 LU-5

City of Laguna Hills General Plan land use

                                           provide the framework for the Land Use Plan. These issue areas are:
                                           •	   Activity Centers and Community Connections
                                           •	   Respect for Existing Neighborhoods
                                           •	   Sustainable and Creative Infill Development
                                           •	   Enhancing the Community’s Identity
                                           •	   Fiscal Health and Economic Sustainability
                                           These issue areas frame the direction the City will take in its land use
                                           goals, policies, and programs to implement the vision of Laguna Hills
                                           as captured in the Guiding Themes. These issues are interrelated and
                                           are woven throughout the Land Use Plan instead of being described in

                                           This element uses certain terminology to describe the 16 land use
                                           designations in Laguna Hills. The term “density” typically applies to
                                           residential uses and refers to the population and development capacity of
                                           residential land. Density is described in terms of dwelling units per acre
                                           of land, exclusive of existing or proposed streets and rights-of-way. Typical
                                           residential densities found within Laguna Hills are illustrated in Figure LU-3.

For nonresidential uses, the term “intensity” describes the degree to which
a property is or can be developed. The measure of intensity Laguna Hills
has adopted is the floor-area ratio. The floor-area ratio, or FAR, describes
the relationship between the total square footage of development on a lot
and the area of that lot. The FAR is determined by dividing the gross floor
area of all buildings on a lot by the land area of that lot (Figure LU-4).
                                                                                             Building Floor Area = 160,000 SF

                                                                                             FAR = 0.20

FAR and factors such as building square footage, building height, and the
percent of lot coverage are all interrelated. For example, a 20,000-square-
foot building on a 40,000-square-foot lot yields a FAR of 0.50. This 0.50
FAR can accommodate a single-story building that covers half the lot or
a two-story building with reduced lot coverage. Figure LU-5 illustrates
different FAR calculations.
                                                                                             Building Floor Area = 60,000 SF

                                                                                             FAR = 0.40
The Land Use Plan (Figure LU-6) graphically represents the planned
distribution and intensity of land use in Laguna Hills. The colors shown                     Figure LU-5
on the map correspond to land use designations that describe the types of                    Typical Floor-Area Ratio
uses existing and planned in Laguna Hills. Given the built-out character                     Calculations
of the community, only minor land use changes are expected to occur over
the long term in Laguna Hills.

City of Laguna Hills General Plan land use
                                           Concepts of the City’s
                                           Land Use Plan
                                           This section describes planning concepts that have been incorporated into
                                           the development of the Laguna Hills Land Use Plan. The concepts reflect
                                           extensive community input as articulated in the Guiding Themes as well
                                           as subsequent input by the community, City staff, and City officials.
                                           Several current planning concepts or trends are also described that are
                                           relevant to the community.
                                           Neighborhood Preservation
                                           Laguna Hills’ residents value the secure and small town atmosphere in the
                                           City and enjoy knowing their neighbors and their neighborhoods. Many
                                           residents attribute the unique feel of Laguna Hills to the City’s established
                                           neighborhoods and feel strongly connected to their neighborhoods. The
                                           Land Use Plan provides goals and policies that serve to protect, preserve,
                                           and enhance existing residential neighborhoods in the City. Where new
                                           development is proposed in proximity to established neighborhoods,
                                           landscaping, buffering, and design techniques will be incorporated to
                                           protect the neighborhoods from the effects of nearby growth.
                                           Preserving the City’s residential neighborhoods and maintaining the
                                           City’s housing stock are essential steps to retaining Laguna Hills’
                                           character, livability, and quality of life that so many residents enjoy.
                                           Current Planning Trends
                                           Since the City adopted its first General Plan in 1994, several practices
                                           and trends have emerged in the urban planning and design fields. The
                                           underlying purpose of these planning concepts is to improve the quality
                                           of life in communities by providing greater housing choices, providing
                                           alternatives to driving, protecting environmental resources, creating a
                                           greater sense of community, and reducing environmental impacts. The
                                           Laguna Hills Guiding Themes, crafted by the community, encompass
                                           many of these planning concepts.
                                           Smart Growth
                                           One of the most prominent planning concepts is smart growth. Principles
                                           of smart growth include creating a range of housing opportunities
                                           and choices; creating walkable neighborhoods linking to key activity
                                           centers and shopping centers; mixing land uses; providing a variety of
                                           transportation choices; fostering distinctive, attractive communities
                                           with a strong sense of place; encouraging community and stakeholder
                                           collaboration; and preserving open space and environmental resources.

Many of the principles of smart growth have been incorporated into the
Laguna Hills General Plan. The overall goal of the City in embracing
smart growth is to enhance the quality of life for the residents of Laguna
Hills while embracing change in a positive, proactive sustainable
manner. Some of the principles related to smart growth are more fully
developed in the sections below.
Mixed Use Development
Mixed use refers to the mixing of compatible land uses such as residential,
commercial, and office in a vertical and/or horizontal configuration, which
increases the balance of land uses within a given area. By integrating or
mixing these compatible uses in proximity to one another, the City will
create desirable places for people to live, work, shop, and play. The City
has two mixed use designations—Mixed Use and Neighborhood Mixed
Use. The Mixed Use designation allows a variety of office, public, light
industrial, residential, and commercial establishments such as retail and
restaurants in proximity. The goal of the Neighborhood Mixed Use
designation is to create vital urban areas that accommodate housing
opportunities, employment, retail, and amenities within walking distance,
and will also create more vibrant areas of Laguna Hills at different times
of the day. The Neighborhood Mixed Use designation excludes light
industrial uses.
Mixed use buildings can be vertically mixed, with commercial space on
the first floor and housing or office space above. Horizontal mixed use is
also desirable at some locations, where commercial uses may be adjacent
to offices or residences. Key to successful mixed use centers is creating
pedestrian friendly environments within the centers and connections to
neighboring uses through the use of trails, pathways, bikeways, and safe
crosswalks.
Infill Development
Redeveloping or reconstructing existing structures or buildings on
underutilized parcels is generally referred to as infill development. Laguna
Hills has several areas, including aging commercial properties, that present
opportunities for quality infill development.
Infill development enhances community character, optimizes City
investments in infrastructure and community facilities, supports increased
transit use, promotes more walking- and bike-friendly neighborhoods,
reduces vehicle trips and resulting air pollution, increases housing diversity,
and enhances retail viability.
Careful planning for the integration of these uses into the fabric of the City’s
existing built-up areas and/or along existing commercial corridors will help
provide housing opportunities and maintain the character in Laguna Hills.

                                           Sustainability
                                           The most widely used definition of sustainability is “meeting the needs
                                           of the present without compromising the ability of future generations
                                           to meet their own needs.” For Laguna Hills, sustainability encompasses
                                           the concepts of community, environmental, and economic sustainability.
                                           Integrating goals, policies, and programs throughout the General Plan
                                           that promote sustainability will enhance the City’s natural resources,
                                           economic interests, and quality of life for present and future generations.
                                           Laguna Hills embraces community or social sustainability by fostering
                                           community participation in civic and community events, improving
                                           the physical connections between neighborhoods and activity centers,
                                           providing access to a variety of housing opportunities, and creating
                                           vibrant places for people to connect and interact.
                                           For environmental sustainability, Laguna Hills has crafted goals and
                                           policies that will promote energy conservation, reduce waste, incorporate
                                           smart growth and green building practices, and protect the City’s natural
                                           resources.
                                           Economic sustainability encompasses sustaining economic growth in
                                           the City, expanding jobs and markets, relying on local businesses, and
                                           promoting an economically thriving city.
                                           Green Buildings
                                           Green or sustainable buildings use resources such as energy, water, and
                                           materials much more efficiently than traditional buildings. Green
   The term “green” used in an             buildings reduce impacts to human health and the environment during
   environmental context describes         the building’s lifecycle, through better siting, design, construction,
   environmental practices that are        operation, maintenance, and removal.
   highly energy efficient and have a
   minimal impact on the environment.      Green buildings are designed to reduce the overall impact of the built
                                           environment on human health and the natural environment by:
                                           •	   Using energy, water, and other resources efficiently;
                                           •	   Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity;
                                                and
                                           •	   Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradation.
                                           Numerous green building programs and rating systems currently exist,
                                           and more programs are under development all the time. The following
                                           section describes two such green building rating systems. The City will
                                           promote the use of green buildings and landscaping techniques using
                                           Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Point
                                           Rated, or other green building standards and rating systems that may be

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. LEED is a building
rating system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).
The LEED green building rating system is a nationally accepted
voluntary benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of
high performance green buildings. Though largely focused on energy
efficiency, LEED promotes a whole-building approach to sustainability
that also considers sustainable site development, water savings, materials
selection, and indoor environmental quality. Projects are certified at one
of four levels (standard, silver, gold, platinum) based on the total number
of points.
LEED-certified buildings use key resources more efficiently compared
to conventional buildings. LEED-certified buildings are healthier work
and living environments, which contributes to higher productivity and
improved employee health and comfort.
GreenPoint Rated. GreenPoint Rated is a program of Build It Green, a
professional nonprofit membership organization that promotes healthy,
energy- and resource-efficient buildings in California. GreenPoint rated
is a third-party rating system for single-family and multi-family homes
based on a set of green building measures. A GreenPoint Rated home is
graded on five categories:
•	    Energy Efficiency
•	    Resource Conservation
•	    Indoor Air Quality
•	    Water Conservation
•	    Community
If a home meets minimum point requirements in each category
and scores at least 50 total points, then it earns the right to bear the
GreenPoint Rated label. GreenPoint Rated homes are verified to
exceed State building and energy code requirements for health and
environmental performance. Currently, standards have only been
developed for newly constructed single-family homes and multi-family
homes in California. GreenPoint Rated for remodeling and existing
homes is under development.
Urban Design
A wide variety of built and natural features contributes to the rich character
of Laguna Hills. The Laguna Hills Mall area, the Civic Center, attractive
residential neighborhoods, commercial corridors, neighborhood-serving
shopping areas, employment centers, and open space areas all contribute
to the mosaic of places and experiences that makes Laguna Hills unique.
Careful urban design techniques can provide direction and guidance for
development that enhances community character and natural beauty.

                                           urban planning, architecture, and landscape architecture in the
                                           Land Use Plan will:
                                           •	   Enhance the City’s unique identity and character and contribute to a
                                                positive City image;
                                           •	   Stimulate investment and strengthen the economic vitality of the
                                                City;
                                           •	   Contribute to a positive physical image and identity of the City;
                                           •	   Maintain and protect the value of property; and
                                           •	   Maintain a high quality of life without causing unnecessary high

                                           Economic Development
                                           Sustainable economic development and fiscal health are important goals for
                                           the City of Laguna Hills. Proactively pursuing economic development will
                                           provide more job opportunities for the City’s residents and will produce
                                           more revenue, allowing the City to provide higher levels of service and
                                           provide community amenities and facilities. Economic development also
                                           increases opportunities for local businesses and property owners. Laguna
                                           Hills will also promote economic development as a way to improve the
                                           City’s regional desirability, revitalize existing commercial areas, and enhance
                                           quality of life for all City residents.
                                           The City has several strengths that make Laguna Hills a competitive and
                                           desirable business environment. The City’s location within south Orange
                                           County and access to I-5 and SR‑73 are significant assets for Laguna
                                           Hills. The City also has a strong job market with large office, professional,
                                           retail, and service employment centers. The City’s jobs-to-housing ratio
                                           is 2.4, which is significantly higher than surrounding jurisdictions and
                                           Orange County as a whole. The Urban Village Specific Plan area, Alicia
                                           Gateway, and North Business Park areas provide multiple opportunities for
                                           residential development, mixed use, and commercial development. The
                                           City also has existing infrastructure in place to serve new development.
                                           Upgrading or expanding infrastructure may be necessary to facilitate
                                           additional growth.
                                           The City recognizes that businesses are an important source of the City’s
                                           economic well-being. Sales tax is the largest General Fund revenue
                                           source to the City (36 percent), and a significant contributor to the
                                           economic vitality of the City. Property taxes and motor vehicle in lieu
                                           fees also contribute significantly to the City’s General Fund revenues at
                                           approximately 30 and 13 percent, respectively. Per capita retail sales remain
                                           consistently strong and are the second highest in the City’s market area.

Retaining existing jobs and expanding and attracting new businesses are
critically important to the City. The City will promote public-private
partnerships, incentives, and a supportive business climate to retain and
expand existing and attract new businesses.
New development or redevelopment in key areas will provide local
opportunities and attract visitors and residents from the region,
contributing to the financial base of Laguna Hills. The City will pursue
additional shopping, entertainment, cultural activities, and performing
arts venues in Laguna Hills to meet more needs locally, while benefiting
the City and residents. Mixed use development will support small
business enterprises and entrepreneurship as well as provide a variety
of housing opportunities to the community. These development
opportunities are available in the Urban Village Specific Plan area,
Alicia Gateway, North Business Park, and Via Lomas areas. The City’s
aging commercial centers will also be redeveloped over time, providing
additional economic opportunities.
The City will actively market suitable areas and sites with adequate
infrastructure for new and expanding businesses and will collaborate with
local and regional organizations to promote the City and advertise local
events. As part of its economic development strategy, the City will also
prioritize capital infrastructure requirements and pursue innovative financing
mechanisms to enable timely implementation of such improvements.
Opportunity Areas
Opportunity areas represent sites within the City of Laguna Hills
where future land use change is very likely to occur throughout the
planning horizon of the General Plan. Each opportunity area has
unique characteristics, opportunities, and constraints. The selection
of the land use opportunity areas was the result of several months of
collaboration and conversation between the public, City officials, City
staff, and property owners. The selected opportunity areas represent sites
in Laguna Hills that offer centrality and favorable market conditions
and fulfill current needs for the City’s commercial and housing markets
in a changing economy. Finally, these sites offer the best potential for
fulfilling the community’s vision for Laguna Hills as described in the
Guiding Themes.
As described in the following sections, this General Plan adjusts the land
use designations in the opportunity areas. Outside of the opportunity
areas, no major land use changes are anticipated to occur. The opportunity
areas include Alicia Gateway, Via Lomas, and Moulton and La Paz.

                                           Alicia Gateway currently contains a variety of office and retail uses, including
                                           retail stores, restaurants, local services, fast-food establishments, and two gas
                                           stations. The area also contains a business park, a used car lot, and a public
                                           storage facility. Single-family homes border the area on the north, south,
                                           and west. No residential development is currently located within the
                                           boundaries of Alicia Gateway.

                                           that welcomes visitors and residents into the community. Residential
                                           units located above retail on upper stories could take advantage of
                                           excellent views created by the natural topography of the City.
                                           The General Plan features a Neighborhood Mixed Use designation for the
                                           entire Alicia Gateway area. The Neighborhood Mixed Use designation
                                           will create a moderate density center and gathering place by promoting
                                           a mix of retail, housing, and office uses; walkable connections, plazas,
                                           and green space for community gatherings; high-quality design and

architecture; orientation of buildings toward the street and pedestrians;
and accessibility to transit. The Neighborhood Mixed Use designation
promotes the development of vertical and horizontal mixed use. Allowed
uses include commercial, retail, office, and residential. Standalone
residential is prohibited. The maximum height is three stories, and the
expected housing density range is between 10 and 20 dwelling units per
acre with a maximum of 110 dwelling units on this site.
The Land Use Plan for this opportunity area is based upon development
objectives established in the goals and policies of the Land Use Element
and is consistent with the vision established in the Guiding Themes.
Figure LU-8 illustrates planning concepts for the Alicia Gateway
opportunity area. Redevelopment in Alicia Gateway will provide new
housing, shopping, and business opportunities for the residents of Laguna
Hills. Quality urban design using sustainable principles will improve
the character of the area and enhance the identity of the City. Gathering
places will enrich the community and provide social opportunities.
Existing residential neighborhoods will be preserved and respected, while
greater connectivity will promote walking from nearby neighborhoods to
Alicia Gateway.

                                           central portion of the City and consists of 39 acres. Figure LU-9 depicts
                                           the location of the Via Lomas opportunity area.
                                           The area is currently developed with 350 apartments and condominiums,
                                           consisting of one-story cluster condos and two-story apartments. A
                                           total of 102 units are within the Rancho Moulton and Rancho Niguel
                                           apartment complexes (51 units each). Both Rancho Moulton and
                                           Rancho Niguel were built in the early 1980s with Section 8 construction
                                           funds and provide affordable housing to low and moderate income
                                           residents. The Aliso Meadows condominiums have 248 units and
                                           provide an affordable home ownership opportunity for low and moderate
                                           income households.
                                           The opportunity for this area is to redevelop the site, maintain the current
   Figure LU-9                             number of existing rental opportunities on-site, provide additional
   Via Lomas Opportunity Area              homeownership opportunities, improve the quality of the housing stock,
                                           and add park and recreation opportunities. Additional development in
                                           the Via Lomas area would ensure a buffer area between the Via Lomas
                                           area and adjacent residential neighborhoods. Building height limitations
                                           would ensure that hillside neighborhoods surrounding the Via Lomas
                                           area retain their views and view corridors.

The General Plan designates this site as Planned Community Residential.
This designation will allow a maximum of 600 dwelling units through a
variety of different densities, which is an increase of 250 dwelling units
over existing conditions. Building height will be a combination of two-
and three-story structures. Additionally, up to about 13 acres of parks
and recreation amenities will be added.
The land use plan for Via Lomas is based upon development objectives
established in the goals and policies of the Land Use Element and
is consistent with the vision established in the Guiding Themes.
Redevelopment in Via Lomas will provide new housing and recreational
opportunities as well as improve the overall character of the Via Lomas

                                           commercial land uses, including neighborhood retail stores, restaurants, and
     Moulton/La Paz                        professional offices. The General Plan designation for this area is Community
     Opportunity Area                      Commercial.
                                           The key opportunity in this area is to extend the Community Commercial
                                           land use designation about 150 feet south. This would result in the loss of
                                           approximately 2.2 acres of unimproved, dedicated open space. This open space
                                           primarily consists of dirt and interspersed eucalyptus trees. The extension of the
                                           Community Commercial designation could allow redevelopment of the area
                                           with a minor expansion of square footage to commercial buildings, and reorient
                                           commercial buildings toward the street. Reorientation would improve the
                                           pedestrian environment along La Paz Road and create an active presence on the
                                           street by placing parking behind buildings away from the street. No residential
                                           development is allowed in this opportunity area. Local and regional trails and

adequate drainage facilities at the corner of Moulton Parkway and La Paz
Road will be retained and opportunities to enhance the visual appeal of
the open space corridor will be explored.
The Land Use Plan for Moulton and La Paz is based upon development
objectives established in the goals and policies of the Land Use Element
and is consistent with the vision established in the Guiding Themes.
Redevelopment may provide some additional square footage for new
business opportunities, which would contribute to the City’s fiscal
health and economic sustainability. This area could also be reconfigured
to stimulate pedestrian activity on adjacent streets. Sustainable
building methods and energy efficiency principles will also enhance
the environment. Figure LU-12 illustrates planning concepts for the
Moulton and La Paz opportunity area.

Future Study Areas
The City of Laguna Hills contains future study areas that have been
considered for revitalization in the future. The Land Use Plan does not
change any of the land use designations in the areas identified as future
study areas. However, opportunities exist to redevelop, improve, or
intensify some of the land uses in the future study areas. This section
describes the North Business Park, Urban Village, La Paz Gateway, and
Alicia Parkway/Aliso Hills Park Triangle future study areas. Figure LU-
13 depicts the locations of the future study areas.

North Business Park
The North Business Park future study area is located in the northern part of
Laguna Hills and is generally bounded by Lake Forest Drive on the north, Avenida
de La Carlota on the east, Ridge Route Drive on the south, and Mill Creek Drive
on the west. The area is approximately 380 acres. The majority (262 acres) of this
study area is designated as Mixed Use. To the east of this area and adjacent to I‑5
is approximately 54 acres designated as Freeway Commercial. A mobile home park
is also within the southern portion of the area.
Existing uses within the North Business Park area include offices, retail, restaurants,
motels, furniture stores, and industrial businesses. These businesses provide
important employment and services for the residents of the City and provide the
City with valuable sales tax revenue. No land use designation changes are proposed
in this area.
Since many of the facilities within this future study area are one-story tilt‑up
construction buildings, opportunities for intensification are possible. Larger and
better designed buildings could be built, perhaps containing more than one story,
subject to the established FAR requirements and other development standards for
the area. Additionally, some of the buildings in the southern portion pof the study
area could be reoriented toward Aliso Creek.
Urban Village
The Urban Village future study area is within the boundaries of the existing Urban
Village Specific Plan (UVSP) area, which was adopted in November 2002. The
UVSP regulates the development within the Urban Village area. This area consists
of 240 acres bounded by Paseo de Valencia on the north and west, Los Alisos
Boulevard on the south, and I‑5 on the east.
The Urban Village area is the heart of Laguna Hills providing a mix of retail, office,
financial, medical, residential, and transportation uses. The uses within this area
provide numerous goods and services to the City’s residents and also generate
major sales tax revenues for the City. The Laguna Hills Transportation Center is
located within this area, which is served by transit.
The General Plan Land Use designation for this area is Village Commercial. The
purpose of the Urban Village area is to develop a community core in which a
variety of public, regional commercial, recreational, and high density residential
uses work in concert to create an urban village. The UVSP, which governs the
land uses in this area, provides for a continuing mixture of land uses, including
retail, residential hotel, medical offices, and general offices. These uses should be
interconnected through safe pedestrian pathways and provide direct access to the
transit center, civic center, and regional trails.

City of Laguna Hills General Plan land use
                                           Opportunities in this area include intensification and redevelopment as already
                                           allowed under the UVSP. Additionally, the General Plan allows the addition of
                                           approximately 117,000 square feet of retail space, above and beyond that specified
                                           in the UVSP. Table LU-2 depicts the opportunities allowed under the UVSP and
                                           with the addition of retail space allowed under the General Plan.

                                           south of La Paz Road and adjacent to Cabot Road. The area consists of 49.9 acres
                                           and is designated as Community Commercial, Freeway Commercial, and Office
                                           Professional.
                                           The La Paz Gateway future study area contains a variety of commercial and office
                                           uses. Commercial uses include retail stores, restaurants, gas station, gym, and hotel.
                                           Some of the commercial centers within the La Paz Gateway have surplus, vacant
                                           leasable space.
                                           Opportunities within the La Paz Gateway area include revitalization and
                                           redevelopment. Buildings could be reconstructed and/or enlarged and reoriented to
                                           create more vibrant street life and to provide better pedestrian access from adjacent
                                           areas. The addition of iconic architecture would also serve to enhance the character
                                           of the area and the image of Laguna Hills. The upper portion of the La Paz Gateway
                                           future study area has excellent eastward views of hills and mountains that should be
                                           enhanced through any redesign and revitalization of the site.

City of Laguna Hills General Plan land use
                                           Use Element. Table LU-3 summarizes the land use distribution, and the resultant
                                           residential and nonresidential levels of development that can be expected from
                                           full implementation of land use policies established by this General Plan. Given
                                           the largely built-out character of Laguna Hills and the good condition of most
                                           buildings, significant redevelopment activities may not occur over the life of this
                                           General Plan. However, within opportunity areas described in this Element, future
                                           land use changes are anticipated.
                                           Goals and Policies
                                           The goals and policies section sets both broad and specific direction for the future
                                           of the City based on identified issues, as captured in the Guiding Themes and
                                           expressed by the community, City staff, and decision makers.
                                           Five major issue areas are addressed in the goals and policies of the Land Use
                                           Element. These major issues are:
                                           •	    Creating more active centers within the community through better physical
                                                 and social connections;
                                           •	    Protecting and enhancing established neighborhoods;
                                           •	    Providing sustainable development opportunities in specific areas;
                                           •	    Beautifying and enhancing the character of the community; and
                                           •	    Promoting responsible economic development.

                                           Connections
                                           The residents of the City value the existing character of Laguna Hills and seek
                                           to enhance the City’s attributes by encouraging pedestrian-friendly design that
                                           promotes physical connections between places and neighborhoods, and social
                                           connections between residents. Laguna Hills values well-landscaped, secure,
                                           clean, and human-scaled neighborhoods and business districts that accommodate
                                           walking. It is important to provide linkages that connect neighborhoods to
                                           schools, community centers, parks, and commercial services. Areas identified
                                           for mixed use development are defined by pedestrian-oriented streetscapes, and
                                           frequented as local gathering places (i.e., cafes, restaurants, plazas). These areas
                                           support surrounding neighborhoods and contribute to a more compact and
                                           consistent pattern of development.
                                           Goal LU-1: Create diverse and vibrant activity centers and events that bring
                                           people together as a community.
                                           Policy LU-1.1: Encourage new mixed use developments in the Urban Village,
                                           and other strategic locations, that complement and enhance Laguna Hills’ existing
                                           community character.

Respect for Existing
Neighborhoods
Laguna Hills values the character of its existing neighborhoods, as
they contribute to the extraordinary quality of life in the City. The
goals and policies in this section identify how the City will continue
to pursue proactive land use planning while protecting, maintaining,
and enhancing existing neighborhoods. These policies ensure that new
development complements and reinforces the unique characteristics of
existing neighborhoods through sensitive infill and transitions in scale
from adjacent centers and corridors.
Goal LU-2: Ensure development is compatible and interdependent
with neighboring uses.
Policy LU-2.1: Preserve the distinctive character of residential
neighborhoods by applying adopted design standards to new renovation
projects.

                                           of the City.
                                           Policy LU-2.4: Protect existing neighborhoods from the encroachment
                                           of incompatible activities and land uses.
                                           Policy LU-2.5: Require the use of buffers and transitional areas, such as
                                           increased setbacks and extensive landscaping, between new activities and
                                           existing land uses.
                                           Policy LU-2.6: Discourage high traffic-generating uses such as drive-
                                           throughs adjacent to sensitive uses such as schools, medical and assisted
                                           care facilities, and residential neighborhoods.
                                           Policy LU-2.7: Expand the use of transitional and buffer areas to buffer
                                           sensitive uses from freeways, arterials, point sources of water pollution,
                                           hazardous materials, and noise.
                                           Policy LU-2.8: Minimize impacts to surrounding neighborhoods and
                                           land uses through context-sensitive site design and architecture.
                                           Sustainable and Creative Infill
                                           Development
                                           Strategic growth and change in Laguna Hills will preserve existing
                                           viable neighborhoods while targeting new development to aging and
                                           underutilized commercial areas. The form of new development will
                                           be compact, mixed use and pedestrian oriented that will enhance the
                                           quality of life through improved connectivity with other parts of the
                                           City, greater access to amenities, enhanced safety, and greater housing
                                           and employment choices. New development will contain energy- and
                                           resource-efficient buildings and landscapes, access to effective public
                                           transit, and attractive pedestrian-friendly streets.
                                           Goal LU-3: Encourage infill development that involves the
                                           revitalization of property in an economically and environmentally

City of Laguna Hills General Plan Mobility
                                           Background
                                           The City of Laguna Hills is served by a well-established mobility network.
                                           The network includes a regional and local street system as well as
                                           Interstate 5 (I‑5) and State Route 73 (SR‑73). In addition, the City has a
                                           system of recreational trails that accommodate a variety of different users
                                           such as bikers, walkers, and equestrians. The City is also served by public
                                           transit and a system of bike trails and bike lanes. Although the City has
                                           an established multi-modal mobility network, local and regional traffic
                                           congestion, speeding, uncoordinated traffic signals, and overreliance on
                                           automobiles are issues that need to be addressed. The Mobility Plan
                                           addresses these issues and presents opportunities and solutions to these
                                           challenges.
                                           Mobility Plan
                                           A well-designed local street system is the foundation of the mobility
                                           network in Laguna Hills. Streets provide primary travel routes for
                                           automobiles, but also form the backbone of Laguna Hills’ transit,
                                           pedestrian, truck, and bicycle networks. Efficient movement within and
                                           through Laguna Hills and the region will be facilitated by developing
                                           and maintaining a well-designed, integrated mobility network. Easy and
                                           convenient access to vehicular, bus transit, pedestrian, and bicycle options
                                           within the City is essential to an efficient network. Coordination among
                                           the various modes is needed so that mobility and the design of City
                                           streets accommodate more options than just cars.
                                           The City has established goals and policies to maintain and improve
                                           streets, and to encourage the use of alternative transportation options.
                                           The Mobility Plan emphasizes pedestrian paths, bikeways, recreational
                                           trails, and transit that connect neighborhoods to shopping, schools, civic
                                           uses, and other activity areas. The Mobility Plan describes the approach
                                           for achieving these objectives.
                                           Efficient Local and Regional
                                           System
                                           The street classifications in Laguna Hills are based on Countywide
                                           Master Plan of Arterial Highways classifications as maintained by the
                                           Orange County Transportation Authority and adopted by the City
                                           upon incorporation. These classifications and street standards have
                                           been incorporated into the existing circulation system design. The
                                           classifications use a hierarchy system that classifies streets based on the
                                           intended traffic volume capacity and character of travel (i.e., regional vs.
                                           local). The following section discusses the street standards in Laguna
                                           Hills. The street network in Laguna Hills is depicted in Figure M-1.

                                           Smart Arterials
                                           The smart street is a specialized arterial highway implemented by OCTA.
                                           The purpose of these roads is to smooth traffic flow and improve street
                                           capacity through measures such as synchronizing traffic signals, providing
                                           bus turn-outs, improving intersections, minimizing access points, and
                                           adding travel lanes by removing on-street parking and roadway widening.
                                           Smart street arterials are typically 6 to 8 lane roadways with enhanced
                                           capacity to a standard arterial street. Moulton Parkway is classified as a 6
                                           lane smart street as it runs through the City.
                                           Major Arterials
                                           Major arterials are 6 lane divided roadways, with a typical right-of-way
                                           of 120 feet and raised landscaped median islands. The function of major
                                           arterials is to carry a large volume of regional traffic not handled by the
                                           freeway system. Unsignalized minor street and driveway access may be
                                           allowed, but signalized access is preferred, and left-turn restrictions are
                                           typically placed at unsignalized access locations. Curbside parking is not
                                           allowed. Major arterials can accommodate between 30,000 and 45,000
                                           vehicle trips per day at level of service (LOS) C.
                                           Major arterials in the City include:
                                           •	   Alicia Parkway

                                           Primary Arterials
                                           Primary arterials are 4 lane divided roadways, with a typical right-of-
                                           way of 100 feet, with painted or raised landscaped medians. Like major
                                           arterials, primary arterials are designed to carry a large volume of traffic
                                           but at reduced capacities. Left-turn restrictions will generally be placed at
                                           minor unsignalized driveways. Curbside parking may not be appropriate
                                           in more heavily traveled segments, especially in segments with class II on-
                                           street marked bikeways. A primary arterial is designed to accommodate
                                           between 20,000 and 30,000 vehicle trips per day at LOS C.
                                           Primary arterials in the City include:

                                           Secondary Arterials
                                            Secondary arterials are 4 lane undivided (no median) roadways, with a
                                            typical right-of-way of 80 feet. A secondary arterial serves as a collector,
                                            distributing traffic between local streets and major and primary arterials.
                                            Although some secondary arterials serve as through routes, most provide
                                            more direct access to surrounding land uses than major or primary
                                            arterials. A secondary arterial is designed to accommodate approximately
                                            10,000 to 20,000 vehicle trips per day at LOS C.
                                           Secondary arterials in the City include:
                                           •    Avenida de la Carlota Note: For the section of Avenida de la Carlota
                                                between El Toro Road and Los Alisos Blvd, the typical right-of-way
                                                can vary between 72 to 88 feet. The right-of-way will include a total of
                                                4 traffic lanes (including a left turn lane) with up to 64 feet of
                                                roadway along with either two 12 foot landscape parkway/sidewalk or
                                                a single 12 foot landscape parkway/sidewalk. The single 12 foot
                                                landscape parkway/sidewalk will adjoin the westerly side of the street.
                                           •     Cabot Road (south of Oso Parkway)

                                           Collector (Commuter) Arterials
                                           Collector or commuter arterials are 2 lane undivided, unrestricted access
                                           roadways, with a typical right-of-way width of 56 feet. A collector
                                           or commuter arterial functions primarily as a commuter facility but
                                           differs from a local collector street in its ability to handle through traffic
                                           movements between two arterials. A collector or commuter arterial is
                                           provided to accommodate up to approximately 10,000 vehicle trips per
                                           day at LOS C.
                                           Collector arterials in the City include:
                                            •   Santa Vittoria Drive

Augmented Arterials
The Mobility Element applies Augmented Arterials to certain roadway
locations as a capacity enhancement strategy. The intent is to customize
such streets for Laguna Hills, while retaining the essential characteristics
for consistency with the MPAH. Two roadway segments that are
designated with the Augmented classification are as follows:
     •	    La Paz Road between I-5 and McIntyre Street is designated as an
           Augmented Primary. The augmentation is in the form of auxiliary
           lanes on each side of the four-lane road. Such lanes provide space
           for weaving, merging and queuing, thereby enhancing the roadway
           to a representative ADT capacity of around 45,000 (compared to
           20,000-30,00 for a standard Primary at LOS C).
     •	    Cabot Road from La Paz Road to Nellie Gail Road is classified as an
           Augmented Secondary. The augmentation is in the form of a raised
           median complementing the four-lane road. The median provides
           an aesthetic and functional treatment, essentially allowing the
           arterial to function somewhat like a Primary Arterial, but retaining
           the Secondary classification. As a result, a representative ADT
           volume of 32,000 can be achieved (compared to 10,000 to
           20,000 for a standard Secondary at LOS C).
Regional Roads
The roadway network in Laguna Hills is connected to an efficient
regional circulation system. I‑5 is the major north-south transportation
facility that defines the eastern boundary of the City of Laguna Hills.
I-5 provides access to destinations throughout southern California and
beyond. Within the City, access to I-5 is provided from Lake Forest
Drive, El Toro Road, Alicia Parkway, and La Paz Road. Access to I‑5 is
also provided by Oso Parkway, just east of the City limits.
The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor (SR-73) forms a portion
of the City’s western and southern border and is another north-south
facility. SR-73 is a toll road, which extends between the Interstate
405 interchange in Costa Mesa to the north, and an I-5 interchange
in Laguna Niguel to the south. SR-73 on‑ and off-ramps are located
adjacent to the City limits at La Paz Road, Moulton Parkway, and
Greenfield Drive.
The City will continue to coordinate with regional and State
transportation planning efforts to provide and maintain safe and
convenient access to the regional circulation system.

                                                   and businesses requires establishing suitable performance criteria.
                                                   Performance criteria have a policy component that establishes a desired
                                                   level of service, as well as a technical component that specifies how traffic
                                                   forecast data can be used to measure the achievement of the criteria.
                                                   The technical evaluation of the roadway system in Laguna Hills is
                                                   performed using volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. V/C ratios are
                                                   calculated based on current or future average daily traffic (ADT) volumes
                                                   and daily capacity values for the various types of arterials. A level of
                                                   service scale is used to evaluate roadway performance based on V/C
                                                   ratios. The level of service (LOS) levels range from “A” to “F,” with LOS

At the local level, evaluation of volumes, capacities, and levels of service     Traffic Calming Examples
on the City street system is based on peak hour intersection data, since
intersections are the primary limiting factor affecting traffic flow on City
streets. The City uses peak hour intersection capacity utilization (ICU)
values to calculate the performance of intersections within its jurisdiction.
         road sections coming later
The City’s performance standard for intersections is LOS “D” which is an
ICU value of .90 or less.
                                                                                                             Enforcement
This LOS “D” policy represents a desirable threshold for attaining
acceptable mobility on the City’s arterial street system over time. It is
recognized however, that not all traffic growth is attributable to land
use decisions made by the City and that specific intersections may
have physical or other constraints that create difficulties in making the
necessary improvements. Under such circumstances, a finding can be
made that a specific location is a “critical intersection” with LOS able to
degrade below “D.” At the same time, any such critical intersections are
to be monitored over time to determine if 1) improvements at nearby                                        Signage
locations direct enough traffic from the critical intersection to bring
it to an acceptable LOS or 2) changes occur that reduce traffic at the
intersection or create opportunities for making physical improvements.
Principal Intersections
There are Principal Intersections in the City that generally determine
the overall performance of the City’s roadway system, and are thereby                                                    Traffic
                                                                                                                         Circle
considered to have strategic importance within the overall Mobility Plan.
The intent is that these intersections be regularly monitored and that
priority be given to them in implementing roadway improvements. The
list of Principal Intersections is maintained by the City Engineer.
Traffic Calming and Safety
                                                                                                                         1/2 Street

As traffic in the City and region increases, motorists seek alternatives to
congested arterials by using local roads, particularly through residential
neighborhoods, to avoid congestion. The City is committed to the
preservation of its residential neighborhoods and has established
policies that contribute to the preservation efforts. One of the ways to
help control the movement of traffic through an area is through traffic
calming techniques. Traffic calming measures can slow traffic on local                                                    Pop-out/
streets or divert traffic from roadways not intended to accommodate                                                       Bulb-out/
high traffic levels. The effect of traffic calming is to create a safer, quieter                                          Curb
                                                                                                                          Extenstion
environment for certain neighborhoods or areas of the City.
 Traffic calming measures also help to create more human-scale places                                Figure M-2
that are safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Figure M-2 shows examples                               Traffic Calming Techniques

                                           Landscaping, trees, sidewalks, and bike lanes also help serve as traffic
                                           calming techniques. Numerous traffic calming measures are available
                                           to slow traffic and enhance safety. The selection of appropriate traffic
                                           calming techniques for a given area will require a comprehensive site
                                           specific study by the City and/or appropriate local, regional, or state
                                           agencies.
                                           Traffic calming measures can result in varying degrees of liability exposure
                                           to the City. Therefore, such measures must incorporate engineering
                                           design features and practices that do not result in unacceptable exposure
                                           for the City.

                                           Walking
                                           Walkability, access, and connections are essential components of a mobility
                                           system that easily and specifically accommodates pedestrians. Walkability
                                           is fostered by wide sidewalks, safe street crossings, features that encourage
                                           cautious driving, a pleasant and safe environment, and destinations to
                                           walk to. Walkways, safe crossings, paths, trails, and pedestrian short-
                                           cuts allow people to get from one destination point to another with ease.
                                           These features are important for providing connections to schools, parks,
                                           shopping, jobs, and between neighborhoods. Children, in particular,
                                           should be able to walk safely to school. Increased numbers of people
                                           walking along streets create a safer environment and thereby encourage
                                           others to also walk. High levels of pedestrian activity support active and
                                           vibrant urban communities.
                                           In Laguna Hills, walkable environments will be created and enhanced by
                                           providing a pedestrian network that connects activity areas. Pedestrian
                                           improvements such as timed crosswalks, pedestrian grade separations
                                           from traffic, and enhanced lighting in areas with homes, jobs, shops, and
                                           schools can promote walkabilty and can help increase walking as a means
                                           of transportation and recreation. This reduces automobile travel and
                                           contributes to the overall health, vitality, and sense of community. The
                                           City will also strive to beautify certain streets within the community to
                                           add aesthetic appeal to various areas and enhance the City’s overall identity.
                                           Bikeways
                                           Bicycling for recreation and transportation is a practical option for
                                           many in Laguna Hills. Increasing cycling opportunities in the City is
                                           an important Citywide goal. To achieve this goal, the City will provide

a convenient network of bike paths and lanes that connect residences,
jobs, shopping, services, transit, recreation, civic uses, and schools.
Convenient and secure bicycle parking, showers at places of employment,
and an educated driving public can make biking more attractive.
The City has an existing system of bikeways that provide internal
community links as well as bicycle access to many of the surrounding
communities. Laguna Hills utilizes the standards developed by Caltrans
to classify bikeways within the City. Table M-2 describes the bike
standards as well as general locations within the City.

In addition to the bikeways listed in Table M-2 and illustrated in
Figure M-3, several arterials in the City have sufficient right-of-way to
accommodate additional bikeways and could fill in missing links in the
City’s bike network. The City will continue to explore opportunities to
upgrade and expand the bike network. A comprehensive bike network
will provide an alternative to driving and will connect neighborhoods
to shopping, jobs, services, schools, other activity centers, as well as the
regional transportation systems.
Recreational Trails
Laguna Hills contains a network of pedestrian and equestrian trails that
traverse portions of the City and connect to trails outside of the City,
including nearby wilderness areas. Trails enhance community mobility
and provide opportunities for recreation and exercise. A well-defined,
interconnected trail system can also reduce dependence on the automobile
for short local trips. The Conservation and Open Space Element describes
the trail system.

Transit and Transportation
Demand Management
An effective and efficient transit network is an important component of
the Mobility Element. Connecting neighborhoods, shopping, services,
and recreation areas to transit will reduce reliance on vehicles and achieve
environmental benefits. As opportunity areas redevelop and provide
additional housing, appropriate and effective transit should be in place.
Public bus service in Laguna Hills is provided by the Orange County
Transportation Authority (OCTA). OCTA transit routes provide access
to residences, jobs, recreation areas, civic uses, shopping, and services
throughout Laguna Hills, and connect to numerous other destinations
in Orange County. Some of the routes also connect to Metrolink and
Amtrak rail services just south of the City in Laguna Niguel and north of
the City in Irvine, at the Irvine Transportation Center. OCTA routinely
updates its long-range service plans to respond to necessary changes to
service levels and route configurations. Currently, 10 fixed routes provide
bus service to portions of Laguna Hills. Table M-3 and Figure M-4 detail
OCTA bus routes that provide service to Laguna Hills as of 2008. All
routes, except bus route 70, serve the Laguna Hills Transportation Center,
which is located near the Laguna Hills Mall. A park and ride facility is
also located at the Laguna Hills Transportation Center and in the Laguna
Hills Mall parking lot.

Expanding transit and paratransit options, including promoting increased
use of transit among City residents and employees is an important City
objective. The City will coordinate with OCTA to expand and improve
bus service within the City, especially as opportunity areas redevelop and
additional housing, shopping, and services are added. Where appropriate as
justified by ridership, the City will also encourage the provision of attractive,
well designed, and appropriate transit amenities such as shaded bus stop or
shelters. No advertisements shall be allowed on bus stops/shelters/benches
within the City.

operations to provide paratransit (door-to-door) service to persons
whose disabilities prevent them from using accessible fixed-route public
transit. Paratransit services are transportation services such as carpooling,
vanpooling, taxi service, and dial-a-ride programs. In Laguna Hills,
OCTA provides shared-ride paratransit services via the ACCESS program
for people who are unable to use the regular, fixed-route bus service
because of functional limitations caused by a disability.
Rail Service
Rail service is an important mobility option for residents of Laguna Hills
to reach destinations outside of the City. Although the City of Laguna
Hills is not directly served by rail, the Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo rail
station is located approximately ½ mile south of Laguna Hills, within
the City of Laguna Niguel. The Irvine station is located approximately
3 miles north of the City on Barranca Parkway. Both Metrolink and
Amtrak trains serve these stations. Metrolink provides daily service to
these stations, including weekends, via the Orange County Line, and the
Inland Empire - Orange County Line.
The OCTA Board of Directors approved the Metrolink Service
Expansion Program (MSEP) in 2005 with the goal of improving the
frequency of rail service between the Fullerton and Laguna Niguel/
Mission Viejo stations. Service could be expanded to provide trains
every 30 minutes between these stations. Included in the program are
station enhancements at the two stations nearest Laguna Hills: Irvine
and Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo. Improvements to the Irvine Station,
including a 1,500-space parking structure, have been completed. Future
improvements have been identified for the Laguna Niguel/ Mission Viejo
station.
Parking
Parking availability is important for the overall quality of life in Laguna
Hills and the vitality of shopping and service areas. A lack of parking
frustrates residents, businesses, and visitors, while too much parking
wastes valuable land and impedes the City’ economic, aesthetic, and
environmental objectives. Greater management of parking spaces in
the City can help achieve mobility, environmental, and community
development goals. As portions of the City redevelop, additional parking
may be necessary to accommodate greater intensity of development. It
is important that parking demand generated by future development does
not negatively impact adjacent uses and neighborhoods. The City will
utilize a broad range of parking management tools and strategies to avoid
excessive parking requirements and to prevent parking spillover effects.

                                           Demand Management
                                           An efficient and successful transit system in Laguna Hills will contribute
                                           to reduced traffic congestion, reduce the need for costly roadway
                                           improvement projects, and improve air quality. Transit also provides
                                           mobility options to those residents who cannot drive or choose not to
                                           drive, such as youth and seniors.
                                           Transportation demand management strategies will help to address a

transportation demand management solutions, such as ride-sharing,
carpooling, and flexible work schedules.
Policy M-5.4: Educate residents of all ages about local mobility choices.
Policy M-5.5: Work with local schools to improve and advertise
nonautomotive options for youths and teens to get to school and after-
school activities.
Policy M-5.6: Evaluate the transportation needs of seniors, including
paratransit service for seniors and disabled persons.
Policy M-5.7: Where appropriate based on ridership, provide non-
advertising transit shelters and benches that are appropriately located,
well designed, comfortable, and attractive.
Parking
Vehicular parking is a necessary component of any land use. New
development and redevelopment projects will provide sufficient parking
to meet the generated demand. At the same time, the City will employ
innovative parking management solutions to avoid excessive parking
requirements that detract from the economic, environmental, and
aesthetic objectives of projects. Reduced parking requirements may be
provided in areas that are highly walkable and well served by transit.
                                                                                                              M-19

                                           parking issues through implementation of a broad range of parking
                                           management tools and strategies.
                                           Summary of Approach
                                           The goals, policies, and programs in the Mobility Element will help the
                                           City to improve streets for safer automobile travel and for pedestrians,
                                           bikes, and transit users. The Mobility Element encourages safer travel
                                           and the use of alternative transportation options with particular emphasis
                                           on improvements to community connectivity through enhanced
                                           pedestrian and bicycle routes and greater transit use. Table M-6 identifies
                                           the six major issue areas guiding the Mobility Element. These major
                                           issues represent the direction the City will take in its mobility goals,
                                           policies, and programs to implement the vision of Laguna Hills as
                                           captured in the Guiding Themes and expressed in the Mobility Plan.

services are provided in the northern portion of the City by the ETWD
and in the southern portion of the City by the MNWD. The division
line runs through a neighborhood north of Alicia Parkway and south
of Aliso Creek (see Figure CSF-2 in Community Services and Facilities
Element). Water from both Districts comes from the Colorado River
and the State Water Project (which draws water from the San Francisco-
San Joaquin Bay Delta) and travels hundreds of miles to the local water
districts through an intricate aboveground and underground delivery
system operated by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California.
Due to the nearly built-out nature of Laguna Hills, basic infrastructure
and adequate capacities for water services currently exist. Both the
MNWD and ETWD updated their Urban Water Management Plans
(UWMPs) in 2005 and determined that current water supplies, facilities,
and storage will be adequate to meet future demands with all areas
under their jurisdictions. However, the City would continue to work
with the Districts to implement their UWMPs and actively look for
opportunities to promote the development of water efficient practices
and to implement water conservation programs to ensure adequate water
supplies for the future.
Water Conservation
Water conservation represents the most cost-effective and
environmentally sound way to reduce current and future demand.
Residents of Laguna Hills can take many actions to reduce water use,
such as using water-conserving toilets and washers, fixing leaks, planting
low water use landscaping, and simply avoiding overwatering plants.
Gardens and turf consume a high percentage of residential water.
Landscaping with low water use plants represents an effective method
of conserving water. The City continues to encourage the residents
of Laguna Hills to reduce water consumption and promote water
conservation through these methods above.
In addition, reclaimed or recycled water (water that has received at least
secondary treatment and basic disinfection at a domestic wastewater
treatment facility) can be used for landscape irrigation and industrial
use. Within the boundaries of Laguna Hills, wastewater flows via gravity
and pumping to the local wastewater treatment facilities operated by
the South Orange County Wastewater Authority where it can be treated
and made available through MNWD and EWD for nonpotable uses,
primarily landscape irrigation. The City continues to support the
expansion of reclaimed water use in the community and is committed to
working closely with each water district to manage and conserve water
resources within Laguna Hills.

                                                                            City of Laguna Hills General Plan conservation and Open space
•	   Bioretention (plant‑ and soil-based water retention)
•	   Vegetated swales
•	   Vegetated buffer strips
•	   Green rooftop systems
•	   Rooftop rainwater collection systems
•	   Stormwater cascades
The incorporation of one or more of these LID design techniques
results in a decrease of impervious (paved) materials and an increase
of permeable materials and water infiltration, ultimately decreasing
stormwater runoff and reducing water pollution. These techniques
should be limited to locations not susceptible to geotechnical instability.
The City will continue to implement the required BMPs in accordance
with the NPDES Stormwater Discharge Permit as well as encourage the
use of natural drainage solutions and LID standards, such as vegetated
swales and stormwater cascades to slow flows and filter out contaminants.
Energy
Energy is essential to maintaining the existing quality of life, economic
development, and sustainability of the region. Recognizing the sources
of our energy—particularly those sources that are nonrenewable—and
understanding the consequences associated with energy waste would assist
in more efficient use. With limited, nonrenewable resources providing
the major source of energy, Laguna Hills recognizes the importance of
efficient energy use and conservation by all community residents.
Electricity and Natural Gas
The primary sources of energy in Laguna Hills are electricity and
natural gas. Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric
(SDG&E) provide electricity services to Laguna Hills, while Southern
California Gas Company and SDG&E are the providers for natural gas.
Efficient energy use can be encouraged by changing customer behavior,
rewarding use of energy-saving appliances, and employing building
design and construction approaches that reduce electric power and
natural gas usage.
Alternative Energy Resources and Conservation
Laguna Hills residents, the business community, and institutions can use
less energy through simple conservation techniques, thereby contributing
to environmental enhancements locally and throughout the region.
Energy requirements and pollutants associated with the generation of
energy can be reduced through innovative architectural design, building
construction, structural orientation, and landscaping. Alternative/
renewable energy sources, such as solar (both active and passive), provide
opportunities to reduce reliance on more traditional sources. The Land

Wildlife species associated with these vegetation types in the City include
common reptiles, birds, and mammals such as side-blotched lizard,
blackbirds, cowbirds, horned lark, and mourning dove, and Beechey
ground squirrel. Raptors foraging over these habitats, in particular
nonnative grasslands, may include red-tailed hawk and northern harrier.
Despite the developed nature of Laguna Hills and the disturbed or
nonnative condition of much of the City’s landscape, some of the
biological resources described above are considered sensitive by the
resource agencies, including the CDFG, USFWS, U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE), and Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB). In particular, all federal or State jurisdictional waters,
including vegetated wetlands, are regulated by the CDFG, USACE,
and RWQCB and thus are considered sensitive or constrained resources
when evaluating any proposed actions that may affect these jurisdictional
waters, regardless of whether the habitat is disturbed.
If a project were to impact jurisdictional waters, permits would likely be
required from the CDFG, USACE, and RWQCB. Native coastal sage
scrub habitat, even if disturbed and disconnected, is considered sensitive
habitat by the CDFG and USFWS. Although sensitive species (i.e.,
State or federally listed species, species considered rare or endangered
by environmental organizations, State species of concern, or species
protected by regulations such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act) do not
have high potential to occur within the City, the potential occurrence
of these species could pose a constraint to proposed actions Citywide.
Such species include Cooper’s hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, least Bell’s
vireo, coastal California gnatcatcher, yellow warbler, yellow-breasted
chat, and California mastiff bat, among others. Permit authorization
from regulatory agencies would be required if a proposed project were to
have the potential to impact sensitive species or their habitats. Permit
requirements would be determined on a project-specific basis. Protective
measures would need to be incorporated into project design and/or
construction to minimize adverse effects. In addition, the City will
continue to enforce policies to protect and preserve riparian areas, creek
corridors and other drainages that support the biological resources
discussed above.
Scenic Resources
The City’s scenic resources are preserved for the mutual enjoyment of
community residents and visitors. The topography of Laguna Hills varies
greatly from north to south. Elevations range from approximately 200
feet above sea level at the northern end of the City to over 650 feet above
sea level atop prominent ridges in the Nellie Gail Ranch area. Due to
this varied topography, view opportunities are present within Laguna
Hills (Figure COS-2).

                                                         Cultural and Historic Resources
                                                         Cultural and historic resources refer to the celebration of the people
                                                         and history that have ultimately shaped the community of the Laguna
                                                         Hills into what it is today. Laguna Hills was built on one of the major
                                                         land grants developed during the Rancho Era. Following Mexico’s
                                                         independence from Spain in 1821, those who had served in the
                                                         government or who had friends in authority, were given vast lands for
                                                         cattle grazing. The 13,000-acre Rancho Niguel—which covered a good
                                                         portion of the Saddleback Valley and would serve as the future site for
                                                         Laguna Hills—was handed to Don Juan Avila. Decades later, the land
                                                         was sold to Lewis Moulton in 1874, and the famous ranch was upgraded
                                                         to cover some 22,000 acres. In the early 1960s, the sprawling Moulton
                                                         Ranch was divided up and turned into communities, with one of those
                                                         divisions representing Laguna Hills.
                                                         As Laguna Hills has evolved over time into a built-out city, the likelihood
                                                         of finding new or undiscovered cultural and historic resources is limited.
                                                         However, artifacts have previously been recovered from archaeological
                                                         sites and areas in and around Laguna Hills. Thirty-one archaeological
                                                         sites have been identified within a ½-mile radius of the City. Of these,

14 archaeological sites are located within the City boundaries and 17
are located outside of the City boundaries. In addition, 10 isolates are
located within a ½-mile radius of the City boundaries. No isolates are
located within the City boundaries.
Two of the 17 sites that are located within the ½-mile radius of Laguna
Hills, but not within the City boundaries, were determined eligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or the
California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR). Typical resources
found at these sites are characterized by a low density shell midden, lithic
flaking debris (chert and quartzite), flaked stone tools, groundstone
(manos, pestles, and bowl), fire-affected rock, and human remains. The
City recognizes the importance of these resources and seeks to identify
and protect locally important sites, buildings, and memorabilia that
reflect the history of the community.
Laguna Hills assesses and mitigates the potential impacts of private
development and public facilities and infrastructure to significant cultural
resources pursuant to the provisions of the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). Pursuant to the State CEQA Guidelines, historical
resources are not limited to officially listed resources but also include
resources found to be eligible for listing at the local, State, and federal
levels. Cultural resources that reflect the history of a community, from
descendants of the earliest Native Americans to later explorers, settlers,
and immigrants, are important to the community and, therefore, warrant
protection by the City. Furthermore, the accessibility of information
about important cultural resources to the public for educational,
religious, cultural, scientific, and other purposes should be supported and
encouraged by the City.
Paleontological Resources
Paleontological resources, or fossils, are the remains and/or traces of
prehistoric (i.e., older than approximately 10,000 years) plant and
animal life. Fossils provide direct evidence of ancient organisms
and document the patterns of organic evolution and extinction that
have characterized the history of life over the past 3.4 billion years.
Paleontological resources, like archaeological resources, represent a
limited, nonrenewable, and sensitive scientific and educational resource.
The geologic formations present within the Laguna Hills area consist of
Sespe Formation, Vaqueros Formation, Monterey Formation, Capistrano
Formation, Niguel Formation, Non-Marin Terrace deposits, and Young
Alluvium (including slopewash and artificial fill). As shown in Table
COS-2, the paleontological resource sensitivity of these formations ranges
from no sensitivity to high sensitivity.

                                                              however, the City assesses and mitigates the potential impacts of private

future development proposals to ensure that cultural resources (including
prehistoric, historic, and paleontological) are conserved in compliance
with CEQA requirements.
Mineral Resources
Pursuant to the California Mining and Reclamation Act, the California
Geological Survey designated areas within the southern and western
portions of Laguna Hills as Mineral Resource Zone (MRZ) 1, and areas
in the northern and eastern portion of the City as Mineral Resource Zone
(MRZ) 3. The two mineral resource zones are defined as follows:
MRZ 1: Areas where adequate information indicates that no significant
mineral deposits are present, or where it has been determined that little
likelihood exists for their presence.
MRZ 3: Area containing mineral deposits of which the significance
cannot be evaluated from the available data.
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA) of 1975
does not require local governments to protect land designated as MRZ
1. The remainder of the City is designated MRZ 3, indicating that the
significance of mineral resources could not be evaluated from available
data. The City is responsible for recognizing lands designated as MRZ 3
and, if significant aggregate resources are ultimately found, State policy
favors conservation and development of those resources. Due to the
built-out nature of Laguna Hills, areas suited for mineral extraction are
extremely limited; however, should mineral resources be discovered in the
future, the City will maintain awareness and comply with State policies
regarding protection and extraction.
Parks and Play
Community Parks
Parks fulfill a number of important functions; they are the green,
“breathing” spaces of the City, a place for children to play and explore,
a staging area for civic functions, and a “get-away” for sports and
relaxation that is close to home and work. Parks also help to preserve
natural features of the landscape and habitat areas vital to the City’s
environmental health and sense of place.
There are 14 public parks within Laguna Hills. Amenities at each include
sports fields, ballparks, tennis courts, picnic shelters, Playgrounds,
playgrounds, walking trails, fountains, restrooms, and lighting. Nearby
golf courses, regional parks, and open space in the coastal foothills offer
additional outdoor recreation opportunities.
                                                                                                                                  COS-15

Regional and Wilderness Parks
Several regional and wilderness parks are easily accessible to the residents
of Laguna Hills. Regional parks frequently encompass large areas of
land and may include special recreation features such as lakes, trails, and
natural open space. These parks play an important part in providing
a wider spectrum of recreation opportunities for the residents of the
community. Aliso and Wood Canyon Regional Park and Laguna Niguel
Regional Park are both located just to the south of the City boundary.
Crystal Cove State Park, Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, Salt Creek
Corridor Regional Park, Arroyo Trabuco Regional Park, O’Neil Regional
Park, Mason Regional Park, Thomas F. Riley Wilderness Park, and
Caspers Wilderness Park are additional regional recreation sites within a
short drive from Laguna Hills.
Recreational Trails
Recreation is proactive: it promotes wellness of individuals of all ages.
The residents of Laguna Hills have become increasingly aware of the
benefits of and need for leisure time to regularly exercise the mind and
body. Promoting a spirit of play is also important in maintaining a
healthy, quality lifestyle.
Currently, the trail system within Laguna Hills is maintained by the City,
the County of Orange, the Nellie Gail Ranch Owners Association, and
Lomas Laguna Homeowners Association. This system of trails provides
both internal trails for walking, biking, and horseback riding as well as
external links to trails that lead into nearby wilderness areas and adjacent
cities. The trails in Laguna Hills are classified as Pedestrian/Equestrian
Trails or Multi-use Corridors. Table COS-5 provides a description of the
existing trail types, uses, locations, and linkages to adjacent communities.
Pedestrian/Equestrian Trails
Sidewalks contribute to the walkability of Laguna Hills. Due to the
built-out nature of Laguna Hills, these suburban sidewalks constitute the
majority of pedestrian by-ways provided within City limits. In addition to
sidewalks, many portions of the City are suitable for equestrian uses, which
have been long established. The Nellie Gail Ranch Owners Association
has built, and continues to maintain, a system of trails in the southeast
portion of the city that are primarily intended for equestrian uses. The
trail network provides an internal network of private trails intended for
Nellie Gail residents but also provides connections to County trails leading
into larger wilderness parks in adjacent communities. Signal buttons at
equestrian height are provided at several intersections along the trails and
there are four tunnels beneath major arterials in the City to provide safer
linkages for equestrians.
                                                                                                                                   COS-19

While most of the pedestrian/equestrian trails are maintained While
most of the pedestrian/equestrian trails are maintained by the County
or are privately maintained, opportunities exist for additional City trails
and linkages that would increase the livability of the community by
connecting parks, open space, schools, and other community activity
centers. Opportunities also exist to provide an enhanced trail system
that will link adjacent communities and provide opportunities for long-
distance equestrian use. Figure COS-3 illustrates the existing collection
of trails and multi-use corridors within the City and also identifies areas
where potential opportunities exist to increase community connections
and provide the missing links in the current network of trails. The City
will continue to maintain and make improvements to the existing trail
system as a whole to encourage more active use and promote walkability
and community connections.
Multi-Use Corridors
Multi-Use corridors include pedestrian and equestrian uses, but also have
adequate right-of way to accommodate bikeways. Multi-Use corridors
can either be composed of a bikeway and pedestrian/equestrian trail
separated by a fence or median, or a bikeway with a soft shoulder wide
enough to be used as a pedestrian/equestrian trail. Several arterials
have been identified as having the additional right-of-way needed
to accommodate bikeways, and are therefore eligible to be multi-use
corridors. The proposed multi-use corridors identified in Figure COS-3
are not meant to represent the only possible corridors for this type of
recreational trail; rather, they serve as examples of opportunities which
could add significant value and enhance the connectivity of the existing
trail system. The City will conduct a Recreational Trails Gaps Analysis
Report to evaluate the missing links in existing trail system in order
to identify areas where linkage opportunities exist that would further
increase the livability of the community.
Bikeways
The City has an existing system of bikeways that provides internal
community links as well as bicycle access to many of the surrounding
communities. The Mobility Element provides a more detailed
description of the City’s bikeways.

Although the City of Laguna Hills has limited options for agriculture
because of its urbanized nature, it can help support the availability of
sustainable local food choices by supporting local farmers markets and
providing opportunities for community farms and gardens to be located
in public spaces. The City is committed to improving access to healthy
and local foods and continues to seek out opportunities to incorporate
community gardens and local agriculture into areas of Laguna Hills.
Air Quality and Global Climate

Air Quality
Laguna Hills is located in the South Coast Air Basin (Basin), which
consists of four counties: San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, and
Orange, including some portions of the area once referred to as the
Southeast Desert Air Basin (Figure COS-4).
The Basin is currently classified as a federal and State nonattainment area
for ozone (O3), particulate matter smaller than 10 microns in diameter
(PM10), and particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter
(PM2.5). This means that the measured concentrations of these pollutants
have exceeded the federal and State standards. The Basin is classified as
a federal attainment/maintenance area and a State attainment area for
carbon monoxide (CO). If an area is redesignated from nonattainment
to attainment, the federal Clean Air Act requires the preparation of
a maintenance plan that demonstrates how the air quality standard
would be maintained for at least 10 years; the area is then designated as
a “maintenance” area. The entire Basin currently meets the federal and
State standards for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and
lead (Pb) and is classified as an attainment area for these pollutants.
In the Basin, the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(SCAQMD) is the agency responsible for the administration of
federal and State air quality laws, regulations, and policies. Included

agricultural operations. Other sources include windblown dust, pollen,
salts, brake dust, and tire ware. Combustion sources such as vehicles,
diesel engines, and industrial facilities also emit PM10 and PM2.5. The
most significant regional sources of O3, NO2, and CO are automobiles
and other on‑road vehicles. O3 is formed by the reaction of reactive
organic gases (ROG) and nitrogen oxides (NOX), which are combustion
products from gas and diesel engines. Other important sources of ROG
are paints, coatings, and process solvents.
Laguna Hills continues to support the SCAQMD in their efforts to
implement regional air quality plans. Further, the City will continue to
educate the residents of Laguna Hills and encourage energy conservation
strategies for improving air quality.
Global Climate Change
The built environment is a primary contributor to climate change and
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The global scientific community
has expressed very high confidence (i.e., at least 90 percent) that global
warming is anthropogenic, i.e., caused by humans, and that global
warming will lead to adverse climate change effects around the globe
(IPCC 2007). The General Plan recognizes a shift to development
decisions, growth, and infrastructure investments that addresses climate
change by reducing GHG emissions and responding to the potential
effects of global warming.
Because it provides a comprehensive, long-term framework for
development, investment, and growth in the City, the General Plan is
the logical place to address climate change. The General Plan policies
addressing land use patterns, future growth, mobility, green building,
City operations, and other issues will affect the rate of GHG emissions in
the City for the long term. The Guiding Themes and policies of focused
revitalization, efficient transportation, green building, and sustainable
connections promote a more energy efficient built environment that
reduces GHG emissions.
The specific impacts of climate change are highly regional and even local
in nature. The City will plan for adaptation to the effects of climate
change, including greater drought conditions that reduce drinking
water supplies; increased risk of hazards like flooding and wildfires; and
increased instance, severity, and duration of heat waves. Because climate
change is bringing about previously unrecorded conditions, the City’s
adaptation policies will be based on projections from the best available
scientific modeling.
Neither mitigation nor adaptation alone can eliminate all climate
change impacts, but together they can significantly reduce the risks of
                                                                                                                                 COS-25

                                                      whether the climate is stabilized at a safe level. Near-term action is particularly

                                                      lifetime of the City’s General Plan. Without substantial emissions reductions
                                                      in the near term, the resulting increase in temperature is projected to cause

                                                      agricultural crops. Because the impacts of GHG emissions in the next few
                                                      decades are long term and potentially catastrophic and irreversible, mitigation
                                                      policies implemented now will have an impact far into the future. Furthermore,
                                                      since not all climate change effects are avoidable, it is important to begin

a full-functioning catering kitchen, two classroom facilities, an Art Room,
and a Physical Activity Room. The Sports Complex features a softball
field, baseball field, two soccer fields, skate park, roller hockey rink, snack
bar, picnic shelters, and a prehistoric themed playground.
Laguna Hills also offers a range of classes and activities for all members of
the community. These classes are announced in City Views, a document
published quarterly by the City. City Views includes an activity schedule
with classes and activities for all ages, such as special community events,
dance, sports and fitness, cultural arts, personal development, and other
social activities. These activities take place in a number of locations
throughout the City, including the Community Center as well as parks
and schools.
Additionally, the Florence Sylvester Senior Center operated
independently by the Orange County Community Foundation provides
a range of services and programs for the community’s senior citizens. At
this center, lunches are provided daily from Monday through Friday, as
well as an occasional dinner period and professional entertainment during
the meals. Wellness programs are developed and administered through
the senior center, including screenings and other assessments by nurses
and public health professionals. Lecture series and other programs are
regularly scheduled at the senior center.
These community programs provide opportunities for residents to come
together and be involved actively in the community. The City will
continue to support community events and activities that bring together
various segments of the community and actively seeks ways to improve
and enhance current community programs.
Community Parks
Parks are places where Laguna Hills residents can gather to have fun,
celebrate occasions, or just relax and enjoy being outdoors in their city.
There are 13 public parks within Laguna Hills and they provide places of
adventure and discovery, peace and tranquility, and recreation and play.
These parks offer a sense of enjoyment, a strong community spirit, and
a sense of community belonging and identity. Amenities at each park
can include sports fields, ballparks, tennis courts, picnic shelters, tot lots,
playgrounds, walking trails, fountains, restrooms, and lighting. Nearby
golf courses, regional parks, and open space in the coastal foothills
offer additional outdoor recreation opportunities. There are parks
within the City designated as private, which are generally maintained

The Community Center has joint-use agreements with Laguna Hills
High School to share facilities, particularly sports fields and recreation
areas, for general public use outside of student activity hours. Public
higher education classes, including adult education classes, are locally
provided by the South Orange County Community College District.
The nearest district campus is Saddleback Community College located in
nearby Mission Viejo.
The City will continue to cooperate with SVUSD to update information
in its master plans and long-range facility plans, and identify future
facility sites, student generation formulas, and facility improvement
plans. The City will also assist the SVUSD in their review of
development proposals to ensure that the proposals are consistent
with school facilities requirements, and offer accessible facilities that
complement the surrounding land uses.
Fire Protection and Emergency
Services
The Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) is contracted to provide
fire protection and emergency services to Laguna Hills. OCFA provides
fire suppression services, emergency medical, rescue, and fire prevention
services for the City, as well as 22 additional cities and the unincorporated
areas within the County. In addition, OCFA has an inspection service
section that conducts fire safety inspections and enforces applicable fire
codes and ordinances in Laguna Hills. The City is served by Fire Station
#22, located on Paseo de Valencia in nearby Laguna Woods. Table CSF-2
provides a list of additional fire stations within the vicinity of Laguna Hills,
Aliso Viejo, and Lake Forest (also shown in Figure CSF-1). Additional
cities are available to assist Station #22 with supplemental resources in an
event of great need.
The OCFA response goal is for the first engine to reach the emergency
scene within 5 minutes 90 percent of the time. In the event of a medical
emergency, OCFA transports patients to the Saddleback Memorial
Medical Center located off Paseo de Valencia. The OCFA response goal
for medical emergencies is for a paramedic to reach the scene within 5
minutes 90 percent of the time. OCFA has consistently met or exceeded
these response goals. The City will continue to work with the OCFA to
ensure that adequate resources are available for continued protection of the
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Laguna Hills and will
continue to educate all residents about fire hazards and reducing the risk
associated with wildland and structure fires.

as schools and shopping centers, helps contribute to an overall feeling of
safety for residents of the community.
The City administers services that partner with the OCSD, including
Neighborhood Watch and Business Watch programs and emergency
management operations. The OCSD also sponsors a Citizens’ Disaster
Preparedness Academy in Laguna Hills. The City will continue to
coordinate with the OCSD to provide an adequate level of police services
to maintain the current police visibility.
Water Services
Laguna Hills obtains water and wastewater services from the Moulton
Niguel Water District (MNWD) and the El Toro Water District
(ETWD). These services are provided in the northern portion of the
City by the ETWD and in the southern portion of the City by the
MNWD. The division line runs through a neighborhood north of Alicia
Parkway and south of Aliso Creek (Figure CSF-2). Water from both
Districts comes from the Colorado River and the State Water Project
(which draws water from the San Francisco-San Joaquin Bay Delta)
and travels hundreds of miles to the local water districts through an
intricate aboveground and underground delivery system operated by the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
Both the MNWD and the ETWD Urban Water Management Plans
(2005) indicate that the districts expect to have adequate water supply
available to meet the demand posed by growth within their jurisdictions.
Encouraging good water service in the City will require maintaining
current infrastructure and extending new infrastructure to serve new
development projects. Because the City is almost entirely developed,
water infrastructure is in place and few improvements will be required
to accommodate new development. Development proposals and
amendments will be reviewed for consistency with water infrastructure
requirements established in development plans and agreements. For
certain projects identified in the State Water Code, the City will require
preparation of 20-year water supply assessments. The City will require
adequate water supplies for fire flow as established by the OCFA, along
with sufficient water storage for emergency situations, and will work with
the water districts to update their Urban Water Management Plans to
ensure the districts’ overall ability to maintain adequate water supplies for
the community on an ongoing basis.

Sewer Services
Wastewater (including sewage) generated within Laguna Hills is also
carried by the MNWD and ETWD wastewater collection systems to
a Regional Treatment Plant operated by the South Orange County
Wastewater Authority (SOCWA). Because Laguna Hills is largely
urbanized and built out, and has few remaining vacant sites in the
city, the remaining capacity at the regional treatment plant wastewater
treatment facility is sufficient to serve potential new development
and redevelopment. Development proposals and amendments will
be reviewed for consistency with sewer infrastructure requirements
established in development plans and agreements. New development
and redevelopment activities will be required to cooperate with the
MNWD or the ETWD to ensure the adequacy of existing wastewater
infrastructure to service the City. The City will continue to cooperate
with SOCWA in that agency’s efforts to provide adequate wastewater
treatment services for Laguna Hills. In addition, the City will continue
to coordinate with the local water districts in planning and maintenance
of wastewater collection facilities for the community.
Solid Waste Disposal
Solid waste generated in Laguna Hills is collected by a private sector
contractor. The City’s solid waste is disposed of in the Prima Deshecha
Landfill, located approximately 11 miles south of the City in San Juan
Capistrano. The landfill is managed by the County of Orange, Integrated
Waste Management Department (IWMD).
Regional household hazardous waste collection centers are located
in Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Irvine, and San Juan Capistrano.
Additional information pertaining to household hazardous waste
collection is provided in the Safety Element.
The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 requires
diversion of 50 percent of solid waste generated within all California
jurisdictions from regional landfills. To comply with this State regulation,
the City implements a Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE),
which outlines the City’s strategy for reducing solid waste generated
within the City that may ultimately impact regional landfills. The SRRE
identifies numerous programs that will assist the City to divert solid
waste in compliance with State law. The City is working to reduce the
disposed amount of solid waste through recycling and composting, source
reduction, and public education. The City will continue to cooperate
with the IWMD in efforts to maintain and expand regional landfill
facilities to accommodate the County’s growing population.

                                                     to support public computer and internet access also while providing a modest

                                                     all ages. As part of OC Public Libraries, Laguna Hills Technology Branch
                                                     Library shares collection materials with the county’s other 33 branches. Patrons
                                                     are encouraged to browse the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) on-site or

                                                     continue to work with the OCPL to provide adequate library facilities, maintain
                                                     and improve access to information, and foster community involvement and
                                                     educational connections to further enrich the residents of Laguna Hills.
                                                     Electricity and Natural Gas
                                                     Fossil fuel products such as coal, natural gas, oil, and diesel are the primary fuel for
                                                     generating electricity and for heating homes, water, and food. The global supply of
                                                     these products is limited and the demand for electricity and fossil fuels continues to
                                                     increase. Employing efficient energy efforts throughout the City and transitioning
                                                     to nonfossil fuel alternatives will help to extend limited supplies, reduce the need
                                                     for expensive new regional power generators and transmission lines, and contribute
                                                     to Laguna Hills’ economic sustainability and regional competitiveness.
                                                     The primary sources of energy in Laguna Hills are electricity and natural gas.
                                                     Southern California Edison (SCE) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E)
                                                     provide electricity services to Laguna Hills, while the Southern California Gas
                                                     Company is the provider of natural gas (Figure CSF-3). SCE and SDG&E review
                                                     new development and redevelopment projects on a case-by-case basis and evaluate
                                                     existing infrastructure for its adequacy. At this time, neither SCE nor SDG&E has
                                                     plans to underground any utility or transmission lines in Laguna Hills. Further,
                                                     all Laguna Hills’ energy providers, including SCE, SDG&E, and the Southern
                                                     California Gas Company, indicated that their present facilities are adequate, and
                                                     no major upgrades are planned within the City in the near future. The City will
                                                     continue to collaborate with the providers to address energy needs within the
                                                     community. Refer to the Conservation and Open Space Element for further

the community’s drainage features in their natural condition. In an
effort to achieve this, the City will also work closely with the OCFCD
to construct and maintain flood control facilities for the community. In
addition, the City requires adequate flood control facilities to protect
all structures and major roadways from hazards associated with being
near a 100-year floodplain and will require new development and
redevelopment to be located to either avoid flood hazards or incorporate
them into the overall design. The City will also encourage the use of
Low Impact Development (LID) standards to reduce the amount of
stormwater runoff and pollution. Refer to the Conservation and Open
Space Element for a full discussion on LID design techniques.

                                         minimize danger to residents and visitors, the Safety Element sets forth
                                         the framework that will regulate existing and proposed development
                                         in hazard-prone areas, promote urban design to ensure safe streets and
                                         neighborhoods, and establish methods to ensure safety and organization
                                         during emergency situations.
                                         Background
                                         Laguna Hills strives to maintain a safe environment for all members
                                         of the community. However, numerous potential hazards that could
                                         affect life and property are present in and around the City. For example,
                                         Laguna Hills is located in a seismically active region, and residents could
                                         potentially be exposed to dangers caused by earthquakes and ground
                                         shaking. The presence of hillside terrain and steep slopes in the City
                                         could potentially cause residents to be vulnerable fire hazards. The
                                         City recognizes it may be vulnerable to a number of hazards, and that
                                         maintaining a safe environment requires constant assessment of the City’s
                                         needs regarding these hazards.
                                         Safety Plan
                                         Laguna Hills faces both natural and human-related hazards, including
                                         earthquakes, urban and wildland fires, geologic hazards, and hazards
                                         caused by the use of hazardous and/or toxic materials. Protection from
                                         the risks of natural and human-caused hazards is essential in continuing
                                         to provide a sense of safety and well-being for the residents and visitors
                                         of Laguna Hills. In addition, safety is a significant consideration in
                                         attracting new businesses to the City. While the likelihood of occurrence
                                         for most of these natural and human-caused hazards is low, the
                                         consequences can be very serious. Understanding hazards and preparing
                                         to deal with them on both an incident-related and ongoing basis are
                                         important objectives for the City. Proper planning and preparation
                                         for potential hazards is an essential action to minimize the disruption,
                                         personal injury, and property damage associated with such hazards and
                                         resulting emergency conditions
                                         The City has established goals and policies to maintain community safety
                                         and reduce the risks associated with natural and human-caused hazards
                                         in Laguna Hills. The Safety Plan addresses these issues and provides
                                         strategies to minimize hazard potential and protect the overall well-being
                                         of the residents in the community.

Geology and seismicity
Geologic Hazards
Landslides, Mudflows, and Slope Instability
The topography of Laguna Hills includes several hills and valleys and
therefore has the potential for slope instability and landslides. Slopes
steeper than 25 degrees (approximately 2:1) are potentially subject to
instability. Such areas may be prone to hazards such as surficial failures,
mudflows, debris flows, rock falls, soil creep, and erosion. Failures of
man-made slopes could also occur in some of the previously developed
areas of the City. The potential for earthquake-induced landsliding
in hillside terrain is also present. Areas of known earthquake-induced
landslides or areas generally susceptible to landsliding and slope
instability within the Laguna Hills have been identified and mapped
by the California Geological Survey (CGS) (Figure S-1). Laguna Hills
continues to update development standards and adopt the latest building
and construction codes to guide future development in areas that could
be potentially vulnerable to landslides and slope instability.
Shallow Groundwater
Shallow groundwater is characterized as an area where the water
table is within 20 to 30 feet of the ground surface at any time during
the year. The areas described in the liquefaction discussion are also
the areas most likely to encounter shallow groundwater that could
interfere with construction. The shallowest water levels are found in
Sulphur Creek (and its main tributary), Aliso Creek, and Oso Creek,
where groundwater is estimated to be approximately 5 to 10 feet
deep. At these depths, water can interfere with subsurface excavations
(e.g., underground parking) and deep foundations (e.g., piles).
Additionally, some shallow perched water may be encountered within
the more southerly portions of Laguna Hills. In the remaining creeks,
the levels are expected to be closer to 20 feet deep.
Unstable Soils
Unstable soils include expansive, compressible, erodible, corrosive, or
collapsible soils. Natural soil, colluvium, and young alluvial deposits
may be susceptible to expansion; consolidation; collapsing; or hydro-
collapsing, which occurs with the addition of water. For each of these
factors, minor to severe damage to overlying structures is possible. Based
on the reported soil types within and around Laguna Hills, it is possible
that one or more of these soil characteristics described above are present
                                                                                                                S-3

Seismic Hazards
Ground Shaking
Southern California as a whole is subject to potential ground shaking
in the event of an earthquake. Ground shaking can result in extensive
structural damage, injury, and death. Safety planning must prepare for
both frequent moderate earthquakes and infrequent large earthquakes
(both local and regional) since any type of ground shaking may affect
standard construction and infrastructure.
While there are no known active faults within the City of Laguna Hills,
earthquakes of low to moderate magnitude have occurred infrequently in
the region around the City based on instrumental recordings. The level
of impact resulting from any seismic activity will depend on factors such
as distance from epicenter, earthquake magnitude, and characteristics
of soils and subsurface geology. Figure S-1 depicts the seismic hazard
zones delineated by the California Department of Conservation. The
major regional faults likely to generate earthquakes of a magnitude of
7 or higher are the San Andreas, the San Jacinto, the Elsinore-Whittier,
and the Newport-Inglewood faults. The Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone
is the nearest major active fault and lies approximately 3 miles to the
southwest of Laguna Hills. The San Joaquin Hills fault that underlies
the City is believed to be capable of a large local earthquake, but it
is considered unlikely to rupture in the near future. As development
and redevelopment occur within Laguna Hills, the City will require a
proper investigation of the expected level of ground shaking in a major
earthquake and the level of risk to the buildings and other structures
associated with seismic ground shaking.
Fault Rupture and Surface Deformation
Fault rupture is a ground movement that occurs during an earthquake.
Although impact is limited, these ground movements can cause
structures to collapse, make roads impassable due to offsets, and sever
utility lines. The chance of an earthquake leading to surface rupture
hazards is minimal, but both “active” faults and “potentially active”
faults should not be discounted as sources of potential seismic harm.
Due to the absence of active faults in the City, the risk of damage due
to fault rupture during an earthquake is limited. In addition, no faults
within or near the City have been placed within State of California
established Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones, which are subject to
special land use controls and building standards.
                                                                                                               S-5

                                         Earthquake-Induced Liquefaction
                                         Liquefaction occurs when severe groundshaking leads to loss of shear
                                         strength of a soil, and is a function of soil type and groundwater. Soils
                                         that are poorly consolidated and combine with groundwater during
                                         an earthquake lose their shear strength and take on the properties of a
                                         heavy liquid. Liquefaction generally occurs within areas that have high
                                         ground water (less than 20 to 30 feet below the surface), loose sandy
                                         alluvial deposits (usually of recent age), and the potential for significant
                                         groundshaking.
                                         Portions of the City occupied by alluvial valleys have these characteristics,
                                         as mapped by the CGS (shown in landslide Figure S-2). In particular, the
                                         following areas within the City are susceptible to liquefaction:
                                         •	   The northern portion of the City in drainages south of Lake Forest
                                              and along Ridge Route Drive;
                                         •	   Aliso Creek (Laguna Hills Mall area) and tributaries to the south
                                              (including Alicia Parkway);
                                         •	   Sulphur Creek and a tributary; and
                                         •	   Oso Creek along southbound Interstate 5 (I-5).
                                         Laguna Hills recognizes that planning for a safe community requires
                                         consideration of all geologic hazards, including liquefaction.
                                         Incorporating proper geotechnical engineering techniques in
                                         development projects within these areas can reduce the risks associated
                                         with geologic hazards to people and property.
                                         Inundation Due to Seismically Induced Ground
                                         Movement or Seiche
                                         Seismically induced inundation refers to flooding that occurs when water
                                         retention structures fail during an earthquake. Often, inundation is
                                         triggered by damage from a seiche. A seiche is a wave that reverberates
                                         on the surface of water in an enclosed or semi-enclosed basin, such as
                                         a reservoir, lake, bay, or harbor, in response to groundshaking during
                                         an earthquake. Seismically induced inundation can also occur if strong
                                         groundshaking causes structural damage to above-ground water tanks.
                                         There are several small reservoirs and water storage tanks located within,
                                         and just outside of City boundaries (Figure S-3). These reservoirs and

The primary hazards that could cause failure of the dams at each
reservoir are strong earthquake groundshaking, seiche, and liquefaction;
however, none of the sites listed above are associated with known faults
or landslides. Water tank sites could also potentially be impacted by
slope instability. The flood impacts of dam or reservoir failures could
be somewhat significant for Lake Mission Viejo since water flows down
Oso Creek and might also affect the southeastern most edge of the City
adjacent to I-5. Local inundation and erosion effects could impact
the area and water tanks immediately adjacent to the Veeh Reservoir
and Sulphur Creek Reservoir, depending upon the amount of water             “Over 70% of residential fires occur in
impounded at the time of the dam or reservoir failure. However, water       homes without a working smoke alarm.
from El Toro Reservoir in Aliso Creek would likely not reach the City.      Be sure to test your alarm monthly,
Should any of the dams, reservoirs, or water tanks fail, persons and
                                                                            replace the batteries every 6 months,

Urban and Wildland Fire Hazards
Urban Fires
Urban fires also have the potential to cause significant loss of life and
property; however, improvements in architecture, building design,
construction materials, and emergency response have helped reduce the
likelihood of catastrophic occurrences. Nevertheless, residents of Laguna
Hills could potentially be exposed to structural fire hazards within
the City for a number of reasons. The Orange County Fire Authority
(OCFA), the agency responsible for providing fire services in the event
of a fire emergency, noted the top causes of structural fires are triggered
by electrical equipment, smoking, candles left unattended, smoke alarms

                                         While major wildfires pose a significant risk in the large, open space
                                         hillsides and areas in other parts of Orange County, the urbanized
                                         nature of Laguna Hills and the adjacent areas significantly reduces the
                                         threat of large, catastrophic wildfires within the City. Nevertheless,
                                         wildland fire hazards do exist. While there are no areas of Laguna

                                         northwestern neighborhoods of the City are adjacent to open space in
                                         the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park in the City of Irvine. The Laguna
                                         Coast Wilderness Park is designated as a Very High Fire Hazard Severity
                                         Zone, as identified by the California Department of Forestry and Fire
                                         Protection (CAL FIRE) (Figures S-4). In addition, area within the
                                         southern portion of the City as well as some hillside corridors with
                                         natural terrain and open areas are also at risk for fire hazards.
                                         OCFA has established a Wildland Taskforce to educate residents living
                                         near wildlands on ways they can protect themselves from potential
                                         wildfire threats. The importance of creating and maintaining a defensible
                                         space around homes to minimize potential threats is stressed in this
                                         education program. Defensible space describes a bare or sparsely planted
                                         area around a home or building that is clear of dry grass, brush, and
                                         dead leaves, which acts as a fire break and gives firefighters a safe place
                                         to stand while protecting properties from approaching flames. The
                                         City will continue to support the public education efforts of the OCFA
                                         as well as integrate new technologies, such as utilizing Geographic
                                         Information Systems (GIS) for mapping, and fire prevention concepts,
                                         such as fire-resistant landscaping, into the design and construction of new
                                         development and redevelopment.

                                         Laguna Hills sets high standards for neighborhood safety and boasts
                                         one of the lowest crime rates in Orange County. Community residents
                                         generally feel safe walking around their neighborhoods during the day, as
                                         well as at night. The City is committed to maintaining this level of safety
                                         by providing superior police protection and crime prevention programs.
                                         Police services are provided by the Orange County Sheriffs Department

City of Laguna Hills General Plan safety
                                         (OCSD). Deputies are responsible for general patrol, traffic enforcement,
                                         criminal investigations, and other law enforcement-related duties.
                                         OCSD prides itself on maintaining the working partnership with the
                                         community of Laguna Hills to serve and protect its neighborhoods.
                                         Crime prevention and community-oriented policing programs, including
                                         Neighborhood Watch, Speed Watch, Business Watch, and school
                                         resource programs designed to educate and build a stronger partnership
                                         with our youth, help residents of all ages take a proactive approach to
                                         crime prevention and protection. Refer to the Community Services and

                                         Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
                                         Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) is based
                                         on the premise that the proper design and effective use of the built
                                         environment can lead to a reduction in the fear of crime and incidence
                                         of crime, and to an improvement in quality of life. While traditional
                                         methods of policing are important to maintain security in Laguna
                                         Hills, CPTED guidelines can be used to prevent crime before it
                                         occurs. CPTED is a multi-disciplinary method of using physical and
                                         psychological strategies to deter crime and incorporates four broad design
                                         and usage concepts:
                                         •	   Surveillance. Surveillance focuses on keeping intruders easily
                                              observable. Surveillance is promoted by design features that
                                              maximize visibility of people, parking areas, and building entrances.
                                         •	   Access control. Access control is characterized by clearly
                                              demarcating public areas from private ones so that access to potential
                                              targets is reduced and perception of risk to potential offenders is
                                              increased as a deterrent.
                                         •	   Territoriality. Territoriality fosters a sense of defensible space,
                                              encouraging individuals to take ownership and control of their
                                              environment. Potential offenders will then be discouraged to engage
                                              in criminal activities nearby.
                                         •	   Maintenance. Maintenance promotes the frequent upkeep of
                                              CPTED measures in order to maintain their surveillance, access
                                              control, and territoriality effectiveness.
                                         While crime in Laguna Hills is low, the application of CPTED in
                                         the existing built environment can further reduce the opportunity
                                         for, and the likelihood of, crime. In addition, the development and
                                         redevelopment of certain areas within the City also allow the opportunity
                                         to incorporate CPTED principles into the design of development as
                                         well as operational aspects. Possible planning techniques and strategies
                                         associated with CPTED are included below. This is not intended to be
                                         a comprehensive list of strategies, rather just a sample of the types of
                                         actions suggested through CPTED.

•	   Control access by creating both real and perceptual barriers to entry
     and movement. Clearly mark the transitions from public to private
     spaces, and use signs, fences, borders, art, and landscaping to prevent
     or discourage access into unmonitored areas.
•	   Building location and orientation can create or remove views.
     Design should promote visibility. This could be accomplished by
     placing windows overlooking sidewalks and parking lots to provide
     natural surveillance or “eyes on the street.”
•	   Ensure adequate lighting is provided in potential problem areas, such
     as stairs, entrances/exits, parking lots, and ATMs.
•	   Limit the number of access points into a building.
•	   Ensure buildings, yards, gardens, sidewalks, and other features are
     well maintained, clean, and in working order, which is a sign of
     guardianship.
The City will continue to take a proactive approach to crime prevention
and will encourage the use of crime prevention through environmental
design (CPTED) techniques in new development and redevelopment
projects.
Hazardous Materials and Nuclear
Power Production
Hazardous Materials and Waste
A hazardous material is defined as any injurious substance, including
pesticides, herbicides, toxic metal and chemicals, explosives, and nuclear
fuels and materials. The use of these hazardous materials is commonplace
in commercial, industrial, and manufacturing activities. Because these
materials are increasingly used in urban settings, there are activities within
the City that expose residents to certain risks associated with hazardous
materials. The use of combustibles, and the use, transport, and disposal
of hazardous and toxic wastes pose certain risks to the general population
of the City. Interstate 5 and the San Joaquin Hills Transportation
Corridor (State Route 73) are major transportation arterials that border
Laguna Hills and it is likely that hazardous materials are transported
along these roadways, thus potentially exposing people to potential
catastrophic events. Hazardous materials require special methods of
disposal, storage, and treatment, and the release of hazardous materials
requires an immediate response to protect human health and safety, and/
or the environment.
OCFA provides 24-hour emergency response services to hazardous
materials incidents occurring throughout Orange County, including
Laguna Hills. In addition, the Safety and Environmental Services
                                                                                                                  S-13

City of Laguna Hills General Plan safety
                                         Section (SESS) of OCFA is responsible for gathering and maintaining
                                         inventories of chemicals stored, handled, and used within Laguna Hills.
                                         Once identified, SESS is responsible for compiling this information into
                                         a database, which can be accessed through the “Community’s Right to
                                         Know” program. This program responds to all requests from the public
                                         for hazardous materials information and disclosure. In addition, OCFA
                                         has developed a Hazardous Materials Area Plan addressing day-to-day
                                         hazardous material operations as well as extreme emergencies. The role of
                                         Laguna Hills in the event of a hazardous materials emergency is focused
                                         on discovery, notification evaluation, and initiation of immediate on-
                                         scene action.
                                         The City will continue to maintain permitting requirements that parallel
                                         County requirements for businesses within Laguna Hills that handle,
                                         store, or generate hazardous waste. In addition, common household
                                         items such as medial waste (syringes), latex and oil based paints,
                                         antifreeze, batteries, used motor oil, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides,
                                         and electronic waste such as used cell phones and computers are
                                         considered hazardous waste and cannot be disposed of along with other
                                         residential trash. In an effort to ensure that household hazardous wastes
                                         are collected and disposed of in a safe manner, the County of Orange
                                         Department of Waste and Recycling (Integrated Waste Management
                                         Department) developed a household hazardous waste collection program
                                         at Orange County landfills. Four permanent collection facilities are
                                         located throughout the County, with the nearest Household Hazardous
                                         Waste Collection Center (HHWCC) located approximately 7 miles
                                         north of Laguna Hills in the City of Irvine. The City will continue to
                                         support this program and supporting programs, as appropriate, to address
                                         the City’s hazardous waste disposal needs.
                                         Nuclear Power Production
                                         The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) is located in San
                                         Diego County approximately 15 miles south of Laguna Hills. The U.S.

                                         SONGS, and every nuclear power facility, as an Emergency Planning
                                         Zone, and the State of California has defined the area outside and
                                         adjacent to the Emergency Planning Zone as a Public Education Zone.
                                         Laguna Hills is located outside of the Emergency Planning Zone but lies
                                         within the Public Education Zone. For areas located within this zone,
                                         the State of California and Southern California Edison have created
                                         education programs to ensure that residents are prepared for any potential
                                         problems associated with the facility.
                                         Radioactive by-products are primarily contained within the plant;
                                         however, small quantities of radioactive gas are released into the air
                                         and liquids into the Pacific Ocean. The releases are monitored by
S-14

                                                                                City of Laguna Hills General Plan safety
SONGS personnel; according to SONGS, radiation exposure due to
material release is less than typical exposure from natural background
radiation. The two most likely sources of radiation contamination are
transportation accidents involving the transport of radioactive materials
and uncontrolled releases at the plant site.
Flooding and Stormwater
Management
Floods have the potential to cause extensive property damage and injury
to the community. Some areas of Laguna Hills are determined to be
within a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-designated
flood zone; therefore, the City participates in the Federal Flood Insurance
Study to determine the mandatory insurance necessary for identified
properties. As shown on Federal Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood
areas that have a 1 percent annual chance of flooding (the “100-year
floodplain”) are identified around Aliso Creek, Veeh Reservoir, Mill
Creek, and in a zone northwest of Alicia Parkway in the southern portion
of the City (Figure S-3). Additional zones in the periphery of these flood
areas may pose a flood risk, but since they are outside the designated
1 percent annual chance floodplain they do not require additional flood
insurance. Lower risk areas are also located along the La Paz Channel on
the eastern border of Laguna Hills, and along North Sulfur Creek around
Moulton Parkway.
The City and County of Orange maintain an extensive storm drain
system that would normally divert any excessive rainfall into appropriate
channels. However, a significant rain event could cause flooding in
the zones identified above, or minor, localized flooding elsewhere in
the City. Most of the City does not lie downstream from any dams or
major levees, so there is little risk of inundation due to structural failures.
However, strong seismic events could result in impacts to a residential
area surrounding Veeh Reservoir in the northwestern area of the City.
The City will continue to coordinate with the Orange County Flood
Control District to maintain the necessary flood control and stormwater
management facilities.
Emergency Preparedness
All urban areas are faced with the possibility of major disasters that
threaten life, safety, and property and Laguna Hills is no exception.
Laguna Hills is committed to providing the most effective and
economical use of all available resources for the maximum benefit and
protection of population and structures within the City.
As discussed throughout this element, Laguna Hills is exposed to multiple
hazards, all of which have the potential to disrupt the community, cause
damage, and create casualties. In response to these realities, Laguna
                                                                                                                   S-15

City of Laguna Hills General Plan safety
                                         Hills has updated its Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) and has
                                         conducted training exercises with the Office of Homeland Security and
                                         the State Office of Emergency Services to ensure that the plan serves as
                                         an extension to, and is consistent with, the guidelines provided in the
                                         statewide Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS). The
                                         EOP takes the “all hazards” approach and determines the actions that
                                         need to be taken by the City to (1) prevent disasters where possible; (2)
                                         reduce vulnerability of residents to any disasters that cannot be prevented;
                                         (3) respond effectively to actual occurrences of disasters; and (4) provide
                                         recovery in the aftermath of any emergency involving extensive damage
                                         or other debilitating influence on the normal pattern of life within the
                                         community. The EOP is not intended for day-to-day emergencies, but
                                         rather for disaster situations where normal resources are exhausted or
                                         nearly exhausted. The EOP becomes activated when a threat to lives and
                                         property is so great that the City needs to expand beyond normal day-
                                         to-day operations to meet the demands. While it is likely that outside
                                         assistance would be available in most large-scale disaster situations and
                                         plans have been created to facilitate the coordination of this mutual
                                         aid, the City is prepared to carry out disaster response and short-term
                                         recovery operations on an independent basis.
                                         Two Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) have been identified by the
                                         City and can be used as emergency facilities and shelters in the event of
                                         an emergency or disaster. They are as follows:
                                         •	   Primary Emergency Operation Center (EOC) is located at:
                                         	    Laguna Hills Civic Center
                                         	    24035 El Toro Road
                                         	    Laguna Hills, CA 92653
                                         •	   Alternate Emergency Operation Center (EOC) is located at:
                                         	    Laguna Hills Community Center
                                         	    25555 Alicia Parkway
                                         	    Laguna Hills, CA 92653
                                         In addition to the EOP, the City sponsors a Citizens’ Disaster
                                         Preparedness Academy to educate citizens about first-aid techniques and
                                         also offers training techniques to first responders for duties in the event
                                         of a disaster. The City will continually educate its residents on the need
                                         to adequately prepare for emergencies and will make the EOP a readily
                                         available document so the community can gain familiarity with the City’s
                                         emergency plans and policies.

Goals and Policies
The goals and policies section sets both broad and specific direction
for the future of the City based on identified issues, as captured in
the Guiding Themes and expressed by the community, City staff, and
decision makers.
Six major issue areas are addressed in the goals and policies of the Safety
Element. The major issues are:
•	   Reducing the risk and damage caused to residents due to natural
     geologic and seismic hazards through proper land use planning and
     geotechnical investigations;
•	   Reducing the risks associated with urban and wildland fires through
     education and fire prevention measures;
•	   Providing effective law enforcement and crime prevention programs
     that help maintain community safety and further reduce crime;
•	   Protecting the community from hazardous waste and nuclear power
     production risks;
•	   Reducing the risks associated with flooding and improper stormwater
     management; and
•	   Maintaining a high level of emergency preparedness to protect public
     health and safety in emergency situations.
Geology and Seismicity
Geologic and seismic hazards are constraints to development and could
potentially pose safety risks to the residents of Laguna Hills. Due
to the seismic nature of the southern California region, residents of
Laguna Hills may be vulnerable to seismic hazards due to the City’s
proximity to nearby faults. In addition, residents and future residents
could be exposed to geologic hazards such as landslides, particularly in
hillside locations or areas of unstable soil. The goals and policies below
emphasize the need for careful investigation of geologic conditions
to help assess their potential threats. The goals and policies will also
ensure that Laguna Hills will regulate the standards for development and
address the need for preventative land use planning and development
requirements to minimize structural damage and protect residents from
unforeseeable seismic and geologic hazards.
Goal S-1: Reduce the risk of injury and the loss of life and property
from seismic activity and geologic conditions.
Policy S-1.1: Investigate specific geologic conditions underlying all new
development or redevelopment proposals in areas where potential fault
rupture, liquefaction, slope instability, or other geologic hazards are suspected.
                                                                                                                      S-17

City of Laguna Hills General Plan safety
                                         Policy S-1.2: Reduce the risk of impacts from geologic and seismic
                                         hazards by applying current and proper land use planning, development
                                         engineering, building construction, and retrofitting requirements.
                                         Urban and Wildland Fire Hazards
                                         Since the City is potentially vulnerable to wildland fire and urban fire
                                         events, the City will continue to administer proper fire protection services
                                         and promote fire prevention measures through community education,
                                         design features such as fire-resistant landscaping, and technological
                                         advances.
                                         Goal S-2: Reduce the threat to life, structures, and the environment

Summary of Approach
The goals, policies, and programs in the Safety Element will help the
City to minimize the threat of both natural and human-caused hazards
on the community, protect public health, maintain safe neighborhoods,
and provide timely and effective response in the event of an emergency
by continually assessing the City’s needs and taking proactive measures to
ensure Laguna Hills is a safe environment in which to live, learn, work,
and play. Table S-2 identifies the six major issue areas described in the
Goals and Policies section. These major issues represent the direction the
City will take in its safety goals, policies, and programs to implement the
vision of Laguna Hills as captured in the Guiding Themes and expressed
in the Safety Plan.

  These are typical noise levels. Distance from the source will reduce the noise level. A 10 dB
  increase doubles perceived loudness. Continued exposure to noise above 85 dB can cause
  hearing loss. A single exposure to 140 dB noise can cause some hearing loss.
Noise Plan
As Laguna Hills and surrounding communities continue to grow, noise
levels associated with transportation‑ and nontransportation-related noise
continue to increase. The City seeks ways to safeguard the community
from excessive noise as the ambient noise level in the community rises.
The goals, policies, and the Plan in this section describe the means to
reduce the negative effects of noise in the City. Programs addressing
noise, contained in the Implementation Program section of the General
Plan, are an extension of the Noise Plan and contain specific actions that
the City uses to protect the community from excessive noise.
Noise Measurement
Evaluating noise is complex. Noise levels are measured as decibels (dB)
on a logarithmic scale that quantifies sound intensity in a manner similar
to the Richter scale used for earthquake magnitudes. Thus, doubling the
energy of a noise source (e.g., traffic volume) would not double the noise
level.
The human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies within the
sound spectrum. The most common method to characterize sound is the
“A‑weighted” sound level, or dB(A), which filters out noise frequencies
not audible to the human ear, thereby weighting the audible frequencies.
Therefore, the dBA is used for noise measurements and standards
involving the human perception of noise.
                                                                                                                                   N-3

City of Laguna Hills General Plan Noise
                                        In addition to instantaneous noise levels, noise levels measured over
                                        a period of time are used to assess noise limits and impacts. Noise
                                        levels measured over 1 hour are usually expressed as dBA Leq, the
                                        equivalent 1-hour noise level. Time of day is also an important factor
                                        for noise assessment; noise levels that may be acceptable during the
                                        day may interfere with the ability to sleep during evening or nighttime
                                        hours. Therefore, 24-hour noise levels are used. The community
                                        noise equivalent level (CNEL) is the cumulative noise exposure in a
                                        community during a 24‑hour period, which adds 5 dB(A) to evening
                                        sound levels (between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.), and 10 dB(A) to the
                                        nighttime sound levels (between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.). The day/
                                        night average sound level (Ldn) is the same as the CNEL, except the
                                        3-hour evening period is considered part of the daytime period.
                                        In addition to noise measurement, traffic noise levels for freeways and
                                        arterials can be modeled using a traffic noise model with traffic volumes,
                                        mix, and speed characteristics.
                                        Noise and Land Use Planning
                                        Accumulation of noise from transportation and nontransportation
                                        sources determine the overall noise environment within a community.
                                        Transportation noise refers to noise from automobile use, trucking,
                                        airport operations and rail operations. Nontransportation noise typically
                                        refers to noise from stationary sources such as commercial establishments,
                                        machinery, air conditioning systems, compressors, and landscape
                                        maintenance equipment.
                                        Regardless of the type of noise, noise levels are highest near the source
                                        and substantially decrease with distance. Most noise impacts can be
                                        avoided when noise sources, sensitive land uses, and information about
                                        the future noise environment are considered in land use planning and
                                        development decisions. Land uses that generate significant noise should
                                        be separated from uses that are particularly sensitive to noise.
                                        To establish the compatibility of various land uses with exterior noise
                                        levels, the City uses CNEL in its planning guidelines. CNEL takes into
                                        account heightened sensitivity of persons to noise during evening and
                                        nighttime periods.
                                        Figure N-1 illustrates Laguna Hills’ land use compatibility guidelines.
                                        Noise levels can be estimated and represented as noise contour lines,
                                        which indicate the area subject to a particular noise level. Figures N-2
                                        and N-3 show the estimated existing and projected future noise contours
                                        in Laguna Hills, based on traffic volume counts and projected 2030
                                        traffic volumes on the City’s arterials.

                                                   The noise contours are used as a guide for land use and development
                                                   decisions. Land uses within contours of 60 dB(A) or greater may
                                                   be noise impacted depending on the use. When noise sensitive land
                                                   uses are proposed within these contours, an acoustical analysis may be
                                                   required. For a project to be approved in a noise impacted area, the
                                                   analysis must demonstrate that the project is designed to attenuate noise
                                                   to meet the City’s noise standards as defined in Table N-1. If the project
                                                   is not designed to meet the noise standards, mitigation measures can be
                                                   recommended in the analysis. If the analysis demonstrates that the noise
                                                   standards can be met with implementation of the mitigation measures,
                                                   the project can be approved with the mitigation measures required as

The nonresidential exterior noise standard is always 65 dBA. Exempt
from these standards are activities at any public or private educational
facilities, or public park or playground; emergency equipment or work;
construction activities during the day on Monday through Saturday;
certain agricultural operations; and landscaping and maintenance.
Schools, hospitals, and churches are protected from noise sources that
exceed the specified noise limits.
Transportation-Related Noise
Laguna Hills contains a number of transportation-related noise sources
including freeways, major roadways, and railroad operations. I‑5, SR‑73,
the railroad, and major roadways create high levels of noise that affect the
overall quality of life in the community and are the major contributors of
noise in the City. Some locations, such as areas adjacent to I-5 at Los Alisos,
are regularly impacted by transportation noise. Reducing transportation-
related noise is necessary to improve the quality of life for noise sensitive
land uses. Cost-effective strategies to reduce the influence of transportation-
related noise sources are an essential part of the Noise Element.
Noise Control at Reception Sites
The most efficient and effective means of controlling noise from
transportation is to reduce noise at the source. However, the City has
little direct control over noise produced by transportation sources because
State noise regulations preempt location regulations. Because the City
cannot control the noise at the source, City noise programs focus on
reducing the impact of transportation noise reception sites.
The most effective way to mitigate transportation noise impacts on the
City is by using the site development permit process and implementing
CEQA. During the planning stages of the development process,
potential impacts from transportation noise will be identified and
mitigation measures will be required as needed to meet the City’s
noise standards. Site planning, landscaping, natural topography and
design, and construction noise barriers are the most common method
of alleviating vehicular traffic and train noise impacts. Setbacks and
buffer areas can also be used to achieve small noise reductions. The City
can also use weight limitations on certain roadways and designate truck
routes to reduce traffic noise in specific locations.
The City also encourages the construction and use of alternative modes
of transportation such as alternative fuel vehicles, transit systems, and
transit-oriented development (higher density, mixed use development
near major rail and transit stops) to reduce transportation-related noise.
Alternative transportation modes can emit less noise per passenger than
their automotive counterparts and can reduce traffic congestion.

City of Laguna Hills General Plan Noise
                                        Noise Control at the Source
                                        The California Vehicle Code contains noise regulations pertaining to
                                        the operation of all vehicles on public roads. These noise standards for
                                        cars, trucks, and motorcycles are enforced through coordination with the
                                        California Highway Patrol and the Orange County Sheriff’s Department.
                                        The City also regulates traffic flow and coordinates with the California
                                        Highway Patrol and Orange County Sheriff’s Department to enforce
                                        speed limits to reduce traffic noise.
                                        Nontransportation-Related Noise
                                        The City contains a variety of land uses, many of which generate noise.
                                        Noise from non-transportation-related sources includes industrial areas
                                        that involve heavy equipment and machinery, and commercial areas
                                        such as restaurants, bars, and entertainment establishments. Mechanical
                                        equipment such as heating, ventilating, and air conditioning units also
                                        generates noise throughout the City. Residential areas are also subject
                                        to noise from the use of pool equipment, landscape maintenance
                                        equipment, barking dogs, and other noise sources. Finally, construction
                                        activities throughout the City can temporarily elevate noise.
                                        Application of the City’s noise regulations is the best means to control
                                        non-transportation-related noise. The Community Development
                                        Department and Orange County Sheriff’s Department cooperate to
                                        identify development or actives that violate noise regulations. The City’s
                                        municipal code gives the City the authority to enforce the noise standards
                                        through penalties and other abatement tactics.
                                        Noise generated by new development is effectively controlled though
                                        the site development permit process, compliance with CEQA, and
                                        compliance with the City noise standards contained in this Noise
                                        Element and the City’s noise regulations. During preliminary stages in
                                        the development process, potential noise impacts will be identified and
                                        mitigation measures imposed.
                                        When reviewing proposed mixed use and nonresidential projects,
                                        noise generation and potential impacts to surrounding development
                                        are considered. An acoustical analysis is required for projects that
                                        will generate noise potentially affecting sensitive receptors. Where
                                        significant impacts are identified, mitigation measures will be required.
                                        Mitigation measures that could be applied when reviewing projects
                                        include acoustically treated and/or quiet designs for furnaces, fans,
                                        motors, compressors, pumps, and other mechanical equipment. The
                                        City may also require limited delivery hours and/or hours of operation
                                        to minimize impacts to adjacent residential or other noise sensitive uses.
                                        In addition, all City departments must comply with State and federal
N-10

                                                                           City of Laguna Hills General Plan Noise
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.
Any new equipment or vehicles purchased by the City will comply with
local, State, and federal noise regulations, and the City will encourage
landscaping contractors to utilize up to date noise-reducing equipment.
Noise Ordinance
The City Noise Ordinance is designed to protect people from non-
transportation noise sources such as construction activity, commercial
and industrial operations, machinery, and pumps and air conditioners.
Enforcing the ordinance includes requiring proposed development
projects to show compliance with the ordinance, including operating in
accordance with noise levels and hours of operation limits placed on the
project site. The City also requires construction activity to comply with
established work schedule limits. The ordinance is reviewed periodically
for adequacy and amended as needed to address community needs and
development patterns.
The City also has the opportunity to control noise and vibration transfers
between adjacent land uses. Problems can arise when noise-producing
uses are located immediately adjacent to sensitive uses, such as business
park or light industrial uses near residences or schools. Additionally,
increasing mixed use development throughout the City will place more
sensitive residential uses alongside or above commercial uses, which
could present challenges. The City’s Zoning Ordinance or any Specific
Plan developed following adoption of the General Plan will include
specific standards that address noise and vibration transfer in mixed use
development.
Goals and Policies
The goals and policies section sets both broad and specific direction
for the future of the City based on identified issues, as captured in
the Guiding Themes and expressed by the community, City staff, and
decision makers.
Three major issue areas are addressed in the goals and policies of the
Noise Element. These major issues are:
•	   Using land use planning and development techniques to reduce noise
     and ensure compatibility between different land uses;
•	   Utilizing a variety of techniques and strategies to reduce
     transportation-related noise; and
•	   Requiring site design and other measures to reduce or maintain noise
     at acceptable levels for non-transportation-related noise.

City of Laguna Hills General Plan Noise
                                        Noise and Land Use Planning
                                        Land use directly affects noise compatibility because higher noise levels
                                        associated with certain land uses can encroach upon more sensitive land
                                        uses. Noise-producing and noise sensitive uses will be planned and/
                                        or sufficiently buffered to ensure that sensitive uses are not exposed to
                                        unacceptable noise levels. Non-compatible land uses will incorporate
                                        noise attenuation and/or control measures in the development and design
                                        process to reduce noise.
                                        Goal N-1: Reduce the effects of noise through proper land use
                                        planning and development techniques.
                                        Policy N-1.1: Use the City’s noise/land use compatibility matrix (Figure
                                        N-1) as a guide for future planning and development decisions.
                                        Policy N-1.2: Use transitional and buffer areas to separate excessive
                                        noise-generating uses from residential and other noise sensitive land uses.
                                        Policy N-1.3: Limit future residential and other noise sensitive land uses
                                        in areas exposed to high levels of noise and/or utilize strategies to reduce
                                        noise experienced by sensitive uses at the point of reception.
                                        Transportation-Related Noise
                                        Transportation-related noise sources are the major contributors of noise
                                        in Laguna Hills and affect the overall quality of life. Reduction of
                                        transportation-related noise through a variety of measures is necessary to
                                        deal with the detrimental effects attributable to excessive noise.
                                        Goal N-2: Reduce the impact of transportation-related noise on
                                        residential areas and other sensitive land uses.
                                        Policy N-2.1: Reduce new transportation-related noise impacts to noise
                                        sensitive land uses through the use of noise control measures.
                                        Policy N-2.2: Require noise-reducing construction techniques and
                                        site design measures for new development in areas impacted by
                                        transportation-related noise.
                                        Policy N-2.3: Encourage new development to provide facilities that
                                        support the use of alternative transportation modes, such as walking,
                                        bicycling, carpooling and, where applicable, transit to reduce automobile
                                        traffic and its associated noise.

Policy N-2.4: Consider using low-noise pavement surfaces on Mobility
Element roadways that reduce motor vehicle traffic noise.
Policy N-2.5: Control truck traffic routing to reduce truck traffic impacts
on noise sensitive land uses.
Policy N-2.6: Use traffic calming design and traffic control measures
as needed to reduce vehicular speeds and associated noise levels in
residential neighborhoods.
Nontransportation-Related Noise
Noise unrelated to vehicles, streets, and freeways also impacts the quality
of life in Laguna Hills. Excessive noise from construction, business
operations, and everyday activities negatively affects the community.
Site design, regulation, and enforcement measures will reduce non-
transportation-related noise.
Goal N-3: Reduce the impact of non-transportation-related noise on
residential areas and other sensitive land uses.
Policy N-3.1: Ensure noise sources from construction activities,
entertainment venues, private development/residences, landscaping
activities, and special events impacting noise sensitive lands use are
maintained at acceptable levels.
Policy N-3.2: Require that commercial and mixed use structures be
designed to prevent transfer of noise and vibration to residential and
other noise sensitive land uses.
Policy N-3.3: Require commercial and mixed use developments to
locate loading areas, parking lots, driveways, trash enclosures, mechanical
equipment, and other noise sources away from residential development
and, if necessary, to shield such noise sources with acoustic barriers.
Summary of Approach
The goals, policies, and programs in the Noise Element will help the City
reduce noise from transportation and non-transportation-related sources.
The Noise Element encourages the use of land use compatibility measures
and noise reduction techniques to ensure that redevelopment and new
development are compatible with established uses. Table N-3 identifies
the three major issue areas guiding the Noise Element. These major
issues represent the direction the City will take in its noise goals, policies,
and programs to implement the vision of Laguna Hills as captured in the
Guiding Themes and expressed in the Noise Plan.

                                          which establishes housing goals, policies, and programs that respond to
                                          community housing conditions and needs. The purpose of this Housing
                                          Element is to identify housing opportunities and solutions specific to the
                                          housing issues of the City of Laguna Hills (City).
                                          Related Plans and Programs
                                          The City’s 2013-2021Housing Element is directly related to a number
                                          of State and federally mandated requirements for housing policy and
                                          planning. A description of these plans and programs follows.
                                          REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
                                          ASSESSMENT
                                          State housing element law requires that Southern California Association
                                          of Governments (SCAG) determine the amount of housing needed in
                                          its region and allocate the need to each community. The allocation of
                                          housing need is based on statewide and local projections of population,
                                          employment, and housing need. State law requires cities to ensure that
                                          adequate sites, public facilities, and services are available to facilitate
                                          housing production commensurate with their housing need. Laguna
                                          Hills’ Housing Element identifies programs to address its share of the
                                          region’s housing need.
                                          HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE
                                          This Element has been prepared in compliance with the 2013-2021
                                          planning cycle for cities within the SCAG region. The Housing Element
                                          covers an eight year planning period from October 15, 2013 - October
                                          15, 2021, and the SCAG RHNA period from January 1, 2014 - 2021.

                                          General Plan Elements
                                          The Laguna Hills General Plan includes the following components: (1)
                                          Introduction to the General Plan; (2) seven elements, including, Land
                                          Use, Mobility, Conservation and Open Space, Community Services
                                          and Facilities, Safety, Noise and Housing; and (3) an Implementation
                                          Program. Background information and policy direction presented in one
                                          element are also reflected in other General Plan elements. For example,
                                          residential development capacities established in the Land Use Element
                                          are incorporated into the Housing Element.
                                          This Housing Element builds upon other General Plan Elements and
                                          is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the General
H-2

                                                                           CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
Plan. For example, the Land Use Element identifies use designations
at densities that will facilitate the provision of a range of residential
housing products for all income groups. The Mobility Element plays
a role in the location of residential development in relation to roads,
transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities. The Noise Element establishes
noise levels appropriate for residential uses. Whenever an element in
the General Plan is amended, the Housing Element will be reviewed
and modified, as necessary, to ensure the continued consistency between
elements.
Citizen Participation
California law requires that local governments make a diligent effort
to achieve public participation from all economic segments of the
community in the development of the Housing Element. Public
participation played an important role in the formulation and refinement
of the City’s housing goals and policies and in the development of the
housing plan for the City of Laguna Hills. Laguna Hills’ residents had
several opportunities to recommend strategies, review, and comment on
the Housing Element. The following information details outreach efforts
and citizen participation efforts by the City of Laguna Hills:
•	   Information posted on the City’s website.
•	   Artciles about the Housing Element update in the City’s quarterly
     newsletter, which is sent to every household in the City.
•	   City Council Meetings: Two City Council meetings occurred on
     June 25, 2013, and October 8, 2013 in which the public had the
     opportunity to address decision makers directly regarding housing
     issues, goals, and policies, as well as other general comments and
     concerns regarding housing. These meetings were advertised in a
     manner consistent with City policy for public meetings.
•	   Housing Stakeholder Workshops: On February 7 and May 9,
     2013, the City held workshops targeting residents, the general
     public, and various organizations that provide housing services to
     Laguna Hills. Table H-1 identifies the housing-related organizations
     that were invited to participate in the workshop.
SUMMARY OF INPUT
During the meetings and workshops, participants were provided with
an overview of the Housing Element update process and content.
Participants, which included residents and other stakeholders, identified
and discussed challenges, opportunities, and resources related to housing
                                                                                                                H-3

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                          in Laguna Hills. Comments received through the outreach activities have
                                          been considered in the development of the housing plan for the City of
                                          Laguna Hills.
                                          Valuable input on the Laguna Hills Housing Element occurred during
                                          the Housing Stakeholder Workshops (summarized below). Although
                                          additional input was received, community input centered around two
                                          recurring themes: senior housing needs and affordable housing in Laguna
                                          Hills. Many community members and stakeholders commented on the
                                          aging population in the region and a need for additional senior housing
                                          in the City. Affordable housing concerns in Laguna Hills centered on
                                          understanding what constitutes affordable housing in Laguna Hills,
                                          where existing affordable housing is located, and the need to provide
                                          additional affordable housing opportunities in the City.

                                               for the Oakbrook Village project? How were they able to do that?

   is the benefit of doing one? Are there funds from the State available
   for this?
•	 Does the City have a redevelopment agency? Does the City have any
   in-lieu fees for affordable housing? Has the City ever gotten involved
   in directly funding affordable housing?
•	 Home prices are going up. Rents are going up, too. Orange County
   has the 5th highest apartment rent in the State. Suggests the City
   create a plan for providing housing for seniors, low-income families,
   and disabled persons who want to live here.
•	 17,000 disabled persons in Orange County, 186 with developmental

   Center of Orange County offers its support to the City in whatever
   way they can.
•	 The City needs to pave the way for people to develop the housing.
•	 The City’s RHNA number is a minimum- a starting point. There is
   hope the City will go above and beyond that number. The Kennedy
   Commission offers its support in whatever way they can.

Housing Needs Assessment
This section of the Housing Element describes the supply and demand
for housing in Laguna Hills and is divided into subsections that
address the characteristics of population, employment, households,
special needs populations, and housing stock. This analysis provides
the basis for developing a successful housing strategy that meets the
needs of the community.
Community Profile
The City of Laguna Hills is located in the San Joaquin Hills in southern
Orange County, approximately 60 miles south of Los Angeles and 70
miles north of San Diego. Laguna Hills is bounded by the cities of
Irvine and Lake Forest to the north; Interstate 5 and the cities of Mission
Viejo and Lake Forest to the east; the City of Laguna Niguel to the
south; and, the cities of Aliso Viejo and Laguna Woods to the west.
In 1991, the City of Laguna Hills incorporated with an original land
area of 3,325 acres. Two subsequent annexations in 1995 and 2000 have

                                                               The age distribution of a population is an important factor in evaluating
                                                               housing and community development needs and determining the
                                                               direction of future housing development. Typically, each age group has
                                                               distinct lifestyles, family types and sizes, income and housing preferences.
                                                               As people move through each stage of life, housing needs and preferences
                                                               change. For example, young householders without children will have
                                                               different housing preferences than middle-age householders with children
                                                               or senior householders living alone. Consequently, evaluating the age
                                                               characteristics of a community is important in determining the housing
                                                               needs of residents.
                                                               As illustrated in Figure H-1, the 2010 population of Laguna Hills
                                                               was older on average than that of the county as a whole, with a higher
                                                               distribution of residents between the ages of 40-69. The median age for
                                                               residents in Laguna Hills was 40.8 years, while the county median age
                                                               was 36.2.
                                                               Since 2000, the median age has increased in the City. The median age for
                                                               the City of Laguna Hills in 2000 was 37.7. A similar increase in median
                                                               age can be seen in Orange County with the median age increasing from
                                                               33.3 years in 2000 to the 2010 median age of 36.2. The Orange County
                                                               Business Council indicates that the population of Orange County is
                                                               growing older rapidly, with Laguna Hills expected to experience a similar
                                                               trend. This may indicate a need for more housing targeted to seniors,

The racial and ethnic composition of a population affects housing needs

Housing Characteristics
HOUSEHOLD TYPE AND SIZE
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type of housing
needed in a community. The Census defines a household as all persons
who occupy a housing unit, which may include families related through
marriage or blood, unrelated individuals living together, or individuals
living alone. People living in group quarters, such as retirement or
convalescent homes, dormitories, or other group living situations, are not
considered households.
In 2010, there were 10,469 households in Laguna Hills (Table H-7).
Families constituted 74 percent of households in the City, a proportion
slightly greater than that found in Orange County (71.4 percent). For
Hispanic and Asian households within Laguna Hills, families accounted
for 84 percent and 81 percent of those households, respectively (Table
H-7a). Families with children represented 32 percent of households in
Laguna Hills and 34 percent in Orange County. Single-person households
represented approximately 20 percent of households in Laguna Hills,
while single-person households in Orange County were slightly greater at
approximately 21 percent.
Housing needs generally vary by household type. Families typically occupy
single-family homes. However, some families are unable to purchase or
rent a home and may reside in multifamily apartments, condominiums, or
townhome units. Single-person households, typified by seniors or young
adults, tend to reside in apartment units, condominiums, townhomes, or
smaller single-family homes. The Laguna Hills housing stock (Figure H-2)
provides a range of unit types. The housing stock comprises 56 percent
single-family detached units, 26 percent single-family attached units, 11
percent multifamily units, such as apartments and condominiums, and 2
percent mobile homes or other units.
Household size identifies sources of population growth and household
overcrowding. A city’s average household size will increase over time
if there is a trend toward larger families. In communities where the
population is aging, the average household size may decline. The
average household size in Laguna Hills in 2010 (2.86) was lower than
the County average household size (2.99). For Hispanic and Asian
households, household size was larger than the average household size for
Laguna Hills as a whole, at 4.04 and 3.16, respectively.

HOUSEHOLD INCOME
The income earned by a household is an important indicator of the
household’s ability to acquire adequate housing. While upper income
households have more discretionary income to spend on housing, lower
and moderate income households are more limited in the range of
housing that they can afford. Typically, as household income decreases,
the incidence of overpayment and overcrowding increases.
HCD has developed the following income categories:
•	   Extremely low income households earn between 0 and 30 percent of
     the County Median Family Income (MFI), adjusted for household
     size;
•	   Very low income households earn between 0 and 50 percent of the
     County MFI, adjusted for household size;
•	   Low income households earn between 51 and 80 percent of the
     County MFI, adjusted for household size;
•	   Moderate income households earn between 81 and 120 percent of
     the County MFI, adjusted for household size; and
•	   Above moderate/upper income households earn over 120 percent of
     the County MFI, adjusted for household size.
 Similarly, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) uses Census data to develop special tabulation by HUD income
group and household type. This data set is known as the Comprehensive
Housing Availability Strategy (CHAS). The federal CHAS data separates
California’s very low income category into extremely low (0–30 percent
MFI) and very low (31–50 percent MFI) incomes, and combines
California’s moderate income and upper income categories.
CHAS income distributions for Laguna Hills and Orange County are
presented in Table H-8. According to CHAS data, almost 11 percent of
the City’s households in 2009 qualified as extremely low income (0–30
percent MFI), more than 10 percent as very low income (31–50 percent
MFI), and greater than 12 percent as low income (51–80 percent MFI).
More than 50 percent of renter households qualified as low income
or below, compared with 24 percent of owner households. In Orange
County, over 42 percent of households were considered low income or
below, compared with 33 percent of households in the City of Laguna
Hills. During the planning period, the extremely low income housing
need is one unt, which is derived from presuming 50 percent of the very
low income housing need (1 unit) from the Regional Housing Need
Assessment.

                                                             An overcrowded household is typically defined as one with more than one

                                                             persons per room. Overcrowding results from either a lack of affordable
                                                             housing and/or lack of available housing units of adequate size.

OVERPAYMENT
State and federal standards for housing cost burden (overpayment)
consider a household as overpaying for housing if it spends more than
30 percent of its gross income on housing. A household spending
more than it can afford for housing has less money available for other
necessities and emergency expenditures. Very low income households
overpaying for housing are more likely to be at risk of becoming
homeless than other households. Renter households overpay for their
housing costs more often than owner households because of their
typically lower incomes.
                                                                       Table H-10

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                          Table H-10 shows the number and proportion of households with
                                          housing cost burden by income range and tenure. According to the
                                          American Community Survey estimates (2009-2011), approximately 49
                                          percent of Laguna Hills households overpaid for housing. Approximately
                                          66 percent of renter households and 43 percent of owner households
                                          in the City use more than 30 percent of their incomes to cover housing
                                          costs. Not surprisingly, the percentage of households overpaying declines
                                          significantly as household income rises.
                                          For Orange County, American Community Survey (2009-2011) data
                                          indicate that approximately 47 percent of households overpaid for
                                          housing, which is 2 percentage points lower than in Laguna Hills.
                                          Special Needs Populations
                                          Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding
                                          decent, affordable housing due to special needs or circumstances. Special
                                          circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income, family
                                          characteristics, disability, and household size, among other things. As
                                          a result, certain segments of residents in Laguna Hills may experience
                                          a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing
                                          problems. “Special needs” groups include senior households, agricultural
                                          workers, female-headed households, disabled persons, large households,
                                          and the homeless.
                                          SENIOR HOUSEHOLDS
                                          Senior or elderly households are those headed by individuals aged 65
                                          or older. The special needs of the elderly are a function of their often
                                          lower or fixed incomes, disabilities or limitations, and dependency needs.
                                          There are four main concerns with this group of the population: limited
                                          and often fixed income; poor health and associated high health care costs;
                                          mobility limitations and transit dependency; and high costs of housing.
                                          In addition, housing for the elderly often requires special attention to
                                          design to allow greater access and mobility. Housing located within the
                                          vicinity of community facilities and public transportation also facilitates
                                          mobility of the elderly in the community.
                                          According to the 2010 Census, Laguna Hills had 3,890 residents age
                                          65 or older, representing 13 percent of the total population. Also in
                                          2010, 2,210 senior households existed in Laguna Hills, constituting
                                          roughly 21 percent of the City’s total households (Table H-11). Of these
                                          households, about 75 percent were owner households, while almost 25
                                          percent were renter households.

According to CHAS data, over 46 percent of all senior households were
of extremely low, very low, or low incomes (Table H-12). Approximately
67 percent of total senior renter households were of extremely low,
very low, or low incomes compared with 39 percent of senior owner
households.
According to the Census, a substantial increase in the number of older
people will occur during the 2010 to 2030 period, after the first Baby
Boomers turn 65 in 2011. The older population in 2030 is projected
to be twice as large as that in 2000, representing nearly 20 percent of
the total U.S. population at the latter date. Orange County including
Laguna Hills is expected to experience similar trends.

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                          California Department of Finance projections indicate that the
                                          population aged 65 and over in Orange County will increase from
                                          282,479 in 2000 to 504,266 in 2020, an increase of over 78 percent.
                                          By 2030, the senior population will increase to 693,602, a 146 percent
                                          increase from 2000.
                                          As the number of older people and life expectancies increase, the demand
                                          for a variety of senior housing options will also increase. In addition
                                          to traditional facilities that offer independent living units, demand for
                                          intermediate care and assisted living will also increase, as well as for
                                          facilities offering a full range of living arrangements.
                                          Laguna Hills currently has two housing developments that provide
                                          housing for seniors. The Willows contains 152 ground level housing
                                          units and Villa Valencia contains 396 units with options for independent
                                          living, assisted living, and nursing care.
                                          Concerns were voiced during the Housing Stakeholder meeting in
                                          February 2013 and other public meetings about an aging population in
                                          Orange County and Laguna Hills and the need to provide additional
                                          senior housing. The Housing Element contains programs that may
                                          benefit the senior population and could provide additional senior housing
                                          opportunities, including Senior/Disabled or Limited Income Repair
                                          Loan and Grant Program; Promote the Urban Village Specific Plan
                                          Area for Housing Opportunities; Promote Alicia Gateway for Housing
                                          Opportunities, and Second Units.
                                          AGRICULTURAL WORKERS
                                          The special housing needs of farm workers result from their low wages
                                          and the seasonal nature of their employment. According to the American
                                          Community Survey (2009-2011) no residents of Laguna Hills were
                                          employed in farming, forestry, or fishing occupations. Therefore, demand
                                          for housing generated by agricultural workers in the City is nominal and
                                          could be addressed adequately by overall housing affordability programs
                                          in the City and County.
                                          FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
                                          Single-parent families with children often require special attention due to
                                          their needs for affordable childcare, health care, and housing assistance.
                                          Female-headed families with children particularly tend to have lower
                                          incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this group. According
                                          to the American Community Survey (2009-2011), of the 7,723 family
                                          households in Laguna Hills, 973 were female-headed family households,
                                          or about 13%. In the 2009-2011 estimates, approximately 5 percent
                                          of all families in Laguna Hills were under the poverty level, with that

number jumping to 7.4 percent of female-headed families with children
under 18. It is important to note, however, that only 2.6 percent of
female-headed families were under the proverty level.
The Housing Element contains programs that could benefit single-
parent, female-headed households. These programs include: Promote
the Urban Village Specific Plan Area for Housing Opportunities;
Promote Alicia Gateway for Housing Opportunities; Continuum of
Care Funding and Consolidated Plan Participation; and Partner with
Affordable Housing Developers. The Housing Element also contains
programs targeted to low income households which may benefit female-
headed households.

PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Disability is a physical or mental condition that substantially limits
one or more major life activities. Physical disabilities can hinder access
to housing units of conventional design, as well as limit the ability to
earn adequate income. The American Community Survey defines six
types of disabilities: hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care,
and independent living difficulty. A more detailed description of each
disability is provided below:
•	 Hearing difficulty: Deaf or having serious difficulty hearing.
•	 Vision difficulty: Blind or having serious difficulty seeing, even when
    wearing glasses.
•	 Cognitive difficulty: Because of a physical, mental, or emotional
    problem, having difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making
    decisions.
•	 Ambulatory difficulty: Having serious difficulty walking or climbing
    stairs.
•	 Self-care difficulty: Having difficulty bathing or dressing.
•	 Independent living difficulty: Because of physical, mental, or
                                                                                                                                 H-21

                                                          senior population in Laguna Hills has a higher incidence of disability,

                                                          Physical and mental disabilities can hinder a person’s access to
                                                          traditionally designed housing units (and other facilities) as well as

countertops, and other features necessary for accessibility. The cost of
retrofitting a home often prohibits homeownership, even for individuals
or families who could otherwise afford a home. Furthermore,
some providers of basic home buying services do not have offices or
materials that are accessible to people with mobility, visual, or hearing
impairments.
A recent change in state law required that the Housing Element
discuss the housing needs of persons with developmental
disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability”
means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
•	   Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination
     of mental and physical impairments;
•	   Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
•	   Is likely to continue indefinitely;
•	   Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the
     following areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and
     expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f )
     capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency; and
•	   Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of
     special, interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports,
     or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration
     and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to
the U.S Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted
estimate of the percentage of the population that can be defined as
developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This equated to approximately
456 persons in the City of Laguna Hills with devevlopmental disabilities,
based on the 2010 Census population.
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services,
approximately 186 Laguna Hills residents with developmental
disabilities sought services at the Regional Center of Orange County.
Most of these individuals reside in a private home with a parent or
guardian.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently
within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled
individuals require a group living environment where supervision
is provided. The most severly affected individuals may require an
institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood,
the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled
is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of interdependence as an adult.

                                          Housing opportunities for disabled persons can be addressed through
                                          the provision of affordable, barrier-free housing. In addition to the
                                          development of new units, rehabilitation assistance can also be provided
                                          to disabled residents to make necessary improvements to remove
                                          architectural barriers to existing units. The Housing Element contains
                                          programs to create reasonable accommodations procedures and to
                                          consider the provision of universal design features. These programs
                                          address concerns from the Fall Prevention Center of Excellence and
                                          other stakeholders regarding incorporating universal design features
                                          and reasonable accommodations procedures into the Housing Element.
                                          Examples of universal design features include roll-in showers and grab

                                          LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
                                          Large households (with five or more persons) are identified as a group
                                          with special housing needs based on the limited availability of adequately
                                          sized, affordable housing units. Large households are often of lower
                                          income, frequently resulting in the overcrowding of smaller dwelling units
                                          and, in turn, accelerating unit deterioration. The American Community
                                          Survey (2009-2011) estimates that 1,007 households in Laguna Hills
                                          have five or more members, representing 9 percent of all City households.
                                          Among the large households, 74 percent were owner households and 26
                                          percent were renter households.
                                          Typically, the availability of adequately sized and affordable housing units
                                          is an obstacle facing large households. Since only 9 percent of Laguna
                                          Hills households are large households, Laguna Hills’ housing stock
                                          should be adequate to meet the needs of larger households. According
                                          to American Community Survey estimates (2009-2011), Laguna Hills
                                          had 3,285 three-bedroom housing units and another 4,484 housing
                                          units with four or more bedrooms. However, lower income large renter
                                          households may have greater difficulty securing adequately sized units
                                          than other large renter households.
                                          HOMELESS
                                          According to HUD, a person is considered homeless if he/she is not

Homelessness is a regional problem throughout Southern California.
The Orange County homeless population includes families and
individuals representing every race, age group, and community in
Orange County. Much of Orange County’s homeless population
consists of working families and individuals. Many live in cars, parks,
under bridges, motels, and in homeless shelters. Many homeless within
the County remain hidden.
The City of Laguna Hills is part of the Orange County Continuum of
Care System. HUD created the Continuum of Care process in 1994 to
foster a single, coordinated, comprehensive planning process to create
long-term solutions to the problem of homelessness and to serve as an
application mechanism to apply for HUD homeless assistance program
funds. Continuum of Care is an umbrella term that covers the planning
process involving government agencies, service providers, and advocates
in the creation of a plan to assess the needs of homeless people and to
devise a plan for delivering housing and services to meet those needs.
Once a plan is developed, “the Continuum” or “the CoC,” as these
planning bodies are generically called, apply for homeless assistance
funds to develop and/or operate transitional housing, supportive
services, and permanent housing for homeless people.
Orange County’s Continuum of Care System comprises a network of
public, private, faith-based, for-profit, and nonprofit service providers.
County agencies such as the Housing and Community Services
Department (HCS), Health Care Agency, Social Services Agency, and
other county agencies provide direct services for the homeless and/or
significant resources for agencies serving the homeless. The region’s 34
municipalities also provide substantial resources for services that assist
the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless. A partnership
exists between HCS’s Homeless Prevention Programs, 211 (formally
known as Info Link Orange County), and OC Partnership (formerly
known as Shelter and Hunger Partnership) to conduct community
forums to focus on the entire system of care. These forums provide
regional and coordinated meetings that focus on all issues relating to
the County’s Continuum of Care System. Issues include temporary
shelter and affordable housing, health care, case management, education,
                                                                                                               H-27

                                          and other related issues. Numerous public/private partnerships and
                                          collaboratives have been and continue to be developed and have enabled
                                          Orange County to expand the system of care through year-round,
                                          regional planning and coordinated efforts to better assist the homeless.
                                          When combined, these coordinated efforts decrease fragmentation and
                                          strengthen Orange County’s Continuum of Care System.
                                          The estimate of the number of homeless people in Orange County
                                          consists of a point-in-time count of the homeless, a needs assessment
                                          which estimates the number of homeless over a given year, and a
                                          housing inventory that identifies the number of beds available to house
                                          the homeless. The housing inventory is conducted annually, whereas
                                          the comprehensive needs assessment and the point-in-time count are
                                          biennial.
                                          Table H-16 details the estimate of the homeless in Orange County.
                                          According to the point in time survey, 6,939 unduplicated persons were
                                          found to be homeless in shelters and on the streets in Orange County
                                          on January 22, 2011. According to HUD, counting only the homeless
                                          persons found in the point-in-time count could under-represent the
                                          number of individuals who experience homelessness during other times
                                          of the year. Point-in-time estimates capture a higher share of chronically
                                          homeless individuals and families who use shelters or transitional shelters
                                          for long periods of time and under represent people whose homelessness
                                          is episodic. To obtain an accurate annual estimation of the number of

within the past 12 months. This methodology resulted in an estimated
total of 18,325 homeless incidents (incidents of homelessness) over a
12-month period in Orange County.
According to the 2007 needs assessment, total homeless episodes in
Orange County amounted to 35,065 in 2006. This number is derived
from 2006 caseload data collected from shelter providers and indicates
the total number of times homeless persons were sheltered and turned
away from shelters over a 12-month period. Also included is the total
number of chronically homeless individuals (street homeless) that
typically do not seek shelter.
The 2006 housing inventory survey identified 68 temporary shelters
providing 3,400 beds for the homeless on any given night. These beds
consist of 1,512 emergency shelter beds, 1,888 transitional shelter beds,
and 1,875 permanent supportive housing beds. Most of these shelters
are located in central and north Orange County. While shelters provide
emergency and transitional housing for the homeless, most shelters
provide services to designated subpopulations such as veterans, victims of
domestic violence, and persons with HIV/AIDS, etc., which limits the
availability of shelters to serve all populations.
Between 1996 and 2012, HUD has conditionally awarded Orange
County $169.9 million in homeless assistance grants under the
SuperNOFA Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Grant funding
program. The SuperNOFA is an annual process and the grant award to
the County of Orange, with Housing and Community Services as the
lead agency, is a direct result of the County’s partnership with cities and
hundreds of nonprofit organizations to address the issue of homelessness
in Orange County. The grant award provides transitional shelter and
supportive services for families and individuals as well as permanent
supportive housing for the disabled and special needs homeless
populations.
The Constraints on Housing Production section did not identify any
constraints to the provision of housing facilities for homeless in Laguna
Hills. The City’s Zoning Ordinance defines an emergency shelter as
“housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that
is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person, or
as may be amended by Health and Safety Code Section 50801(e). No
individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because
of an inability to pay.” The City permits supportive and transitional
housing facilities for six (6) or fewer persons in all residential zones as a
residential use. Emergency shelters are permitted by right in the Mixed
Use zone and are subject to development and management standards.
As of May 2013, the City has not received applications to construct
emergency shelters, and none have been constructed.

                                            estimate the number of homeless in Laguna Hills, although it does appear
                                            that a small number of homeless persons in Orange County lived in
                                            Laguna Hills at some point.

                                            A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all housing
                                            units located within the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing

                                            costs, and affordability are important in determining the housing needs
                                            for the community. This section details the housing stock characteristics
                                            of Laguna Hills in an attempt to identify how well the current housing
                                            stock meets the needs of current and future residents of the City.
                                            HOUSING GROWTH TRENDS
                                            The 2010 Census reported that Laguna Hills had 11,046 housing units.
                                            On January 1, 2012, the California Department of Finance reported
                                            that Laguna Hills had a total of 11,049 housing units (Table H-17).
                                            From 2008 to 2012, the housing stock decreased in Laguna Hills by
                                            approximately 104 units. As of January 2008, single-family homes
                                            constituted over 75 percent of the City’s housing stock. Multifamily
                                            units constituted 9 percent, while mobile homes constituted 3 percent of
                                            the City’s housing stock (Figure H-2).

TENURE
The tenure distribution of a community’s housing stock (owner versus
renter) influences several aspects of the local housing market. Residential
stability is influenced by tenure, with ownership housing evidencing a
much lower turnover rate than rental housing. Housing overpayment,
while faced by many households, is far more prevalent among renters.
Tenure preferences are primarily related to household income,
composition, and age of the householder.
Table H-18 details tenure by housing unit type for Laguna Hills and
Orange County for 2009-2011. Approximately 75 percent of Laguna
Hills residents owned the units they occupied, while approximately 25
percent rented. This rate of homeownership is over 16 percentage points
higher than the countywide rate.

                                                          VACANCY
                                                          A certain number of vacant units are needed to moderate the cost of
                                                          housing, allow sufficient choice for residents, and provide an incentive for
                                                          unit upkeep and repair. Specifically, vacancy rates of 1.5 to 2 percent for
                                                          ownership housing and 5 to 6 percent for rental housing are considered
                                                          optimal to balance demand and supply for housing.
                                                          In 2010, the Census indicated that the overall vacancy rate in Laguna
                                                          Hills was 5.2 percent (Table H-19). Specifically, the vacancy rate for
                                                          ownership housing was 1.0 percent, while the rental vacancy rate was 3.0
                                                          percent.
                                                          The low ownership housing vacancy rate in Laguna Hills is attributed to
                                                          the lack of developable land for additional housing unit construction and
                                                          pent-up demand for ownership housing opportunities.

                                                          AGE AND HOUSING STOCK CONDITIONS
                                                          The age of housing is commonly used as a measure of when housing may
                                                          begin to require major repairs. In general, housing units over 30 years
                                                          old are likely to exhibit signs of rehabilitation needs, such as new roofing,
                                                          foundation work, and new plumbing.
                                                          As depicted in Figure H-3, the housing stock in Laguna Hills is newer
                                                          than that of Orange County. About 49 percent of the City’s housing
                                                          stock was constructed after 1980 versus 35 percent for Orange County.

At the same time, about 51 percent of the housing stock in Laguna Hills
was constructed prior to 1980. Therefore, nearly half of the housing
stock is of sufficient age to be susceptible to deterioration, requiring
maintenance or rehabilitation by the end of this planning period (2013-
2021).
Citywide windshield surveys were conducted to identify general housing
conditions within Laguna Hills. The majority of the City’s housing
stock is not considered substandard or in need of rehabilitation or
replacement. However, many of the units within the Aliso Meadows
Condominium Development may be considered substandard due to pest
damage, dry rot, heating ductwork issues, and water heater closet issues.
As of early 2008, the City has used Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) funds to renovate 136 housing units in the 248-unit
Aliso Meadows Condominium Development. The City continues to use
CDBG funds to renovate units with this development. The Housing
Element contains the Housing Rehabilitation Program to rehabilitate the
remaining units (approximately 112.)
Housing Costs and
Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems
in a community. If housing costs are relatively high in comparison to
household income, there will be a correspondingly higher prevalence of
                                                                                                              H-33

                                          HOMEOWNERSHIP MARKET
                                          Prices for single-family homes and condominiums in Laguna Hills were
                                          collected using data provided by the Orange County Association of
                                          Realtors. Prices for single-family homes and condominiums in Laguna
                                          Hills during the period from January 1, 2012 to January 1, 2013, by
                                          housing type, number sold, price range, and median sale price are
                                          shown in Table H-20. According to the Orange County Association of
                                          Realtors, 433 homes and condominiums were sold during the 1-year
                                          period. The median resale price for condominiums was $225,000 and the
                                          median resale price for single-family homes was $580,000. The overall
                                          median sales price for both condominiums and single-family homes was
                                          $425,000.
                                          Market data for October 2012 housing prices for the City of Laguna
                                          Hills and nearby communities is shown in Table H-21. As the table
                                          indicates, after Laguna Niguel, Laguna Hills has the second highest
                                          median selling prices for single-family homes.
                                          RENTAL MARKET
                                          With renters constituting approximately 24 percent of the City’s
                                          households, it is important to understand the rental market in Laguna
                                          Hills. Rental price information was collected for five apartment
                                          communities in January 2013 by calling the apartment complexes
                                          identified in Table H-22. The rental range for one-bedroom units
                                          ranged from $1,190 to $1,525. Two-bedroom units were offered
                                          at rents ranging from $1,325 to $1,825. No apartment complexes
                                          offering market rate studio units or three-bedroom units or greater were
                                          identified.
                                          HOUSING AFFORDABILITY BY
                                          HOUSEHOLD INCOME
                                          Housing affordability is dependent upon income and housing costs.
                                          Using set income guidelines, current housing affordability can be
                                          estimated. According to the HCD income guidelines for 2013, the Area
                                          Median Income (AMI) in Orange County was $87,200 (adjusted for
                                          household size). Assuming that the potential homebuyer within each
                                          income group has sufficient credit, downpayment (10 percent), and
                                          maintains affordable housing expenses (i.e., spends no more than 30
                                          percent of their gross income on the mortgage, taxes, and insurance),
                                          the maximum affordable home price can be determined for each income

family. Affordable rental rates for low income households would range from $1,249

                                          to 120 percent of the County AMI. The maximum affordable home
                                          price for moderate income households ranges from $319,557 for a
                                          one-person household to $497,866 for a family of five. A moderate
                                          income household can afford rental rates of $1,691 to $2,514 per month
                                          depending on household size.
                                          Based on these maximum affordable home prices and the real estate data
                                          provided by the Orange County Association of Realtors and presented
                                          in Table H-20, moderate income households could afford a number of
                                          condominiums sold in Laguna Hills, but moderate income households
                                          would have difficulty purchasing a single-family home that could
                                          accommodate their household size.
                                          Moderate income households can comfortably afford rental housing
                                          within Laguna Hills (Table H-22). However, the number of apartment
                                          complexes offering three-bedroom units in Laguna Hills is limited, so
                                          moderate income households with large households may have difficulty
                                          finding housing.
                                          This Housing Element includes a variety of programs designed to
                                          improve the adequacy and affordability of housing in Laguna Hills and
                                          to assist renters and homeowners who cannot afford housing (see the
                                          Housing Plan section).
                                          Table H-24 presents a summary of housing affordability and availability
                                          in Laguna Hills. The table indicates that extremely low and very low
                                          income households cannot afford to rent market rate rentals in Laguna
                                          Hills. Low income and moderate income households in Laguna Hills can
                                          generally afford market rate rentals. Additionally, there were homes and
                                          condominiums available for purchase within all income category ranges
                                          according to sale prices over the previous year. It should be noted that at
                                          the extremely low and very low income levels, housing stock for sale is
                                          much more limited than at higher income levels.

                                          Laguna Hills. The figure depicts the location of affordable condo sales

At-Risk Rental Housing
Existing housing that receives governmental assistance is often a
significant source of affordable housing in many communities. This
section identifies the publicly assisted rental housing in Laguna Hills,
evaluates the potential for those units to convert to market rates during
a 10-year period (2013-2023), and analyzes the cost to preserve those
units. Laguna Hills has two assisted housing developments that provide
102 affordable housing units (Table H-25).
ASSISTED HOUSING INVENTORY
State housing element law requires cities to prepare an inventory
including all assisted multifamily rental units that are eligible to convert
to non-low income housing uses due to termination of subsidy contract,
mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions.
Table H-25 is an inventory of assisted rental housing projects in Laguna
Hills. A total of 102 assisted units are provided by the Rancho Moulton
and Rancho Niguel developments. Both Rancho Moulton and Rancho
Niguel are projects built in the early 1980s with Section 8 construction
funds. The projects were approved in one action by the County of
Orange in 1980 as affordable to low and moderate income residents.
Project approval included first-time homebuyer/renter qualifications,
an anti-speculation program, and a method of assuring continued
affordability of the units to low and moderate income individuals or
families. Furthermore, project approval mandated that 29 percent of
total units be made available to individual or families earning 80 percent
and below AMI, 30 percent of total units be made available to individuals
or families earning 81 percent to 100 percent of AMI, and 41 percent of
total units be made available to individuals or families earning 101 to 120
percent AMI.

AT-RISK HOUSING
During the 2013-2023 planning period, the Rancho Moulton federally
assisted housing project in Laguna Hills is at risk of converting to
market rate housing. The Section 8 contract for Rancho Moulton was
set to expire in 2012, and was recently renewed for 10 years. The new
contract will expire in 2022, near the end of the planning period. This
project, totaling 51 affordable units, is assisted with project-based
Section 8 rental assistance. The Section 8 contract for Rancho Niguel
was extended for 20 years in 2004 and is due to expire in 2024. The
City continues to pursue the extension of affordability controls with the
owners of the Rancho Moulton development.
The City will continue to monitor the status of at-risk units. Should
a notice of intent to convert to market rate be filed, the City will work
with potential purchasers to preserve the units and ensure that tenants
are properly notified of their rights under California law.
PRESERVATION OPTIONS
Preservation of the at-risk units can be achieved in several ways: (1)
facilitate transfer of ownership of these projects or purchase of similar
units by nonprofit organizations; (2) purchase of affordability covenant;
and (3) provide rental assistance to tenants using funding sources other
than Section 8.
Transfer of Ownership
Long-term affordability of low income units can be secured by
transferring ownership of these projects to nonprofit housing
organizations. By doing so, these units would be eligible for a greater
range of government assistance. Table H-26 presents the estimated
                                                                                                                                         H-41

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                          market value for the 51 units at Rancho Moulton Apartments and
                                          establishes an order of magnitude for assessing preservation costs. As
                                          shown, the total market value of these units is over $10,089,000 Assuming
                                          a 5-percent down payment is made on the project, at least a $504,000
                                          down payment would be required to transfer ownership of these buildings
                                          to nonprofit organizations. Unless some form of mortgage assistance
                                          is available to interested nonprofit organizations, rental income alone
                                          from the low income tenants would not likely be adequate to cover the
                                          mortgage payment, and rental subsidy would be required.
                                          Purchase of Affordability Covenant
                                          Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to
                                          provide an incentive package to the owners to maintain the projects as
                                          low income housing. Incentives could include writing down the interest
                                          rate on the remaining loan balance, and/or supplementing the Section 8
                                          subsidy amount received to market levels.
                                          Rent Subsidy
                                          Tenant-based rent subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability
                                          of housing. Similar to Section 8 vouchers, the City through a variety
                                          of potential funding sources may provide a voucher to lower income
                                          households. The level of the subsidy required to preserve the at-risk
                                          affordable housing is estimated to equal the fair market rent for a unit
                                          minus the housing cost affordable by a very low income household.
                                          Table H-27 estimates the rent subsidies required to preserve the housing
                                          affordability for the residents of the 51 at-risk units. Based on the
                                          estimates and assumptions shown in this table, approximately $356,000 in
                                          rent subsidies would be required annually.
                                                                            Table H-26

       Average subsidy per unit is estimated with the following assumptions:
       A 2-BR unit is assumed to be occupied by a three-person household, a 3-BR unit by a five-person household, and a 4 BR unit by a seven-person household.
       Vacancy rate = 5%.
       Based on 2011 AMI in Orange County, affordable monthly housing cost for a three-person very low income household is $948, $1,053 for a five-person household, and
       $1,137 for a seven-person household. HUD 2013 fair market rent in the Orange County MSA is $1,527 for a 2-BR, $2,137 for a 3-BR, and $2,379 for a 4-BR.
REPLACEMENT COSTS
The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of factors
such as density, size of units, location and related land costs, and type
of construction. A typical two-bedroom apartment costs approximately
$200,000 to develop. Assuming a three-bedroom apartment would
cost 20 percent more to develop than a two-bedroom unit, and a four-
bedroom unit would cost 20 percent more than a three-bedroom unit,
the total cost of constructing 51 new units to replace at risk units would
be approximately $10,880,000.
COST COMPARISON
The cost to build new housing to replace the 51 at-risk units was
estimated at more than $10,880,000. This cost estimate is higher than
the cost associated with transfer of ownership ($10,089,000). This
analysis indicated that providing rent subsidies similar to Section 8
vouchers for 20 years ($7,600,000) could cost less than building new
housing and transferring ownership.
ESTIMATES OF HOUSING NEEDS
The CHAS developed by the Census for HUD provides detailed
information on housing needs by income level for different types of
households in Laguna Hills. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2012
                                                                                                                                                                         H-43
CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                          Census are displayed in Table H-28. Based on CHAS, housing problems
                                          in Laguna Hills include:
                                          •	   Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
                                          •	   Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person
                                               per room);
                                          •	   Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of
                                               gross income; or
                                          •	   Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent
                                               of gross income.
                                          Disproportionate Needs
                                          The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and
                                          tenure. Some highlights include:
                                          •	   In general, renter households had a higher level of housing problems
                                               (40 percent) than owner households (16 percent).
                                          •	   Small family renter households had the highest level of housing
                                               problems regardless of income level (56 percent).
                                          •	   Approximately 70 percent of extremely low income renters, 76
                                               percent of very low income renters, and 54 percent of low income
                                               renters had a housing problem.
                                          •	   Approximately 51 percent of extremely low income owners, 33

                                          Production
                                          Despite the great need for housing in general and the demand for
                                          affordable housing in particular, a number of constraints exist that could
                                          limit the development, preservation, and improvement of housing.
                                          These barriers or constraints include governmental, environmental,
                                          infrastructure, and market-related factors. These constraints may result
                                          in housing that is not affordable to extremely low, very low, low, and
                                          moderate income households; not available to households with special
                                          needs; or may render residential construction economically infeasible for
                                          developers. These factors are discussed in this section. Constraints on
                                          the production of housing related to the national economy cannot be
                                          effectively mitigated by local government and, accordingly, are beyond
                                          the scope of this section.

 Notes: Data presented in this table are based on special tabulations from sample Census data. The number of households in each category usually deviates slightly from the
 100.0% count due to the need to extrapolate sample data out to total households. Interpretations of these data should focus on the proportion of households in need of assistance
 rather than on precise numbers.
Governmental Constraints
The intent of local government regulations is to protect public health
and safety, and to ensure a decent quality of life for the community.
However, local policies and regulations affect the price and availability
of housing and, in particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land
use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit
processing procedures, and other factors can constrain the maintenance,
development, and improvement of housing.
State and federal regulations also affect the availability of land for
housing and the cost of producing housing. Regulations related to
environmental protection, building codes, and other topics have
significant, often adverse, impacts on housing cost and availability.
Perhaps one of the greatest constraints to the production of housing
                                                                                                                                                                              H-45

   areas where a variety of goods and services can be obtained within
   an overall planned environment. This zone permits commercial,
   recreational, residential, and light industrial uses.
•	 Neighborhood Mixed Use District (NMU) – The intent of the
   Neighborhood Mixed Use designation is to provide a variety of
   compact, multi-family housing types close to jobs and services;
   create a more active, vibrant street life; increase pedestrian activity
   and reduce vehicular traffic; provide storefront style shopping
   streets; and/or encourage walking and social interaction. Within
   the Neighborhood Mixed Use designation, appropriate land uses
   include mid-box anchors; administrative and professional uses;
   grocery and specialty stores; business support uses; eating and
   drinking establishments; cinemas; personal services; residential
   condos, apartments, and townhomes; and mixed use structures.

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                               planned, zoned, developed and administered as individual integrated
                                               communities.
                                          •	   Village Commercial (VC) – The Village Commercial district is
                                               established to develop an urban core in which a variety of public,
                                               regional commercial, recreational, and high density residential uses
                                               work in concert to create an urban village. All development within
                                               the village commercial district is subject to the Urban Village Specific
                                               Plan.
                                          The City’s General Plan, which was updated in 2009, added additional
                                          development capacity in the Urban Village Specific Plan (UVSP) area
                                          of 117,000 square feet of retail space, and included an Implementation
                                          Program requiring that the information be inserted into the UVSP. The
                                          updated General Plan’s Housing Element (Housing Element 2008-
                                          2014) also required that the UVSP be amended to establish a minimum
                                          residential density of 30 units per acre and reduce high open space
                                          standards that discourage affordable housing. In 2011, the City amended
                                          the UVSP to ensure consistency with the General Plan and to help
                                          implement the General Plan goals and policies.
                                          Development standards for residential development established in the
                                          City’s Zoning Ordinance are designed to protect and promote the health,
                                          safety, and general welfare of residents, as well as implement the General
                                          Plan. These standards also help preserve the character and integrity of
                                          existing neighborhoods.
                                          The development standards in Table H-30 can have an effect on the
                                          ability of property owners to construct and maintain housing. The City
                                          has very few opportunities for new development, as there is little vacant,
                                          buildable land remaining in the City. Selected residential development
                                          standards in Laguna Hills were compared to those in jurisdictions
                                          surrounding Laguna Hills (Table H-31). The comparison indicates that
                                          the minimum open space percentage of 40 percent for the HDR district
                                          in Laguna Hills may be high compared to that for Laguna Niguel (25
                                          percent) and that for Mission Viejo (80 sq. ft. of private open space),
                                          which could discourage the construction of high density residential
                                          projects in the City. The City will decrease the open space requirement
                                          for the HDR district. Additionally, maximum lot coverage in the MXU
                                          district in Laguna Hills may be considered low at 40 percent, which
                                          could also discourage the construction of mixed use projects in the
                                          City. The City will increase the maximum lot coverage requirement
                                          for the MXU district. These recommendations are included in the
                                          Programs section of this Housing Element. As illustrated in Table H-31,
                                          many residential development standards in some of the jurisdictions
                                          surrounding Laguna Hills are not specified to the same level of detail as
H-48

they are in Laguna Hills. Therefore, an exact comparison of residential
development standards with Laguna Hills is not possible.
Overall, the City’s development standards for residential development
have not constrained housing development in the City as development
can still occur up to the maximum densities allowed by the General Plan
and zoning regulations.

PARKING STANDARDS
Excess parking requirements can reduce the number of housing units
that can be achieved on a given site. The City’s parking requirements are
illustrated in Table H-32, while Table H-33 shows parking requirements
for surrounding jurisdictions. The parking requirements in Laguna
Hills are not considered overly excessive when compared with those in
surrounding jurisdictions. For affordable housing projects qualified for a
density bonus, the City has adopted the parking requirements mandated
by state density bonus law (refer to Section 9-72.030 of the Laguna Hills
Municipal Code).
PROVISION FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING
The City recognizes the need for a variety of housing types to meet
the needs of the City’s diverse population, particularly segments with
special housing needs. The following analysis reviews the City’s Zoning
Ordinance to evaluate potential constraints to developing housing for
persons with special needs. Table H-34 summarizes the key zoning
provisions for various housing types in the City. As shown, the City’s
zoning provisions for special needs housing are flexible and offer ample
opportunities for such uses.
SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS
Detached, single-family dwellings are permitted in all residential zones.
As the City is nearly built out, only six vacant single-family home parcels
remain within the Nellie Gail Ranch area.
SINGLE-FAMILY ATTACHED DWELLINGS
Attached single-family dwellings are permitted in the medium-low,
medium, and high density zoning districts of the City.
DUPLEX DWELLINGS
Duplex dwellings are permitted in the medium-low, medium, and high
density zoning districts of the City.
MULTIFAMILY DWELLINGS
Multifamily developments are permitted in the medium-low,
medium, and high density zoning districts of the City, subject to a site
development permit. The maximum density in these districts ranges
from 12.5 dwelling units per acre in the medium-low district to 30.0
dwelling units per acre in the high density residential zone. Multifamily
development in the Urban Village Specific Plan area is permitted at a
minimum density of 30.0 dwelling units per acte to a maximum density
of 50.0 dwelling units per acre.

permits boarding homes in the VC district. In the FC, CC, and MXU
districts, boarding homes are permitted subject to a site development
permit.
ACCESSORY LIVING QUARTERS/SECOND
UNIT HOUSING
Accessory living quarters/second unit housing provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons, including
permanent provisions for living, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation.
These units may be an alternative source of affordable housing for lower
income households and seniors.
California law requires local jurisdictions to adopt ordinances that
establish the conditions under which second dwelling units are
permitted (Government Code, Section 65852.2). A jurisdiction cannot
adopt an ordinance that precludes the development of second units
unless findings are made acknowledging that allowing second units may
limit housing opportunities of the region and result in adverse impacts
on public health, safety, and welfare. An amendment to the state’s
second unit law in September 2002 requires local governments to use a
ministerial rather than discretionary process for approving second units
(i.e., second units otherwise compliant with local zoning standards can
be approved without a public hearing).
Second dwelling units are permitted in all residential zones in Laguna
Hills pursuant to Section 9-68 of the Zoning Ordinance. Section
9-68 contains the following standards and criteria for accessory living
quarters/second unit housing:
•	    The second unit is not intended for sale and may be rented.
•	    The lot must contain at least, but not more than, one single-family
      unit.
•	    Attached second units shall not exceed 30 percent of the existing
      dwelling unit living area.
•	    Detached second units shall not exceed one 1,200 sq. ft. of floor
      area.
•	    The second unit shall be compatible in materials, colors, and
      architecture to the primary dwelling unit.
•	    Second units must conform to development standards and all other
      applicable requirements of the zone in which developed.
•	    One parking spot per unit is required.
•	    The owner of both units shall occupy either the primary or the
      second unit.
•	    The owner shall record a use restriction with the Orange County
      Recorder’s Office so that all present and future property owners
                                                                                                              H-55

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                               understand the obligations and limitations of these standards and
                                               criteria (Section 9-68 of the Zoning Ordinance).
                                          The City’s criteria and standards for second unit developments are not
                                          considered overly excessive. As of May 2013, four accessory living
                                          quarters/second units have been constructed in the City.
                                          SINGLE-ROOM OCCUPANCY HOUSING
                                          FACILITY
                                          The City’s Zoning Ordinance defines a single room occupancy housing
                                          facility (SRO) as a housing type consisting of one room, often with
                                          cooking facilities and with private or shared bathroom facilities. As of
                                          May 2013, no SRO has been constructed in the City.
                                          The City provides opportunities for the location of SROs in
                                          nonresidential districts. SROs are permitted in the VC and MXU
                                          districts with a conditional use permit subject only to those restrictions
                                          or conditions that may apply to other residential uses of the same type
                                          in the same zone. In the OP, FC, and CC districts, SROs are permitted
                                          with a site development permit. Site development permits involving
                                          projects that have four or fewer residential units and non-residential uses
                                          of less than 20,000 square feet may be processed by the Community
                                          Development Director administratively. Anything above those
                                          thresholds must go to the City Council acting as the Planning Agency.
                                          However, whether a project goes to the City Council or is approved by
                                          staff (administratively), the findings are the same:
                                          1.	 That the site design complies with standards of the development
                                               code;
                                          2.	 That the site is suitable for the proposed development;
                                          3.	 That the project is consistent with the general plan and applicable
                                               design guidelines;
                                          4.	 That the site design and structural components are appropriate for
                                               the site and function of the proposed uses.
                                          The findings for a site development permit do not require “that the use
                                          be compatible with surrounding uses/properties.” Therefore, it is not
                                          considered discretionary from a “use” perspective.
                                          Chapter 9-72 of the Zoning Ordinance describes housing development
                                          incentives that are available to developers of affordable housing, which
                                          could include SROs. Incentives include both fiscal and procedural
                                          incentives, such as:
                                          •	   A 50% reduction in application fees;

                                                                            CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
•	   Waiver or reduction in building permit fees;
•	   Financial assistance for acquisition of property, mortgage assistance,
     sale of housing bonds, rent subsidies, or provision of improvements
     to serve the site;
•	   Combining all required applications for one review hearing;
•	   Fast-tracking; and
•	   Providing priority processing and scheduling for review.
The procedural incentives noted above ensure priority processing of
SROs. With the City’s already streamlined review process (1-2 months
for administrative and 2-3 months for discretionary projects) and the
ability for priority processing, no governmental constraint to developing
SROs exists in Laguna Hills.
COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES (SIX OR
FEWER INDIVIDUALS)
Community care facilities for six or fewer individuals consist of the
following per the City’s Zoning Ordinance:
•	   Residential care facilities for the elderly;
•	   Drug abuse and alcoholism recovery facilities;
•	   Intermediate care facilities;
•	   Dependent and neglected children homes (foster homes);
•	   Social rehabilitation facility;
•	   Congregate living health facility;
•	   Facilities for people with HIV or AIDS;
•	   Homes for the mentally and physically disabled;
•	   Supportive housing facilities; and
•	   Transitional housing facilities; and
•	   Facilities for wards of the juvenile court.
These facilities are permitted by right in all residential zones, with the
exception of facilities for wards of the juvenile court which require a
conditional use permit.
COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES (SEVEN
OR MORE INDIVIDUALS)
Table H-35 shows where various community care facilities for seven or
more individuals may be permitted or conditionally permitted in Laguna
Hills. The table also indicates when a conditional use permit may be
required.
LARGE FAMILY DAY CARE HOMES
Large family day care homes, for 7 to 14 children under the age of 10
years are conditionally permitted in all residential zones of the City.

TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES/
EMERGENCY SHELTERS
The City’s Zoning Ordinance provides definitions for “supportive
housing,” “transitional housing,” and “emergency shelter” that are
consistent with the California Health and Safety Code. Supportive
housing and transitional housing for six or fewer individuals are treated
as residential uses subject only to those restrictions that apply to other
residential uses in the same zone.
The following community care facilities are located in the City of Laguna
Hills as of January 31, 2008.
•	 Adult residential facility (developmentally disabled) - 1 facility
•	 Child care center (commercial) – 3 facilities
•	 Large family day care homes – 8 homes
•	 Small family day care homes – 32 homes
•	 Infant centers (commercial) – 1 facility
•	 Residential care for the elderly – 43 facilities
•	 Alcoholism or drug abuse recovery, residential (state licensed) – 1
     facility
•	 Alcoholism or drug abuse recovery, commercial/office (state
     licensed) – 3 facilities
•	 Sober living homes – 2 homes
As noted above, the City does not require permits for community
care facilities serving six or fewer individuals. Therefore, additional
community care facilities may exist within the City.
In accordance with SB2, the Municipal Code was amended to allow
emergency shelters “by right” within the defined emergency shelter
overlay area of the Mixed Use (MXU) district subject to objective
development standards without a conditional use permit or other
discretionary approval. The MXU district encompasses approximately
284 acres, 20% (55 acres) of which meets the overlay criteria for
emergency shelters sites (See Figure H-4a). The MXU district is
served by transit and commercial services. Development Code Section
9-64.040.(D) establishes the following standards for emergency shelters:
1. An emergency shelter shall be located at least five hundred (500) feet
from any residential use, public or private park, public or private K-12
school, church, or other religious institution.
2. An emergency shelter shall be located at least three hundred (300)
feet from other emergency shelters.
                                                                                                               H-59

                                          emergency shelters established within the mixed use zone shall not exceed
                                          twenty (20).
                                          4. The maximum stay at the emergency shelter shall not exceed one
                                          hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days.
                                          5. Off-street parking shall be provided in the ratio of one space for every
                                          three beds, plus one parking space for each staff member.
                                          6. A client intake and waiting area shall be provided that is at least two
                                          hundred (200) square feet in size. A client intake and waiting area less
                                          than two hundred (200) square feet in size may be provided if it can be
                                          demonstrated that the size of the intake and waiting area is sufficient to
                                          accommodate the demand for the facility.
                                          7. Lighting shall be provided in accordance with the standards set in
                                          Sections 9-40.170 and 9-44.060(I) of the Development Code.
                                          8. An operational plan shall be provided prior to the issuance of
                                          a certificate of use and occupancy for review and approval by the
                                          Community Development Director. At minimum, the plan shall contain
                                          provisions addressing the following:
                                          a. Security and Safety. The plan shall include provision of on-site
                                          management, facility rules, and procedures for maintaining a safe
                                          environment within and outside the shelter.
                                          b. Management of Outdoor Areas. The plan shall describe procedures
                                          for admittance and discharge of clients, and describe measures aimed
                                          at minimizing the congregation of clients outside the shelter when not
                                          accepting clients.
                                          c. Staff Training. The plan shall describe the staffing required for the
                                          shelter and outline required training programs that provide staff with the
                                          knowledge and skills to assist clients in obtaining permanent shelter.
                                          d. Referral Service. The plan shall include provision of a kiosk providing
                                          information on other programs available to clients for obtaining
                                          permanent shelter, mental and health counseling, job placement,
                                          educational, legal, and other supportive services.
                                          Factors 1 and 2 define the overlay area, and parcels meeting these criteria
                                          are shown in Figure H-4a.
                                          A critical component of SB 2 is identifying the City’s need for an

emergency shelter. Many jurisdictions determine this by estimating
the homeless population using “point-in-time” counts of the number
of people using existing shelters within their jurisdiction on a given day
and time and averaging the data. Since Laguna Hills does not operate
its own shelter or currently have an operating private, faith-based or
non-profit shelter in the city to draw data from, the City has relied on
data provided by the County to estimate the homeless population in
Laguna Hills. Each year, the County conducts a point-in-time count
of the homeless population at its shelters and conducts a demographic
survey which includes a question about where the individual was living
prior to becoming homeless. The Laguna Hills 2008-2014 Housing
Element cites a 2008 survey, which showed that a total of 20 people
served by Orange County shelters reported living in Laguna Hills prior
to becoming homeless. The most recent survey available from 2011
indicates that this number has since dropped to eight. However, the
more conservative need of 20 persons was used as the basis for planning
for emergency shelters since the County’s point-in-time survey is taken
once per year and a need of 20 persons will better take into account
fluctuations in the homeless population throughout the year.
The standards for the MXU overlay area do not significantly constrain
the location of emergency shelters within the MXU district because
the overlay area contains approximately 55 acres of land and more
than a sufficient number of parcels to accommodate the City’s need for
emergency shelters.

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                          The MXU Zone contains primarily offices and businesses. No vacant
                                          land is available in this zone for construction of a new shelter. However,
                                          as identified in the City’s Land Use Element, the Mixed Use Zone
                                          contains underutilized parcels with one-story, tilt-up buildings. One-
                                          story tilt-up concrete buildings are very easy to convert to other uses,
                                          including emergency shelters and transitional housing. Additionally,
                                          larger and better designed buildings could be built, which would also
                                          provide opportunities for emergency shelters. This area is also served by
                                          transit and is located within an area providing significant employment
                                          resources.
                                          FARM WORKER HOUSING
                                          No land within the City of Laguna Hills is designated for agricultural use.
                                          The 2000 U.S. Census identified zero persons employed in farm, fishing,
                                          or forestry occupations. Therefore, Laguna Hills has no specific need for
                                          farm worker housing.

                                          Code declares that mentally and physically disabled persons are entitled
                                          to live in normal residential surroundings. The use of property for the
                                          care of six or fewer persons with disabilities is a residential use for the
                                          purposes of zoning. A state-authorized or certified family care home,
                                          foster home, or group home serving six or fewer persons with disabilities
                                          or dependent and neglected children on a 24-hour-a-day basis is
                                          considered a residential use that is permitted in all residential zones.
                                          As demonstrated in Table H-34 and discussions above, the City’s
                                          Zoning Ordinance complies with the Lanterman Act and permits small
                                          community care facilities (including adult and senior residential facilities,
                                          as well as small family homes) in all residential zones. Facilities for
                                          more than six persons are conditionally permitted in most the VC and
                                          MXU districts (Table H-34). Potential conditions for approval of a
                                          conditional use permit may include hours of operation, security, loading
                                          requirements, and management. Conditions would be similar to those
                                          for other similar uses in the same zones and would not serve to constrain
                                          the development of such facilities.
                                          Definition of Family: The City’s Zoning Ordinance defines “family”
                                          as a group of individuals not necessarily related by blood, marriage,

adoption, or guardianship living together in a dwelling unit as a single
housekeeping unit under a common housekeeping management plan
based on an intentionally structured relationship providing organization
and stability. This definition is not considered restrictive or constraining
to the development of housing for persons with disabilities.
Reasonable Accommodation: Under state and federal laws, local
governments are required to provide “reasonable accommodation” to
persons with disabilities when exercising planning and zoning powers.
The City has a formal policy for processing requests for reasonable
accommodation for persons with disabilities and special housing needs.
Development Fees and
Entitlements
Various types of development impact fees and entitlement fees to
cover the cost of processing permits to provide necessary services and
facilities may add substan¬tially to the cost of housing. These include
road assessments, park, and permit/development processing fees. The
City does not charge library development impact fees. Additionally,
an applicant pays water, storm drain, and sewer fees directly to the
provider(s). Development impact fees can be a constraint on housing
development and compromise market rate affordability because the
additional cost borne by developers contributes to overall increased
housing unit cost. However, the fees are necessary to maintain adequate
planning services and other public services and facilities in the City.
A typical new, single family unit that requires no discretionary review
from the City would only be required to pay the City public park in-lieu
fee of $7,392. An infill, 4-unit, multifamily residential development
project outside of the Urban Village area that required approval of a
Major Site Development Permit would cost approximately $8,392 per
unit ($4,000 site development permit deposit plus $7,392 per unit
for the public park in-lieu fee). In the Urban Village area, a recently
approved 489 unit multifamily residential project (with mixed use
commercial) will pay approximately $7,902 per unit in development and
entitlement fees (approximately $160 per unit in entitlement processing
fees, $7,392 per unit for the public park in-lieu fee, and approximately
$350 per unit for the urban village traffic impact fee).
The City’s fee schedule is provided in Table H-36. Table H-37 compares
various planning fees in surrounding jurisdictions with those in Laguna
Hills. Planning fees in Laguna Hills are in most cases consistent with
or lower than those in surrounding jurisdictions and, therefore, do not
present a constraint to development.

       The City of Mission Viejo uses the term planned development permit, which is generally comparable to a site development permit in
       Irvine, Lake Forest, and Laguna Niguel.
On- and Off-site
Improvement Requirements
The City adopted the County of Orange subdivision ordinance and
manual as the City’s subdivision ordinance upon incorporation on
December 20, 1991.
Commonly required on-site improvements for residential projects
include the following:
•	 Internal circulation system – public/private roads, drives, curbs,
     gutters, vehicle (including fire protection and emergency vehicle)
     turnarounds
•	 Water and wastewater disposal systems
                                                                                                                                                 H-65

                                          Commonly required off-site improvements for residential projects
                                          include the following:
                                          •	   Traffic signalization
                                          •	   Roadway improvements
                                          •	   Water and wastewater disposal systems
                                          •	   Schools (fee program)
                                          The City’s few vacant parcels are located in the Nellie Gail Ranch area,
                                          where there are likely to be very few site improvement requirements.
                                          Therefore, the costs of on-site and off-site improvements do not serve as
                                          constraints on development.
                                          The City’s street improvement requirement and/or dedication
                                          requirements are determined as part of the process for a tentative
                                          subdivision map and/or conditions of approval. Improvement and/or
                                          dedication requirements must be consistent with public streets in the
                                          area. The requirements are necessary to achieve the health and safety
                                          requirements of the City and are not considered a constraint to affordable
                                          housing development.
                                          Building Codes and
                                          Enforcement
                                          Building and safety codes are adopted to preserve public health and safety
                                          and ensure the construction of safe and decent housing. These codes
                                          and standards also have the potential to increase the cost of housing
                                          construction or maintenance.
                                          The City of Laguna Hills has adopted the 2010 California Building
                                          Code, which establishes construction standards for all residential
                                          buildings. The City amends the code as needed to further define
                                          requirements based on the unique local conditions. The code is designed
                                          to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of Laguna Hills’ residents.
                                          Code enforcement in the City is performed proactively and on a
                                          complaint basis.

Processing and Permit
Procedures
The City’s Zoning Ordinance defines requisite discretionary permits
and establishes requirements for submission of applications for the
discretionary permits. The City’s Community Development Department
prepares and maintains information and materials for each permit
required by the Zoning Ordinance. These materials include application
forms, questionnaires, and other information that addresses content of
applications, fee information, and general processing procedures and
requirements.
The City’s established processing and permit procedures are designed
to expedite project approvals to avoid unnecessary timing constraints
on development. For a typical project, Community Development
Department staff conduct an initial discussion with applicants/developers
and provide information about the subject property’s zoning, permitted
uses, development standards, approval authority (administrative or
discretionary), and required environmental documentation. During the
next step of the process, initial plan review, Planning Staff review the
project site plan and determine if the project complies with the Zoning
Code, development standards and design guidelines. Project applicants
then formally submit materials to the Community Development
Department, where Planning Staff has 30 days to determine the
completeness of the application. Once the application is deemed
complete, the next step, plan check, is initiated. Initial plan check takes
approximately 3 weeks. Plan check two, if necessary, takes 1–2 weeks,
while subsequent plan checks require approximately 1 week of processing
time.
Those discretionary permits pertaining most closely to provision of
housing affordable to low and moderate income and special needs
populations are general plan amendments, precise (specific) plans,
conditional use permits, site development permits and variances. The
permit, processing time, and approval bodies are described below. (Note
that the Planning Agency refers to the City Council serving in its dual
role as the planning commission, or hearing body for planning related
matters.)
•	   General Plan Amendments – A general plan amendment may be
     proposed to change general plan land use designations. A general
     plan amendment may require a processing time of 12 months
     or more, depending in part on the environmental determination
     accompanying the amendment processing. The City Council is the
                                                                                                                H-67

                                              approval body for both major and minor general plan amendments,
                                              while the Community Development Director approves minor,
                                              technical general plan amendments.
                                          •	  Precise (Specific) Plan – A precise (specific) plan is required for
                                              developments within the Mixed Use and Neighborhood Mixed Use
                                              districts whenever more than one variety of land use is proposed
                                              for a single property or a limited collection of abutting properties.
                                              Processing time is approximately 6 to 12 months or more, depending
                                              in part on the environmental determination. The City Council
                                              approves specific plans and amendments to specific plans.
                                          •	  Conditional Use Permit – A conditional use permit is used to
                                              evaluate uses that may have a moderate to high potential for adverse
                                              impact to adjacent or abutting uses or the surrounding community
                                              due to operating characteristics. Processing time is approximately 3
                                              to 4 months. Conditional use permits are approved by the Planning
                                              Agency.
                                          •	  Site Development Permit – A site development permit is used to
                                              evaluate site planning and design considerations and is the lowest
                                              level planning permit for development projects. A site development
                                              permit is required for most development projects, is issued in absence
                                              of any other specified permit or approval, and may be required in
                                              addition to other approvals. A minor site development permit takes
                                              4 to 6 weeks to review. A major site development permit takes 2 to
                                              3 months to review and requires that a noticed public hearing be
                                              held prior to a decision on the application by the Planning Agency.
                                              The notice must be published/ provided at least 10 days prior to the
                                              public hearing. Minor site development permits are approved by the
                                              Community Development Director, while major site development
                                              permits are approved by the Planning Agency.
                                          The Community Development Director has the authority to review and
                                          approve all site development permits meeting the following criteria:
                                          •	  Developments of nonresidential uses and or buildings not exceeding
                                              twenty thousand (20,000 square feet whether in one or more
                                              structures on a single parcel;
                                          •	  Four or fewer residential structures or dwellings in a single project;
                                          •	  Temporary uses not involving use or public facilities or rights-of-way;
                                          •	  Master sign programs for properties containing less than five
                                              nonresidential units;
                                          •	  Change plans, or minor changes to any plan or permit previously
                                              approved provided such change does not exceed ten percent of the
                                              gross square footage of the original project;
                                          •	  Site development permits for retaining walls that are greater than
                                              thirty (30) inches in height.

The Planning Agency has jurisdiction and review authority over all site
development permits exceeding the criteria specified above. Additional-
ly, the Community Development Director may forward any project over
which he or she has authority or which he or she shall deem of sufficient
interest on a broader land use policy scale to the Agency for their con-
sideration. The Community Development Director reviews and makes
recommendations regarding all site development permits forwarded to
the Agency and insures all environmental and notice requirements are
met.
Prior to issuing a site development permit, the Community Develop-
ment Director or Planning Agency shall make the following findings:
•	    That the site design complies with standards of the development
      code;
•	    That the site is suitable for the proposed development;
•	    That the project is consistent with the general plan and applicable
      design guidelines; and
•	    That the site design and structural components are appropriate for
      the site and function of the proposed uses.
The findings relate back to whether or not the site is suitable for develop-
ment and is limited to physical development of the site. Since the SDP
process relies exclusively on the Development Code for determining
whether or not the project complies with the Development Code, it also
incorporates Chapter 9-72 of the Development Code which identifies
housing development incentives available to a developer who may be
seeking to develop affordable housing. These incentives are completely
consistent with state law.
•	    Variance – A variance may be granted from any development
      standard or criteria affecting establishment of a use in a zoning
      district but may not be granted to approve a use which would
      otherwise be prohibited by a zoning district. A variance takes
      approximately 3 weeks to 3 months to review. The Planning Agency
      is the approval body for variances.
SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT
For residential projects, a major site development permit that is
approved by the Planning Agency is required as follows:
•	    Estate Residential district – manufactured housing
•	    Low Density Residential district – manufactured housing
•	    Medium-Low Density Residential district – manufactured housing
                                                                                                                 H-69

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                               and multifamily dwellings
                                          •	   Medium Density Residential district – manufactured housing and
                                               multifamily dwellings
                                          •	   High Density Residential district – manufactured housing,
                                               multifamily dwellings, and single-family attached dwellings
                                          The City has previously eliminated the conditional use permit process for
                                          the residential projects discussed above. Instead, the City uses the site
                                          development permit process to assess site planning and design issues.
                                          DISCRETIONARY PERMIT(S) PROCESSING
                                          TIMES
                                          Laguna Hills does not have a separate Planning Commission (the City
                                          Council acts as its own Planning Agency) so the processing of all projects
                                          is more streamlined than in other municipalities. Permit processing times
                                          differ for various discretionary permits in the City. Typically in Laguna
                                          Hills, a project receives a final decision within 2 to 3 months of having
                                          submitted a complete application. Projects requiring an EIR generally
                                          take 6 to 9 months.
                                          A general plan amendment may take 12 or more months to process
                                          should an environmental impact report be required. A precise plan
                                          (specific plan) may take between 6 to 12 months to process, depending
                                          on the required and appropriate environmental documentation.
                                          The precise plan is required for developments with more than one
                                          proposed land use for a single property or for a limited collection
                                          of abutting properties. The processing time for a conditional use
                                          permit is approximately 2 to 3 months, unless detailed environmental
                                          documentation is required that would lengthen the processing time. This
                                          permit evaluates uses that may adversely impact adjacent or abutting
                                          uses or the surrounding community due to operating characteristics
                                          of the proposed use. A major or discretionary (Planning Agency)
                                          site development permit takes 2 to 3 months to process in the City.
                                          This permit type is required for some residential (and nonresidential)
                                          development projects and is issued in absence of another specified permit
                                          or approval. A site development permit may be required in addition
                                          to other discretionary or ministerial permits. A discretionary variance
                                          application takes 2 to 3 months to process. The Planning Agency may
                                          grant a variance from any development standard or criteria affecting the
                                          establishment of a use in a zoning district, but may not be granted to
                                          approve a use that would otherwise be prohibited by a zoning district.
                                          As indicated above, the processing time for various land use actions
                                          within the City depends on the type of development or action requested
                                          and whether environmental documentation is required and the scope of

                                                                               CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
that environmental documentation. Each development project does not
necessarily require multiple discretionary actions (i.e., small scale projects
consistent with general plan and zoning designations do not generally
require general plan amendments, rezones, or variances).
The City does not have a backlog of development applications and is
able to process applications in a timely manner. As already indicated,
the City has very little vacant land available for development.
Remaining parcels are designated as estate residential within the Nellie
Gail Ranch area of the City. According to the City’s Building Division,
the majority of single-family residential development applications
involve redevelopment/demolition of existing single-family homes and
construction of much larger single-family homes. The City will continue
to pursue the extension of affordability controls for 51 units, either in
the existing Rancho Moulton housing development or as part of new
or redevelopment activities in the Via Lomas area or other areas of the
City. The City will annually prepare a “Risk of Assessment” report
provided by the California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC).
Projects determined high risk are those most likely to decline continued
federal assistance because they currently have rents below market rate(s)
and are owned by profit-motivated entities. Should a notice of intent
to convert to market rate be filed, the City will work with potential
purchasers to preserve 51 units in the existing development or in new
development by finding an interested non-profit entity and securing
funding to acquire and preserve the property. The City will use HCD
resources listed on the HCD website, as well as other resources, to locate
potential funding sources as needed for the preservation of affordable
housing. The City will work with tenants of at-risk units and provide
them with education regarding tenant rights, notification procedures,
and conversion procedures. The City will also provide tenants in at-
risk projects information from the Orange County Housing Authority
regarding Section 8 rental assistance.
Processing Times for New Housing
As indicated in the Housing Resources section, underutilized land in
Laguna Hills will be used to meet the City’s Regional Housing Need
Assessment requirements. The underutilized areas include the Urban
Village Specific Plan area and the Alicia Gateway. Within the UVSP
area, high density, multiple family housing or single family attached
housing can be constructed. Both multiple family and single family
attached projects in the Urban Village area are permitted uses, subject

required for five or more residential units. A minor site development

                                          likely involve more than five units; hence, a major site development
                                          permit would be required. A major site development permit would
                                          require 2 to 3 months for approval by the Planning Agency; 3 to 4
                                          months if a negative declaration prepared; and, 6 to 9 months if an
                                          EIR is required. A minor site development permit would require 1 to 2
                                          months for approval because limited environmental review is required
                                          and the Community Development Department Director is the approval
                                          authority.
                                          Within the Alicia Gateway area, the existing Mixed Use Zone requires
                                          a conditional use permit for multiple-family housing and a site
                                          development permit for single-family attached housing. The processing
                                          time is typically the same for a major site development permit and a
                                          conditional use permit.
                                          The City’s processing and permit procedures do not appear to unduly
                                          constrain the development of housing. Nevertheless, the City will
                                          continue to monitor its development review procedures to ensure a
                                          streamlined processing procedure. Section 9-92 of the City’s Zoning
                                          Ordinance details the specific application process and submittal
                                          requirements for various land use actions in the City.
                                          Measure M
                                          In November 1990, Orange County voters approved the Revised Traffic
                                          Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance (Measure M).
                                          Measure M implemented a half-cent local transportation sales tax to
                                          fund transportation improvements. The Measure M sales tax includes
                                          an apportionment to local jurisdictions for street maintenance and
                                          improvements. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA)
                                          is the agency responsible for administering proceeds of the Measure M
                                          sales tax.
                                          On November 7, 2006, Orange County voters approved the renewal of
                                          Measure M, for an additional 30 years beginning in 2011 until 2041.
                                          Renewed Measure M is expected to raise $11.8 billion to improve
                                          Orange County’s transportation system.
                                          Every year, OCTA determines if a local jurisdiction is eligible to
                                          receive Measure M turnback funds. Prior to the renewal of Measure
                                          M, the City received approximately $500,000 per year in turnback
                                          funds. Under the Measure M Renewal, the City anticipates receiving
                                          an increased allocation of $750,000 per year beginning in 2011. In
                                          addition, the Measure M renewal will enable the City to compete for
                                          discretionary Measure M funding, for which the City has historically
                                          been very successful. To date, the City of Laguna Hills has received
                                          approximately $11.4 million from Measure M funds to improve its

transportation. Among the several requirements a local jurisdiction
must satisfy to receive turnback funds, they must be in compliance with
the requirements of a Countywide Growth Management Program. Each
local jurisdiction is required to produce a Growth Management Element
as part of its participation in the Countywide Growth Management
Program. The Growth Management Element must contain eight
elements. Three of these elements relate directly to the Laguna Hills
Housing Element: a development phasing program; a development
mitigation program; and a program addressing balanced housing
options and employment opportunities within the City. The Laguna
Hills General Plan Growth Management Element has as its goal to
reduce traffic congestion, mitigate traffic impacts of new development
by requiring new development to pay its fair share toward local and
regional roadway/transportation improvements, and tie timing of
new development to availability of facilities needed to support that
development.
The City of Laguna Hills has based its approach to the Measure M
requirement for adoption of a Growth Management Element on the
Model Growth Management Element developed jointly by the County
of Orange and the Orange County Division of the League of California
Cities. The Growth Management Element of the Laguna Hills General
Plan encompasses all required policy provisions necessary to comply
with Measure M. The City Growth Management Element contains an
implementation plan to ensure that required programs (Development
Mitigation Program; Development Phasing Program; Annual
Monitoring Program) in the Growth Management Element are applied
consistently to the City development review process.
Implementation of the City of Laguna Hills Growth Management
Element – Growth Management Program will result in a more equitable
balance between housing opportunities and employment opportunities
within the City, which will allow residents to live closer to their jobs
and thereby reduce commuting distance and times. A complementary
commitment of development mitigation, development phasing, and
performance monitoring is necessary to achieve a coordinated land use
development and transportation infrastructure. The City of Laguna
Hills will ensure that the actions described below will be applied to
applicable development projects and a citywide assessment of land use
development/transportation infrastructure capacity will be conducted in
conjunction with fee program implementation and capital improvement
program development.
Development Mitigation Program – To compensate the public for any
increased burden on public services attributed to new development,
jurisdictions have the authority to impose reasonable fees or required
                                                                                                             H-73

                                          Hills have imposed development fees on development transportation
                                          improvements within the City. The City of Laguna Hills Development
                                          Mitigation Program requires that development proposals be reviewed
                                          so new development may pay its share of costs associated with that
                                          development on existing and planned transportation facilities.
                                          Development Phasing Program – The City of Laguna Hills will review
                                          traffic levels of service on City arterials, contrast operating levels of
                                          service with General Plan performance standards, and program necessary
                                          improvements in conjunction with the annual development of its
                                          Capital Improvement Program. This information will be shared with
                                          participating jurisdictions in applicable Growth Management Area

                                          The City of Laguna Hills will also maintain adopted traffic performance
                                          standards by outlining and coordinating necessary transportation
                                          improvements, including a 7-Year Capital Improvements Program,
                                          and Traffic Improvement/Public Facilities Development Agreements
                                          consistent with the Growth Management Element, and its implementing
                                          ordinances, plans, and programs. In addition, the City is an
                                          active participant in interjurisdictional forums for Orange County
                                          jurisdictions that address area-wide transportation improvement
                                          projects. Furthermore, the City of Laguna Hills endorses alternative
                                          transportation modes and strategies to reduce vehicular trips and has
                                          adopted programs to reduce trip generation, including a Transportation
                                          Demand Management Ordinance to assist in reducing trips to and from
                                          employment.
                                          The goals and implementation programs described above enable the
                                          City of Laguna Hills to attain the most equitable balance possible
                                          between housing opportunities and employment opportunities within
                                          the City. This balance is maintained further by planning and housing
                                          opportunities affordable to low income and moderate income families
                                          within the Urban Village Specific Plan area of Laguna Hills because this
                                          additional housing opportunity is located close to a collection of land
                                          uses (existing and planned) that are employment intensive. The urban
                                          village context represents land uses within the area designated on the

To mitigate the impacts of government policies, rules, and regulations on
the development and improvement of housing, the City offers a number
of regulatory concessions and incentives to help offset the costs.
In 2005, the City amended its Zoning Ordinance to define specific
housing development incentives, to implement General Plan Housing
Element objectives, including incentives for the production of housing
for very low to moderate income, and senior citizens in accordance with
state density bonus law under Section 65915 of the Government Code.
Chapter 9-72 of the City’s Zoning Ordinance enumerates the housing
development incentives approved by the City.
The City offers a density bonus and/or concessions or incentives for:
(1) at least 10 percent of the total units of a housing development are
affordable to lower income households; (2) at least 5 percent of the
total units of a housing development are affordable to very low income
households; (3) senior citizen housing developments; and (4) at least
10 percent of the total units in a condominium project or in a planned
development are affordable to moderate income households.
The City also offers a density bonus for condo conversions, where 33
percent of the total units of the proposed condominium project are
affordable to low or moderate income households, or 15 percent of the
total units are affordable to low income households.
The City also provides opportunities to develop housing in certain
nonresidential districts of the City, which includes boarding homes,
community care facilities, emergency shelters, single room occupancy
housing facilities, and mobile home parks. Chapter 9-72.030(C) of the
Zoning Ordinance details the requirements and location of housing in
nonresidential districts throughout the City.
Fiscal incentives available to developers of affordable housing include
waiver or reduction in fees, low interest loans or subsidies, and financial
or mortgage assistance for acquisition of property.
Procedural incentives available to developers of affordable housing
include consolidation of applications for consideration at one hearing,
fast tracking of all housing development projects, and priority processing
and scheduling for review of housing projects.
Market Constraints
Locally and regionally there are several constraints that hinder the
ability to accommodate affordable housing demand in Laguna Hills.
The high cost of land, rising development costs, and neighborhood
                                                                                                                H-75

                                                             These constraints may result in housing that is not affordable to low and
                                                             moderate income households or may render residential construction
                                                             economically infeasible for developers.
                                                             LAND COSTS
                                                             The cost of land is another major impediment to production of affordable
                                                             housing. Land costs are influenced by many variables, including scarcity
                                                             and developable density, location, unique features, and the availability
                                                             of public utilities. The cost of land in Laguna Hills reflects its proximity
                                                             to major employment centers and the rapid appreciation of land cost
                                                             throughout Southern California in the past decade. Besides the few
                                                             vacant remaining parcels within the Nellie Gail Ranch section of the

                                                             within the City.
                                                             CONSTRUCTION AND LABOR COSTS
                                                             The cost of construction is dependent primarily on the cost of labor and
                                                             materials. Construction factors such as type of construction, custom
                                                             versus tract development, materials, site conditions, finishing details,
                                                             amenities, square footage, and structural configuration can increase the
                                                             cost of housing. Table H-38 summarizes the estimated construction costs
                                                             based on type of development in the City of Laguna Hills.
                                                             Future costs are difficult to predict given the cyclical fluctuations in
                                                             demand and supply that in large part are created by fluctuations in the
                                                             state and national economies. Such fluctuations do not usually result in
                                                             favoring development in one geographic area over another and, therefore,

FINANCING
Construction Financing
Prior to the recession of the early 1990s, and significant changes in
lending practices following the savings and loan scandal of the late
1980s, developers could receive loans for 100 percent or more of a
project’s estimated future value. Now, construction and permanent
loans are almost never available for over 75 percent of the future project
value for multifamily developments. This means that developers must
usually supply at least 25 percent of the project value.
The financing of a residential project, particularly affordable housing, is
quite complex. No firm threshold determines an acceptable “return” on
investment or the maximum equity contribution at which an otherwise
feasible project becomes infeasible. Upfront cash commitment may not
be problematic for some developers as long as the project can generate
an acceptable net cash flow to meet the acceptable returns. Although
financing costs impact project feasibility, these problems are generally
equal across jurisdictions and thus are not a unique constraint to
housing production in Laguna Hills.
Mortgage Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase a home
or to perform necessary maintenance and repairs. The availability of
financing can also serve as a constraint to housing production. Many
communities have experienced a pattern where households looking
to purchase a home have had more difficulty in obtaining financing
in lower income neighborhoods. The Community Reinvestment
Act was passed in an effort to address this issue. In tandem with the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lenders must now disclose
information on the disposition of home loan applications by the income,
gender, and race/ethnicity of the applicants.
The Federal Financial Institutions Council (FFIEC) compiles HMDA
data according to the income characteristics of the census tracts where
the dwelling units are located, based on the following FFIEC definitions.
Income limits are determined based upon the MFI for the relevant
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Low to moderate income tracts
have a MFI below 80 percent of the MFI for the MSA. Middle income
tracts have a median family income from 80 to 120 percent of the MFI
for the MSA. Finally, upper income tract have a MFI above 120 percent
of the MFI for the MSA.

Loans with low initial payments often had provisions for substantial
payment increases after several years (usually between 1 and 3 years).
These loan products enticed many investors into the single-family market
in the Orange County region, including Laguna Hills. The increasing
availability of these loan products also allowed homebuilders to qualify
many more households for home purchase and provided more business
opportunities for virtually every profession linked to the homebuilding
and residential real estate markets (mortgage brokers, real estate agents,
title companies, etc.).
Rapidly rising housing prices since the late 1990s provided homebuyers
and investors a sense of security that, even if loan payments adjusted
upward significantly after an initial period, the growth in home equity
would allow the borrower to either refinance or resell the home and
thus avoid financial difficulties. The ability to “grow” one’s way out of
potential financial trouble with equity growth changed dramatically after
2005, when home prices began to level off and then decline in many
parts of the Orange County region for both new and existing homes.
Many borrowers who purchased homes in the past 2 years, particularly
those with subprime loans, found that they owed more on their homes
than their homes were worth. The changing mortgage market also
affected borrowers without subprime loans in more expensive housing
markets in California. In these more expensive markets (such as Laguna
Hills), borrowers have to qualify for “jumbo” loans—relatively large
loans that are not federally backed. A jumbo mortgage is a loan amount
above conventional conforming loan limits set by Fannie Mae (FNMA)
and Freddie Mac (FHLMC), federally chartered financial institutions
that purchase the bulk of residential mortgages in the United States.
Individuals who, 2 or 3 years ago, could qualify to purchase high-priced
homes with jumbo loans have found it increasingly difficult to find
willing lenders. They set a limit on the maximum dollar value of any
mortgage they will purchase from an individual lender.
The confluence of flattening or declining home prices and the growing
number of subprime and alternative loans resulted in a spike in defaults
on home loans beginning in 2007. The number of defaults continued
rising through 2008 and began to decline after the volume of troubled
subprime and alternative mortgages funded between 2004 and 2006
resolved (either through refinancing, the sale of homes with troubled
mortgages, or foreclosures). In 2011, almost forty percent of home sales
were distressed sales in Laguna Hills. In January of 2013, the percentage
of distressed sales made up less than ten percent of total sales in Laguna
Hills.
The American Community Survey estimates that between 2009-2011,
                                                                                                               H-79

                                          approximately 50 percent of Orange County homeowners spent more
                                          than 30 percent of their gross income on housing. The high percentage
                                          of homeowners spending a disproportionate percentage of income on
                                          housing combined with a large number of troubled subprime loans
                                          suggest that homebuyers in the Orange County region will continue to
                                          face near-term challenges in making mortgage payments.
                                          Environmental Constraints
                                          Laguna Hills is impacted by various environmental hazards that include
                                          steep slopes/hillsides, flooding, and earthquakes.
                                          Hillsides: The City has special development regulations that apply to
                                          all property within the City having a slope gradient, whether natural or
                                          manufactured, of 15 percent or greater.
                                          Flooding: Portions of the City’s Open Space – 2 Drainage Facilities
                                          District may be located in the flood plain overlay zone established by the
                                          Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) maps. The
                                          City does not allow any permanent building or structure development to
                                          occur within a floodplain except those that meet FEMA standards and
                                          criteria.
                                          Earthquakes: There are no active or potentially active faults known
                                          within the City of Laguna Hills. However, the active Newport
                                          Inglewood Fault Zone is 3 miles southwest of the City.
                                          Development in areas with known hazards must ensure that adequate
                                          precaution and mitigation are afforded to protect public health and
                                          safety. No vacant, developable land and no infill development is
                                          planned in the City that is located in proximity to areas subject to
                                          flooding or in areas subject to special hillside development regulations.
                                          Potential infill or redevelopment sites within the City are located in
                                          areas that are generally level. Infill and/or redevelopment activities
                                          within Laguna Hills would be subject to seismic activity, as is all of

                                          Another factor adding to the cost of new home construction is the cost
                                          of providing adequate infrastructure, such as streets, curbs, gutters,
                                          sidewalks, water and sewer lines, and street lighting. The cost of these
                                          additions or improvements is borne by developers and then, to the extent
                                          possible, added to the cost of new housing units, impacting affordability.

As redevelopment or infill development occurs within the City,
infrastructure may need to be upgraded to accommodate intensification
which could present a constraint to development.
Housing Resources
State housing element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodate
a share of the region’s projected housing needs for the planning period.
This share, called the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, is important
because state law mandates that jurisdictions provide sufficient land
to accommodate a variety of housing opportunities for all economic
segments of the community. Compliance with this requirement is
measured by the jurisdiction’s ability to provide adequate land to
accommodate the RHNA. This section summarizes the resources
available for the development of housing in Laguna Hills. The analysis
includes an evaluation of the adequacy of the City’s land inventory to
accommodate Laguna Hills’ regional housing needs goals for the 2013-
2021 planning period. This section also analyzes the financial resources
available to support housing activities and the administrative resources
available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs. Finally,
this section documents the City’s accomplishments during the 2008-
2014, Housing Element planning period.
Available Sites for Housing
State law requires communities to play an active role in ensuring that
enough housing is available to meet expected population growth in the
Southern California region. Approximately every 8 years, the SCAG is
authorized to set forth specific goals for the amount of new housing that
should be planned in each jurisdiction over a specified time period, in
this case 2013-2021. This section discusses how Laguna Hills will plan
for the provision of housing for all economic segments by 2021.
FUTURE HOUSING NEED
For the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle, HCD projected a need
for 412,137 new housing units in a six-county Southern California
region (encompassing the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside,
San Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial). The SCAG is responsible for
allocating this future housing need to the 193 jurisdictions within the
region. In this capacity, SCAG developed a Regional Housing Needs
Assessment that determines each jurisdiction’s share of the forecasted
growth. Laguna Hills’ share of the regional housing need for the
period 2013-2021 is allocated by SCAG based on a number of factors,
                                                                                                              H-81

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                          including recent growth trends, income distribution, and capacity for
                                          future growth.
                                          The RHNA is divided into the four income groups established by HCD.
                                          Pursuant to state housing element law, a jurisdiction must demonstrate
                                          in its housing element that it has adequate residential sites at appropriate
                                          densities and development standards to accommodate its RHNA.
                                          According to the RHNA, Laguna Hills has a RHNA of two additional
                                          units. This need for new housing is divided into two income categories as
                                          follows:
                                          •	   Extremely low income (0-30 percent MFI) - one unit
                                          •	   Low income (51 to 80 percent MFI) – one unit
                                          CREDITS TOWARD THE RHNA
                                          The City has no units that can be credited toward the RHNA.
                                          RESIDENTIAL SITES INVENTORY
                                          An important component of the Laguna Hills Housing Element is the
                                          identification of sites for future housing development and evaluation of
                                          the adequacy of this site inventory in accommodating the City’s share of
                                          regional housing growth.
                                          Vacant Land
                                          Because of the built out nature of Laguna Hills, the supply of vacant
                                          land suitable for residential development is very limited. A GIS and
                                          building permit analysis of land resources identified six vacant parcels
                                          located in the Nellie Gail Ranch area of the City. Each of the vacant sites
                                          has public infrastructure to accommodate development and is currently
                                          zoned for residential development. The capacity of each site was based
                                          on established land use controls and development standards. Figure
                                          H-5 depicts the location of available, vacant land suitable for residential
                                          development in the City.
                                          Table H-41 quantifies the number and type of housing units that could
                                          be accommodated on the City’s vacant residential land.
                                          Underutilized Land
                                          Local governments with limited vacant land resources may rely on
                                          nonvacant and underutilized residential sites to accommodate their
                                          respective portion of the regional housing need. For the Housing

Urban Village Specific Plan
The Urban Village Specific Plan (UVSP), adopted in November 2002, is
a 240-acre area bounded by Paseo de Valencia on the north and west, Los
Alisos Boulevard on the south, and Interstate 5 on the east.
The UVSP provides for a continuing mixture of land uses, including
retail, residential hotel, medical offices, and general offices. The UVSP
allows residential development at high density development only, up to
50 dwelling units per acre. The UVSP area is designated in the City’s
General Plan and Zoning Ordinance as Village Commercial. All new
development within the Village Commercial district is subject to the
UVSP.
Existing Use. Existing uses include a mix of retail, office, financial,
medical, residential, and transportation uses. The area currently
consists of approximately 527,000 sq. ft. medical center, approximately
633,000 sq. ft. of office space and 1,124,000 sq. ft. of retail space. The
employment base within the UVSP area contains approximately 5,000
workers. The existing 756 residential uses in the UVSP area include
the Prado apartment complex (360 units) and the Villa Valencia senior
citizen development (396 units).
The size of the UVSP area allows residential development and adjacent
                                                                                                                                         H-83

                                          uses will not impede residential development.
                                          Proposed Use. The purpose of the UVSP area is to develop an urban
                                          core in which a variety of public, regional commercial, recreational,
                                          and high density residential uses work in concert to create an urban
                                          village. The UVSP area allows residential development at high density
                                          development only, at a maximum of 50 dwelling units per acre. This is in
                                          addition to the existing 756 units within the UVSP area, none of which
                                          will be removed as development/redevelopment occurs within this area.
                                          The City amended the UVSP in 2011 to establish a minimum residential
                                          development density of 30 dwelling units per acre in the UVSP area. No
                                          pre-established limit of residential units previously existed in the UVSP.
                                          The allowed development intensity in the UVSP area is regulated
                                          based on trip generation limits to ensure that the City’s General Plan
                                          Circulation Element Level of Service Standard D is not exceeded at
                                          any of the intersections within the area. A traffic study analyzed “trip
                                          budgets” available to accommodate new development within the UVSP
                                          area. At present, the remaining trip budget from the Urban Village area
                                          is 1,049 AM peak hour trips and 2,228 PM peak hour trips. Prior to
                                          redevelopment or new development, project proponents must provide
                                          an analysis that indicates that the proposed project does not exceed the
                                          remaining trip budgets allowed in the UVSP area.
                                          The City has taken steps toward attracting residential development to
                                          the UVSP area. The City has worked with real estate and development
                                          interests to develop residential mixed use in the UVSP area. Over the
                                          past eight years, the City has held numerous meetings with property
                                          owners and residential builders to promote new residential development
                                          in the UVSP area.
                                          In 2012, the City worked with the Fritz Duda Company (owner of the
                                          Oakbrook Village Shopping Center) for almost a year to approve plans
                                          for a two-phased, redevelopment project of a portion of the Oakbrook
                                          Village Shopping Center. The mixed-use, redevelopment project includes
                                          the development of up to 489 residential units (289 in Phase One and
                                          up to 200 in Phase Two) in multi-story residential buildings and up to
                                          82,574 square feet of retail space (23,974 in Phase One and 58,600 in
                                          Phase Two).
                                          The City continues to engage residential builders about development
                                          opportunities that exist in the UVSP area, and other locations in the
                                          community.

                                          new facilities will be required. The recent update to the El Toro Water
                                          District’s Water and Sewer Master Plan accounted for the potential water
                                          and sewer needs within the Urban Village Specific Plan. The District has
                                          adequate water supply and sewage treatment capacity to accommodate
                                          the development as proposed. Specific improvements to the water

                                          time development occurs. The cost of any improvements necessary to
                                          provide water or sewer service to the development would be borne by the

                                          Recent Development Trends. Several redevelopment projects have
                                          occurred in Laguna Hills during the past several years. The old Circuit
                                          City site at Avenida de la Carlota and El Toro has been redeveloped to
                                          add an additional 5,949 square feet of retail space that now serves as the
                                          new home to Ashley Furniture, Total Wine and More, and Chick-Fil-A.
                                          The Taj Mahal Office Complex was renovated to include expanding the
                                          complex by 6,100 square feet to provide medical office space. In April
                                          2012, the City approved plans for the redevelopment of the Moulton
                                          Las Paz Shopping Center to include the addition of 29,098 square feet
                                          of general commercial space. The Center will be anchored by The Fresh
                                          Market, the chain’s first store in Southern California and the second in
                                          the State.
                                          Market Conditions. Although the housing market in southern
                                          California has softened, home prices in Laguna Hills remain high. The
                                          median home price for single-family homes during the period January 1,
                                          2012, to January 1, 2013, was $580,000, while the median home price
                                          for condominiums was $225,000. The City continues to experience
                                          high land and construction costs. Furthermore, as already noted, besides
                                          the vacant Estate Residential parcels within the Nellie Gail Ranch
                                          area, Laguna Hills contains no vacant residential land for new housing
                                          development. Therefore, conditions for redevelopment and reuse are
                                          favorable in Laguna Hills.

                                          and Zoning Ordinance designate the site as Neighborhood Mixed Use.
                                          The site contains approximately 439,263 square feet of commerical
                                          development. No residential development is located within the current
                                          boundaries of Alicia Gateway. The area is generally surrounded by single-
                                          family homes on the east, south, and west.
                                          Existing Use. Existing land uses consist of a variety of commercial and
                                          office uses, including retail sites, restaurants, local services, fast food
                                          establishments, medical offices, and two gas stations. Additionally, the
                                          site contains a business park, a used car lot, and a public storage facility.
                                          The southeast portion of Alicia Gateway contains a parcel of
                                          approximately 5.1 acres, containing approximately 20,777 sq. ft. of
                                          improvements supporting a used car lot and car repair services. The
                                          property owner of this site has engaged in extensive discussions with
                                          the City to discontinue the current use of automobile sales and services.
                                          Discontinuation of the present use is expected within the Housing
                                          Element planning period and redevelopment is anticipated to occur.
                                          Environmental constraints may be present on this site due to the current
                                          use.

CITY OF LAGUNA HILLS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING
                                          Proposed Use. The City’s General Plan designates the entire Alicia
                                          Gateway as neighborhood mixed use. The neighborhood mixed use
                                          designation will create a moderate density center and gathering place.
                                          This designation will promote a mix of retail, housing, and office uses;
                                          walkable connections, plazas and green space for community gathering;
                                          high quality design and architecture; orientation of buildings toward the
                                          street and pedestrians; and accessibility to transit. The neighborhood
                                          mixed use designation promotes the development of vertical and
                                          horizontal mixed use. Allowed uses include commercial, retail, office,
                                          and residential. Standalone residential is prohibited. The maximum
                                          height is three stories, and the expected housing density range is between
                                          10 and 20 dwelling units per acre with a maximum of 110 dwelling
                                          units on this site.
                                          A preliminary traffic review of Alicia Gateway indicated that the mixture
                                          of uses proposed under the neighborhood mixed use designation
                                          (including 110 dwelling units) actually results in a slight decrease in
                                          traffic currently being generated. As a result, daily trip generation would
                                          not be expected to cause any adverse impacts to surrounding traffic
                                          operations.
                                          Figure H-7 depicts the parcels and acreage within the Alicia Gateway
                                          area.
                                          Infrastructure Availability. Infrastructure and public services are
                                          readily available within Alicia Gateway. Water and sewer service is
                                          provided by MNWD. MNWD has adequate wastewater treatment
                                          capacity and sufficient potable water capacity to serve the development
                                          of the area with a mixture of commercial and residential uses. However,
                                          some replacement of the transmission systems may be required to meet
                                          MNWD standards. It is expected that any proposed redevelopment
                                          would require an assessment of the adequacy of water and sewer services
                                          to determine if upgrades to existing facilities or construction of new
                                          facilities would be required.
                                          Recent Development Trends. Several redevelopment projects have
                                          occurred in Laguna Hills during the past several years. The old Circuit
                                          City site at Avenida de la Carlota and El Toro has been redeveloped to
                                          add an additional 5,949 square feet of retail space that now serves as the
                                          new home to Ashley Furniture, Total Wine and More, and Chick-Fil-A.
                                          The Taj Mahal Office Complex was renovated to include expanding the
                                          complex by 6,100 square feet to provide medical office space. In April
                                          2012, the City approved plans for the redevelopment of the Moulton
                                          Las Paz Shopping Center to include the addition of 29,098 square feet
                                          of general commercial space. The Center will be anchored by The Fresh
H-90

the State.
Market Conditions. As noted previously, although the housing market
in southern California has softened, home prices in Laguna Hills remain
high, as do land and construction costs. Additionally, besides the vacant
Estate Residential parcels within the Nellie Gail Ranch area, Laguna Hills
contains no vacant residential land for new housing development. The
neighborhood mixed use land use designation may stimulate interest in
residential development of this area by allowing mixed use residential
development by right. Therefore, conditions for redevelopment and reuse
are favorable in Laguna Hills.
Concessions and Incentives. The Regulatory Concessions and Incentives
section of this Housing Element (see Constraints on Housing Production
section) describes the numerous regulatory concessions and incentives
available to developers of affordable housing in Laguna Hills. These
concessions and incentives include density bonuses, opportunities
to develop housing in certain nonresidential districts of the City,
fiscal incentives, and procedural incentives. Refer to the Regulatory
Concessions and Incentives section for a detailed discussion.

Table H-41a summarizes the inventory of commercial underutilized sites
in Laguna Hills.
COMPARISON OF SITES INVENTORY AND
RHNA
Properties identified in the sites inventory have the combined capacity
to accommodate sufficient housing units on vacant and underutilized
properties in Laguna Hills (Table H-42) and meet the remaining
RHNA for the 2013-2021 planning period. The UVSP was amended
to accommodate residential development at a minimum of 30 dwelling
units per acre to its current maximum of 50 dwelling units per acre. The
UVSP will continue to allow residential development “by right.” The
UVSP site provides opportunities at a density suitable to accommodate
the development of lower income housing in Laguna Hills.

The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program is
administered by HUD. Through this program, the federal government
provides monies to cities to undertake certain kinds of community
development and housing activities.
Activities proposed by the City must meet the objectives and eligibility
criteria of CDBG legislation. The primary CDBG objective is the
development of viable urban communities, including decent housing
and a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunity,
principally for persons of low and moderate income. Each activity must
meet one of the three broad national objectives:
•	    Benefit low and moderate income families
•	    Aid in the prevention of elimination of slums or blight
•	    Meet other community development needs having a particular
      urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate
      threat to the health or welfare of the community
Over the past 8 years, the City has been awarded CDBG funds totaling
approximately $2.1 million. These funds were used to renovate over
136 housing units in the 248-unit Aliso Meadows Condominium
Development, which primarily houses low income households, although
is not deed restricted as such.
SECTION 8 HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER
PROGRAM
The Housing Choice (Section 8) voucher program (HCVP) is the federal
government’s major program for assisting very low income families,
seniors, and the disabled to rent decent, safe, and sanitary housing in
the private market. Since the rental assistance is provided on behalf of
the family or individual, participants are able to find and lease privately
owned housing, including single-family homes, townhouses, and
apartments from landlords who accept vouchers.
The Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA) coordinates and
administers Section 8 rental assistance on behalf of the City of Laguna
Hills. According to OCHA, approximately 19 households are receiving
Section 8 assistance in Laguna Hills.
Like many other urban areas, the demand for rental assistance in
Orange County is very high. For the first time in more than 4 years,
OCHA opened the HCVP waiting list during the month of November
2005. Approximately 20,000 applications were received within this
30-day period. By June 1, 2006, OCHA had established a new wait
list containing 18,601 applicant names and began processing elderly
                                                                                                                H-93

                                          and disabled veterans and families headed by a veteran from the list. At
                                          the end of December 2006, OCHA had issued 1,064 Housing Choice
                                          Vouchers to applicants on the new waiting list. It could take several years
                                          to deplete the current waiting list and accept applications for a new list.
                                          Energy Conservation
                                          Government Code Section 65583(a)(78) requires that the City of
                                          Laguna Hills Housing Element include an analysis of opportunities for
                                          energy conservation with respect to residential development.
                                          The City of Laguna Hills fully enforces provisions of Title 24 of the
                                          California Administrative Code, which requires energy conservation
                                          measures in all new residential buildings (and additions to residential
                                          buildings) except hotels, motels, and buildings with four or more
                                          habitable stores and hotels. The regulations specify energy saving design
                                          for walls, ceilings, and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling
                                          equipment and systems, gas cooling devices, conservation standards,
                                          and the use of nondepleting energy sources, such as solar energy or wind
                                          power. Standards in Title 24 create energy savings of approximately 50
                                          percent over residential construction practices utilized prior to the Title
                                          24 enactment.
                                          Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy
                                          conservation and green building features can contribute to reduced
                                          housing costs for homeowners and renters, in addition to promoting
                                          sustainable community design, reduced dependence on vehicles, and
                                          reduced greenhouse gases.
                                          The City updated its General Plan and incorporated sustainability
                                          measures into the General Plan, including energy conservation
                                          opportunities.
                                          The City will adopt a sustainable development program (Land Use
                                          Implementation Program LU-8) with the goal of reducing ownership
                                          costs, reducing water and energy consumption, reducing driving, and
                                          reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
                                          The current General Plan incorporates sustainability by establishing
                                          implementation programs that address the following: green building
                                          standards; mixed use; additional bikeways, sidewalks, walkways,
                                          crosswalks to reduce driving; increasing transit use by coordinating with
                                          the Orange County Transportation Authority; drafting a climate action
                                          plan; increasing water conservation; increasing recycled and reclaimed
                                          water; and promoting community gardens. In addition to the above
                                          implementation programs in the General Plan, the City will also consider

Goals and Policies of 2013-
2021 Housing Element
The goals and policies described in this section will formulate the
City’s housing strategy and guide the implementation of the Housing
Element programs. The policies are intended to guide the City in
making decisions related to housing issues, the City staff in the daily
administration of the General Plan, and the public in understanding the
general direction of the City’s housing policies.
NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOUSING
PRESERVATION
Preserving the City’s residential neighborhoods and maintaining the
City’s housing stock are essential steps to retaining the City’s livability
and character. Preserving and or replacing units affordable to low
income households and those with special needs is also important.
Preservation efforts must carefully consider environmental, physical, and
economic constraints. To this end, the following policies seek to facilitate
neighborhood and housing preservation in Laguna Hills.
GOAL H-1: Maintain and preserve existing housing and residential 	
neighborhoods in Laguna Hills.
Policy H-1.1: Invest public and private resources in the maintenance 	
and rehabilitation of existing housing to prevent or 				
reverse neighborhood deterioration.
                                                                                                                                         H-99

                                          Policy H-1.5: Preserve the City’s affordable housing stock for low
                                          and moderate income households and special needs households.
                                          HOUSING AVAILABILITY
                                          Residents of Laguna Hills recognize the need to provide housing
                                          opportunities for all segments of the community. Providing a
                                          greater diversity of housing types, such as multifamily apartments,
                                          condominiums, townhomes, and senior housing facilities, will allow both
                                          younger and older generations of Laguna Hills’s residents to remain in the
                                          community. Housing variety will also enable citizens from a wide range
                                          of economic levels to live within the City. Accordingly, the following
                                          policies are designed to facilitate a diverse housing supply. The amount,
                                          type, and design of new development should be compatible with existing
                                          neighborhoods.
                                          GOAL H-2: Facilitate the development of a range of housing types,
                                          densities, and affordability levels to meet the diverse needs of the
                                          community for all economic levels and age groups and special
                                          needs groups, such as large families, female-headed households, the
                                          disabled, seniors, and the homeless.
                                          Policy H-2.1: Provide opportunities for higher density residential
                                          development, mixed use residential/commercial development, and
                                          transit-oriented development in appropriate areas of the City.
                                          Policy H-2.2: Promote zoning designations and commensurate
                                          development standards for residential development that encourage
                                          flexibility in permitted land use types, which also respond to changing

                                          Monitoring, enforcement, and preservation in housing should be
                                          established and maintained as an ongoing function of the City. An
                                          effective monitoring program provides the City with an important tool to
                                          gauge the success of the City’s housing programs and to address emerging
                                          housing needs as appropriate.

                                          ensure compliance with funding program regulations and compliance
                                          with local, state, and federal laws.
                                          Policy H-4.2: Ensure collaboration among various City departments in
                                          the delivery of housing and related services.
                                          Summary of Approach
                                          The goals, policies, and programs of the Housing Element will help the
                                          City to provide housing opportunities for all segments of the community
                                          while enhancing the quality of its neighborhoods and housing stock.
                                          Table H-44 identifies the four major issues guiding the Housing Element.
                                          These major issues represent the direction the City will take in its goals,
                                          policies, and programs to implement the vision of Laguna Hills as
                                          captured in the Guiding Themes and expressed in the Housing Plan.
                                          Quantified Objectives
                                          Table H-45 summarizes the City’s quantified objectives for construction,
                                          rehabilitation, and preservation over the 2013-2021 Housing Element
                                          planning period.
                                          As indicated in Table H-45, the City’s new construction objective totals
                                          two units. The City’s rehabilitation objective is 216 units at the Aliso

                                          To promote maintenance of existing rental properties, the City
                                          shall work with the California State Franchise Tax Board to enforce
                                          provisions of California Revenue and Taxation code Sections 17274
                                          and 24436.5, which prohibit owners of substandard rental housing

                                          The City will continue to work with the Orange County Housing
                                          and Community Services Department to receive rehabilitation
                                          loans and grants for low and moderate income homeowners and
                                          rental property owners, including senior/disabled households,
                                          to maintain housing stock. Efforts will focus on rehabilitating
                                          approximately 148 units in the Aliso Meadows Condominium
                                          Development. The rehabilitation loan and grant program will
                                          use CDBG funds distributed by the County as appropriate.
                                          The City will publicize the availability of this program in local
                                          newspapers, on the City’s website, at the Community Development

Hearings. Modifications for accessibility/universal design are
eligible activities under this program (see also Housing Element

Funding Source: 		                  CDBG
Time Frame:			                      Annually by September of each
year or as otherwise required by the County CDBG schedule
H-4. At-Risk Units
The City will continue to pursue the extension of affordability
controls for 51 units, either in the existing Rancho Moulton
housing development or as part of new or redevelopment activities
in the Via Lomas area or other areas of the City. . The City will
annually prepare a “Risk Assessment” report provided by the
California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC). Projects
determined high risk are those most likely to decline continued
federal assistance because they currently have rents below market
rate(s) and are owned by profit-motivated entities. The City will
work with potential purchasers to preserve 51 units in the existing
development or in new development by finding an interested non-
profit entity and securing funding to acquire and preserve the
property. The City will use HCD resources listed on the HCD
website, as well as other resources, to locate potential funding
sources as needed for the preservation of affordable housing.
As needed, the City will work with tenants of at-risk units and
provide them with education regarding tenant rights, notification
procedures, and conversion procedures. The City will also provide
tenants in at-risk projects information from the Orange County
Housing Authority regarding Section 8 rental assistance.
Responsible Agency:		               Community Development
Funding Source: 		                  General Fund
Time Frame:			                      By January of each year.
H-5. Foreclosure Referral Program
Based on current dynamics, the City seeks to address the increased
incidence of residents facing foreclosure. The City will provide

manufactured housing and mobile homes and ensure consistency
in the Zoning Ordinance, use regulations, and development
standards.

Residential district;
3.	      Increase the maximum lot coverage requirement in the
Mixed Use district.

a residential use and only subject to those restrictions that apply
to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone
(Government Code Section 65583 (a)(5)).

                                             Primary Implementation documents
                                             One of the primary implementation tools for the General Plan is
                                             the City’s Zoning Ordinance, which establishes zoning districts and
                                             corresponding allowed use and development provisions for all property
                                             within the City. By law, the Zoning Ordinance text and map must be
                                             consistent with the General Plan. Other important implementation
                                             tools include, but are not limited to the City’s Municipal Code,
                                             subdivision ordinance, development agreements, and specific plans.
                                             Funding
                                             The City’s General Fund is the primary source of funding for General
                                             Plan and implementation. Several other fees and funding sources are
                                             used to implement the General Plan. These funding sources are listed as
                                             applicable in each implementation program.

    improvements (such as crosswalks and bike racks) are in place to support walking and
    bicycling to schools.
5.	 Explore nonstructural solutions that may encourage people to walk or bus to school,
    rather than drive (e.g., staggered start times, walking groups, etc.)
6.	 Coordinate busing programs and expand ride-sharing opportunities to relieve
    congestion and improve safety conditions during school drop-off and pick-up times.
7.	 Enter into joint-use agreements to make additional recreational facilities available to the
    community during nonschool hours.

N-1. Noise Standards and Acoustical Studies
Review development proposals to ensure that the noise standards and compatibility criteria
set forth in the Noise Element are met. Consult Noise Element guidelines and standards for
noise compatible land uses to determine the suitability of proposed developments relative to
existing and forecasted noise levels. Enforce California Title 24 Noise Standards to ensure
an acceptable interior noise level of 45 dBA CNEL in habitable rooms.
Require acoustical analysis for all discretionary projects where any of the following apply:
1.	 The project will create or impact noise sensitive land uses and is located within the
    existing or future 60 dbA CNEL or higher contour.
2.	 The addition of more than 10 percent to the volume of average daily traffic of any
    arterial street.
3.	 The addition of 1,000 or more vehicles in the peak hour on adjacent roadways.                                                  
4.	 The project will introduce noise or vibration sources associated with mechanical
    equipment operations, entertainment, maintenance, and facility operations.
5.	 The project is a proposed residential use in the vicinity of existing and proposed
    commercial areas.
6.	 The project is a mixed use development that includes a residential component. The
    focus of this type of acoustical study is to determine likely interior and exterior noise
    levels and recommend appropriate design features to reduce noise.
Require mitigation measures, where necessary, to reduce noise levels to meet the adopted
standards and criteria. Such measures may include landscaped berms, barriers, walls,
enhanced parkways, increased parkways, and other sound attenuating architectural design
and construction methods. Only permit new development if adopted noise standards and
regulations can be met.

a “Risk Assessment” report provided by the California Housing Partnership Corporation
(CHPC). Projects determined high risk are those most likely to decline continued federal
assistance because they currently have rents below market rate(s) and are owned by profit-
motivated entities. The City will work with potential purchasers to retain 51 units in the existing                                     
development or in new development by finding an interested non-profit entity and securing
funding to acquire and preserve the property. The City will use HCD resources listed on the
HCD website, as well as other resources, to locate potential funding sources as needed for
the preservation of affordable housing. As needed, the City will work with tenants of at-risk
units and provide them with education regarding tenant rights, notification procedures, and
conversion procedures. The City will also provide tenants in at-risk projects information from
the Orange County Housing Authority regarding Section 8 rental assistance.

      50 dwelling units per acre.
5.	   Separate the transitional care facility/community care facility/emergency shelter
      definitions and explicitly allow emergency shelters in the Mixed Use zone subject to
      the development standards allowed by State law.
6.	   Update and include definitions for Emergency Shelter, Supportive Housing, and
      Transitional Housing, consistent with the provisions of the California Health and
      Safety Code. Transitional and supportive housing will be treated as residential uses
      subject to the same standards that apply to other residential uses of the same type in

                                             health and welfare from the effects of air pollution. Six air pollutants
                                             have been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
                                             (USEPA) as being of concern nationwide: carbon monoxide (CO);

                                             particulate matter (PM), which is subdivided into two classes based on
                                             particle size—PM10 and PM2.5. These pollutants are collectively referred
                                             to as criteria pollutants.

                                             occupied by federally listed species. Federally listed species are most

                                             species. Section 9 also prohibits “taking” any species of wildlife or fish
                                             listed as endangered. These restrictions apply to all federal agencies and

                                             (NFIP)
                                             The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is administered by the
                                             Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The NFIP provides
                                             federal flood insurance and federally financed loans for property owners
                                             in floodprone areas. To qualify for federal flood insurance, the City
                                             must identify flood hazard areas and implement a system of protective
                                             controls. The flood management section in the Safety Element fulfills
                                             these requirements.

National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA)
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 created the
framework for preservation activity in the United States. The NHPA
redefined and expanded the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) (established by the Historic Sites Act of 1935), created the
position of State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), and set up the
Historic Preservation Fund to fund the provisions of the NHPA. Section
106 of the NHPA requires that the effects of all federal undertakings
on properties eligible or listed in the NRHP be taken into account.
Amendments to the NHPA in 1980 provided for the establishment of a
Certified Local Government (CLG) program. The CLG program allows
for direct local government participation and integration in the statewide
historic preservation planning process. Cities can apply for CLG
status; to qualify, cities must adopt a historic preservation ordinance,
establish a qualified preservation commission, provide for adequate
public participation, and conduct a comprehensive historic resource
survey. Advantages to becoming a CLG include the ability to compete
for preservation grants. CLGs directly participate in the nomination
of historic properties to the NRHP and perform other preservation
functions as delegated by SHPO under NHPA.
Uniform Building Code (UBC)
The federal Uniform Building Code (UBC) defines different regions
of the United States and ranks them according to their seismic hazard
potential. There are four types of regions, called Seismic Zones 1
through 4, with Zone 1 having the least seismic potential and Zone 4
having the highest seismic potential. The City of Laguna Hills is within
Seismic Zone 4; accordingly, any future development would be required
to comply with all design standards applicable to Seismic Zone 4.
Uniform Fire Code (UFC)
The federal Uniform Fire Code (UFC) is the primary means for
authorizing and enforcing procedures and mechanisms to ensure the safe
handling and storage of any substance that may pose a threat to public
health and safety. The UFC regulates the use, handling, and storage
requirements for hazardous materials at fixed facilities. The UFC and
the federal Uniform Building Code (UBC) use a hazard classification
system to determine what protective measures are required to protect
fire and life safety. These measures may include construction standards,
separations from property lines, and specialized equipment. To ensure
that these safety measures are met, the UFC employs a permit system
based on hazard classification.
                                                                                                                   B-3

                                             The Alquist-Priolo Act (Public Resources Code Sections 2621–2630) was
                                             passed in 1972 to mitigate the hazard of surface faulting to structures
                                             designed for human occupancy. The main purpose of the law is to
                                             prevent the construction of buildings used for human occupancy on the
                                             surface trace of active faults. The law addresses only the hazard of surface

                                             Alquist-Priolo Act requires the State Geologist to establish regulatory
                                             zones known as “Earthquake Fault Zones” around the surface traces of

all affected cities, counties, and State agencies for their use in planning
efforts. Before a project can be permitted in a designated Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zone, cities and counties must require a geologic
investigation to demonstrate that proposed buildings would not be
constructed across active faults. Laguna Hills is not located within an
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone.
California Air Resources Board
(CARB)
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is the agency responsible
for coordination and oversight of State and local air pollution control
programs in California and for implementing the California Clean Air
Act (CCAA). The CCAA, which was adopted in 1988, required CARB
to establish the California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS).
CARB has established CAAQS for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl
chloride, visibility-reducing particulate matter, and the above-mentioned
criteria air pollutants. In most cases the CAAQS are more stringent
than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Differences in the
standards are generally explained by the health effects studies considered
during the standard-setting process and the interpretation of the studies.
In addition, the CAAQS incorporate a margin of safety to protect
sensitive individuals.
California Building Code (CBC)
The State of California provides a minimum standard for building design
through the California Building Code (CBC). The CBC is based on the
Uniform Building Code and modified for California conditions. The
CBC is generally adopted on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, subject
to further modification based on local conditions. The City of Laguna
Hills has adopted the CBC along with the County of Orange Grading
and Building Codes.
California Department of Fish and
Game (CDFG)
The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) regulates
impacts to wildlife resources. Special permits are required for alteration,
dredging, or any activity in a lake or stream, as well as other activities

sensitive plant and animal species. Future development in Laguna Hills
that has the potential to affect wildlife habitat will be subject to CDFG
regulations.

                                             The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) generally parallels
                                             the main provisions of the federal Endangered Species Act and is
                                             administered by CDFG. CESA prohibits the “taking” of listed species

                                             The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is the State’s
                                             environmental review process that requires public agencies to identify
                                             the significant environmental effects of a project and either avoid
                                             the significant environmental effects, where feasible, or mitigate the
                                             significant environmental effects, where feasible.
                                             California Fire Code
                                             The California Fire Code and Office of the State Fire Marshall provide
                                             regulations and guidance for local agencies in the development and
                                             enforcement of fire safety standards. The California Fire Code also
                                             establishes minimum requirements that will provide a reasonable degree
                                             of safety from fire, panic, and explosion.

                                             Solutions Act
                                             Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), the California Global Warming Solutions Act
                                             of 2006 (Nunez, Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006) recognizes that global
                                             warming poses a serious threat to the economy, environment, and people of
                                             California. To avert these potential consequences, AB 32 requires California
                                             to reduce statewide emissions to the 1990 level by 2020 (a reduction of
                                             about 30 percent from the forecast emissions level for 2020, or about
                                             10 percent below the existing emissions level). The law establishes the
                                             California Air Resources Board (CARB) as the lead agency to implement
                                             AB 32, which identifies the major actions CARB must perform. The major
                                             actions required of CARB to implement AB 32 include developing a list
                                             of early actions to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions; creating an
                                             inventory of historic emissions in the state; establishing the 2020 emissions
                                             limit; approval of a Scoping Plan by January 1, 2009 describing the
                                             comprehensive set of actions that will achieve the 2020 limit; and adopting
                                             the actions in the Scoping Plan as regulations by January 1, 2011, to ensure
                                             they are implemented and enforceable by January 1, 2012.

California Health and Safety Code,
Hazardous Waste Control
The Hazardous Waste Control Act (HWCA) regulates the generation,
treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste
is any material or substance that is discarded, relinquished, disposed, or
burned, or for which there is no intended use or reuse, and the material
or substance causes or significantly contributes to an increase in mortality
or illness; or the material or substance poses a substantial present or
potential hazard to human health or the environment. These materials or
substances include spent solvents and paints (oil and latex), used oil, used
oil filters, used acids and corrosives, and unwanted or expired products
(pesticides, aerosol cans, cleaners, etc.). If the original material or
substance is labeled danger, warning, toxic, caution, poison, flammable,
corrosive or reactive, the waste is very likely to be hazardous.
California Noise Insulation
Standards (Title 24)
The California Commission of Housing and Community Development
officially adopted noise standards in 1974. In 1988, the Building
Standards Commission approved revisions to the standards (Title 24, Part
2, California Code of Regulations). As revised, Title 24 establishes an
interior noise standard of 45 dBA (A-weighted decibels) for residential
space (community noise equivalent level [CNEL] or day/night average
sound level [Ldn]). Acoustical studies must be prepared for residential
structures that are to be located within noise contours of 60 dBA or
greater from freeways, major streets, thoroughfares, rail lines, rapid transit
lines, or industrial noise sources. The studies must demonstrate that the
building is designed to reduce interior noise to 45 dBA or lower.
California Surface Mining and
Reclamation Act (SMARA)
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA)
requires that all cities address in their General Plans the significant
aggregate resources classified by the State Geologist and designated by
the State Mining and Geology Board. SMARA was enacted to promote
conservation and protection of significant mineral deposits. The law also
ensures that significant aggregate resources are recognized and considered
before land use decisions are made that may compromise the availability
of these resources.

                                             Program
                                             In 1989, Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939), known as the Integrated Waste
                                             Management Act, was passed because of the increase in waste stream
                                             and the decrease in landfill capacity. As a result, the current California
                                             Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) was established. A
                                             disposal reporting system with CIWMB oversight was established,
                                             and facility and program planning was required. AB 939 mandates
                                             a reduction of waste being disposed: jurisdictions were required to
                                             meet diversion goals of 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by the year
                                             2000. AB 939 also established an integrated framework for program
                                             implementation, solid waste planning, and solid waste facility and landfill
                                             compliance.
                                             Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
                                             The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (Public Resources Code
                                             Sections 2690–2699.6) addresses earthquake hazards from nonsurface
                                             fault rupture, including liquefaction and seismically induced landslides.
                                             The act established a mapping program for areas that have the potential
                                             for liquefaction, landslide, strong groundshaking, or other earthquake
                                             and geologic hazards. The act also specifies that the lead agency for
                                             a project may withhold development permits until geologic or soils
                                             investigations are conducted for specific sites and mitigation measures are
                                             incorporated into plans to reduce hazards associated with seismicity and
                                             unstable soils.
                                             Senate Bill 375
                                             Senate Bill 375 (SB 375) establishes a strategy for achieving significant
                                             greenhouse gas emissions reductions through improved land use planning
                                             and transportation policy, which the bill states are necessary to achieve
                                             the 2020 limit established by AB 32. The bill requires CARB to establish
                                             greenhouse gas reduction targets for the automobile and light truck
                                             sector for 2020 and 2035 for regions of the State with a metropolitan
                                             planning organization (MPO). MPOs are required to adopt a sustainable
                                             community’s strategy (SCS), and an alternative planning strategy
                                             (APS) in specified situations, as part of its regional transportation
                                             plan (RTP) that is designed to achieve the automobile and light truck
                                             sector greenhouse gas reduction target established for their region by
                                             CARB. Transportation planning and programming activities performed
                                             by MPOs are required to be consistent with the adopted SCS, with
                                             certain projects exempt from consistency with the SCS. Local land use
                                             policies, including General Plans, are not required to be consistent with
                                             an adopted SCS or APS. In addition to linking regional transportation
                                             planning with local land use planning, the bill aligns both of those

Regional Plans and Programs
Airport Environs Land Use Plan for
Heliports (AELUP)
The Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) for Heliports intends
to safeguard the general welfare of the inhabitants within the vicinities
of heliports by reviewing proposed heliport sites to determine if
the proposed site is compatible with adjacent existing or proposed
uses. Location of heliport sites in compatible areas helps to ensure the
continued operation of the heliports. Specifically, the AELUP seeks to
protect the public from the adverse effects of aircraft noise, to ensure
that sites are not proposed for locations where people and facilities are
concentrated, and to ensure that structures or activities in the area would
not adversely affect the navigable airspace. The implementation of the
AELUP will help forestall urban encroachment on heliports and will
allow for their continued operation by ensuring that heliports are sited in
areas compatible with adjacent development.
As described in Figure 1 of the AELUP, all construction or alteration
of structures within Orange County at elevations more than 200 feet
above ground level require FAA and ALUC notification. In addition,
the ALUC indicates “For development of structures with a height of
200 feet in height above ground level or higher, at a development site,
applicants shall file a Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration
with the FAA (FAA Form 7460-1). Following the FAA’s Aeronautical
Study of the project, projects must comply with conditions of approval
imposed or recommended by the FAA. Subsequent to the FAA findings,
the City shall forward the FAA Aeronautical Study to the Airport Land
Use Commission (ALUC) of Orange County which may result in a
consistency analysis with ALUC.
County of Orange Congestion
Management Program
The State of California requires urbanized areas such as Orange County
to adopt a Congestion Management Program (CMP) with the goal of
reducing traffic congestion and facilitating coordination of local land use
planning and regional transportation improvement decision. By and
large, the Orange County CMP is a composite of data collected by local
jurisdictions according to guidelines established by the Orange County
                                                                                                                    B-9

                                             Transportation Authority (OCTA). The data is compiled by the OCTA
                                             and submitted to the Southern California Association of Governments
                                             (SCAG), the agency that determines regional consistency. Within

                                             Management Plan (Measure M)
                                             In 1990, Orange County voters approved Measure M authorizing a
                                             half-cent retail sales tax increase for a period of 20 years effective April 1,
                                             1991. In 2006, Orange County voters approved the renewal of Measure
                                             M for another 30 years until 2041. Measure M revenue is returned
                                             to local jurisdictions for use on local and regional transportation and
                                             maintenance projects.
                                             The purpose of the Orange County Growth Management Plan is to
                                             ensure that transportation and other public facilities are adequate to meet
                                             current and projected needs of County residents. The Plan establishes the
                                             following five major policies:
                                             •	   Development Phasing: Development will be phased according
                                                  to Comprehensive Phasing Plans (CPPs) adopted by the County.
                                                  Phasing is limited to roadway and public facility capacities.
                                             •	   Balanced Community Development: Development will be
                                                  balanced to encourage employment of local residents, and both
                                                  employment and employee housing in the County, as well as in
                                                  individual growth management areas (GMAs).
                                             •	   Traffic Level of Service: Future development creates the need

of public facilities for each GMA; (3) Countywide implementation and
evaluation of compliance with development phasing and improvements;
and (4) traffic improvement/public facility development agreements.
To qualify for Measure M revenue, each jurisdiction must comply with
the Countywide Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Program.
Specifically, to receive an allocation of Measure M revenue, Laguna Hills
must submit a statement of compliance with the growth management
components of this Program. Requirements include the adoption of
a traffic circulation plan consistent with the Master Plan of Arterial
Highways, adoption of a Growth Management Element within the
General Plan, adoption and adequate funding for a local transportation
fee program, and adoption of a 7-year capital improvement program that
includes all transportation projects funded either partially or fully by
Measure M funds.
County of Orange Master Plan of
Arterial Highways
The County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) forms
part of the Orange County General Plan and designates the arterial
system in the circulation element of the General Plan. Defined according
to specific arterial functional classifications, the MPAH serves to define
the intended future roadway system for the County. Cities within the
County are expected to achieve consistency with the MPAH in individual
General Plan circulation elements. To implement changes to the MPAH,
approval from the Orange County Transportation Authority is required.
National Pollutant Discharge and
Elimination System (NPDES)
The 1972 amendment to the Clean Water Act (CWA) established the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
program. The NPDES permit program outlined in the CWA contains
effluent limitation guidelines, water quality requirements, and permit
program requirements for discharges to waters of the U.S. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has overall responsibility
for the NPDES program, but administration of the program in
California has been delegated to the State Water Resources Control
Board (SWRCB) and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards
(RWQCBs). The City of Laguna Hills is located in two RWQCB
regions; the Santa Ana Region (Region 8) and the San Diego Region
(Region 9). Each region implements an NPDES permit for the
respective area of the City that is included in each region. Under the
NPDES permit, Laguna Hills must implement measures to reduce urban
runoff during all phases of development: planning, construction and
                                                                                                                  B-11
City of Laguna Hills General Plan Appendix B

                                             Practices (BMPs) to reduce runoff from construction and current uses,
                                             reporting any violations to the San Diego RWQCB, and education
                                             regarding the negative water quality impacts of urban runoff.

                                             The Orange County Environmental Management Agency (EMA)
                                             has prepared a Natural Community Conservation Plan and Habitat
                                             Conservation Plan (NCCP/HCP) for the Central and Coastal Subregion
                                             of the County of Orange, including portions of Laguna Hills. The
                                             NCCP/HCP was prepared in cooperation with CDFG and USFWS.
                                             The intent of the NCCP/HCP program is to provide long-term, regional
                                             protection of natural vegetation and wildlife diversity, while allowing
                                             compatible land use and appropriate development and growth. The
                                             NCCP/HCP is accomplished with the institution of a subregional
                                             Habitat Reserve System and implemented through a coordinated
                                             program to manage biological resources within the habitat reserve.

                                             Bikeways Strategic Plan is a regional planning document that identifies
                                             existing and proposed bikeways in Orange County. OCTA is currently
                                             updating the Commuter Bikeways Strategic Plan. The updated plan
                                             will help coordinate bikeway planning efforts between local agencies by
                                             providing a regional perspective of the needs and benefits of bikeways in
                                             Orange County.

                                             Plan addresses normal day-to-day hazardous materials operations as
                                             well as extreme emergencies, in which coordination among a variety of
                                             emergency response agencies is required. Local government involvement
                                             in a hazardous materials emergency is principally focused on discovery,
                                             notification, evaluation, and initiation of immediate on-scene action,
                                             along with long-term preparedness measures, which are implemented
                                             in coordination with local businesses. The Area Plan provides guidance
                                             for all local government agencies within OCFA’s jurisdiction, including
                                             Laguna Hills, in response to a hazardous materials emergency.

Regional Housing Needs
Assessment
State housing element law requires that Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG) determine the amount of housing needed in
its region and allocate the need to each community. The allocation of
housing need is based on Statewide and local projections of population,
employment, and housing need. State law requires cities to ensure that
adequate sites, public facilities, and services are available to facilitate
housing production commensurate with their housing need. Laguna
Hills’ Housing Element identifies programs to address its share of the
region’s housing need.
SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan
and Guide
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) undertakes
regional planning for the six-county SCAG region composed of Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Imperial and Ventura
Counties. SCAG’s efforts focus on developing regional strategies to
minimize traffic congestion, protect environmental quality, and provide
adequate housing. The Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide
sets forth broad goals intended to be implemented by participating
local and regional jurisdictions and the South Coast Air Quality
Management District. SCAG has adopted companion documents to the
Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide, most notably the Regional
Transportation Plan.
SCAG Regional Transportation
Plan
In May 2008, the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) adopted the 2008 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The
RTP is the culmination of a multi-year effort involving stakeholders
from across the SCAG Region and connects the six-county region of
Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura
Counties to a future vision in which innovative solutions address current
transportation challenges. The 2008 RTP presents the transportation
vision for this region through the year 2035 and provides a long-term
investment framework for addressing the region’s transportation and
related challenges. The Plan focuses on maintaining and improving the
transportation system through a balanced approach that considers system
preservation, system operation and management, improved coordination
between land-use decisions and transportation investments, and strategic
expansion of the system to accommodate future growth. SCAG has also
adopted a Regional Transportation Improvement Program to implement
                                                                                                                   B-13

                                             The federal Clean Air Act requires preparation of plans to improve
                                             air quality in any region designated as a nonattainment area. A
                                             nonattainment area is a geographic region identified by the U.S.

                                             Air Quality Management Plan, or AQMP, prepared by the South Coast
                                             Air Quality Management District, first adopted in 1994 and updated on
                                             a 3‑year cycle, contains policies and measures designed to achieve federal
                                             and State air quality standards within the South Coast Air Basin. The

                                             of Emergency Management Plans. Additionally, the Orange County
                                             Sheriff’s Department and Department of Environmental Health provide
                                             similar models and resources for local agencies.
                                             Development Agreements
                                             State law provides for development agreements between a project
                                             proponent and the City. The purpose of a development agreement is
                                             to provide developers with additional assurances that the policies, rules
                                             and regulations, and conditions of approval in effect at the time a project
                                             was approved will not be nullified by a future local policy or regulation
                                             change. In exchange, the developer may be required to meet certain
                                             conditions or performance criteria, which become part of the agreement.
                                             Development agreements can be a useful means of meeting General Plan
                                             goals and policies while removing some of the risks faced by developers.

Agreements can remain in effect for a few or several years, the term
typically being set forth in the agreement. It is important to emphasize
that, as set forth in the Government Code, the City is not prohibited
from applying new rules, regulations, and policies to the property
unless specifically stated in the development agreement, nor is the City
prevented from denying or conditionally approving any subsequent
development project application on the basis of such existing or new
rules, regulations, or policies.
Master Plans
Bikeways, Trails, and Open Space Master Plan
The City of Laguna Hills Bikeways Trails and Open Space Master Plan
was prepared in 2001 and represents a comprehensive planning effort to
guide future recreation development and natural area conservation within
the City of Laguna Hills. The Plan includes a description of the baseline
conditions in 2001 as well as explores the opportunities and constraints
for the improvement of bikeways, trails, and open spaces.
Saddleback Valley Unified School District
Facilities Master Plan
To plan for future facility needs, school districts typically implement
a long-range planning approach with Long-Range Facility Plans and
Master Plans. These documents allow school districts to estimate the
number of additional students that new development will generate and
plan for needed improvements to meet the demand. The Saddleback
Valley Unified School District Facilities Master Plan is based on the
projected development levels established for the City. The master plan
also considers demographic trends, such as increased household size, that
can affect the need for future school services. The City’s coordination
with the school districts to provide adequate educational facilities is an
issue addressed in this Element.
Municipal Code and Zoning
Ordinance
The City’s Municipal Code and Zoning Ordinance are the primary
tools used to implement the goals and policies of the General Plan.
The Zoning Ordinance provides more detailed direction related to
development standards; permitted, conditionally permitted, and
prohibited uses; and other regulations such as parking standards and sign
regulations. The land uses specified in the Zoning Ordinance are based
upon and should be consistent with the land use policies set forth in the
General Plan. Changes to the Zoning Ordinance will be necessary due to
the adoption of provisions in this General Plan and will require changes
to the zoning maps and development standards.

                                             City of Laguna Hills Noise Ordinance
                                             The City of Laguna Hills has the authority to set land use noise standards
                                             and place restrictions on private activities that generate excessive or
                                             intrusive noise. The applicable standards for these activities are specified
                                             in the Laguna Hills Municipal Code. The Noise Ordinance establishes
                                             allowable interior and exterior noise levels for residential areas. Specific
                                             standards for daytime and nighttime hours are also provided. Certain
                                             noise sources are prohibited and the ordinance establishes an enforcement
                                             process. Noise Ordinance requirements are identified in this Element.

                                             development of the City, specific plans are used to provide more detailed
                                             regulatory guidance for special areas or large developments within
                                             the City. Specific plans are generally composed of a land use plan,
                                             circulation plan, development standards, design guidelines, phasing plan,
                                             infrastructure plan (water, sewer, or drainage), and implementation plan.
                                             They are typically implemented as customized zoning for a particular area
                                             of the City and are generally used for large-scale projects that require a
                                             comprehensive approach to planning and infrastructure issues.
                                             Urban Village Specific Plan
                                             The City currently has one, approved specific plan. The Urban Village
                                             Specific Plan (UVSP), adopted in November 2002, is a 240-acre
                                             area bounded by Paseo de Valencia on the north and west, Los Alisos
                                             Boulevard on the south, and Interstate 5 on the east. The purpose of
                                             the UVSP area is to develop an urban core in which a variety of public,
                                             regional commercial, recreational, and high density residential uses
                                             work in concert to create an urban village. The UVSP provides for
                                             a continuing mixture of land uses, including retail, residential hotel,
                                             medical offices, and general offices. All new development within this area
                                             is subject to the provisions of the UVSP.
                                             Urban Water Management Plans
                                             Urban water purveyors are required to prepare and update an Urban
                                             Water Management Plan (UWMP) every 5 years. The Moulton Niguel
                                             and El Toro Water Districts, which serve Laguna Hills, updated their
                                             Plans in 2005. UWMPs address water supply, treatment, reclamation,
                                             and water conservation, and contain a water shortage contingency plan.
                                             Local UWMPs, such as those prepared by the Moulton Niguel and El
                                             Toro Water Districts, are supplemental to the regional plans prepared
                                             by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the
                                             Municipal Water District of Orange County.

                                             permit them to be located near each other in harmony and without
                                             conflict. The designation of permitted and conditionally permitted uses
                                             in zoning districts is intended to achieve compatibility within the district.

                                             materials. On the other hand, many aspects of compatibility are based
                                             on personal preference and are much harder to measure quantitatively, at
                                             least for regulatory purposes.

                                             Density: The number of dwelling units per unit of land; for the purposes
                                             of this General Plan density is the number of dwelling units per net acre

Income Category: Four categories are used to classify a household
according to income based on the median income for the county. Under
state housing statutes, these categories are defined as follows: Very
Low (0-50% of County median); Low (51-80% of County median);
Moderate (81-120% of County median); and Upper (over 120% of
County median).
Infrastructure: The physical systems and services that support
development and population, such as roadways, railroads, water, sewer,
natural gas, electrical generation and transmission, telephone, cable

Intensity: A measure of the amount or level of development often
expressed as the ratio of building floor area to lot area (floor area ratio)
for commercial, business, and industrial development, or dwelling units
per acre of land for residential development (also called “density”).
For the purposes of this General Plan, the intensity of nonresidential
development is described through the use of floor area ratio and building
floor area square footage.

                                             quantity that must be complied with or satisfied. The California
                                             Government Code (Section 65302) requires that General Plans describe
                                             “standards.” Examples of standards might include the number of acres
                                             of parkland per 1,000 populations that the community will attempt

Subsidence: The sudden sinking or gradual downward settling and
compaction of soil and other surface material with little or no horizontal
motion. Subsidence may be caused by a variety of human and natural
activity, including earthquakes.
Subsidy (Housing): To assist by payment of a sum of money or by
the granting of terms or favors that reduce the need for monetary
expenditures. Housing subsidies may take the forms of mortgage
interest deductions or tax credits from federal and/or State income
taxes, sale or lease at less than market value of land to be used for the
construction of housing, payments to supplement a minimum affordable
rent, and the like.
Substandard Housing: Housing that does not meet the minimum

physically attached to at least one other dwelling unit.
Transportation Demand Management (TDM): A strategy for
reducing demand on the road system by reducing the number of vehicles
using the roadways and/or increasing the number of persons per vehicle.
TDM attempts to reduce the number of persons who drive alone on
the roadway during the commute period and to increase the number in
carpools, vanpools, buses and trains, walking, and biking. TDM can be
an element of TSM (see below).

                                             comprehensive plans to reduce the number of vehicular trips generated
                                             by or attracted to new or existing development. TSM measures attempt
                                             to reduce the number of vehicle trips by increasing bicycle or pedestrian
                                             trips or by expanding the use of bus, transit, carpool, vanpool, or other
                                             high occupancy vehicles.

                                             Transitional Housing: Transitional housing is temporary (often 6
                                             months to 2 years) housing for a homeless individual or family who is
                                             transitioning to permanent housing. Transitional housing often includes
                                             a supportive services component (e.g., job skills training, rehabilitation
                                             counseling, etc.) to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in
                                             support of independent living.
                                             Trip: A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a destination
                                             via a single mode of transportation; the smallest unit of movement
                                             considered in transportation studies. Each trip has one “production end,”
                                             (or origin--often from home, but not always), and one “attraction end”
                                             (destination).
