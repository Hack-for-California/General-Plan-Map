Purpose
The purpose of the land use element of a
general plan is to improve the use of the land
and relationships between the different land
uses in the way that best serves the health,
safety, welfare and convenience of the general
public. Of all sections and elements of the
general plan, the land use element is the
foundation and focal point of the general plan.
However, it does not stand alone. Significant
policy exchange and interaction must exist with
the other general plan elements to form a basis
for a successful general plan.

The Mixed-Use Overlay permits residential
development on selected areas designated for
Commercial and Industrial land uses. The
purpose of this land use designation is to allow
greater flexibility of development alternatives,
especially attractive higher density residential         Example of vertical mixed-use development –

experiencing both physical and economic
blight.       To prevent a patchwork of
incompatible       land     uses,     residential
development in the Mixed-Use Overlay would
be allowable on a project site with a minimum
of 1.0 acre, unless circumstances prevent the
consolidation of parcels to meet this
requirement.
There are approximately 170 acres of Mixed-
Use Overlay in the City. The underlying
acerage as of follows: Low Density Residential
- 3.8 acres; Medium Density Residential - 15
acres; Neighborhood Commerical - 13 acres;
                                                         Example of horizontal mixed-use development –
General Commerical - 115.4 acres; and                            residential next to commercial.
Industrial - 22.7 acres.
Both horizontal mixed-use (single use free-
standing structure adjacent to commercial use
on the same or adjacent parcels) and vertical
mixed-use (residential land use above a
commercial use) are possible under this overlay
designation.

Public/Institutional
The Public/Institutional land use designation
provides for a wide range of public and quasi-
public uses, including government offices,
transportation facilities, parks, schools, public
utilities, public libraries, non-profit senior
housing and other public uses.              It is
implemented by the Official (O) zoning
designation.

Holding Capacity Analysis
Gardena is virtually built out, with 99.2 percent
of the total area developed.          There are
approximately 31.7 acres of vacant land
currently available for development. As a
result, future development will either occur
through limited infill development or through
recycling of existing developed land.
Table LU-4 provides an estimate of the total
number of dwelling units planned and the
resulting population, and Table LU-5 estimates
the potential future development in building
square feet of commercial, industrial and
public uses within the City. These estimates
are based on assumptions of future dwelling
unit densities and commercial/industrial
building intensities.
Since the original estimates were prepared in
2006, a number of assumptions have been cor-
rected to provide a more accurate estimate of
development. Housing population per dwell-
ing unit was reduced to match current esti-
mates. In the June 2012 Update there was a
recognition that to more accurately represent
buildout, development in the mixed use over-
lay designation should be calculated at 50%
residential and 50% non-residential develop-
ment. In this 2013 update there was further
adjustment to reflect that the Mixed Use des-
ignation is made up of two distinct zones, one
which allow up to 34 dwelling units per acre
(the C-R zone) and one which allows only 9
dwelling units per acre (the H-B zone). Fur-
thermore, it was recognized that development
in the C-R zone should be allocated as 60%
residential and 40% non-residential develop-
ment.

Class I (Bicycle Path) – A bicycle path is a
special facility that is designed exclusively
for the use of bicycles. They are physically
separated from motor vehicle traffic by a
barrier or spatial distance. Bicycle paths
are more often used for recreation and are
generally found in Los Angeles County in
parks and recreation areas such as the
beach and along river channels.
