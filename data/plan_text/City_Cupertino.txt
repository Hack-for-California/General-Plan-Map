CHAPTER 3: LAND USE AND COMMUNITY CHARACTER ELEMENT   | cupertino community vision 2040
                                                The Land Use and Community Design Element is the keystone of Community
                                                Vision 2040. It unifies and informs the other Elements by providing an overall
                                                policy context for future physical change. It deals with the issues of future
                                                growth and helps define the desired balance among social, environmental and
                                                economic considerations, while enhancing quality of life in the community.
                                                As Cupertino implements Community Vision 2040, it aspires to preserve
                                                and enhance the distinct character of each planning area to create a vibrant
                                                community with inviting streets and public spaces, preserved, connected and
                                                walkable neighborhoods, exceptional parks and community services, and a
                                                vibrant economy with a strong tax base.
                                                This Element includes goals, policies and strategies that provide direction on
                                                land use and design principles that will shape future change in Cupertino. In
                                                turn, each of the other Elements in Community Vision 2040 support the land
                                                use and design assumptions included in this Element.

  CHAPTER 3: LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
CONTEXT
DEVELOPMENT HISTORY
Cupertino was incorporated in 1955 and grew from a lightly settled agricultural
community of 2,500 people into a mostly suburban community during Silicon
Valley’s expansion from the 1960s through the 1980s. Cupertino’s attractive
natural setting and close proximity to employment centers and regional
transportation networks makes it a highly desirable place to live.
LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PATTERNS
Cupertino’s land use pattern was largely built on a conventional suburban
model, with predominantly single-family residential subdivisions and distinct
commercial and employment centers. This development pattern was also heavily
influenced by the topography of the area, with more intensive growth located on
the valley floor and lower design residential on the foothills. The western area by
the foothills is semi-rural with steep terrain, larger residential lots and access to
open space. The pattern becomes more suburban immediately west of Highway
85 where residential neighborhoods have a more uniform pattern with smaller
lots and older commercial and industrial areas along Stevens Creek Boulevard
and Bubb Road. The land use pattern becomes more urban east of Highway 85,
with a relatively connected street grid and commercial development along major
boulevards such as Stevens Creek, De Anza, Homestead, Stelling and Wolfe. This
area also has significant amounts of multi-family development in and around the
major boulevards.
The suburban pattern is also reflected in building locations, with most of the
older buildings set back from the street with parking lots in the front. Streets
have also been historically widened to accommodate larger volumes of traffic,
often to the detriment of other forms of transportation such as walking, biking
and transit. In the last 20 years, the City has made strides towards improving
walkability and bikeability by retrofitting existing streets to include bike lanes;
creating sidewalks lined with trees along major boulevards; and encouraging
development to provide a more pedestrian-oriented frontage with active uses,
gathering places and entries lining the street.
As the City seeks to implement sustainability and community health objectives,
future growth and retrofitting of existing infrastructure will create vibrant mixed-
use, commercial, employment and neighborhood centers; pedestrian-oriented
and walkable spaces for the community to gather; and distinct and connected
neighborhoods with easy walkable and bikeable access to services, including
schools, parks and shopping.
                                                                                           LU-3

CHAPTER 3: LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
HISTORIC PRESERVATION
The Cupertino area was originally settled by the Ohlone Indians, who lived in the
Rancho San Antonio area for over 3,000 years. In 1776 the area was explored by
Spanish soldiers during an expedition led by Colonel Juan Bautista De Anza. The
area was later settled by European immigrants who established farms on the
valley’s fertile land and enjoyed a thriving agricultural economy.
In the late nineteenth century, the village of Cupertino sprang up at the
crossroads of Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road (De Anza Boulevard) and Stevens Creek
Road. It was first known as the West Side. However, by 1898 the post office at
the Crossroads needed a new name to distinguish it from other similarly named
towns. The name “Cupertino” came from a local creek and winery owned by John
T. Doyle, a San Francisco lawyer and historian. In 1904, the Cupertino name was
officially applied to the Crossroads post office. At the same time, the Home Union
Store at the Crossroads location was renamed the Cupertino Store and moved to
the northeast corner of the Crossroads.
HILLSIDES
Cupertino’s hillsides are an irreplaceable resource shared by the entire Santa
Clara Valley. They provide important habitat for plants and wildlife; watershed
capacity to prevent flooding in downstream areas; a wide vegetative belt that
cleanses the air of pollutants; creates recreational opportunities for residents;
and a natural environment that provides a contrast to the built environment. The
City balances the needs of property owners in hillside areas with those of the
environment and the community by allowing low-intensity residential and other
uses in these areas, while requiring preservation of natural habitat and riparian
corridors when selecting building sites.
NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION
Cupertino is a city with diverse and unique neighborhoods that vary in character
and composition. As Cupertino matures, the city must continue to look at
preserving and enhancing its built environment. Cupertino’s vision is to preserve
the distinct character of neighborhoods; provide walking and biking connections
to services including parks, schools and shopping; and revitalize neighborhood
centers as community gathering places. The City will welcome citizens as
partners in making sure that their neighborhoods are the kind in which they
want to live in the future.

  CHAPTER 3: LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
REGIONAL LAND USE PLANNING
The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (SB 375)
calls on each of the State’s 18 metropolitan areas to develop a Sustainable
Communities Strategy (SCS) to accommodate future population growth and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. Plan Bay Area,
jointly adopted in 2013 by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), is the region’s first
Sustainable Communities Strategy to meet the requirements of SB 375 through
the year 2040.
Plan Bay Area anticipates that the Bay Area’s population will grow from about
7 million today to approximately 9 million by 2040 with employment growth of
about 1.1 million jobs. The Plan provides a strategy for meeting 80 percent of
the region’s future housing needs in Priority Development Areas (PDAs). These
are neighborhoods within walking distance of frequent transit service, offering a
wide variety of housing options, and featuring amenities such as grocery stores,
community centers and restaurants (see page LU-7).
CUPERTINO’S DEMOGRAPHICS
Cupertino’s population has grown from 3,664 in 1960 to over 58,000 in 2010 per
the U.S. Census Bureau. Most of the population growth has been from annexation
of areas into the city and from tract development during the 1970s and 1980s.
The city’s population is projected to grow to 66,110 by 2040 (Plan Bay Area,
2013). The diversity of its population has grown and changed over the years.
In 1960, 94 percent of the population was white while only 6 percent of the
population comprised of other races per the U.S. Census. This statistic held fairly
steady until 1980 when the population of whites steadily started to decline with
only 91 percent being white. By 1990, the population of whites had plunged to 74
percent and the Asian population had increased to 23 percent. In the following
decade, the white population continued to decline steadily to 50 percent, while
Asian population stood at 44 percent. By 2010 the Asian population in Cupertino
accounted for almost two thirds of the population (63 percent). A sizeable
portion of the City’s 2010 population, almost 50 percent are foreign born while
only seven percent of the 1960 population was foreign born; indicating a large
immigrant population.
The population of Cupertino is also growing older. Per the 1970 census, the
median age in the city was 26. The 2010 census reveals that the median age in
Cupertino has increased to 39.9. In 1970, only three percent of the population
was 65 years or over in age; however, the 2010 census indicates that 12.5
percent of the population is 65 years or over.
                                                                                           LU-5

CHAPTER 3: LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
With the changing demographic and ethnic values, housing needs are changing
as more immigrant families care for parents in their homes, younger workers
look for more affordable housing, close to services and employment, and the
older generation looks to downsize from their single-family homes into smaller,
single-level homes within walking distance to shopping and entertainment.
CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
PRINCIPLES
A major challenge today is meeting the energy needs of a growing population
while protecting the environment and natural resources. The Global Warming
Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) and Executive Order S-3-05 set a target to reduce
California’s greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by year 2020 and by
80 percent below the 1990 levels by year 2050. The City is in the process of
completing its Climate Action Plan (CAP), which aims to achieve statewide and
Bay Area emissions reduction targets.
The CAP is based on 2040 growth projections for Cupertino and identifies
policies and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at a municipal
and community-wide level. Similar to most neighboring cities, Cupertino has
historically had an imbalance of land uses (housing, services and jobs) with
a roadway infrastructure primarily dedicated to the automobile. When this
imbalance is multiplied at a regional level, there are regional consequences
including, traffic congestion, high housing costs, increased air pollution and lack
of accessibility for the young, elderly and disabled.
ECONOMIC VITALITY
Cupertino is fortunate in its location in the heart of Silicon Valley. Despite its
mostly suburban characteristics to the west and south, the city is home to
a number of small, medium and large software, technology and biomedical
companies. Community Vision 2040 includes more office growth to support
a strong fiscal revenue and a stable tax base. In particular, policies focus on
retaining and increasing the number of small, medium and major businesses in
key sectors and provide flexible space for innovative startups that need non-
traditional office environment. Policies for commercial areas seek to revitalize
the Vallco Shopping District, and enhance commercial centers and neighborhood
centers, which contribute to the City’s tax base and serve community needs.

PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT
AREAS
In 2008, ABAG and the MTC created a regional initiative to allow local governments
to identify Priority Development Areas (PDAs). PDAs are areas where new
development will support the day-to-day needs of residents and workers in a
pedestrian-friendly environment served by transit. While PDAs were originally
established to address housing needs in infill communities, they have been
broadened to advance focused employment growth. PDAs are critical components
for implementing the region’s proposed long term growth strategy. The level of
growth in each PDA reflects its role in achieving regional objectives and how it
fits into locally designated priority growth plans. Cupertino’s PDA area includes
properties within a quarter mile of Stevens Creek Boulevard from Highway 85 to its
eastern border and a portion of North and South De Anza Boulevards.

LOOKING FORWARD
Maintaining and enhancing Cupertino’s great quality of life is the keystone of
Community Vision 2040. The City will look towards focusing future change within
Special Areas that are located on Cupertino’s major mixed-use corridors. These
areas already have a mix of commercial, office, hotel and residential uses, and are
located along roadways that will be enhanced with “Complete Streets” features
(see Mobility Element), improved landscaping and expanded public spaces (e.g.,
parks and plazas). In turn, the City will also protect and enhance Neighborhoods
throughout Cupertino to ensure these largely residential areas continue to support
the community’s great quality of life. As we look forward, the following are ways
the City will address key challenges and opportunities facing Cupertino:

         percentage of our population, but also for the growing demographic of
         seniors and younger workers through new housing, services, shopping,
         entertainment and community facilities.
	
 2       LOCAL AND REGIONAL LAND USE PLANNING AND COLLABORATION.
	The City will take an active part in regional collaborative planning
         processes related to housing, transportation, sustainability, health,
         transportation and infrastructure financing in order to ensure local land
         use and transportation decisions are coordinated with regional efforts.
	3       INTEGRATING COMMUNITY HEALTH INTO LAND USE PLANNING.
	Integrating community health into land use planning. The City will
         enhance and improve health of people who live and work in our
         community. This includes integrating land use and transportation
         networks to reduce reliance on auto usage and improving alternative
         choices for transportation by focusing growth and change in corridors
         that support all modes of transit, providing neighborhoods with easy
         access to schools, parks and neighborhood centers.

  CHAPTER 3: LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
	4       LAND USE AND ECONOMICS.
	The City will look to diversify the City’s tax base, support and retain
         existing businesses, increase the vitality of aging commercial centers
         with redevelopment, seek to diversify shopping opportunities so that
         the community has the opportunity to satisfy their shopping needs
         within Cupertino.
	        URBAN DESIGN, FORM AND CHARACTER.
  5	
	The City will seek high-quality development to achieve desired
         physical environment in Planning Areas, including walkable,
         connected neighborhoods, inviting streets that allow for different
         modes of transportation, and vibrant and walkable special areas, and
         neighborhood centers in keeping with Community Vision 2040.
	        PRESERVATION OF NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND HILLSIDES.
  6	
	       Cupertino is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, including
         hillsides, creek corridors, and sensitive animal and plant habitats along
         the foothills. Much of this land is preserved in low-intensity residential
         and agricultural uses or open space. As redevelopment occurs, the City
         will strive to preserve these natural areas through land use and building
         design decisions.
	        ECONOMIC VITALITY AND FISCAL STABILITY.
  7	
	       As Cupertino’s population grows and ages, demands on community
         resources will increase. In order to maintain and enhance the
         community’s quality of life, the City will ensure that existing businesses
         are encouraged to reinvest and grow in Cupertino, and that the city
         continues to attract new businesses and investment.
                                                                                           LU-9

CHAPTER 3: LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
CITYWIDE GOALS AND POLICIES
Cupertino is a collection of many different neighborhoods, employment centers,
streets, parks and open space areas that all have their own unique character and
constraints. While there are specific planning and design considerations for these
areas (see Planning Area Goals and Policies later in this Element), many growth,
design and planning policies and strategies apply citywide. The following section
describes the goals, policies and strategies that are applicable to all property in
the city.

MIXED-USE URBAN VILLAGES
Many of the City’s Housing Element sites are located in major corridors to reduce
traffic and environmental impacts and preserve neighborhoods (Figure LU-2).
Housing Element sites, which are further identified and defined in the Housing
Element, represent the City’s priority for residential development. Residential uses
on sites with mixed-use zoning should be designed on the “mixed-use village”
concept discussed below.
     1. P arcel assembly. Parcel assembly of the site is required. Further parcelization
        is highly discouraged in order to preserve the site for redevelopment in the
        future.
     2. P lan for complete redevelopment. A plan for complete redevelopment of the
        site is required in order to ensure that the site can meet development standards
        and provide appropriate buffers.
     3. “ Mixed-Use Village” layout. An internal street grid with streets and alleys using
        “transect planning” (appropriate street and building types for each area), that is
        pedestrian-oriented, connects to existing streets, and creates walkable urban
        blocks for buildings and open space.
     4. Uses. Include a substantial viable, retail component. Retail and active uses such
        as restaurants, outdoor dining, and entries are required along the ground floor
        of main street frontages. Mix of units for young professionals, couples and/
        or active seniors who like to live in an active “mixed-use village” environment.
        Office uses, if allowed, should provide active uses on the ground floor street
        frontage, including restaurants, entries, lobbies, etc.
     5. O pen space. Open space in the form of a central town square with additional
        plazas and “greens” for community gathering spaces, public art, and
        community events. The locations and sizes will depend on the size of the site.
     6. A rchitecture and urban design. Buildings should have high-quality, pedestrian-
        oriented architecture, and an emphasis on aesthetics, human scale, and
        creating a sense of place.
     7. Parking. Parking in surface lots shall be located to the side or rear of buildings.
        Underground parking under buildings is preferred. Above grade structures
        shall not be located along major street frontages. In cases, where above-grade
        structures are allowed along internal street frontages, they shall be lined with
        retail, entries and active uses on the ground floor. All parking structures should
        be designed to be architecturally compatible with a high-quality “town center”
        environment.
     8. N eighborhood buffers. Setbacks, landscaping and/or building transitions to
        buffer abutting single-family residential areas.
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CENTERS
Neighborhood Commercial Centers serve adjacent neighborhoods and provide
shopping and gathering places for residents. Retaining and enhancing neighborhood
centers within and adjacent to neighborhoods throughout Cupertino supports
the City’s goals for walkability, sustainability and creating gathering places for
people. Figure LU-2 shows the location of the Neighborhood Commercial Centers
in Cupertino. The Guiding Principles of sustainability and health in Community
Vision 2040 support the retention and enhancement of neighborhood centers
throughout the community, and providing pedestrian and bike connections to them
from neighborhoods. Mixed-residential use may be considered if it promotes
revitalization of retail uses, creation of new gathering spaces, and parcel assembly.
Housing Element sites represent the City’s priority for residential development.
Residential uses should be designed on the “mixed-use village” concept discussed
in this Element.

CHAPTER 3: LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
PLANNING AREA GOALS AND POLICIES
As outlined in the Planning Areas chapter, Community Vision 2040 organizes
the city into 21 distinct Planning Areas, divided into two categories: (1) Special
Areas that are expected to transition over the life of the General Plan and (2)
Neighborhoods where future changes are expected to be minimal. The following
goals, policies and strategies are specific to the Planning Areas and provide
guidance for future change in accordance with the community vision. Figure LU-2
shows maximum heights and residential densities allowed in each Special Area.
SPECIAL AREAS
Special Areas are located along major mixed-use corridors and nodes that
have access to a variety of different forms of transportation. Future growth in
Cupertino will be focused in these areas to manage growth while minimizing
traffic, greenhouse gas and health impacts on the community. The discussion
for each Special Area outlines goals, policies and strategies related to land use,
building form, streetscape, connectivity, open space, landscaping, and the urban/
rural ecosystem in order to help implement the community vision for these
areas.

                                               Cupertino is a community with a high quality of life, a renowned school
                                               system, and a robust high-technology economy. The long term vitality of
                                               Cupertino and the local economy depend upon the availability of all types of
                                               housing to meet the community’s diverse housing needs. As Cupertino looks
                                               towards the future, increasing the range and diversity of housing options
                                               will be integral to the City’s success. Consistent with the goal of being a

ROLE AND CONTENT OF HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element is a comprehensive eight-year plan to address housing
needs in Cupertino. This updated Housing Element focuses on housing needs
from January 31, 2015 through January 31, 2023, in accordance with the housing
element planning period established by State law for San Francisco Bay Area
jurisdictions.
This Housing Element is the City’s primary policy document regarding the
development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing for all economic
segments of the population. Per State Housing Element law, the document must
be periodically updated to:
     •	 Outline the community’s housing production objectives consistent with
        State and regional growth projections
     •	 Describe goals, policies and implementation strategies to achieve local
        housing objectives
     •	 Examine the local need for housing with a focus on special needs
        populations
     •	 Identify adequate sites for the production of housing serving various
        income levels
     •	 Analyze potential constraints to new housing production
     •	 Evaluate the Housing Element for consistency with other General Plan
        elements
This element outlines the community’s projected housing needs and defines the
actions the City will take to address them. General Plan Appendix B provides
detailed background information to meet all requirements of State Housing
Element law.
                                                                                           H-3

CHAPTER 4: HOUSING ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This section describes the demographic, housing, and economic conditions in
Cupertino; assesses the demand for housing for households at all income levels;
and documents the demand for housing to serve special needs populations. The
Housing Needs Assessment establishes the framework for defining the City’s
housing goals and formulating policies and strategies that address local housing
needs.
A community’s population characteristics can affect the amount and type of
housing needed. Factors such as population growth, household type, and whether
or not households are more likely to rent or buy their homes influence the type of
housing needed.
DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS IN CUPERTINO AND THE REGION
POPULATION
The City’s population increased by 15 percent between 2000 and 2010, exceed-
ing the growth rate of Santa Clara County (six percent), the San Francisco Bay
area (five percent), and the State of California (10 percent) (see Table HE-1).
During this period, Cupertino grew from 50,546 to 58,302 residents. A portion of
this population growth can be attributed to the annexation of 168 acres of land
between 2000 and 2008. Annexation of Garden Gate, Monta Vista, and scattered
County “islands” added 1,600 new residents. After removing the population in-
creases from these annexations, Cupertino experienced a 12-percent increase in
its population during the previous decade.
 H-4

                     CHAPTER 4: HOUSING ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
HOUSEHOLDS
A household is defined as a person or group of persons living in a housing
unit, as opposed to persons living in group quarters, such as dormitories,
convalescent homes, or prisons. In 2010, Cupertino was home to 20,181
households (see Table HE-1). The City added approximately 2,000 new
households between 2000 and 2010, an increase of 11 percent. Approximately
600 of these households, however, resulted from annexations. After adjusting for
household increases due to annexation, the number of households grew by only
eight percent between 2000 and 2010. During the same time period, the number
of households increased by 6.8 percent in Santa Clara County.
HOUSEHOLD TYPE
Households are divided into two different types, depending on their composition.
Family households are those consisting of two or more related persons living
together. Non-family households include persons who live alone or in groups
of unrelated individuals. Cupertino has a large proportion of family households.
In 2011, family households comprised 77 percent of all households in the City,
compared with 71 percent of Santa Clara County households (see Table HE-1).
HOUSEHOLD TENURE
Households in Cupertino are more likely to own than rent their homes.
Approximately 63 percent of Cupertino households owned their homes in 2010.
By comparison, 58 percent of Santa Clara County households owned homes
(see Table HE-1).
                                                                                         H-5
CHAPTER 4: HOUSING ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
LONG-TERM PROJECTIONS
Table HE-2 shows population, household, and job growth projections for
Cupertino, Santa Clara County, and the nine-county Bay Area region between
2010 and 2040 and represents the analysis conducted by the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG) using 2010 Census data and a variety of local sources.
Between 2010 and 2040, Cupertino’s population is expected to grow by 12,898
residents—from 58,302 to 71,200. This translates into an increase of 22 percent
over 30 years. ABAG projects both Santa Clara County and the ABAG region will
experience much larger growth over the same time period (36 percent and 31
percent, respectively). Cupertino’s job growth is expected to continue to outpace
population and household growth between 2010 and 2020, compounding the
“jobs rich” nature of the City and the region. By 2020, Cupertino is anticipated
to have a jobs-to-housing ratio of 1.40 (up from 1.29 in 2010, but mirroring the
regional average of 1.40). Job growth in Cupertino is projected to level off after
2020 to a comparable pace with population and household growth. Similar
trends are also projected for the County and the ABAG region as a whole.
HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all types of housing
located within the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock—
including condition, type, and affordability—are important in determining the
housing needs for Cupertino.
DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS BY STRUCTURE TYPE
A majority of housing units in Cupertino are single-family detached homes (57
percent in 2013). While still representing the majority house type, this represents
a decrease from 2000, when 61 percent of all homes were single-family
detached. In comparison, single-family detached homes in both Santa Clara
County and the Bay Area comprised 54 percent of all homes in 2013.
Large multi-family buildings (defined as units in structures containing five or
more dwellings) represent the second largest housing category in Cupertino (21
percent), followed by single-family attached dwellings (12 percent). Between
2000 and 2013, these two housing types experienced an increase of 24 and 26
percent, respectively.

INCOME AND MARKET CONDITIONS RELATED TO HOUSING COSTS
The cost of housing is dependent on a variety of factors, including underlying
land costs, market characteristics, and financing options. In the Bay Area,
the technology boom has increased the demand for new housing at all
income levels, resulting in both lower-earning residents and well-paid area
professionals competing for housing in an overcrowded and expensive market.
High housing costs can price lower-income families out of the market, cause
extreme cost burdens, or force households into overcrowded conditions.
Cupertino has some of the highest housing costs in the region.

RENTAL MARKET CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS
A review of rental market conditions in Cupertino was conducted for this
Housing Element by reviewing advertised apartment listings. The survey found
that market-rate rents averaged:
     •	 $1,608 per month for studio units
     •	 $2,237 per month for one-bedroom units
     •	 $2,886 per month for two-bedroom units
     •	 $3,652 per month for three-bedroom units
Rental prices in Cupertino ranged from $1,400 for a studio unit to $5,895 for
a five-bedroom unit. As can be expected, smaller units are generally more
affordable than larger units. The overall median rental price for all unit sizes
surveyed was $2,830, and the average price was $2,919.
HOME SALE TRENDS
While other areas of the State and nation experienced downturns in the housing
market during the national recession that began in 2008, Cupertino home values
have continued to grow. During the depth of the housing market crash (between
2008 and 2010), the median home price in Cupertino held steady at around
$1,000,000. Since 2011, home prices in Cupertino have increased substantially.
The 2013 median home sales price of $1,200,000 in Cupertino was nearly double
that of the County median price ($645,000), and prices continued to rise in 2014.
                                                                                        H-9

CHAPTER 4: HOUSING ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
According to the federal government, housing is considered “affordable” if it
costs no more than 30 percent of a household’s gross income. Often, affordable
housing is discussed in the context of affordability to households with different
income levels. Households are categorized as very low income, low income,
moderate income, or above moderate income based on percentages of the area
median income established annually by the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD). In 2014, the area median income for Santa
Clara County was $105,500 for a family of four.
SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Certain groups have more difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to
their special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s
income-earning potential, family characteristics, the presence of physical or
mental disabilities, or age-related health issues. As a result, certain groups
typically earn lower incomes and have higher rates of overpayment for housing,
or they may live in overcrowded residences. Housing Element law specifically
requires an analysis of the special housing needs of the elderly, the disabled,
female-headed households, large families, farmworkers, and homeless persons
and families. Table HE-3 summarizes demographics for these special needs
groups in Cupertino.
SENIORS
Many senior residents face a unique set of housing needs, largely due to physical
limitations, fixed incomes, and health care costs. Affordable housing cost, unit
sizes and accessibility to transit, family, health care, and other services are
critical housing concerns for seniors.
In 2010, 20 percent of Cupertino householders were 65 years old or older,
slightly higher than the proportion of senior households in Santa Clara County
(18.5 percent). A large majority of these senior households owned their homes;
86 percent of elderly households were homeowners, compared to only 58
percent of householders under 64 years old.
Cupertino’s elderly renter households are more likely to be lower income
than elderly owner households. Approximately 62 percent of elderly renter
households earned less than 80 percent of the area median income compared to
42 percent of senior homeowners. Elderly households also tend to pay a larger
portion of their income on housing costs than do other households.

CHAPTER 4: HOUSING ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
Large households are defined as those with five or more members. Large
households are identified as a special needs group because of limited
opportunities for adequately sized and affordable housing. Cupertino has a
smaller proportion of large households than Santa Clara County as a whole (9.3
percent in Cupertino compared to 15 percent in Santa Clara County). In the City,
large households are more likely to be homeowners (67 percent) than renters
(33 percent). Approximately 64 percent of the housing units in Cupertino have
three or more bedrooms and can accommodate large households.
SINGLE-PARENT HOUSEHOLDS
Single-parent households often require special consideration and assistance
because of their greater need for affordable housing and accessible day care,
health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed single-parent
households with children, in particular, tend to have a higher need for affordable
housing than other family households in general. In addition, these households
are more likely to need childcare since the mother is often the sole source of
income in addition to being the sole caregiver for the children in the household.
In 2010, 667 female-headed single-parent households with children under 18
years of age lived in Cupertino, representing 3.3 percent of all households in
the City. A significant proportion of these households were living in poverty (21
percent).
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
A disability is a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life
activities. Persons with disabilities generally have lower incomes and often face
barriers to finding employment or adequate housing due to physical or structural
obstacles. This segment of the population often needs affordable housing that
is located near public transportation, services, and shopping. Persons with
disabilities may require units equipped with wheelchair accessibility or other
special features that accommodate physical or sensory limitations. Depending on
the severity of the disability, people may live independently with some assistance
in their own homes, or may require assisted living and supportive services in
special care facilities. Approximately six percent of Cupertino residents and eight
percent of Santa Clara County residents had one or more disabilities in 2010.

                     CHAPTER 4: HOUSING ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
RESIDENTS LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL
Families with incomes below the poverty level, specifically those with extremely
low and very low incomes, are at the greatest risk of becoming homeless and
often require assistance in meeting their rent and mortgage obligations in order
to prevent homelessness. Census data suggest that four percent of all Cupertino
residents were living below the poverty level in 2010. Specifically, about three
percent of family households and two percent of families with children were
living below the poverty level. These households may require specific housing
solutions such as deeper income targeting for subsidies, housing with supportive
services, single-room occupancy units, or rent subsidies and vouchers.
HOMELESS
Demand for emergency and transitional shelter in Cupertino is difficult to
determine given the episodic nature of homelessness. Generally, episodes of
homelessness among families or individuals can occur as a single event or
periodically. The county-wide 2013 Santa Clara County Homeless Census &
Survey reported a point-in-time count of 7,631 homeless people on the streets
and in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and domestic violence shelters
throughout the County. This estimate includes 112 homeless individuals in
Cupertino. The count, however, should be considered conservative because many
unsheltered homeless individuals may not be visible at street locations, even
with the most thorough methodology.
                                                                                        H-13
CHAPTER 4: HOUSING ELEMENT    | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
 REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
 Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65584, the State, regional
 councils of government (in this case, ABAG), and local governments must
 collectively determine each locality’s share of regional housing need allocation
 (RHNA). In conjunction with the State mandated housing element update cycle
 that requires Bay Area jurisdictions to update their elements by January 31, 2015,
 ABAG has determined housing unit production needs for each jurisdiction within
 the Bay Area. These allocations set housing production goals for the planning
 period that runs from January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2022 (Table HE-4).
                        Table HE-4: RHNA, Cupertino, 2014-2022

  Source: ABAG Regional Housing Needs Assessment, 2014.
PROGRESS TOWARD THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
The City of Cupertino may count housing units constructed, approved, or
proposed since January 1, 2014 toward satisfying its RHNA goals for this
planning period. Between January 1 and May 31, 2014, building permits for 14
single-family housing units and three second units were approved in Cupertino.
In addition, six single-family homes and seven apartments received Planning
approvals. Also included in the RHNA credits are 32 second units projected to
be developed within the planning period. This projection is based on historical
approvals of second units during the past Housing Element planning period. With
these credits, the City has a remaining RHNA of 1,002 units: 356 extremely low/
very low-income units, 207 low-income units, 196 moderate-income units, and
243 above moderate-income units.

HOUSING RESOURCES
OVERVIEW OF AVAILABLE SITES FOR HOUSING
The purpose of the adequate sites analysis is to demonstrate that a sufficient
supply of land exists in the City to accommodate the fair share of the region’s
housing needs during the RHNA projections period (January 1, 2014 – October
31, 2022). The Government Code requires that the Housing Element include
an “inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant
sites and sites having the potential for redevelopment”((Section 65583[a][3]). It
further requires that the Element analyze zoning and infrastructure on these
sites to ensure housing development is feasible during the planning period.
Figure HE-1 indicates the available residential development opportunity sites
to meet and exceed the identified regional housing need pursuant to the RHNA.
The opportunity sites can accommodate infill development of up to 1,400
residential units on properties zoned for densities of 20 dwelling units to the
acre or more. The potential sites inventory is organized by geographic area and
in particular, by mixed use corridors. As shown in Table HE-5, sites identified
to meet the near-term development potential lie within the North Vallco Park
Special Area, the Heart of the City Special Area, and the Vallco Shopping
District Special Area.
One particular site will involve substantial coordination for redevelopment
(Vallco Shopping District, Site A2). Due to the magnitude of the project, the City
has established a contingency plan to meet the RHNA if a Specific Plan is not
approved within three years of Housing Element adoption. This contingency
plan (called Scenario B and discussed further in General Plan Appendix B),
would involve the City removing Vallco Shopping District, adding more priority
sites to the inventory, and also increasing the density/allowable units on other
priority sites.
                                                                                        H-15

  Introduction
        Cupertino’s transportation system is multi-faceted. It integrates walkways,
        sidewalks, bicycle routes, bus transit facilities, local streets, major roadways
        and freeways into a single, integrated system that supports the city’s
        high quality of life. At the local level, this includes facilities that connect
        neighborhoods with pedestrian, bicycle and automobile routes. Longer
        distance connections include links to major boulevards, expressways,
        commuter rail and the regional freeway system.
        This Element includes goals, policies and strategies that the City will use in
        making decisions regarding transportation network improvements needed to
        accommodate Cupertino’s anticipated growth. The purpose for this Element
        is to implement strategies that make alternative modes of transportation
        attractive choices. This will help reduce strain on the automobile network and
        improve health and quality of life for Cupertino residents and businesses.

                      CHAPTER 5: MOBILITY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
CONTEXT
Cupertino’s circulation system was developed mostly in a suburban and auto-
oriented pattern during the 1950s and 1960s. Over the years, the City has
enhanced its roadway infrastructure with a system of bike lanes, trails, bridges,
better sidewalks and publicly accessible connections in new development.
Cupertino is also served by many important regional transportation facilities such
as Highway 85, Interstate 280, Lawrence Expressway, and bus transit service
provided by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA).
The community anticipates reductions in auto traffic impacts, enhancements to
the walking and biking environment, improvements to existing transit service,
and connections to key transit nodes including Caltrain. As such, the goals in this
Element respond to current conditions and present policies to adequately address
future change.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING
Cupertino’s local transportation infrastructure is supplemented by regional
facilities and services through agencies such as the VTA, the local congestion-
management agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), the
Bay Area’s regional transportation authority, and Caltrans, the State Department
of Transportation. Each agency has a long-term plan consisting of policies and
projects which are connected to the operational success of Cupertino’s local
transportation network. Key projects for these agencies include:
•	 Interchange Improvements at Interstate 280/Highway 85 (MTC–Plan
    Bay Area)
•	 Stevens Creek Bus Rapid Transit (MTC–Plan Bay Area)
Regional transit service primarily includes bus lines operated by VTA that run
along the city’s major corridors, including Stevens Creek Boulevard, De Anza
Boulevard and Wolfe Road, and portions of Homestead Road, Stelling Road
and Tantau Avenue. Regional facilities include a bus transit station at De Anza
College and within the Vallco Shopping District. As new development projects are
proposed, the City will continue to identify opportunities for improvements to bus
stop facilities, such as the new Apple Campus 2 area at Wolfe Road, Homestead
Road and Tantau Avenue and the Main Street project at Tantau Avenue and
Stevens Creek Boulevard.
                                                                                          M-3

CHAPTER 5: MOBILITY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
A relatively new trend in regional commute transportation is the implementation
of private bus and shuttle services to connect workers and major employers
throughout the Bay Area. While currently this activity is not regulated or
organized among these employers, it is beneficial in the regional effort to reduce
the reliance on Single Occupancy Vehicles (SOVs).
The One Bay Area Grant Program is a new funding approach that better
integrates the region’s federal transportation program with California’s
landmark climate change law (Assembly Bill 32, 2006) and Sustainable
Communities Strategy program (Senate Bill 375, 2008). Funding distribution to
the counties considers progress toward achieving local land use and housing
policies by:
•	 Supporting the Sustainable Communities Strategy for the Bay Area by
     promoting transportation investments in Priority Development Areas (PDAs);
     and
•	 Providing a higher proportion of funding to local agencies and additional
     investment flexibility to invest in bicycle and pedestrian improvements,
     local streets and roadway preservation and planning activities, while also
     providing specific funding opportunities for Safe Routes to School (SR2S)
     and Priority Conservation Areas.
The goals and policies included in this Element and the Land Use and
Community Design Element seek to take advantage of regional planning and
funding efforts. They implement strategies that encourage the location of
future growth in Cupertino’s Priority Development Areas along Stevens Creek
Boulevard and portions of De Anza Boulevard, and by advocating for improved
service and improvements to regional infrastructure.
LINK BETWEEN LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION
In order to maintain and enhance the quality of life for Cupertino residents and
businesses, it is important to ensure that future growth does not overwhelm the
transportation network, identify ways to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and
improve the health of our community. Land use and mobility policies included
in the General Plan seek to do so by working together to focus future growth
along major mixed-use corridors and within PDAs. Mobility policies also seek to
improve the walking/biking environment and enhance transit to ensure that the
transportation network is accessible to people of all ages and abilities, including
  M-4

                       CHAPTER 5: MOBILITY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
school children, the disabled and the elderly. These policies also promote
connectivity between neighborhoods and services, and between key nodes in
order to reduce reliance on the automobile as the sole mode of transportation.
COMPLETE STREETS
The California Complete Streets Act (2008) places the planning, designing
and building of “Complete Streets” into the larger planning framework of the
General Plan by requiring jurisdictions to plan for multi-modal transportation
networks. Complete Streets are designed and operated to enable safe access
for all users including pedestrians, bicyclists, the disabled, motorists, seniors,
users of public transportation and movers of commercial goods. These networks
allow people to effectively travel to key destinations within their community and
the larger region. In addition, all transportation projects should be evaluated
as to their ability to improve safety, access and mobility for all travelers and
recognize pedestrian, bicycle and transit modes as integral elements of their
transportation system.
Cupertino has already begun the work of reviewing the existing street network
and looking for new opportunities to improve alternative modes of transportation
through the construction of sidewalks, walking paths, bike lanes, trails and
bridges across pedestrian barriers, such as the Don Burnett Bridge at Mary
Avenue. The goals and policies in this Element seek to continue the work of
making enhancements to the transportation network to encourage all modes of
transportation.
GREENHOUSE GASES AND TRANSPORTATION
A major challenge of today is meeting the energy needs of a growing population
while also protecting air quality and natural resources. The majority of
greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to carbon dioxide emissions
from the transportation sector. A 2010 inventory of Cupertino’s community-
wide emissions shows that transportation accounts for almost 41 percent of
community-wide emissions. Therefore, reducing the number of automobile trips,
particularly from single-occupancy vehicles, can provide the greatest benefit in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Cupertino.
The goals and policies in this Element work in tandem with other General Plan
policies to address issues of sustainability, health and air quality by taking
                                                                                           M-5

CHAPTER 5: MOBILITY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
advantage of opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Low-carbon
fuels, new and improved vehicle technologies, and land use strategies and
infrastructure improvements to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled can
reduce transportation-related emissions significantly.  
PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS
Cupertino has made considerable strides improving walkability and bikeability
with new or improved bike lanes, sidewalks and pedestrian connections.
However, many older commercial areas and neighborhoods continue to lack a
pedestrian and bike-friendly environment where students can safely walk and
bike to school, and families can walk or bike to parks and nearby community
facilities and shopping. This was a consistent theme expressed by participants
during public workshops conducted as part of the General Plan Amendment.
Areas are generally considered walkable if people can safely walk to schools,
parks and services within a half mile (less than10-14 minutes) distance. A bike-
friendly city provides a network of streets and paths where people can bike
safely and conveniently to community facilities, employment and shopping. The
goals and policies of this Element, along with the City’s Bicycle Transportation
Plan and Pedestrian Plan, seek to further improve and enhance the walking
and biking environment through capital improvement projects, development
review, and retrofitting existing facilities within older commercial areas and
neighborhoods. Figure M-1 identifies existing and planned improvements to
bicycle and pedestrian facilities in the city.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
Senate Bill 743 (2013) created a process to change the way that transportation
impacts are analyzed under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The
process helps achieve the State’s goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
and traffic-related air pollution, promotes the development of a multi-modal
transportation system, and provides clean, efficient access to major destinations.
Specifically, the law requires an alternative to automobile level of service (LOS)
for evaluating transportation impacts. Particularly within areas served by transit,
alternative criteria are required to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions, the development of multi-modal transportation networks, and a
diversity of land uses.

Like many cities, Cupertino has used LOS as a performance measure to evaluate
traffic impacts. Historically, this has led cities to focus entirely on improvements
to auto infrastructure, often to the detriment of other modes of transportation.
Consistent with State law, this Element seeks to look at performance measures
that balance the needs of all modes of transportation, including automobile,
walking, biking and transit. Such new measures can range from looking at
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as a measure of balancing land uses to reviewing
seconds of delay for all travel modes as a measure of impacts to traffic. This will
allow the City to develop and maintain a Transportation Improvement Plan that
includes pedestrian, bicycle, transit and automobile network enhancements, and
Transportation Systems Management (TSM) and Travel Demand Management
(TDM) measures to improve efficiency of the network.
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK
Cupertino’s transportation network consists of a variety of street types and
pathways. The network determines not only how various land uses are
connected but also the modes of transportation used by people to access
them. Table M-1 defines the various street types and paths in terms of their
character, adjoining current and future land uses, modes of travel that they
currently support, and improvements needed to enhance access for all modes of
transportation.
Close alignment of the City’s Capital Improvement Program with Community
Vision 2040 priorities will allow the City to strategically plan and direct resources
to develop this multi-modal transportation infrastructure. Figure M-2 shows the
geographical locations of the major roadways.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
MANAGEMENT (TSM)
TSM is an approach to congestion mitigation that identifies improvements to enhance the
capacity of existing roadways through better operations. These techniques help improve traffic
flow, air quality and movement of vehicles and goods, as well as enhance system accessibility
and safety. TSM strategies are low-cost and effective, and typically include: intersection and
signal improvements; data collection to monitor system performance; and/or special events
management strategies.
TRANSPORTATION DEMAND
MANAGEMENT (TDM)
TDM seeks to reduce travel demand (specifically that of single-occupancy car) by encouraging
other modes of travel through requirements and/or incentives. TDM strategies typically include:
commute trip reduction programs; parking policies; and/or incentives to take transit or other
modes of transportation.

CHAPTER 5: MOBILITY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
LOOKING FORWARD
Maintaining Cupertino’s great quality of life – including convenient access, clean
air, and reduced traffic – requires careful management of growth. The City will
identify ways to locate appropriate land uses along major mixed-use corridors,
improving overall access and connectivity, enhancing the attractiveness of non-
vehicular transportation modes, and reducing demand on the roadway network.
The following are ways the City will address key challenges and opportunities
facing Cupertino:
 1       BETTER LINKAGES BETWEEN LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION.
         How we use our land directly impacts our transportation facilities,
         modes of travel and vice versa. A primary cornerstone of Community
         Vision 2040 is to focus growth on major mixed-use corridors; support
         alternate modes of transportation including walking, biking and transit;
         and encourage a mix of compatible and complementary uses on key
         sites. These strategies will allow the City to manage growth with reduced
         traffic, air quality and greenhouse gas impacts.
 2       IMPROVED REGIONAL COORDINATION.
         The City should continue to participate in regional projects and
         infrastructure planning to ensure consistency with local planning, and
         pursue funding for City transportation projects.
 3       ENHANCED CONNECTIVITY.
         A key objective of the City is to improve connections through streetscape
         and pathway improvements to ensure that the community enjoys
         easy walking and biking access to services including parks, schools
         and shopping. Other strategies seek to supplement existing modes of
         transportation such as community shuttles through partnerships and
         agreements and providing links between key transportation nodes.
 4       REDUCED DEMAND.
         The strategies in this Element seek to reduce demand on the City’s
         roadway infrastructure through careful land use planning, encourage
         alternative modes of transportation and utilize best practices in
         Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and Transportation Systems
         Management (TSM).

                       Regional transportation and land use decisions affect the operation of the
                       transportation network in Cupertino. A key consideration of the General Plan is for
                       the City to participate in regional planning initiatives in order to coordinate local
                       improvements with regional initiatives, advocate for Cupertino’s needs, and take
                       advantage of programs that can support Cupertino’s transportation infrastructure.

CONTEXT
CLIMATE CHANGE
In 2006, the California Legislature and Governor took significant steps to address
climate change concerns with the passage of the Global Warming Solutions Act
(AB 32). The law set a target to reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions to
1990 levels by year 2020. In addition, the Governor also signed Executive Order
S-3-05 that required California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 80
percent below the 1990 levels by year 2050.
Many initiatives at the State, regional and local levels are being implemented to
help achieve these goals. These include:
•	 The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (SB
    375) supports the State’s climate action goals to reduce GHG emissions
    through coordinated transportation and land use planning. Each of
    California’s Metropolitan Planning Organizations must prepare a
    Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) as an integral part of its Regional
    Transportation Plan (RTP) to achieve these targets. For the nine-county Bay
    Area, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and the Metropolitan
    Transportation Commission (MTC) have prepared the One Bay Area Plan as
    its SCS. This plan contains land use, housing and transportation strategies
    that allow the region to meet its GHG reduction targets.
•	 The One Bay Area Grant (OBAG) program, which implements transportation
    funding in coordination with the strategies in the One Bay Area Plan.
•	 The City is in the process of completing its Climate Action Plan (CAP), which
    aims to address GHG reductions per the targets set in AB 32 and S-3-05. The
    CAP is based on 2040 growth projections for Cupertino. It aims to capture the
    shortfall projected from State initiatives by identifying policies and strategies
    to reduce GHG at a municipal and community-wide level.
                                                                                        ES-3

AIR QUALITY
Clean air is a basic need for human and environmental health. Air pollution
comes from both mobile sources (e.g., cars, trucks, airplanes) and stationary
sources (e.g., agricultural and industrial uses). Air quality standards are
established by both the State Air Resources Board and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) has
the responsibility to create strategies and monitor the targets set by State and
Federal standards for the Bay Area. Due to air quality planning efforts, regional
air quality has improved significantly over the past several decades, even though
the population, traffic and industrialization have increased.
BAAQMD’s 2010 Clean Air Plan works in tandem with the One Bay Area Plan
and identifies strategies to address four categories of pollutants including
ground-level ozone, particulate matter, air toxics and GHG. The City’s CAP aims
to capture the shortfall projected from State initiatives to reduce GHG at a
municipal and community-wide level. While standards are a key component
in improving air quality, the City’s approach towards land use, mobility,
infrastructure and operations can have a huge impact.
ENERGY
Energy consumption in the United States and in Cupertino is mainly fossil-
fuel based (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas, etc.). The continuously rising cost of
energy production, together with diminishing non-renewable fossil fuels, has
necessitated a change towards reduction and efficient use of fossil fuels, and
identifying and increasing the use of alternative, renewable energy sources.
Energy providers are also looking to move their portfolio towards alternative
energy sources including wind turbine, nuclear and solar generation. The
diminishing cost of installing smaller solar power generation systems is
encouraging the increased use of such facilities by consumers. Additionally,
strides in automobile technology utilizing electric batteries and improvements
to the network of charging stations allows users confidence in the use of electric
cars. Finally, rising energy costs and Federal and State standards on energy
usage are encouraging more people to replace existing appliances and other
equipment with more energy efficient equipment.

Cupertino has continued to express its commitment to conserving energy by
improving municipal operations in order to reduce energy use (e.g., retrofitting
or replacing street equipment, vehicles and facilities), and providing resources
and information to professionals, residents, businesses and schools to achieve
energy and associated cost savings.
BUILDINGS
The 2010 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory for Cupertino indicates that
buildings account for about 55 percent of GHG emissions in the city. This means
that State and local efforts towards energy conservation in buildings can
significantly affect the community’s air quality. While green building strategies
can effectively target GHG, they also improve the health of occupants, preserve
habitat and natural landscapes, reduce water pollution and conserve other
natural resources. State and local efforts to encourage green buildings include
the following:
•	 The State routinely updates building code standards to include new energy
    conservation and green building concepts. The 2013 CalGreen Building
    Code outlines mandatory and voluntary measures to encourage sustainable
    practices in all aspects of construction such as planning and design; energy
    and water efficiency and conservation; material conservation; resource
    efficiency; and environmental quality.
•	 Cupertino has adopted a Green Building Ordinance that ensures that new
    buildings and renovations exceed the sustainability and ecological standards
    set by the State.
NATURAL RESOURCES
BIODIVERSITY
Biodiversity refers to the diversity, or variety, of plants and animals in a
particular ecosystem, area or region. Cupertino’s commitment to sustainability
includes sustaining the diversity of species in each ecosystem as we plan for
human activities that affect the use of land and natural resources. Cupertino’s
ecosystem ranges from the urban environment in the flatlands to semi-rural
and rural environment in the western foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains.
                                                                                       ES-5

CHAPTER 6: ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES AND SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT
general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
The City has always recognized the importance of sustaining biodiversity in the
foothills and along riparian corridors. However, a commitment to sustainability
will require a different way of thinking about the urban ecosystem. The City has
already preserved an 18-acre site and restored creek habitat right in the city
to maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity of our local natural systems.
The City is now looking at opportunities in the built and natural environment to
sustain and enhance biodiversity.
URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
While an urban environment can be stressful for some species due to pollution
and habitat fragmentation, others may thrive in this environment because
humans create favorable microhabitats or abundant resources for them.
Modified habitats including greenhouses, basements, compost piles and green
roofs can help certain plant and animal species thrive better than in natural
environments. As Cupertino continues to change and grow, the City is committed
to enhancing the urban ecosystem in the form of urban forestry management,
integration of green infrastructure, treatment of parks and open space,
landscape and building requirements.
RURAL ECOSYSTEMS
Cupertino’s rural plant and animal resources are located in the relatively
undeveloped western foothills and mountains, near the Rancho San Antonio
Open Space Preserve and along Stevens Creek. Each ecosystem of vegetation
provides food and shelter to support a variety of wildlife. The diversity of plant
and animal life supported in different ecosystems is identified in Table ES-1 and
Figure ES-1.

MINERAL RESOURCES
The State of California, recognizing the value of preserving mineral deposits to
achieve a more sustainable future, enacted the Surface Mining and Reclamation
Act (SMARA) in 1975. The objective of SMARA is to assist local governments in
conserving mineral deposits for future use.
There are several mineral resource areas located both in Cupertino’s sphere of
influence and within the city limit. These mineral resource areas are shown in
Figure ES-2. The figure identifies natural resource areas that will be conserved
for future extraction, which are outside of the city limits.
Two quarries within the city’s sphere of influence, Hanson Permanente and
Stevens Creek, have been designated by the State as having mineral deposits of
regional or state significance. These quarries are located in the unincorporated
area outside city limits, and therefore, Santa Clara County has regulatory
jurisdiction. The County’s mineral resource policies are directed toward
preserving existing resource areas and, where feasible, designating new areas
and expanding existing sites.
The McDonald-Dorsa quarry, which used to operate south of the Deep Cliff Golf
Course and Linda Vista Park, was closed in the 1970s and is not a current source
of minerals. The site has since been designated as residential, while the portion
that is now Linda Vista Park is designated for parks and open space. However,
since it was closed prior to SMARA, redevelopment in the area should address
soils stabilization and reclamation issues.

WATER
Cupertino’s sustainable future is, in part, dependent upon the supply and use of
water as well as the effective management of natural watershed resources. In
recent years, water resource management has moved away from supply side
efforts (e.g., creation of dams and reservoirs) to managing how water is used.
In particular, this includes emphasizing conservation, stormwater treatment
and efficiency in infrastructure planning, design and construction of buildings,
and land use planning. The following is a list of existing State, regional and local
efforts towards water conservation.
•	 The Santa Clara Valley Water District is the groundwater management
    agency in Santa Clara County. The Santa Clara Valley Groundwater sub-basin
    provides approximately half of the total county water demands. The District
    works to maximize water supply, protect the basins from contamination and
    ensure that groundwater supply is sustained.
•	 The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
    implements the Clean Water Act for the Bay Area region including the
    National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Municipal Storm
    Water permit which regulates both point source and non-point source
    pollutants to improve ground water resources and reduce pollution in the
    bay. This program is discussed in detail in the Infrastructure Element.
•	 Senate Bill X7-7 was enacted in November 2009, requiring all water
    suppliers to increase water use efficiency and sets a goal of reducing per
    capita urban water use by 20 percent by 2020. The bill includes a short-term
    target of a 10 percent reduction in per capita urban water use by 2015.
•	 The City of Cupertino has adopted a Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance and
    Green Building Ordinance to ensure that the city can meet State and regional
    targets.
                                                                                       ES-11

CHAPTER 6: ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES AND SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT
general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
LOOKING FORWARD
Future growth and change in Cupertino provides both a challenge and an
opportunity for the City and community. Cupertino is blessed with an abundance
of natural and urban ecosystems. In the past, the City has relied on a limited
toolkit of policies to ensure that growth and development do not negatively impact
natural resources. Great strides have been made in the last decade to promote
sustainability, and community support for these initiatives has been growing.
In response, the City has created a suite of services and policies, to ensure our
community’s growth and achievement of its development potential enhances, not
hinders, natural resources and bolsters, not impacts, human health. The City now
has a much larger array of resources to manage growth, including sustainability
practices, new planning and development tools, and performance measures to
maintain or enhance natural resources and overall environmental health.
	
	1       REGIONAL COOPERATION.
         Federal, State and regional agencies have been at the forefront of
         legislation related to sustainability and environmental health. The City
         should strive to exceed these requirements in areas that are of priority
         to the community and strengthen regional partnerships to bring in
         resources for implementing new policies and programs.
  2
	ECOSYSTEMS.
         In recent years, cities have begun to realize that urban and suburban
         areas can provide habitat for many plant and animal species. The
         City will focus policies on a citywide approach (urban and natural
         environments) towards sustaining and improving urban and suburban
         ecosystems.
	3       SUSTAINABILITY BEST PRACTICES.
         The City will use sustainability principles, striving always to balance
         social equity with economic and environmental health, when
         evaluating all aspects of new development; mobility and infrastructure
         improvements; building design and operation; streetscapes and

CONTEXT
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Emergencies can severely impact the health of a community and a city or
agency’s ability to provide needed services. Emergencies can include natural
disasters such as earthquakes, floods and forest fires, or others events such as
infrastructure disruptions, security incidents or hazardous spills. Emergency
preparedness includes activities that are undertaken before an emergency
occurs so there is an effective and coordinated response.
Emergency preparedness requires the integration of the following elements
into each of the City’s functions: emergency planning, coordination, mitigation,
training and public education. The City, its contributing agencies, and the
community are partners in ensuring that emergency planning is effectively
implemented.
CUPERTINO EMERGENCY PLAN
State law requires cities to prepare an emergency plan in order to effectively
respond to natural or human-caused disasters that threaten lives, the
natural environment or property. The Cupertino Emergency Plan establishes
an organizational framework to enable the City to manage its emergency
response activities and to coordinate with County, State and Federal agencies.
The Emergency Plan was prepared in accordance with the National Incident
Management System (NIMS) and is used in conjunction with the State
Emergency Plan, the Santa Clara Operational Disaster Response and Recovery
Area Interim Agreement, Santa Clara County Emergency Plan, as well as plans
and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of contract agencies and special
districts. Support personnel such as City staff, special districts and volunteer
groups are trained to perform specific functions in the Emergency Operations
Center. The plan is reviewed annually and tested through periodic emergency
disaster drills.
                                                                                         HS-3

CHAPTER 7: HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER
The City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is located on the first floor of City
Hall, with an alternative location in the Service Center on Mary Avenue. The EOC
has the ability to be fully functional within 30 minutes of activation. Capabilities
include emergency backup power, computer network and internet access,
and telephone and radio communications to City and County sites. While the
staffing and duties are actively managed through the Emergency Plan, there
may be additional physical and seismic improvements required to City Hall
to ensure that it can continue to meet the requirements of an EOC. Additional
communication support is provided by volunteers from Cupertino Amateur
Radio Emergency Service (CARES). CARES volunteers coordinate extensive
citywide communications capabilities, including helping to connect neighbors,
public safety officials, special districts, City and County Departments.
DISASTER SERVICE WORKERS
During emergencies, all City employees are designated Disaster Service
Workers under Section 3100 of the California Government Code. They are
required to remain at work as long as they are needed, and receive specific
training in personal and home preparedness, First Aid, CPR, NIMS and
Terrorism Awareness.
Volunteer groups also play an important role in the City’s Emergency Plan.
The City is part of a countywide volunteer services plan and is working with
the Emergency Volunteer Center, Blockleaders, and Neighborhood Watch
to develop a plan for coordinating and deploying volunteers. Citizen Corps
members (CARES, CERT and MRC) continue to receive appropriate training and
equipment to rapidly respond throughout the City and augment professional
first responders. Unregistered and untrained volunteers may be utilized and
trained, as needed during a disaster.

FIRE SAFETY
Fire fighting and emergency medical services are provided to the City by the
Santa Clara County Fire Department (SCCFD). SCCFD is a full service department
that provides similar services to seven other West Valley cities and adjacent
county areas. Mutual aid agreements with the neighboring jurisdictions augment
SCCFD’s fire response capabilities. In addition to fire protection, SCCFD also
conducts fire prevention inspections and educational programs, including those
on Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training, cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) and first aid certification.
Due to Cupertino’s geographical location, it is exposed to hazards from both
wildland and urban fires. There are approximately 16 square miles of hillsides
included in and around the boundary of the city. In 2009, based on vegetation
data, topography and potential fire behavior, the California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) identified approximately three acres of the
City to be in the High and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. The City adopted
this area as its Wildand-Urban Interface Fire Area (WUIFA). Properties in the
WUIFA are subject to building and property maintenance standards intended to
prevent and manage community safety due to brush and forest fires (Figure
HS-1). Planning for such areas also requires attention to the availability of
access roads and water for firefighting and evacuation efforts.
Santa Clara County lists the Montebello Road/Stevens Canyon area as the fourth
highest risk in the county. The road linking Montebello and the Palo Alto Sphere
of Influence to the bottom of Stevens Canyon has been improved to acceptable
standards for a fire access road. A fire trail extends from Skyline Boulevard on
Charcoal Road to Stevens Canyon. The City requires that all emergency roads
be constructed with an all weather surface. It also requires a private emergency
access connection between public streets within Lindy Canyon and Regnart
Canyon areas. Presently, there are no water systems serving the Montebello
Road and upper Stevens Canyon area, with the exception of Stevens Creek itself.
Because there is no water service to these areas, the County requires homes to
provide individual water tanks and fire sprinkler systems (Figure HS-2).
                                                                                         HS-5

CHAPTER 7: HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
The urbanized portions of Cupertino are not exposed to a high risk of fire.
The City is served by a well-managed fire protection service as well as a fire
prevention program. Buildings in the City are relatively new and there is a
strong code enforcement program, an adequate water supply and a well-
maintained delivery system. State, regional and local standards also ensure that
new buildings and facilities adequately address issues of fire safety, access,
evacuation and fire-fighting requirements.
Response time is one metric for measuring level of service for fighting fire
and emergency services. It is the policy of SCCFD to respond to 90 percent
of emergency calls not requiring a paramedic in under seven minutes. For
situations where emergency medical services are required, it is the policy that
paramedics arrive in less than seven minutes at least 90 percent of the time.
An increase in calls for fire service and traffic congestion may affect SCCFD’s
critical response time, and the District may need to adjust or expand staff, and
equipment in areas of high service demand in the future. Figure HS-3 shows the
location of fire stations and their service areas in Cupertino.
STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS
The City regulates building construction and site planning through the Uniform
Fire Code and the California Building Code. The City and the SCCFD inspect
commercial and industrial buildings for compliance with the applicable codes.
In addition, the County Fire Marshal and the Fire Department regulate activities,
including weed abatement and brush clearance, in the Wildland Urban Interface
Fire Area (WUFIA).
PUBLIC SAFETY
The City, and a number of surrounding jurisdictions, contracts with the Santa
Clara County Sheriff’s Office, West Valley Division, for law enforcement services.
Law enforcement services include police patrols, criminal investigations, traffic
enforcement, accident investigation and tactical teams. The City’s commitment to
public safety encompasses two broad areas of responsibilities: (1) provide public
safety services and the planning necessary for the prevention of crime; and (2)
plan for a safe environment in which the public is not exposed to unnecessary
risks to life and property.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous materials are a part of our everyday life in the form of batteries,
light bulbs, and household chemicals such as pesticides, motor oil, cleaners
and paints. They are also used in many commercial and industrial operations.
The use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including management
of contaminated soils and groundwater, is regulated by Federal, State and
local laws. The City has adopted a Hazardous Materials Storage Ordinance that
regulates the storage of these materials in solid and liquid form. The City’s
Regulation of Facilities Where Materials Which Are Or May Become Toxic Gases
Are Found Ordinance regulates the storage of hazardous materials in gaseous
form. Figure HS-4 identifies potential sites within the city that may contain
hazardous materials.
Since 1990, State law has required that hazardous waste be properly disposed
of in approved hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities. To accomplish
this, new treatment methods and facilities have been developed and approved
to pre-treat hazardous waste before its final disposal. Under authority of the
1986 “Tanner” Bill (AB 2948), Cupertino, along with 13 other cities, joined the
County to develop a comprehensive and coordinated planning approach to
hazardous waste disposal. In 1990, a countywide Household Hazardous Waste
(HHW) Program was created. In order to supplement the County HHW Program
and make the collection of HHW more convenient for residents, the City currently
provides a door-to-door hazardous waste retrieval service through its solid
waste franchise agreement.
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
Electromagnetic fields are a physical field produced by electrically charged
objects, such has high transmission power lines. The potential health effects
of the very low frequency EMFs surrounding power lines and electrical devices
are the subject of on-going research and a significant amount of public debate.
The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has issued
some cautionary advisories but stresses that the data is currently too limited
to draw good conclusions. Currently, electromagnetic fields from transmission
lines, electrical and wireless facilities, and appliances are heavily regulated
through Federal and State requirements.

GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
Cupertino is located in the seismically active San Francisco Bay region, which
has several active seismic faults. The San Andreas fault, one of the longest
and most active faults in the world, is located west of Cupertino. Two additional
faults closely associated with the San Andreas fault, the Sargent-Berrocal and
Monta Vista-Shannon fault systems, also cross the western portion of the city.
Movement on the San Andreas fault is predominantly right-lateral strike-slip,
where the earth ruptures in a horizontal fashion, with the opposite sides of the
fault moving to the right with respect to each other. Movement on the Sargent-
Berrocal and Monta Vista-Shannon faults is more variable in style. Both of these
faults are characterized by “thrust” faulting, where a significant amount of
vertical “up-down” (so called dip-slip) displacement occurs on an inclined plane,
and one side of the fault is elevated (i.e., thrust over) the other side.
Primary geologic hazards in Cupertino are related to landslides and seismic
impacts. Seismically induced ground shaking, surface fault rupture, and various
forms of earthquake-triggered ground failure are anticipated within the city
during large earthquakes. These geologic hazards present potential impacts to
property and public safety. Tables HS-1 through HS-4 briefly explain seismic
hazards, magnitude and occurrence, acceptable exposure rise, and technical
investigations required based on acceptable risk. Figure HS-5 identifies the
areas in Cupertino susceptible to the greatest risk. Also see Technical Appendix
E for additional information on geologic and seismic hazards and risks.
Following the 1983 Coalinga and 1994 Northridge earthquakes, scientists
became increasingly aware of earthquakes generated by faults not previously
observed at the earth’s surface. These types of faults are called “blind faults,”
and represent a type of thrust fault that does not rupture completely to the
surface. It is possible that one or more “blind faults” are present in the Monta

FLOOD HAZARDS
The City participates in the Community Rating System (CRS) program which
is a voluntary incentive program that recognizes and encourages community
floodplain management activities that exceed minimum NFIP requirements.
Flood insurance premium rates for property owners within the city may be
discounted to reflect the reduced flood risk resulting from community actions
meeting the three goals of the CRS, which are to: (1) reduce flood damage to
insurable property; (2) strengthen and support the insurance aspects of the
NFIP; and (3) encourage a comprehensive approach to floodplain management.
Floods are surface hydrological hazards that can have a significant, and
sometimes, long lasting effect on a community. Floods can originate from
various sources including heavy rainstorms, landslides and/or dam failure.
Sediment deposits also increase flood risks because they clog the drainage
system and may induce upstream flooding.
Rain related floods are the most common type of floods, and usually occur
during periods of extended heavy rainfall. The largest body of water within the
area is the Stevens Creek Reservoir. Stevens Creek Dam meets current dam
safety standards and the probability of its failure is minimal (Figure HS-6).
The watersheds in the Santa Cruz Mountain Range feed into four major
streambeds that traverse the City: Permanente Creek, Stevens Creek, Regnart
Creek, and Calabazas Creek (Figure HS-7). Stevens Creek and its streamside
are among the natural elements that have the most influence on Cupertino’s
character. These creeks collect surface runoff and channel it to the Bay.
However, they also pose potential flooding risks if water levels exceed the top of
bank as a result of heavy runoff.
The City and the Santa Clara Valley Water District are actively involved in
programs to minimize the risk of flooding. The City developed an approach to
land use for the non-urbanized flood plain of Stevens Creek south of Stevens
Creek Boulevard in the Land Use Element. This ensures the preservation of
the 100-year flood plain and the protection of the riparian corridor along this
portion of Stevens Creek. The City and the Water District also developed a flood
management program for the flood plain of Stevens Creek between Interstate
280 and Stevens Creek Boulevard while preserving the natural environment of
Stevens Creek. Structural improvements, while not preferred, may be necessary,
to protect properties from a 100-year flood.

CHAPTER 7: HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
NOISE
The noise environment is an accumulation of many different sources, ranging
from human voices to major sources such as freeway traffic. The degree to
which noise becomes an annoyance depends on a variety of factors including
noise level, time of day, background sounds, and surrounding land use.
COMMUNITY NOISE FUNDAMENTALS
The three elements of community noise are noise level, noise spectrum, and
variation in noise level with time. Noise level is measured in decibels (dB). Noise
is composed of various frequencies within a noise spectrum that define the
character of the noise. Since human hearing is more sensitive to the higher
speech frequencies, the A-weighted frequency network is applied, in accordance
with national and international standards, to adjust the measured noise level to
more closely relate to human perception of loudness.
Noise environments have different characteristics that vary with duration
and time of day; for instance a freeway may emit a fairly constant noise
level for long periods while an airport may emit many short-term high level
noise events punctuated by extended periods of quiet. To provide a standard
measure for community noise exposure that takes into account the time-varying
characteristics, the State of California adopted the Community Noise Equivalent
Level (CNEL) as the standard metric. The CNEL is a 24-hour energy average
metric that penalizes evening and nighttime noise, and provides a uniform
measure for time-varying noise environments.
HS-20
           CHAPTER 7: HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
NOISE ENVIRONMENT
The noise environment can generally be divided into two categories:
transportation-related and non-transportation related noise. Traffic noise is the
greatest contributor to noise pollution in Cupertino and one of the most difficult
to control through local effort. Two major freeways (Interstate 280 and Highway
85) and four major corridors (Stevens Creek Boulevard, De Anza Boulevard,
Homestead Road, and Foothill Boulevard ) cross Cupertino. These roadways
are utilized not only by local residents and employees, but also by commuters
to destinations beyond Cupertino. Heavy-duty trucking operations to and from
the Hanson Permanente Cement Plant and Stevens Creek Quarry located in the
western foothills near Stevens Creek Boulevard and Foothill Boulevard are also
a significant transportation-related noise contributor.
Cupertino receives some aircraft noise from facilities within the region including
San Jose International Airport, Moffett Federal Airfield and Palo Alto Airport;
however, the Cupertino city limit does not fall within the identified noise contours
of any airport. One railroad line passes through the Monta Vista neighborhood
and connects with the Hanson Permanente Cement Plant. This freight railway
operates at very low frequencies, with approximately three train trips in each
direction per week, usually during the daytime or early evening.
Non-transportation noise varies from stationary equipment (e.g., air conditioning
units) to construction activity. Regulation to minimize excessive noise from non-
transportation sources includes compliance with the City’s noise standards that
limit certain noise-generating activity during evening and early morning, when
ambient noise levels tend to be lower. Advancements in technology to muffle
sound also reduce noise from construction equipment and stationary equipment
such as compressors and generators.
                                                                                       HS-21

CHAPTER 7: HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
The Cupertino Municipal Code, Title 10, outlines the maximum noise levels on
receiving properties based upon land use types (Figure HS-8). Land use deci-
sions and the development review process play a large role in minimizing noise
impacts on sensitive land uses. Noise compatibility may be achieved by avoiding
the location of conflicting land uses adjacent to one another and incorporating
buffers and noise control techniques including setbacks, landscaping, building
transitions, site design, and building construction techniques. Selection of the
appropriate noise control technique will vary depending on the level of noise that
needs to be reduced as well as the location and intended land use.

CHAPTER 7: HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
LOOKING FORWARD
As Cupertino’s resident and employee population grows, the City must identify
ways to ensure public safety and support the community’s high quality of life.
Innovative site design and construction techniques are needed to reduce noise
in developments near major corridors and where uses are mixed to ensure
compatibility. Fire protection and public safety should be enhanced in a manner
that provides a high quality of service while continuing to be fiscally responsible.
The following are ways the City will address key challenges and opportunities
facing Cupertino:
 1       NOISE.
         As State, regional and local policies encourage mixed-use development
         near corridors, the City should look to ways to reduce noise impacts
         on residences near and in such developments through site design,
         landscaping and construction techniques. Additionally, the City should
         review locations and site design for sensitive uses including schools,
         childcare facilities and hospitals to ensure that they are not negatively
         impacted by noise.
 2       PROJECT DESIGN AND OPERATIONS.
         Measures such as project and building design, emergency access,
         operations and maintenance of property, can help developments promote
         public and fire safety. Such measures will also allow the providers to
         maintain a high service level, while accommodating future growth.
 3       COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION.
         The City and service providers should enhance community participation
         through new and existing programs such as neighborhood watch,
         emergency preparedness and school programs.
 4       SHARED RESOURCES.
         The City can enhance emergency, fire safety and public safety services
         by coordinating programs with service providers and neighboring cities
         through shared services, mutual aid and agreements.

CONTEXT
The City regularly prepares a Five-Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) to
identify capital projects and options for financing them. It is the City’s primary
mechanism for building and maintaining citywide infrastructure such as
streets, medians and stormwater systems, and City-owned facilities, parks,
trails and bridges.
Much of the City’s infrastructure was built between the 1950s and 1970s when
it was first incorporated and developed. Other areas that were later annexed
into the city typically have older and/or outdated infrastructure. Planning for
replacement and upgrades to these facilities will be important to ensure that
all residents and businesses have access to excellent services. Identifying
sustainable funding sources is also important to ensure that infrastructure
improvements can be built in a timely manner and effectively maintained to
meet community needs. The following is a summary of key infrastructure
systems that currently exist in Cupertino.
WATER
Cupertino has two major water suppliers: the California Water Company and
the San Jose Water Company. Both retailers purchase their water supply from
the Santa Clara Valley Water District, which receives water from the Rinconada
Treatment Plant and wells fed by groundwater.
The Santa Clara Valley Water District, which is the groundwater management
agency in Santa Clara County, manages groundwater recharge through
percolation ponds and in-stream recharge of creeks. The McClellan Pond
recharge facility (located in Cupertino) and the Stevens Creek Reservoir
(located outside the city on its southwest boundary) also contribute to
Cupertino’s water supply.
In addition to the potable water supply, there is a potential recycled water
system planned for the North Vallco Park Special Area as part of the Apple
Campus 2. The City anticipates that recycled water will be used for groundwater
recharge, irrigation, and will help to offset potable water use in areas served.
The recycled water system can be potentially extended to serve other areas of
the city in the future as capacity and demand increases and new distribution
lines can be built.
                                                                                      INF-3

CHAPTER 8: INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015-2040)
WASTEWATER
Wastewater collection and treatment are provided to the City by the Cupertino
Sanitary District and the City of Sunnyvale. The majority of the City is served by
the Cupertino Sanitary District, while the City of Sunnyvale serves only a small
portion of the Cupertino Urban Service area within the Rancho Rinconada area.
The Cupertino Sanitary District was formed in 1956 and is currently in the
process of updating its 1964 Master Plan. The District collects and transports
waste water collected in Cupertino to the San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution
Control Plant located in North San Jose. The District maintains approximately
one million linear feet of sewer lines and 500,000 linear feet of sewer laterals
and 17 pump stations. While the physical condition of the infrastructure appears
to be in relatively good condition, there are issues with the carrying capacity of
a number of lines in the system. The lines serving the City Center development,
Stevens Creek Boulevard between Randy Lane and Wolfe Road, Wolfe Road
south of Interstate 280, Stelling Road and Foothill Boulevard are running either
at capacity or over capacity. In order to accommodate future development, lines
would have to be upgraded. Any necessary improvements are expected to be
coordinated with development review, with new projects bearing their share of
the cost or partnering with the Sanitary District to provide improvements needed
to increase capacity.
The City of Sunnyvale provides wastewater treatment service for Cupertino’s
commercial properties along Stevens Creek Boulevard, east of Finch Avenue,
and a portion of the Rancho Rinconada neighborhood. While the City of
Sunnyvale has adequate capacity to serve anticipated growth and can continue
to provide treatment capacity for future growth in its Cupertino service area,
there may need to be improvements to the distribution network to address
future growth on the east side. Any necessary improvements are expected to
be coordinated with development review, with new projects bearing their share
of the cost or partnering with the City of Sunnyvale to provide improvements
needed to increase capacity.

              CHAPTER 8: INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015-2040)
STORMWATER
Comprehensive stormwater management can reduce pollution and erosion,
prevent flooding, recharge aquifers with clean water, and prevent Bay pollution.
While efforts in early years focused on expanding storm drain capacity and
wastewater treatment, the approach today is to reduce and filter runoff through
project design and management.
Cupertino’s storm drain system currently operates adequately, with some
targeted upgrades or improvements likely over the next 25 years. There is only
localized flooding in the storm drain system, limited primarily to unimproved
streets. The City continues to update its infrastructure planning to ensure that
future improvements include best practices for stormwater management.
The City, along with 76 other agencies throughout the Bay Area, is regulated by
the Municipal Regional Stormwater National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System Permit (MRP). The MRP, which is issued by the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board, requires the City to carry out a comprehensive stormwater
pollution prevention program. In order to comply with these requirements,
the City joined with 15 other adjoining agencies to form the Santa Clara Valley
Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program (SCVURPP). SCVURPP works with
the participating agencies and the Regional Board to develop solutions to control
urban runoff quality. In addition, the City is required to prepare a city-specific
Urban Runoff Management Plan. This plan identifies stormwater pollution
control measures such as design, construction and operation best practices,
inspections and water-quality monitoring. The regulations are expected to evolve
and become more stringent in the future.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Cupertino is located in Silicon Valley, which is home to the world’s greatest
technology companies, and is known for its forward-thinking and innovation. In
order to ensure that the City can continue being an exceptional place to work and
live, efforts will be made to expand access to telecommunications services. The
City does not directly supply telecommunications utilities; however, it plays an
important role by coordinating with providers, allowing access to public rights-
of-way, and ensuring that proposed improvements or changes in service meet
community expectations and are integrated in a compatible manner.
                                                                                      INF-5

CHAPTER 8: INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015-2040)
SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING
Nearly every human activity leaves behind some kind of waste. Households
create ordinary garbage while industrial and manufacturing processes create
solid and hazardous waste. Waste uses up limited landfill space, releases toxins
and creates greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The City uses
recycling, reuse and reducing consumption as an effective way to manage solid
waste.
The Air Resources Board, as a means to implement AB 32, identifies in its
Scoping Plan mandatory commercial recycling as one of the measures to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Subsequently, AB 341 sets a goal of 75
percent residential and commercial recycling by 2020. Recology currently
provides garbage pickup and recycling services in Cupertino. City residents
and businesses served by Recology have achieved a 69 percent diversion rate
in 2012. The City is currently working with Recology to develop programs to
boost that diversion rate even higher, reduce contamination, and boost organics
composting by residents and businesses. With the proposed changes, the City
hopes to achieve the 75 percent diversion rate by 2015.
To meet its future solid waste disposal needs, the City also executed a contract
with Browning and Ferris to provide landfill capacity at Newby Island in Milpitas.
The term of the agreement is 35 years and ends in 2023, or at the time the
specified tonnage in the contract is reached.

LOOKING FORWARD
As the City continues to grow and develop, it will have to look at strategies for
replacing and expanding the City’s aging infrastructure to meet community needs.
Whereas strategies in the past focused on expansion of facilities, the focus in
the future will be looking for ways to reduce demand on infrastructure through
sustainable measures and balancing modes of transportation. A key strategy
moving forward will be finding new ways to fund infrastructure improvements and
ongoing maintenance through new development, partnerships or other methods.
The following are ways the City will address key challenges and opportunities
facing Cupertino:
	1      SUSTAINABLE METHODS.
        The City will reduce the demand on infrastructure and services by
        exploring ways to expand water and energy conservation and waste
        diversion efforts.
	ACCESS.
 2
        The City will ensure that the entire community has access to all services.
        This will include identifying areas where access is not available and
        looking for strategies to retrofit and partner in the construction of
        necessary improvements.
	3      ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.
        The City will prioritize methods that improve environmental and
        community health when exploring strategies to reduce demand and
        construct facilities.
	4      NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
        The City will utilize technology to deliver services efficiently and
        effectively. This includes supporting emerging technologies in
        information services and infrastructure to better serve the business and
        resident community.
	COORDINATION.
 5
        The City will work with service providers to ensure that their
        infrastructure planning and maintenance goals meet community needs.
                                                                                      INF-7

CHAPTER 8: INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT | general plan (community vision 2015-2040)
	6       COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT.
         The City will enlist the community in programs to achieve goals including
         recycling and conservation programs.
	FUNDING.
 7
         The City will ensure a sustainable source of funding for construction,
         operation and maintenance of infrastructure.

                                            time, the city’s parks and recreation programs will have to adapt to meet
                                            changing needs. This Element ensures that the City will continue to provide
                                            high-quality parks and recreation programs, improve the distribution and
                                            access to these facilities, work with other community service providers, and
                                            protect open space.

SANTA CLARA COUNTY PARKS
The Santa Clara County park program was a voter-approved measure to acquire
and develop a regional park system. County parks adjacent to Cupertino are
located near the southwestern boundary of the city. The County Park plan
emphasizes completing Upper Stevens Creek Park and its connection to Stevens
Creek near Cupertino. Because the upper portions of Stevens Canyon are
environmentally important, the County Parks and Recreation Department has
made a commitment to purchase lands to connect these two parks. In 1997,
as part of the development of a portion of the San Jose Diocese’s St. Joseph’s
Seminary property, the County was able to acquire 133 acres of open space to
add to its original holdings in the Rancho San Antonio County Park (which is now
managed by the Mid-Peninsula Open Space District).
SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT OPEN SPACE AREAS
Trails along creeks owned and managed by the Santa Clara Valley Water District
supplement Cupertino’s overall open space and park system. The District helped
with the acquisition of open space lands within McClellan Ranch Park. The
District works with cities and the county to provide access to creekside trails and
parks for recreational opportunities.
CITY COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS
The City has an excellent system of community and neighborhood parks that
provide a place for community gathering, recreation and healthy programs. All
existing parks and open space areas are shown in Figure RPC-3 and listed in
Table RPC-1.
Community parks include Memorial Park and the Stevens Creek corridor area.
Memorial Park is an urban park and facility venue for festivals located in the
Heart of the City Special Area. The Sports Center, located at the intersection of
Stevens Creek Boulevard and Stelling Road, provides a gym and tennis facilities.
The Sports Center also has a small facility where teens can gather and play
indoor sports. A Senior Center is located at the intersection of Stevens Creek
Boulevard and Mary Avenue, which runs programs for seniors in Cupertino. The
Quinlan Community Center, located on Stelling Road, runs the bulk of the art,
dance, music and other community programs. All of these facilities are located
around Memorial Park.

CHAPTER 9: RECREATION, PARKS AND COMMUNITY SERVICES ELEMENT
general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
The Civic Center complex, located in the central part of the city, provides an
additional community venue for gathering and programs. It consists of City Hall,
Community Hall and Library Field, which offers indoor and outdoor venues for
meetings, functions and outdoor recreation. The Cupertino Library, a facility
owned by the City but operated by the County Library District, is also located in
the Civic Center complex.
The Stevens Creek Corridor, located in the Monta Vista Planning Area, has a
natural environment with trails, swimming facilities, group picnic areas, historic
orchard (Stocklmeir), historic ranch (McClellan Ranch), a nine-hole golf course
(Blackberry Farm Golf Course) and related support facilities. Blackberry Farm
Recreational area’s swimming facilities, recreation programs and reserved
picnic areas are only available in the summer, although access to the Stevens
Creek Corridor trails is available year round. The City is in the process of
preparing a Stevens Creek Corridor Master Plan to review the design and
planning of facilities and programs throughout the Stevens Creek corridor. City
objectives for the plan include accommodating year-around use of the facilities
in the corridor; reviewing and revising the plans for the golf course, McClellan
Ranch, Stocklmeir, McClellan Ranch West (Simms) and Blesch properties;
incorporating the trail system; restoring Stevens Creek; and addressing
neighborhood issues.
In addition to these community facilities, the City also has a system of
neighborhood parks of varying sizes and types that are located throughout
Cupertino. Each neighborhood park offers a variety of opportunities for passive
and active recreation for adjacent neighborhoods and recreational programs
for the community. Lastly, the City also has agreements with the school districts
to maintain school fields in return for allowing the community to use the fields,
when they are not in use by the schools.
PRIVATE AND SEMI-PUBLIC OPEN SPACE RESOURCES
There are several private, open space and recreational activity businesses in
Cupertino that support the recreational needs of the community. They include
the Deep Cliff Golf Course and the Cupertino Hills Swim and Racquet Club in the
Monta Vista Planning Area, as well as riding stables in the foothills. The Rancho

Rinconada Recreation Center, a swim and recreational facility operated by a
separate District, is available publicly to residents of the Rancho Rinconada
Area. These facilities are valuable to the community because they often provide
services that are not traditionally provided by the public sector on City or
regional parklands.
Several hillside and urban subdivisions, and apartment complexes, offer both
natural and built recreational facilities for their residents. Private open spaces
that are accessible to the public include Cali Mill Plaza at the intersection
of Stevens Creek and De Anza Boulevards, Civic Park in the Town Center
development across from the Civic Center, and the park at the Main Street
development along Stevens Creek Boulevard east of Wolfe Road. Lastly, utility
power line corridors in the city’s foothills provide public paths and trails through
open space areas.
TRAILS
Trails and paths connect people to each other, create access to open space areas
and parks, and provide an alternative to driving from place to place. Promoting
more trails and connectivity along creeks, hillsides and through neighborhoods
is a major objective of the General Plan. Providing access to open space and
parks is not completely dependent on trails. Sidewalks and streets can also
connect pedestrians to their destinations. However, occasional barriers often
pose an issue when they break the continuity. Future plans for these areas
should enhance connectivity to neighborhoods and other parts of the city. Each
major trail corridor in Cupertino is discussed in greater detail below. In addition
to these trail corridors, the City also seeks to expand access to other trails
through grants and development review. Figure RPC-4 identifies major trail
linkages in Cupertino.
STEVENS CREEK
The 65 acre Stevens Creek corridor is Cupertino’s most prominent urban open
space/trail resource. The land is designated for recreation, parklands and
farming, and provides flood plain area for the creek. Adjoining properties are
zoned for low-density residential use. The Stevens Creek Corridor Plan retains
                                                                                         RPC-9

the open space character of the Stevens Creek greenbelt between the Stevens
Creek reservoir and Stevens Creek Boulevard, and offers historical significance
relating to the Juan Bautista De Anza Trail designation.
The City is participating with the Santa Clara Valley Water District and adjacent
cities including Sunnyvale, Los Altos and Mountain View in a Four Cities
Coordinated Stevens Creek Trail Feasibility Study to explore connections for
a trail following Stevens Creek, extending to the San Francisco Bay. The study
is currently in progress and is expected to be completed in 2015. The City will
implement recommendations from the study endorsed by the City Council. The
City’s acquisition of Linda Vista Park, McClellan Ranch, Blackberry Farm, and the
McClellan Ranch West (Simms), Stocklmeir properties, and more recently, the
Blesch property support these planning efforts.
The 2002 Stevens Creek Trail Feasibility study concluded that it is feasible to
construct 7.7 miles of separated and on-street multi-use paths connecting to
Rancho San Antonio and Stevens Creek County parks. To complete the trail,
a public trail easement through the approximately 150 acre former quarry
property south of Linda Vista Park will be established when the property is
proposed for development. The former quarry haul road connects Linda Vista
Park to McClellan Road. It is under the same ownership as the quarry and is
necessary to link these properties. Full build out of the Stevens Creek trail is
expected to take about 10 to 15 years.
CALABAZAS CREEK
There is an opportunity for a trail along Calabazas Creek that would connect the
South Vallco Planning Area to Cupertino High School and Creekside Park.
SAN TOMAS-AQUINO/SARATOGA CREEK
Cupertino’s section of the 12 mile San Tomas-Aquino Trail crosses into the city
from Santa Clara on Pruneridge Avenue, extends to bicycle lanes on Bollinger
Road, and further extends north-south along the city limit between San Jose and
Cupertino. The City has explored the potential to create a linear Lawrence-Mitty
Park along the creek with the cooperation of Santa Clara County, neighboring
jurisdictions and the Santa Clara Valley Water District. Discussions on trail
options in this area are ongoing.
                                                                                       RPC-11

general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD
The 8.7 mile proposed Union Pacific Rail Trail corridor extends through the cities
of Cupertino, Saratoga, Campbell and the town of Los Gatos. The trail would
link to the Los Gatos Creek Trail, connecting the two most heavily used parks in
Santa Clara County: Rancho San Antonio County Park and Vasona County Park.
A feasibility study found that this project is not feasible at this time. Acquisition
of right-of-way or easements is anticipated if the Railroad goes out of service or
if it is able to relinquish right-of-way. The corridor is designated as a proposed
trail on the Trail Linkages diagram. Should the railroad corridor use change,
provision for a continuous trail through the corridor must be included as a
project component.
DON BURNETT BICYCLE-PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE
The Don Burnett Bicycle-Pedestrian Bridge (formerly known as the Mary Avenue
Bicycle Footbridge) links the Sunnyvale and north side of I-280 to De Anza
College, Memorial Park and the Oaks Shopping Center. It was opened in 2009
and is enjoyed by pedestrians, bicyclists and school children. Its unique design
creates a gateway into Cupertino and a landmark for the area.
INTERSTATE 280 TRAIL
This is a potential trail along the drainage channel on the south side of I-280.
The trail has the potential of connecting several significant nodes in the city
starting from the Calabazas Creek connection across from the Main Street
development to Vallco Shopping District, and ending at De Anza Boulevard. The
trail could be potentially extended west of De Anza Boulevard in a later phase.
A number of development projects have contributed to a study and potential
improvements to implement the trail. The timing of the study is expected to be
coordinated with the redevelopment of the Vallco Shopping District and other
developments in the area. The City will have to coordinate with the Santa Clara
County Valley Water District on the project since it owns the drainage channel.

CHAPTER 9: RECREATION, PARKS AND COMMUNITY SERVICES ELEMENT
general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
PARK STANDARDS
A well-planned park program incorporates a variety of facilities and programs
to meet the community’s needs. The program must also be flexible so that it
can be updated as the community grows and changes in the future. The City is
proposing a Parks and Recreation Master Plan that responds to these issues.
Key elements of such a master plan will include parks performance standards, a
classification system of park type and a recreation program for the community.
The master plan will also identify locations where additional capacity is needed
to meet the current and future needs of its residents and workers and strategies
to bridge the gaps.
The City is fortunate to have access to a multitude of trails and regional park
resources within Cupertino, which, along with the City’s inventory of available
parkland, provides approximately 430 acres of park and recreation area for
city residents (or approximately 7.37 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents).
The City’s inventory of available parkland, which includes community and
neighborhood parks as well as publicly accessible parks through agreements,
is approximately 210 acres (or approximately 3.6 acres per 1,000 residents). If
the amount of parkland accessible due to agreements with the Cupertino Union
School District is excluded, the available parkland is 174 acres (or approximately
2.98 acres per 1,000 residents).
The City’s standard currently specifies three acres of parkland per 1,000
residents. However, the City should continue to explore raising the parkland
standard to five acres per 1,000 residents for its parks acquisition program.
PARK ACCESSIBILITY
One of the City’s key objectives in planning for neighborhoods is to distribute
parks and open space within the community so that all residents can safely walk
or bike to a recreation facility. This has the advantage of improving neighborhood
identity, social interactions and the overall health of the community.
Figure RPC-5 shows the neighborhoods and the 1/2 mile service area radius
for neighborhood parks. The service area map includes walking and biking
impediments due to physical barriers, such as freeways, railroad tracks or
stream beds. In addition, busy streets may discourage some people, especially

Mobility Element will work in tandem with parks planning to ensure that key
intersections connecting neighborhoods to services are improved for pedestrian
and bicycle connections.
Table RPC-2 shows the park and open space acreage proposed by area.
Acquisition strategies will include agreements to allowing community use of
school sites, expanding and making modifications to existing parks, leveraging
State and regional funding, and park dedication requirements for major new
developments.
RECREATION PROGRAMS
The City offers a variety of recreation programs for residents ranging from
pre-school age children to its seniors. These include sports, arts, educational
programs, teen programs, senior programs and services, special festivals and
events and other activities. As the community profile changes, these programs
will have to evolve to address their specific needs. The City is continuously
working to refine and revise its programs to serve its population, while ensuring
that the programs can be mostly maintained by fees charged. Programs such
as environmental education, health and wellness, after school programs, art and
cultural diversity programs, science and math camps, and adventure programs
are examples of programs that are growing in need and popularity.
SCHOOLS
Cupertino is served by excellent institutions of public education. Cupertino
Union School District, Fremont Union High School District and Foothill-De
Anza Community College District provide nationally acclaimed elementary,
secondary and post-secondary education. This group of school districts is one
of the primary attractions of Cupertino for home buyers, particularly families
with school-age children. While the City is not directly involved in the provision
of education, it does control growth and development that can affect schools by
increasing student enrollment beyond the means of schools to service them. In
turn, it is crucial for the City to continue working directly with the school districts
to maintain their current high quality.

In addition, the City should continue to coordinate with schools to partner on
open space and cultural opportunities for community use. The City is already
implementing, and hopes to expand, the field maintenance agreements with
schools to allow community use when these facilities are not in use by schools.
The City will also explore partnerships with De Anza College and the school
districts to make available their theater, tennis courts and community meeting
spaces for use by community groups.
LIBRARY
The Cupertino Library, operated by the Santa Clara County Library under the
Joint Powers Authority Agreement, is an important community resource. The
City continues to contribute to the library’s annual operating costs, which are
necessary to implement and enhance services provided by the County Library.
In addition, the City built a new 54,000 square foot library in 2004, which
replaced an outdated 23,000 square foot library. This new facility was needed
to accommodate the needs of the growing community. Cupertino Library is
now a key community destination in the Civic Center and runs a variety of
reading programs and other community activities. A Civic Center Master Plan is
currently being developed to meet the facility and parking needs of the various
site elements, including the Library, Library Field, City Hall, Community Hall, and
the plaza.
                                                                                       RPC-17

CHAPTER 9: RECREATION, PARKS AND COMMUNITY SERVICES ELEMENT
general plan (community vision 2015 - 2040)
LOOKING FORWARD
As the Cupertino community grows and changes in age, diversity and ability, the
City’s parks and recreation programs will have to adjust to meet those needs. In
cases where needed services are not provided by the City, the City will partner
with other providers to ensure that community goals and expectations are met.
The City will also have to look for ways to expand and deliver services in a manner
that is fiscally-responsible by partnering with public agencies, service providers
and private development, and looking for grants to supplement funding for
projects. The City will also have to continually update its portfolio of facilities and
recreation services to prioritize programs that are most needed and can serve
the community in an equitable manner. The City should also explore ways to take
advantage of sustainable practices to reduce facility maintenance costs.
The following are ways the City will address key challenges and opportunities
facing Cupertino:
	1        EXPAND RECREATION FACILITIES.
          As the City realizes added growth anticipated in Community Vision 2040
          it will have to look at expanding facilities and programs. These can be
          achieved through careful master planning, implementation of a Capital
          Improvement Program (CIP), and partnering with agencies and private
          developers to increase park and open space.
	2        EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION AND ACCESS.
          In the future, the City should look to balancing its recreation facilities so
          that each neighborhood and special area has easy access to parks and
          recreation services. Strategies to achieve this include removing physical
          barriers and improving pedestrian and bicycle paths to such facilities,
          prioritizing areas that are deficient in park space, retrofitting facilities
          and revising programs to meet community needs.

	COLLABORATION.
3
  The City will rely heavily on partnerships and collaboration with other
  service providers in sharing facilities and services, and ensuring that
  City plans meet the community’s current and future needs. This will
  allow the City to deliver services in a manner that is efficient and fiscally
  responsible.
	SUSTAINABILITY.
4
  The City should explore ways to redevelop, build and maintain facilities
  and parks in an environmentally sustainable manner. Such practices
  will allow the City to reduce maintenance costs for buildings and
  landscaping, while also improving community health.
	FUNDING.
5
  The City should continue to explore ways to deliver services in a fiscally
  responsible manner by identifying new sources of funding through
  grants, working with developers to expand facilities and services,
  sharing facilities with other agencies and school districts, and reviewing
  recreation programs to ensure that they meet demand.
                                                                                 RPC-19
