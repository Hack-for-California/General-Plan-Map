I. INTRODUCTION
State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section 65580 (et seq.)) mandates that local
governments must adequately plan to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all
economic segments of the community. State law also recognizes the vital role local governments
play in the supply and affordability of housing. It acknowledges that in order for the private market to
adequately address housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans and
regulatory systems that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development.

City of Visalia                                                                 Part 1. Background Report
                                                                                         Housing Element
As a result, housing policy in the State rests largely upon the effective implementation of local
general plans and local housing elements in particular.
This Housing Element (2009) (2015)is a comprehensive update of the previous Housing Element
(2010) and is valid for a nine-year planning period (i.e., January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2023.
The previous Housing Element (2009) served a planning period from 2008 to 2015. The purpose of
the housing element is to identify the community’s housing needs, to state the community’s goals
and objectives with regard to housing production, rehabilitation, and conservation to meet those
needs, and to define the policies and programs that the community will implement to achieve the
stated goals and objectives. As required by State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section
65583(a)) the assessment and inventory for this Housing Element includes the following:
        Analysis of population and employment trends and projections.
        Analysis and documentation of household characteristics,         including level of payment
            compared to ability to pay.
        Analysis of housing characteristics, including overcrowding; and housing stock condition.
        Analysis of any special housing needs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, large families,
            farmworkers, families with female heads of households, and families and persons in need
            of emergency shelter.
        An   inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
            having potential for redevelopment; and an analysis of the relationship of zoning, public
            facilities, and services to these sites.
        Analysis     of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
            improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and for persons with
            disabilities, including land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site
            improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing and
            permit procedures. Analysis of local efforts to remove governmental constraints.
        Analysis     of potential and actual non-governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
            improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including the availability of
            financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
The Housing Element Background Report identifies the nature and extent of the city’s housing
needs, which in turn provides the basis for the City’s response to those needs in the Policy
Document.
General Plan and Housing Element Consistency
The housing element is one of seven State-mandated elements that every general plan must
contain. Although the housing element must follow all the requirements of the general plan, the
housing element has several State-mandated requirements that distinguish it from other general
plan elements. The housing element is required to be internally consistent with the other elements
of the general plan.
The City of Visalia completed its comprehensive General Plan Update and Program Environmental
Impact Report (PEIR) in October 2014. This Housing Element Update has been analyzed for
August 2016

consistency with the City’s recently adopted General Plan, and has been found to be fully consistent
with all other Elements of the General Plan. For example, new policies and actions to amend the
Zoning Ordinance to increase the number of units of a multi-family development project, and new
incentives to promote affordable housing in designated in-fill locations are expansions of land use
policies adopted in the recently adopted General Plan. Further analysis is provided in Part 2 of this
document.
Preparation of this Housing Element update closely follows adoption of the City of Visalia
Comprehensive General Plan Update (October 2014). Consequently, the Goals Policies and
Programs contained in this Housing Element are integral with the provisions of the remaining
General Plan Elements. Once certified and adopted, the Housing Element will be consistent with the
remainder of the General Plan.
Further, the General Plan Implementation Plan includes a requirement for an Annual and Five Year
progress review. These plans are required to be presented to the Visalia City Council annually. In
addition, annual review and reporting on the status of the implementation of the Housing Element is
required by State Law. The City adheres to both of these local and state mandated requirements.
Joint City Council/Planning Commission Session Direction
In a joint Planning Commission/City Council Worksession held on February 2, 2015, City staff
presented a summary of a proposed work program to prepare the 2015 Housing Element Update.
The presentation included a summary of the recently approved Regional Housing Needs Allocation
assigned to Visalia during the 5th Housing Element cycle (2015-2023), a summary of new Housing
regulations since the last update, a strategy for conducting community outreach and participation
through a stakeholders group to conduct formal oversight, and integration of the Council’s direction
in preparing the new Housing Element. The Council’s direction focused on compliance with current
state Housing regulations, continuation and improvement of the policies contained in the current
Housing Element, and avoidance of involuntary rezoning actions to meet the City’s new Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). Finally, the City Council directed that the Housing Element be
prepared using City staff and resources exclusively due to budget constraints.
Public Participation
As part of the Housing Element update process, the City implemented the State’s public participation
requirements in Housing Element Law, set forth in Government Code Section 65583(c)(7), that
jurisdictions “…shall make a diligent effort to achieve participation of all economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element.”
Prior to the Draft Housing Element being submitted to the State for the mandated 60-day review
period, City staff conducted an extensive public outreach effort to gain input from key stakeholders,
other City Committees, and members of the public as a means of testing and augmenting the input
of the Housing Element Technical Advisory Committee (HTAC) who’s composition and functions are
discussed below. The City maintains a contact list of housing stakeholders who have been invited
to participate in the Housing Element Update process..

Housing Element Technical Advisory Committee (HTAC)
To provide independent direction and oversight of the Housing Element Update, including providing
technical expertise and direct key constituent representation throughout the development of the
Housing Element Update, , the City Council appointed a seven-member Housing Advisory
Committee (HTAC), consisting of representatives of the Tulare County Housing Authority, Self- Help
Enterprises, Visalia Emergency Aid Council, Community Service-Employment and Training (C-SET),
Habitat for Humanity of Tulare/Kings County, Home Builders Association of Tulare and Kings
County, and Tulare County Board of Realtors. The HTAC oversaw the City staff’s incremental work
program throughout the process, including the public outreach efforts, policy review and revisions,
and approval of the Land Inventory Needs strategy.
Community Outreach Workshops Nos. 1 and 2
City staff and at least three members of the HTAC conducted two Community Outreach Workshops
on July 8th and 9th, 2015. Both workshops began at 7:00pm. The locations were selected based on
their convenience for access to north Visalia (Manuel F. Hernandez Community Center) and to south
Visalia (Whitendale Community Center).
Staff and the HTAC members distributed bi-lingual announcement flyers for the Workshops through
their respective organizations, as well as other governmental and non-governmental agencies
throughout the greater Visalia Community. Furthermore, the City publicized the workshops on the
City website and posted the flyers at City facilities.
City staff and the HTAC members conducted the Workshops The Workshop format provided a brief
overview of the Housing Element Update process and to solicit responses from the participants on
their individual concerns and experiences in obtaining adequate and affordable housing in Visalia,
both now and in the future. Participants were also asked to relate their personal experiences on
housing issues such as potential discrimination, steering, and fraudulent business practices. In all,
twelve residents participated in the two Workshops.
The key issues provided by the participants are noted as follows:
    •    The imbalance between the cost of housing compared with income levels. This was
         apparent for both purchase and rental housing costs. These concerns were borne out by the
         statistical data compiled in this Housing Element Update.
Both the current and 5th Cycle Housing Elements and the other General Plan Elements emphasize
inclusionary housing practices and promote a variety of housing products for all income and special
needs groups.         Visalia meets or exceeds all requirements for preserving land inventory for
affordable housing, and its development permit and processing fees and timelines are competitive
with or lower than other jurisdictions in the Central Valley. These policies and practices help Visalia
to enjoy one of the most favorable housing affordability levels in the State, However, the primary
cost of housing (demand/scarcity, mortgage rates, product offerings) and local
employment/remuneration rates, far outweigh the incentives and other tools the City has at its
disposal to rectify the inherent imbalance in housing affordability. However, the City continues to
use its resources in economic development to foster job and salary growth, done in conjunction with

promoting affordable housing strategically located near employment centers and transportation
corridors.
     •   The quality of life concerns in some neighborhoods in the City. There was a consensus
         conclusion that the City’s public safety and blight abatement programs are vital to raising the
         perceived and actual quality of life for “at risk” neighborhoods.
The City will continue to commit all available resources to these neighborhood improvement
programs, using general fund and CDBG funding sources.
     •   Proximity to school, employment centers, and daily goods and services providers were also
         noted as essential to residents.
Comment received and noted.
     •   Access to reliable public transit was identified as a key component of residents’ mobility
         solutions. Potential incidents of steering or other forms of institutional discrimination were
         not noted as concerns among the Workshop participants.
City Committee Presentations
City staff and HTAC members made presentations to several City Committees that have
involvement in housing and services to key constituents. These presentations used essentially the
same format and content as the Public Outreach Workshops discussed in the previous paragraphs.
These sessions were conducted as follows:
         Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC): July 1, 2015. The presentation included an overview
of the Housing Element Update process and an summary of key City demographic, housing, and
income statistics. The CAC provided individual comments in response to the discussion questions
raised to all groups who received the presentation. Key points received from the CAC members
included: concern for housing cost burden, varied housing product types to meet the needs of
changing demographics (e.g. elderly, young families, single persons, multi-generational housing.
         North Visalia Neighborhood Advisory Committee (NVNAC):                    July 9, 2015, and
September 10, 2015. This session was conducted over the course of two NVNAC meetings by
request of the NVNAC members who desired to more thoroughly review and comment on City
Housing policies and programs in addition to preparing individual responses to the standard
questions posed by the Outreach format. The NVNAC responses provided a particularly invaluable
insight into day to day housing concerns from the perspective of an extensive cross section of
residents of the City’s most at-risk neighborhoods, as well as real estate agents, property owners,
and homeless services providers.
The key points raised by the NVNAC members included - the disparity between housing costs and
incomes, particularly among special needs residents. Other key issues raised were the need for the
City to focus its housing support resources into neighborhoods that will maximize the utility value of
the dollars invested; public transit to be integral with economically disadvantaged neighborhoods;
concern for the quality and walkable access to schools that service these neighborhoods; and

ensuring for good and responsive management practices by apartment managers. Among the
specific recommendations was for the City to purchase abandoned houses and apartment buildings
and resell the units to homeowners who would become stakeholders/investors in the neighborhood.
         Disability Advocacy Committee (DAC): August 10, 2015. The DAC focused their
comments on ensuring that the availability of accessible units keep pace with the increase in the
numbers of disabled and other limited mobility residents, including the City’s aging population.
Individual Committee members also noted problems with handicap accessibility in the new housing
stock, and in preserving programs to retrofit older units. Some concern was expressed that the
“minimum” building code standards may not be adequate for accommodating the full range of
disabled persons. Also noted was the up-front cost of filling out credit checks before being approved
for some housing assistance programs.
Planning Commission Public Hearing
On June 27, 2016, the City of Visalia Planning Commission held a public hearing to review and
consider the draft Housing Element Update (GPA-2016-06), VMC Chapter 17.54 (General Plan
Amendments). One person spoke in favor of adopting the Housing Element Update.The Planning
Commission voted unanimously (5-0) to recommend the Housing Element Update be approved as
submitted.
City Council Public Hearing
On September 6, 2016, the City Council held a public hearing to review the proposed Negative
Declaration, and GPA 2016-06 (draft Housing Element Update). Several persons spoke in favor of
adopting the Housing Element Update. The City Council voted to adopt Resolutions approving
Negative Declaration No. 2015-56, and approving GPA 2016-06 (Housing Element Update). The
City Council made an additional finding that authorizes City staff to make any needed administrative
revisions to gain certification of the Housing Element, asmay be required by the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD).
 II. EXISTING HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This section begins with an update of key housing and demographic characteristics of Visalia that
have been revised to reflect current statistical data. The section then discusses the existing housing
needs of the city based on housing and demographic characteristics. The section also discusses
the housing needs of “special” population groups as defined in State law. Data for Visalia is
presented in the 4th Cycle Housing Element tables alongside data for Tulare County and California
for comparison. In the interest of streamlined content allowed by state HCD regulations, the
comparisons have not been included in all cases.
Demographic and Employment Profile

Demographics
Table 1 shows historic population trends and growth rates for Visalia. Since incorporating in 1874,
Visalia grew between 2 and 6 percent (AAGR) between 1930 and 1990. The city experienced its
highest average annual growth rate (AAGR) between 1970 and 1980 when the population grew at
an AAGR of 6.2 percent. Visalia’s population growth slowed slightly between 1980 and 1990 to 4.3
percent. Growth rates continued to diminish from 1990 to 2000 (2.0 percent) and then increased
slightly through the 2000s (3.7 percent). As of 2013, Visalia’s population was nearing 130,000. It
should be noted that the boundaries of incorporated cities are not constant and population change
over time in a given place reflects not only population growth, but a change in the area of an
incorporated city.Table 1

     Table 3 compares Visalia’s age trends between 1990 and 2013. Residents in the “0-4”, “25-34”, “55-
     64”, and “65-74” age groups increased as a percentage of the entire population. Visalia’s “25-34”
     age group had the most significant increase from 13.7 percent of the population to 15.6 percent.
     This trend most likely reflects the increased number of families with young children in Visalia.

Population and Employment Projections
The Tulare County Council of Governments uses Department of Finance projections to estimate
population growth for the county and its cities. Table 8 shows population projections for 2010 to
2050 for Visalia and Tulare County. From 2010 to 2020, the population in Visalia is projected
increase by 40,466, a 32.5 percent increase over ten years. The county population will increase
132,224 or 28.3 percent from 2010 to 2020. In the long term, the annual average growth rate
(AAGR) will decrease from 2.9 percent (2010 to 2020) to 1.9 percent (2040 to 2050). This table is
consistent with growth projects in the recently adopted City of Visalia General Plan Update. It is also
accurate for the 5th Cycle Housing Element update.

Household Characteristics and Housing Supply
The section provides an analysis of household characteristics and housing supply. The first part of
this section analyzes household characteristics, such as household population, composition, size,
tenure, and overcrowding. More simply stated, it summarizes the profile of Visalia residents living in
private households, whether they are renters or owners, how many people live in a household, and if
it is overcrowded. The second section analyzes the city’s housing inventory and supply, including a
discussion of vacant units.
The discussion of the housing stock in Visalia uses a significant amount of data from the 2013
Census, ACS 5 year survey estimates.
Household Characteristics
The first part of this section analyzes household characteristics including household population,
tenure, and household composition.
Household Population
Household population is an important measure for establishing the number of persons residing in
private households. Per the 2010 Census, Visalia had a total population of 124,442 and a total
household population of 123,116. The difference is 1,326 persons living in group quarters.
Persons in institutional or group quarters are not included in the count of household population.
From 2008 to 2010 there was a decrease in group quarters population in Visalia. In terms of
planning for the housing needs of all segments of the population, three group quarter categories hold
special interest: inmates of correctional institutions, persons staying in nursing homes, and persons
in other group quarters. The Department of Finance estimated that the majority of the 1,326 persons
living in group quarters in Visalia consisted of the elderly living in nursing homes. Only 1.3 percent
of all Visalia residents were living in group quarters.

Household Composition
The U.S. Census divides households into two different categories, depending on their composition:
family and non-family. Family households are those consisting of two or more related persons living
together. Non-family households include persons who live alone or in groups composed of
unrelated individuals.
Housing composition has remained relatively constant for the city, county and state. In 2000, family
households as a percentage of total households in Visalia was 74.2 percent, which was higher than
the percentage of family households in the State (68.8 percent), but were slightly lower than Tulare
County (78.9 percent). The 2013 Census, ACS 5-year estimate shows the ratio of households in
Visalia to be proportionally the same as in previous years.

Tenure
Tenure, or how many units are owner-occupied versus renter-occupied, is a measure of the rate of
homeownership in a jurisdiction. Tenure for housing type and number of bedrooms can help
estimate demand for a diversity of housing types.
Home equity is the largest single source of household wealth for most Americans. Median net wealth
for renters is about 3 percent of that of homeowners. The national homeownership rate has risen
from around 40 percent before World War II to 65.6 percent in 1980, 64 percent in 1995, 65 percent
in 2002, and 69 percent in 2008. Some economists consider a 65 percent ownership and 35 percent
rental rate to be a healthy tenure mix for the United States. They also feel that anything over 70
percent is not sustainable in the long run and will lead to a housing bubble.
Figure 3 shows rates of homeownership and renter occupancy in Visalia, Tulare County, and
California in 2000 and 2005-07. As shown in the figure, Visalia had a slightly higher rate of
homeownership (62.8 percent) than the county (61.5 percent) and state (56.9 percent) in 2000.

Table 10 shows average household size by tenure for Visalia, Tulare County, and California in 2013.
Visalia had a slightly lower percentage of large households (four or more members) than Tulare
County for owners and a larger difference (10%) for renters in 2013. Visalia had more large renter-
occupied households than owner-occupied households (3.4% difference). . This suggests that
Visalia has a need to accommodate more large renter households.

Household Size
Average household size is a function of the number household population (the group quarters
population is not counted) divided by the number of occupied housing units. Table 12 shows the
average household size for Visalia, Tulare County, and California. The average number of persons
per household (i.e., persons per occupied housing unit) remained relatively the same in Visalia
between 2000 and 2013. There was a slight increase in average household size since 2000 The
average household sizes in Visalia are slightly lower than those in Tulare County during this time
period and slightly larger than the statewide average. Based on the information regarding housing
unit and household sizes, Visalia has a relatively smaller need for large housing units than the
Tulare County and the state.

Overcrowding
U.S. Census standards define a housing unit as overcrowded when the total number of occupants is
greater than one person per room, excluding kitchens and bathrooms. A typical home might have a
total of five rooms (three bedrooms, living room, and dining room). If more than five people were
living in the home, it would be considered overcrowded. There is some debate about whether units
with larger households where seven people might occupy a home with six rooms should really be
considered overcrowded. Nonetheless, units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered
severely overcrowded, and should be recognized as a significant housing problem.
Table 13 compares housing overcrowding data for Visalia with data for Tulare County and California.
In 2000, 6.6 percent of Visalia’s housing units were overcrowded: 3.3 percent had between 1.01 and
1.50 persons per room; 2.2 percent had between 1.51 and 2.0 persons per room; and 1.1 percent
had more than 2.0 persons per room. These statistics show that overcrowding was less of a
problem in Visalia than in Tulare County where 13.2 percent of all households had more than 1.0
persons per room and in California where 15.2 percent of households were considered
overcrowded.

Overcrowding is typically more of a problem in rental units than owner-occupied units. When broken
out by tenure, 64.5 percent of the overcrowded households in Visalia were renter households. Only
6.6 percent (1,292) of Visalia’s owner households had 1.01 or more persons per room, while 20.4
percent (2,346) of the renter households had 1.01 or more persons per room in 2000. In Tulare
County, 13.2 percent of owner households and 29.1 percent of renter households were
overcrowded. Statewide, overcrowding was much higher than in Visalia and more similar to the
county with 8.7 percent of owner households and 23.9 percent of renter households having more
than 1.0 persons per room. Based on this information, Visalia had less of a need for large housing
units in 2000 than other jurisdictions.
Table 13A provides comparative data regarding overcrowding updated for the 2013 American
Community Survey 5 year estimate (2009-2013). Overcrowding in Visalia households remained
statistically similar as in previous periods and compared to Tulare County and State ratios.

Part 1. Background Report
Housing Element
Housing Supply
While the previous section discussed the characteristics of persons living in households, this section
provides information about the total supply of existing housing in Visalia. This section includes
information about the total number housing units available in the city, changes in vacancy, and
structural condition of the units.
Housing Units
Table 14 shows comparative data on the housing stock in Visalia, Tulare County, and California in
2008 and 2015. The table shows the total housing stock in each area according to the type of
structures in which units are located.
Single-family detached housing units account for the majority of housing in Visalia in 2015. At 75.6
percent of the total housing stock in 2008 and again in 2015, single-family detached units in Visalia
make up a much larger share of the total than in the state overall, where only 58.0 percent of all
units are single-family detached. From 2008 to 2015, 3,302 single-family detached units were built
in Visalia. This was a significant reduction (5,398) of single-family detached units as compared to the
period 2000 to 2008. This is due to the severe economic downturn and housing bubble experienced
in the City and nationwide beginning in 2008.
Multi-family housing with two to four units makes up the next largest segment of Visalia’s housing
stock, with 11 percent of the total units in 2015. Between 2008 and 2015, 73units were built in
multi-family complexes with two to four units and 164 multi-family complexes with 5-plus units.

Building permit data for single-family (attached and detached) and multi-family residential activity
shows greater detail for housing unit growth for the City from 1990 to 2008. Building permit activity
for single-family rose and fell in the early 1990s and then started steady climb to peak in 2005 with
1,405 permits. Multi-family permits have followed a similar trend, but spiking in 2006 with 541 units.
As shown in Figure 4, the City’s building activity crashed during 2006 to 2013,following a similar
pattern to other regional, state, and national trends.
                                                FIGURE 4
As shown in Figure 4,
 above (source: City of Visalia Building Permits Issued, 2006-2015), residential permit activity
increased in 2013, but has failed to achieve more than 40% of the peak residential permit activity in
2006.
Occupancy/Vacancy Rates
According to the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the desired
vacancy rates necessary to provide a stable housing environment is approximately 2 percent for
owner-occupied housing and 5 percent for renter-occupied housing. As shown in Table 15, Visalia
and Tulare County have both had modestly lower vacancy rates than the state average in 2013.
The vacancy rate in Visalia has remained around 6 percent since 2008, while the statewide vacancy
rate has increased closer to 9 percent.

Housing Conditions
This section helps to identify the number of substandard housing units (both renter and owner) in
need of repair, rehabilitation, or replacement. The City has not conducted a housing conditions
survey and the Census provides only limited data that can be used to infer the condition of Visalia’s
housing stock. For example, the Census reports on whether housing units have complete plumbing
and kitchen facilities. Since only a very small percentage of all housing units in Visalia lack complete
plumbing or kitchen facilities (Tables 17 and 17A), these indicators do not reveal much about overall
housing conditions.
Since housing stock age and condition are generally correlated, one Census variable that provides
an indication of housing conditions is the age of a community’s housing stock. As shown in Table
17A, the median year built for all housing units in Visalia as of the 2000 Census was 1983,
compared to 1978 during the previous review period.. Over 30% percent of Visalia’s housing stock
was fifteen or less years old in 2013. These statistics reflect the steady growth in the area during
the 1990s in excess of growth Statewide.. Over 30 percent of the housing units in Visalia are 15
years old or less
These broad statistical factors suggest that Visalia’s housing stock is in relatively good condition
compared to communities with larger shares of older homes, disparate housing/income balance and
other factors that directly or indirectly influence housing conditions. The City Building Official and
Code Enforcement Manager have estimated that approximately three percent (1,232 units, of which
approximately 40 percent are single- family units, and 60 percent are multi-family units) of 41,066
total units are in need of rehabilitation or replacement. Their estimates are based on factors that
include building permit trends for corrective repairs (re-roofing, change of electrical boxes/wiring,
etc.) within aging neighborhoods, foreclosure and abandonment activity, and code compliance
complaints for deficient living conditions investigated over an approximately two year period (2014-
2016). This is 856 more units (3.3 times) than the number of units reported as lacking plumbing or
kitchen facilities (Table 17A). However, the number of units deemed substandard under this criteria
are fully offset by the number of new and rehabilitated housing units (over 700 units per year on
average)        that     are     added         to    the     City’s    housing        unit      inventory.

Housing Affordability
State law [65583(a)(2)] requires “an analysis and documentation of household characteristics,
including level of payment compared to ability to pay.” Identifying and evaluating existing housing
needs are a critical component of the housing element. This requires comparison of resident
incomes with the local cost of housing. The analysis helps local governments identify existing
housing conditions that require addressing and households with housing cost burdens or unmet
housing needs. This section includes an analysis of housing cost burden, ability to pay for housing,
and the cost of housing.
The data in this section uses this Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data from
HUDs State of the Cities Data Systems (SOCDS) website. Income groups are shown in the SOCDS
CHAS tabulation based on the HUD-adjusted area median income (AMI). The list below shows the
definition of housing income limits as they are applied to housing units in Visalia.
        Extremely     Low-Income Unit is one that is affordable to households whose combined
            income is less than 30 percent of the area median income (AMI) for Visalia as established
            by HUD using the Visalia-Porterville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). A 3-person
            household is considered to be extremely low-income in Visalia if its combined income is
            $20,090 or less in 2015.
        Very Low-Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose combined income is
            between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI as established by HUD for the Visalia-Porterville
            MSA. A 3-person household is considered to be very low-income in Visalia if its combined
            income is between $20,091 and $26,100 in 2015..
        Low-Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose combined income is at or
            between 51 and 80 percent of the AMI as established by HUD for the Visalia-Porterville
            MSA. A 3-person household is considered to be low-income in Visalia if its combined
            income is between $26,101 and 41,700 in 2015..
        Median Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose combined income is at
            or between 81 and 120 percent of the AMI as established by HUD for the Visalia-
            Porterville MSA. A 3-person household is considered to be median-income in Visalia if its
            combined income is between $47,701 and $69,500 in 2015
        Moderate-Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose combined income is
            above 121 percent of the AMI as established by HUD for the Visalia-Porterville MSA. A 3-
            person household is considered to be above moderate-income in Visalia if its combined
            income exceeds $62,558 in 2015..
According to HUD, the median area income for a four-person household in the Visalia-Porterville
MSA was $57,900 in 2015. Income limits for larger or smaller households were higher or lower,
respectively, and are calculated using a formula developed by HUD (see Table 18A).

Housing Cost Burden
This section provides an analysis of the proportion of households “overpaying for housing” based on
income level and percentage of income used for housing (i.e., housing cost). Lower-income
households are defined as those that earn 80 percent or less of the area median income. Housing
cost is measured as the percentage of income. A “moderate cost burden” is defined by HUD as
gross housing costs between 31 and 50 percent of gross income. A “severe cost burden” is defined
as gross housing costs exceeding 50 percent of gross income. For renters, gross housing costs
include rent paid by the tenant plus utilities. For owners, housing costs include mortgage payment,
taxes, insurance, and utilities.
The impact of high housing costs falls disproportionately on extremely low-, very low-, and low-
income households, especially renters. While some higher-income households may choose to
spend greater parts of their income for housing, the cost burden for lower-income households
reflects choices limited by a lack of a sufficient supply of housing affordable to these households.
Low-income households, who are overpaying for housing, frequently have insufficient resources for
other critical essentials, including food and medicine. This is a significant hardship for many
workers, families and seniors, but it also impacts local economies as money that might otherwise be
spent in local stores generating sales tax revenues are being spent on housing.
Table 19A shows the State of the Cities Data Systems (SOCDS), Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy (SOCDS) data from the 2012 Census regarding the percentage of households
with a moderate housing cost burden (greater than 30 percent) and severe cost burden (greater than
50 percent) by income group and tenure for Visalia, Tulare County, and California. Approximately
34.6 percent of households in Visalia, or 14,125 households, had very low- or low-incomes; much
lower than the county (46.1 percent) or state (44.2 percent). That is, they earned less than 80
percent of the median countywide income. Of the lower income households in Visalia, about 60.9
percent were renters, and 39.1 percent were owners.
As shown in Table 19A, 24,390 households or 41.0 percent of all households in Visalia had a
housing cost burden greater than 30 percent in 2012. This rate is more than Tulare County (35.3
percent), but less than California (44.8%). However, only 14 percent of all households in Visalia had

                   for Tulare County and California, respectively.
                   Rates of housing cost burden were greater among low-income renter households than among low-
                   income owner households. However, for renter households with moderate incomes, rates of
                   housing cost burden were lower than those of owner-occupied households. This trend was common
                   across the city, county, and the state. In Visalia, 54.2 percent of low-income renter households paid
                   30 percent or more of their monthly incomes for housing costs in 2012, compared to 22.1 percent of
                   low-income owner households. Among non-low-income households, the percentage of owner
                   households with moderate or severe housing cost burdens was far higher than renter households
                   (30.5 percent compared to 16.3 percent).

 Ability to Pay for Housing
 Table 21A shows the 2015 HUD-defined household income limits for extremely low-, very low-, low-,
 median and moderate-income households in the Visalia-Porterville MSA by the number of persons in
 the household. It also shows maximum affordable monthly rents and maximum affordable purchase
 prices for homes. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
 housing is classified as “affordable” if households do not pay more than 30 percent of gross income
 for payment of rent (including utilities) or monthly homeownership costs (including mortgage
 payments, taxes, and insurance). Since above moderate-income households do not generally have
 problems locating affordable units, affordable housing is usually defined as units that are reasonably
 priced for low- and moderate-income households. The following section compares 2015 income
 levels and ability to pay for housing with actual housing costs.
 Affordable: For purposes of this section the term “affordable” is defined as: Housing that is
 affordable to Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low income categories, regardless whether the housing
 is market priced, or is deed restricted as a result of Federal, State, or Local funding assistance, non-
 monetary incentive program, or tax increment reduction or waiver program. Affordable housing is
 housing that requires no more than 30% of an income qualifying occupant’s gross salary to maintain
 the housing unit . In addition, for purposes of the Housing Element, affordable housing includes any
 housing developed at a gross density of 20 units or more per acre.

 Housing Values
 Between 1998 and 2008 there was a significant boom and severe downturn in the local housing
 market. Commonly referred to as the “housing bubble,” local markets exploded with construction
 and sales activity skyrocketed. From December 2002 to December 2006, the median home price in
 Visalia more than doubled, from about $133,500 to $282,750 and then fell back to around $175,000
 by December 2008. This trend occurred throughout California and in the surrounding cities of Tulare
 County.
 Overall, this is was due to high volumes of housing stock purchased with sub-prime mortgages that
 contributed to the “housing bubble” of inflated sales rates and prices. Visalia was not an exception.
 In May 2009 there were 1,755 properties in Visalia listed as foreclosures. These properties were
 listed at various stages of foreclosure, including pre-foreclosures (52 percent), auctions (25 percent),
 and bank-owned (23 percent) (Realitytrac.com, 2009). The 820 bank-owned homes ranged in price
 from $100,000 to about $2.3 million suggesting that foreclosures are impacting households of all
 incomes.
 From 2006 to 2008 rapid mortgage default rates brought prices down dramatically. In February
 2009, the average sale price for a foreclosed home was $155,430 (Realitytrac.com, 2009). Table
 23A shows the average sale price for new homes sold in Visalia in Fall 2015 is $260,000. From
 2003 to 2006, new homes in Visalia had appreciated more than 50 percent. This was subsequently
 followed by a 39.1 percent drop in value from 2006 to 2008.
 As of 2015, housing prices have rebounded to approximately 90% of their peak prices in 2006.
 Similarly, foreclosure activity has diminished to only 64 units in September 2015 (Realtytrac.com,
 2015). Although very low compared to the previous seven years, the percentage of foreclosures in
 Visalia is almost twice those statewide [.013% vs .007% (Realtytrac.com, 2015)].
 Rebounding house values and declining foreclosure activity have resulted in general economic
 benefit to individual property owners, to the community, and to the economy as a whole. It has had
 the effect of stabilizing living arrangements among community households, particularly among
 households that had already lost their homes or who have been at risk of losing their homes due to
 properties being ‘underwater’ relative to their loan balances.
 However, this has also resulted in a contrasting challenge for home affordability, particularly at the
 low and very low household income levels. While the availability of newly constructed homes has
 steadily increased (particularly since 2012 which has shown steady year to year growth which now is
 over 600 units per year), the increased sales prices of new homes that has facilitated the growth in
 new construction has also raised the price of existing homes which typically serve as the City’s stock

Rental Rates
Table 24A shows HUD-defined fair market rent (FMR) for the Visalia-Porterville MSA for 2015. In
general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to pay the gross rent (shelter rent
plus utilities) of privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest (non-luxury)
nature with suitable amenities.1 HUD uses FMRs for a variety of purposes: FMR determines the
eligibility of rental housing units for the Section 8 Housing Assistance program; Section 8 Rental
Certificate program participants cannot rent units whose rents exceed the FMRs; and FMRs also
serve as the payment standard used to calculate subsidies under the Rental Voucher program.
Comparing the current FMR to Table 21A, a 3-person household classified as low-income (80
percent of median) with an annual income of up to $40,500 could afford to pay $1,013 monthly
gross rent (including utilities). The 2015 FMR for a 2-bedroom unit is $771, which is affordable to
the household, assuming such a unit was available in Visalia. However, a 3-person very low-income
household ($26,650) could afford to pay only $660 for a two bedroom unit, which is below the 2015
FMR.
Since the FMR applies to the entire Visalia-Porterville MSA, residents of communities with higher
rental rates are likely to find that there is a limited supply of rental units at the regional FMR (i.e., a 2-
bedroom unit for $771, with utilities included). The lack of affordability would be even worse for the
very low-income household mentioned above if the household has to spend more than the FMR
amount to rent a unit in Visalia.

 Housing Element
 According to HUD, “the level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent
 distribution of standard-quality rental housing units. The current definition used is the 40th percentile
 rent, the dollar amount below which 40 percent of the standard-quality rental housing units are
 rented. The 40th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution of rents of all units occupied by recent
 movers (renter households who moved to their present residence within the past 15 months). Public
 housing units and units less than 2 years old are excluded.”
 Average Monthly Rents
 Table 25A shows approximate rents for various apartment complexes as well as single-family homes
 in Visalia as of December 2008. Rents vary widely based on the number of bedrooms, age of the
 facility and location. Depending on the cost of utilities, about half of the apartments listed in Table
 25A would be affordable to low-income households.                  None of the rental units listed in the table
 would be affordable to extremely low- or very low-income households; however, nearly all of the
 units would be affordable to low- and moderate-income households.

 Special Housing Needs
 Within the general population of Visalia there are several groups of people who have special housing
 needs. These needs can make it difficult for members of these groups to locate suitable housing.
 The following subsections discuss the special housing needs of six groups identified in State
 housing law (Government Code, Section 65583(a)(6)): “elderly, persons with disabilities, large
 families, farmworkers, families with female heads of households, and families and persons in need
 of emergency shelter.” Where possible, estimates of the population or number of households in
 Visalia belonging to each group are shown.
 Senior Households
 Seniors are defined as persons 65 years and older, and senior households are those households
 headed by a person 65 years and older. Seniors often face unique housing problems. While many

may own their homes outright, fixed retirement incomes may not always be adequate to cover rising
utility rates and insurance. Also, many elderly homeowners do not have sufficient savings to finance
the necessary repairs costs. This is a situation commonly described as “house-rich and cash-poor.”
Table 26A shows information on the number of seniors, the number of senior households, and
senior households by housing tenure in Visalia, Tulare County, and California in 2015. Seniors
represented 10.4 percent of the population in Visalia in 2013 compared to 9.7 percent of the
population in Tulare County and 11.8 percent in California. Senior households represented 18.5
percent of all households in Visalia compared to 18.6 percent in Tulare County and 20.5 percent in
California. Senior households have a high homeownership rate. Nearly 65.8 percent of senior
households in Visalia owned their homes in 2013, compared to 59.5 percent of all households in the

city. While some seniors may prefer to live in single-family detached homes, others desire a smaller,
more affordable home with less upkeep, such as condos, townhouses, apartments, or mobile
homes. In general, most senior households consist of a single elderly person living alone or a
couple. In comparison, among non-senior households, a smaller percentage of households live
alone. This information suggests that senior households may prefer smaller housing units than the
general population.
Some seniors have the physical and financial ability to continue driving well into their retirement;
however, those who cannot or chose not to drive must rely on alternative forms of transportation.
This includes bus routes, ride sharing, and walking.

     Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a needs-based program that pays monthly benefits to
     persons who are 65 or older, blind, or have a disability. Seniors who have never worked nor have
     insufficient work credits to qualify for Social Security disability often receive SSI benefits. In fact, SSI
     is the only source of income for a number of low-income seniors. The amount of SSI payment for
     eligible participants is $710 for a single person and $1,066 for a couple as of January 2013. As of
     December 2014 there were 6,697 recipients of SSI over the age of 65 in Tulare County.
     The Housing Authority of the County of Tulare provides rental assistance to very low and moderate-
     income seniors throughout the county and manages three assisted senior housing developments
     within the City: Kimball Court, Westport Village and Visalia Garden Villas. Kimball Court provides 94
     units for seniors in duplexes and fourplexes with one on-site managers unit in a gated environment.

Westport Village, a development with 109 lots for pre-manufactured housing for seniors, includes 25
units with subsidies for seniors at or below 60 percent of adjusted median income (AMI). Visalia
Garden Villas provides 60 units for very low- and moderate-income seniors.
The City continues to look for opportunities to partner with agencies, developers, and non-profit
organizations for the construction and/or rehabilitation of affordable senior housing. The City
partnered with Christian Church Homes/Visalia Senior Housing on the development of a 43-unit
senior housing development, known as Sierra Meadows. The project was completed in 2011, with a
total development cost of $9.6 million, including $2.8 million in HOME Investment Partnership Funds,
and U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 202 Supportive Housing
funding for the Elderly. The project was the first leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) Gold-certified in the State of California.
There are sixteen residential care facilities that are licensed in Visalia with a capacity for 684
residents. As shown in Table 28, the size of the facilities varies greatly from 5 units to 175 units per
facility and the average size is 43 units.

 The City of Visalia is an entitlement and participating jurisdiction, which receives U. S. Department of
 Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding, such as Community Development Block Grant
 (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnership (HOME) funds. As part of the City’s 2015-2019
 Consolidated Plan, high priority needs were identified, with goals that include providing affordable
 housing opportunities to existing owner occupants, including accessibility and senior repairs. As
 funding becomes available, programs such as the Senior Mobile Home Repair Program, will assist
 very low-income seniors or disabled individuals with emergency, minor repairs, and mobility needs.
 The Senior Center of Visalia provides activities and a lunch program for seniors. Senior Center staff
 have reported that seniors often ask for assistance with housing problems such as home repairs and
 finding affordable rental housing. The requests are primarily for affordable rental housing because
 the seniors’ low incomes make it difficult to find housing that they can afford.
 Persons with Disabilities
 While there is limited data available on the housing needs of persons with disabilities in Visalia, data
 on the number of persons with disabilities is useful in inferring housing needs. Table 29A shows
 information from the 2010-2014 American Community Survey (ACS) on the disability status by age
 group for males and females in Visalia, Tulare County, and California. According to the table, 11.7

percent of the total population in Visalia have a disability in the 2010-2014 ACS, compared to 11.0
percent in Tulare County and 10.3 percent in California. When generalized into three age groups,
3.8 percent of the city’s population under 18 years of age, 10.2 percent of the population 16 to 64
years of age, and 41.2 percent of seniors (65 years and older) had a disability in the 2010-2014
ACS. These percentages are higher for the city than for California as a whole.
SSI program statistics show the number of persons with disabilities who may have housing needs
because of their low incomes. As of December 2014, 15,442 SSI recipients in Tulare County were
receiving benefits because they were blind or disabled, with 2,728 recipients younger than 18 years
of age. (Although these figures can give a sense of the proportion of the population with different
types of disabilities, a much smaller proportion of the population may actually require specially
adapted housing to accommodate disabilities.)
The Central Valley Regional Center coordinates services for persons with developmental disabilities
(e.g., mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism), some who are able to live independently
with supportive services. According to a staff person at the Center for Independent Living, most of
the Center’s clients are on SSI and thus have very limited budgets for housing expenses. As noted
in the Fiscal Year 2014/15 Central Valley Regional Center Purchase of Service Expenditure and
Demographic Data, the CVRC serves a total of 7,720 clients aged 22 and older within its five-county
service area. The report does not break out adults between the ages of 18 and 22. The service area
has a total population of 1,995,342 (2014). Of this total, the City of Visalia has 130,000 or 6.5% of
the total population. Assuming the City has a proportionate share of clients there are 502 persons
with qualifying developmental disabilities. Housing for non-adult developmentally disabled persons
are typically under the jurisdiction of and placed in permanent housing (when not placed within the
nuclear family home) by the Child Welfare Services Agency, or in some cases by the Juvenile Court.
Consequently, the City lacks jurisdiction for the placement of non-adult developmentally disabled
persons. The City supports supportive housing and other support facilities for persons with
developmental disabilities. There are 16 adult residential care facilities with a total bed capacity of
557 (source City of Visalia 2015-2019 Consolidated Plan and Fiscal Year 2015 Action Plan). Based
on the proportionate population and available residential care facility capacities, the City may be
seen as satisfying this special housing need for adult persons, pursuant to GC Section 65583(a)(7).
The Housing Authority of the County of Tulare provides rental assistance to very low and moderate-
income families, seniors and individuals with disabilities throughout the county. They have two
projects in Visalia: Clark Court, which provides 12 units for the mentally disabled, and the
Transitional Living Center, which provides transitional housing for the mentally disabled totaling 40
occupants.
The City has a Committee for Persons with Disabilities that advises the City on the needs of disabled
people, including the public improvement projects for ADA compliance.
The City will adopt a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance addition to the Zoning Ordinance
within one year of the certification of the Housing Element (Please see Part 3, Program 5,3). The
Ordinance shall state that structures or devices necessary to facilitate access to a building for
persons with physical and non-physical disabilities shall be accommodated without the requirement
to file an application for an exception or variance. Further, Program 5.3 and the associated
Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance shall include procedures for providing exception in zoning

 and land use that may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing for persons requiring
 reasonable accommodation. For example, a housing development is allowed in any non-
 residentially zoned district (eg. Commercial or Office zone district), subject to approval of a
 Conditiona Use Permit (CUP). In the event a CUP for housing that includes a request for reasonable
 accommodation for a person or persons with disabilities, the CUP shall be evaluated and approved
 in the same manner as that of a CUP without a similar request for reasonable accommodation.
 However, any accommodations necessary to support reasonable accommodation shall not require a
 request for exception or variance as may be necessary to provide reasonable accommodation.
 In addition, announcement of this new Zoning Code allowance will be prominently displayed on the
 City website, front Community Development Department permit counter, as well as disseminated
 through the local Building Industry Association (BIA) and the City’s Disability Advocacy Committee
 (Please see Part 3, Program 5.4).

Housing Needs
Persons with disabilities in Visalia have different housing needs depending on the nature and
severity of the disability. Physically-disabled persons generally require modifications to their housing
units, such as wheelchair ramps, elevators or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinetry, and
modified fixtures and appliances. If a disability prevents a person from operating a vehicle, then
proximity to services and access to public transportation are particularly important. If a disability
prevents an individual from working or limits income, then the cost of housing and the costs of
modifications are likely to be even more challenging. Those with severe physical or mental
disabilities may also require supportive housing, nursing facilities, or care facilities. In addition,
many persons with disabilities rely solely on Social Security Income, which is insufficient for market-
rate housing.
A growing number of architects and developers are integrating universal design principles into their
buildings to increase the accessibility of the built environment. The intent of universal design is to
simplify design and construction by making products, communications, and the built environment
usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design.
Applying these principles, in addition to the regulations specified in the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA), to new construction in the city could increase the opportunities in housing and
employment for everyone. Furthermore, studies have shown the access features integrated into the
design of new facilities in the early conceptual stages increase costs less than half of one percent in
most developments.
The following are the seven principles of universal design as outlined by the Center for Universal
Design:
              Equitable Use - The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
              Flexibility in Use - The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences
               and abilities.

 Housing Element
              Simple and Intuitive - Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s
               experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
              Perceptible Information - The design communicates necessary information effectively to
               the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.
              Tolerance for Error - The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of
               accidental or unintended action.
              Low Physical Effort - The design can be used efficiently and comfortably with minimum
               fatigue.
              Size and Space for Approach and Use - Appropriate size and space is provided for
               approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or
               mobility.
 The City has adopted the 2013 California Building Code including Title 24 regulations dealing with
 accessibility for persons with disabilities. Newer housing will meet minimum standards for access for
 persons with disabilities.
 Large Families/Households
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines a large household or family
 as one with five or more members. Large families may have specific needs that differ from other
 families due to income and housing stock constraints. The most critical housing need of large
 families is access to larger housing units with more bedrooms than a standard three-bedroom
 dwelling. Multi-family rental housing units typically provide one or two bedrooms and not the three or
 more bedrooms that are required by large families. As a result, the large families that are unable to
 rent single-family houses may be overcrowded in smaller units. In general, housing for families
 should provide safe outdoor play areas for children and should be located to provide convenient
 access to schools and child-care facilities.
 Table 30A shows the number and share of large households in Visalia, Tulare County, and
 California. Approximately 16 percent of all households in Visalia had five or more persons. Of these
 large households, 3,713 were owner-occupied households and 3,110 were renter-occupied
 households. The percentage of large owner-occupied households in Visalia (14.9 percent) was
 smaller than the percentage in Tulare County (20.4 percent) and slightly larger than the percentage
 in California (13.9 percent). The percentage of large renter-occupied households in the city (18.7
 percent) was smaller than the percentage in Tulare County (25.9 percent) and larger than the
 percentage in California (14.9 percent).

Single-Parent Households
A single-parent household contains a household head and a dependent child (i.e., related or non-
related). As shown in Table 31A, there were 10,015 single-parent households with children,
comprising 24.1 percent of total households in Visalia. Nearly 69 percent of these households are
single-female households, which make up 16.6 percent of all households in the city. Single male-
headed households make up approximately 31 percent of all single-headed households, and 7.5
percent of all households in the city. The percentage of female single-headed households is slightly
higher than the county and slightly lower than the state.
Because they generally have only one potential wage earner, single-headed households, and
especially female-headed households, often have more difficulties finding adequate, affordable
housing than families with two adults. Single-headed households with small children may need to
pay for childcare, which further reduces disposable income. This special needs group will benefit
generally from expanded affordable housing opportunities. More specifically, the need for dependent
care also makes it important that housing for single-headed families be located near childcare
facilities, schools, youth services, and medical facilities.

 Farmworkers
 Farmworkers and day laborers are an essential component of California’s agriculture industry.
 Farmers and farmworkers are the cornerstone of the larger food sector, which includes the industries
 that provide farmers with fertilizer and equipment; farms to produce crops and livestock; and
 industries that process, transport, and distribute food to consumers. Farmworker households are
 often compromised of extended family members or single male workers. Many farmworker
 households tend to have difficulties securing safe, decent, and affordable housing and are often
 forced to occupy substandard homes or live in overcrowded situations. Additionally, farmworker
 households tend to have high rates of poverty, live disproportionately in housing that is in the
 poorest condition, have very high rates of overcrowding, have low homeownership rates, and are
 predominately members of minority groups.
 Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
 permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Migrant farmworkers as a group consists of individuals
 who travel not only across county lines but also from one major geographic region of California to
 another to find work. Travel for work prevents them from returning to their primary residence every
 evening. Many migrant farmworkers are single males, most of whom are married and migrate alone
 to support their families who live at home base. However, there are many migrant families who have
 more than one employed member.
 When workloads increase during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor,
 often supplied by a labor contractor. Non-migrant seasonal farmworkers consist of individuals who
 work only during a harvest season, and who are able to return to their primary residence every
 evening. This group, which includes cannery workers, is fairly significant, and includes more than
 half of all farmworkers in the state.

Permanent farmworkers comprise the smallest group of individuals employed in agriculture.
Permanent farmworkers are employed year-round, usually by one employer in the agricultural
industry. This group generally lives in rural areas in permanent housing provided by the grower.
Providing migratory or seasonal farmworkers with affordable shelter has long presented a problem.
Traditionally, growers offered some level of shelter to workers yet the availability of grower-offered
housing has dramatically decreased over the last twenty years. While housing for farmworkers is
most convenient when located on or adjacent to farms, housing affordable at very low-income levels
tends to be more feasible in cities. Housing in cities, with services located nearby, may also be
more suitable for seasonal farmworkers whose families live with them. Increasingly, farmworkers
are living in cities on a year-round basis, especially in existing single-family rental units in older
neighborhoods that offer relatively low-cost housing and its central location in relation to farmland.
U.S. Census of Agriculture is conducted every five years and gives the most recent estimate on the
number and type of farmworkers in Tulare County. Tulare County has seen an increase in farms and
a slight increase in farm workers over the five-year period (2007 to 2012). As shown in Table 32A,
from 2007 to 2012 the number of farms that hired farm labor increased by 16.4 percent and the
number of workers these farms hired increased by 1.0 percent. In 2007, there were 12,429
farmworkers in Tulare County that worked fewer than 150 days. In 2012 there were 13,502
farmworkers; an 8.6 percent increase in the number of farmworkers.

The City of Visalia has been undergoing a transition from agriculture-based industries to
metropolitan-oriented employment for many decades. The demand for substantial numbers of
transient farm laborers has evolved to a much more stable workforce that remains in residence.
Thus, the need for seasonal housing has evolved to a need for year-round housing that is
undifferentiated from the other housing demands in the city.
The Housing Authority operates a farm labor housing program. Under this program, the Housing
Authority rents 500 units to non-migratory farmworkers in six locations in Tulare County, including
Visalia. La Puente Apartments rents 15, two- and three-bedroom units. The Linnell Farm Labor

 Center, which has 191 two-, three-, and four-bedroom apartments, is located three miles east of
 Visalia near Farmersville.
 Since adoption of the 2010 Housing Element, the Employee Housing Act (EHA) (Health and Safety
 Code Section 17000 et.seq.) requires that employee housing for up to 12 units or 36 beds be
 permitted in the same manner as other residential uses in Zone districts that allow agricultural uses.
 The Zoning Ordinance allows agricultural uses in all residential zones, as well as the IL and IH (Light
 and Heavy Industrial) Zone Districts.
 Currently, employee housing is permitted by right, but only as an accessory to a primary residential
 use in the AG (Agricultural) Zone District. In light of recent State Housing Law revisions in this
 regard, the Zoning Ordinance shall be revised to be fully consistent with State Law. The Zoning
 Code provisions pertaining to employee housing shall be expanded to also permit employee housing
 by right in all residential zones and the IL and IH Zone Districts. This is in addition to being permitted
 by right in the AG Zone District (Also see Tables 54A and 54B, page 110 and 111), This Ordinance
 Amendment shall be accomplished within one year of the certification of the Housing Element
 (Please see Part 3, Program 5.9).
 Homeless Persons
 Since the 1980s, there has been a national increase in the number of homeless persons found not
 only in shelters but also in police station lobbies, emergency rooms of hospitals, camp sites, parked
 cars, all-night movie theaters, bus stations, airport terminals, hallways, alleys, abandoned buildings,
 caves, along river banks, and under bridges. Many uncounted homeless may also be living house-
 to-house until they are forced onto the street.
 Most families become homeless because they are unable to afford housing in a particular
 community. Nationwide, about half of those experiencing homelessness over the course of a year
 are single adults. Most enter and exit the system fairly quickly. The remainder essentially lives in
 the homeless assistance system, or in a combination of shelters, hospitals, the streets, jails, and
 prisons. There are also single homeless people who are not adults, including runaway and
 “throwaway” youth (children whose parents will not allow them to live at home).
 Not all homeless people are the same but many fall under several categories: the mentally ill,
 alcohol and drug users, vagrants, elderly, runaways and abandoned youths, single women with
 children who are often fleeing domestic violence, individuals and families who have recently lost jobs
 and are unable to make ends meet, the working poor, and those with jobs but whose income is too
 small to afford housing. Although each category has different specific needs, the most urgent need
 is for emergency shelter and case management (i.e., help with accessing needed services).
 Emergency shelters have minimal supportive services for homeless persons and are limited to
 occupancy of six months or less. No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter
 because of an inability to pay.
 For any community, measuring the number of homeless individuals is a difficult task, in part because
 homelessness is typically a temporary, not permanent, condition. Therefore, a more appropriate
 measure of the magnitude of homelessness is the number of people who experience homelessness
 over time, not the exact number of homeless people at any given time.

                                                                                         Housing Element
Services and facilities available for the homeless are coordinated in Visalia and Tulare County as a
“continuum of care.” The City of Visalia, with other jurisdictions and agencies in Tulare and Kings
County, developed a Continuum of Care Plan to identify gaps in services for the homeless in the two
counties and to apply for available funding for homeless services. The continuum of care begins
with a point of entry to assess the needs of a homeless individual or family. Once a needs
assessment is completed, the person or family may be referred to permanent housing or transitional
housing where supportive services are provided to prepare them for independent living. The goal of
a comprehensive homeless service system is to ensure that homeless individuals and families move
from homelessness to self-sufficiency, permanent housing, and independent living.
In 2015, the Continuum of Care group released its annual Point in Time survey of the homeless to
learn more about the demographics and needs of the homeless population in the two counties. The
following summarizes the preliminary results from the survey conducted on January 28, 2015, and
released in May 2015:
              Gender. The majority of homeless people in the City of Visalia were men (71 percent).
               Age. The majority were aged 25 to 54 years old including 25 percent between 25 to 34
               years, 20 percent between 35 to 44 years old, and 26 percent between 45 to 54 years
               old. Thirteen percent were 55 years old and over.
               Race/Ethnicity.      The majority ethnicity of homeless persons was of Non-
               Hispanic/Latino (60 percent). The remainder was Hispanic/Latino (39%) and Unknown
               (1%). The majority race of homeless persons was White (82%).
              Veteran. Approximately 6 percent were veterans.
              Domestic Violence Victim. Approximately 17 percent were the victims of domestic
               violence, 32 percent were not, and 51% were unknown.
              Disability. Overall, 41 percent reported that they were disabled. The types of
               disabilities included the following: physical (23 percent); chronic health condition (24
               percent); substance abuse (23 percent); mental illness (38 percent); and HIV/AIDS (less
               than 1 percent).
              Prior Homelessness. Approximately 22 percent reported that they had been chronically
               homeless.
              Current Housing. Approximately 43 percent reported that they were living in transitional
               housing and 29 percent in emergency housing. About 28 percent reported that they
               were living in places not intended for human accommodation.
The 2015 Point in Time survey estimated there was a total of 636 homeless people in Tulare
County, an 8 percent increase compared to the 2014 Point in Time results. The survey also shows
that Visalia had a total of 23 homeless children in 2015 (6 percent of total homeless population of
357), which was 1 percent lower than the previous year.
Table 34A includes listings of facilities which provide overnight and emergency housing to the
homeless. Most facilities are provided by Visalia Rescue Mission.

 Housing Element
 Transitional Housing
 For many jurisdictions there is a significant need for transitional housing, long-term rental assistance,
 and/or low-income rental units. Transitional housing is usually in buildings configured as rental
 housing developments, but operated with State programs that require the unit to be cycled to other
 eligible program recipients after some pre-determined amount of time. Supportive housing has no
 limit on length of stay and is linked to on-site or off-site services that assist the resident in retaining
 the housing, improving health status, maximizing ability to live independently and, when possible,
 work in the community.
 Transitional housing programs provide extended shelter and supportive services for homeless
 individuals and/or families with the goal of helping them live independently and transition into
 permanent housing. Some programs require that the individual/family transition from a short-term
 emergency shelter. The length of stay varies considerably by program but is generally longer than
 two weeks and can last up to 60 days or more. In many cases, transitional housing programs will
 provide services for up to two years or more. The supportive services may be provided directly by
 the organization managing the housing or by other public or private agencies in a coordinated effort
 with the housing provider. Transitional housing is generally provided in apartment style facilities with
 a greater degree of privacy than short-term homeless shelters; may be provided at no cost to the
 resident; and may be configured for specialized groups within the homeless population, such as
 people with substance abuse problems, homeless mentally ill, homeless domestic violence victims,
 and veterans or homeless people with AIDS/HIV. Table 34A provides a comprehensive list of the
 transitional and permanent supportive housing opportunities serving individuals in need of this type
 of housing in the City.

 Since adoption of the 2010 Housing Element, which included new provisions to accommodate
 Transitional and Supportive Housing, State law has been interpreted to require that there be no
 numerical limitations on permitting by right Transitional and Supportive housing. The current Zoning
 Ordinance sets a six person threshold for requiring a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for these types
 of housing in residential zone districts. To correct this deficiency, the City will amend the Zoning
 Ordinance to permit these uses, by right, in all Residential zone districts (Also see Table 54A, page
 116). This shall be accomplished within one year of the certification of the Housing Element (Please
 see Part 3, Program 5,3).
 Additional Supportive Housing
 In addition to the transitional and supportive housing listed in Table 34A, the State issues licenses
 for adult residential facilities that can provide supportive services in a residential environment. Adult
 residential facilities are facilities of any capacity that provide 24-hour non-medical care for adults
 ages 18 through 59 who are unable to provide for their own daily needs. Adults may be physically
 handicapped, developmentally disabled, and/or mentally disabled. There are 44 adult residential
 facilities in Visalia, with a total capacity for 293 adults. The majority (87 percent) have capacity for 6
 adults. (Source: California Department of Social Services)

Extremely Low-Income Households
Extremely low-income households are defined as those households with incomes under 30 percent
of the area median income. Extremely low-income households typically consist of minimum wage
workers, seniors on fixed incomes, the disabled, and farmworkers. This income group is likely to live
in overcrowded and substandard housing conditions. This group of households has specific housing
needs that require greater government subsidies and assistance, housing with supportive services,
single room occupancy (SRO) and or shared housing, and/or rental subsidies or vouchers. In recent
years, rising rents, higher income and credit standards imposed by landlords, and insufficient
government assistance has exacerbated the problem. Without adequate assistance this group has
a high risk of homelessness.
In Visalia, a household of three persons with an income of $20,090 in 2015 would qualify as an
extremely low-income household. Table 35 shows the number of extremely low-income households
and their housing cost burden in Visalia, Tulare County, and California in 2000. As shown in the
table, Visalia had a higher percentage (14.9 percent) of extremely low-income households than
Tulare County (13.5 percent) and the State (12 percent). Following the statewide and countywide
trends, the city had a larger proportion of extremely low-income renter households (10.7 percent)
and a smaller proportion of extremely low-income owner households (4.2 percent). In Visalia, 79.4
percent of extremely low-income households had a moderate housing cost burden. Of that 79.4
percent, 65.4 percent of extremely low-income households had a severe housing cost burden. This
was slightly higher than the cost burdens of extremely low-income households in the state.
Extremely low-income renters had a higher cost burden than owners in Visalia; 80.9 percent of
extremely low-income renters had a moderate cost burden compared to 75.6 percent of owners, and
66.9 percent of renters had a severe cost burden compared to 61.5 percent of owners. This
information suggests that there is a need for affordable rental units for extremely low-income
residents in Visalia.
Based on Visalia’s 2014-2023 regional housing needs allocation, there is a projected need for 1,308
extremely low-income housing units (which assumes 50 percent of the very low-income allocation)
within the city.

 III. Future Housing Needs
 The State of California’s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) is required to
 allocate each region’s share of the statewide housing need to Council of Government (COG) based
 on Department of Finance (DOF) population projections and regional population forecasts used in
 preparing regional transportation plans. The COG develops a Regional Housing Need Plan (RHNP)
 allocating the region’s share of the statewide need to cities and counties within the region. The
 RHNP promotes the following objectives: increase the housing supply and the mix of housing types,
 tenure, and affordability in all cities and counties within the region in an equitable manner; promote
 infill development and socioeconomic equity; protect environmental and agricultural resources;
 encourage efficient development patterns; and promote an improved intraregional balance between
 jobs and housing. Housing element law recognizes the most critical decisions regarding housing
 development occur at the local level within the context of the periodically updated general plan.
 Housing element law requires a quantification of each jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing
 need as established in the RHNP prepared by the COG. The Regional Housing Need Allocation
 (RHNA) is a minimum projection of additional housing units needed to accommodate projected
 household growth of all income levels by the end of the housing element’s statutory planning period.
 Each locality’s RHNA is distributed among five income categories (i.e., extremely low-, very low-,
 low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income) to address the required provision for planning for all
 income levels.

Regional Housing Needs Allocation
This section evaluates projected future housing needs in Visalia based on the Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA) adopted by the Tulare County Association of Governments (TCAG) in
June 2014. TCAG’s methodology is based on the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
supplied by HCD. The RHNA is broken down by income categories (i.e., extremely low-, very low-,
low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income).
TCAG allocated its RHNA using a “regional income parity” formula. The RIP applies an adjustment
factor based on disparities in household income across the TCAG region. The adjustment factor
assigns a higher proportion of units affordable to lower-income households to jurisdictions that
currently have a lower proportion of affordable households compared to the regional average and
assigns a lower proportion of affordable units to jurisdictions that currently have a higher proportion
of affordable households than the regional average. The Methodology is intended to help the region
achieve income parity (the same proportion of affordable units in each community) by 2050.
Each jurisdiction is required to report to HCD on how the fair share allocation can be accommodated
within the planning period. The allocations are intended to be used by jurisdictions when updating
their housing elements as the basis for assuring that adequate sites and zoning are available to
accommodate at least the number of units allocated. Table 36A shows the projected housing needs
for the planning period from January 1, 2014, to September 30, 2023, for Visalia.

   Needs Assessment Plan, June 2014.
As shown in the table, TCAG allocated a total need of 10,021 units to Visalia for the January 1,
2014, to September 2023, planning period. The allocation is equivalent to a yearly need of
approximately 1,028 housing units for the 9-3/4-year time period. Of the 10,021 housing units, 6,349
units are for moderate-income households and below, including 1,308 extremely low-income units,
1,308 very low-income units, 1,931 low-income units, and 1,802 moderate-income units. The total
countywide housing need is 26,910 units, of which Visalia received 36.6%, and 45.4% of the
affordable units allocation.

 Housing Element
 Comparison of Housing Unit Production with Projected Housing Needs
 One of the Housing Element’s main goals is to ensure that a variety of housing opportunities at a
 range of prices and rents are made available to residents. This includes, but not limited to,
 conventional single-family homes, multi-family apartments and town homes, and housing for special
 needs groups. Since the Housing Element planning period runs from January 1, 2014, to September
 30, 2023, Visalia’s RHNA can be reduced by the number of new units built (using building permit
 data) or approved since January 1, 2014. In this case, the RHNA has been reduced by market rate
 units constructed or approved from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015.
 Market-Rate Units: Built, Under Construction, and Approved
 This section describes the number and type of units that have been built, are under construction, or
 approved in Visalia since the start of the Housing Element planning period (i.e., January 1, 2014).
 Table 37A shows building permit data from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. As shown 924
 building permits were issued for single-family (i.e., attached or detached) houses from January 2014
 to December 2015. There were 126 multi-family units built over this same time period.

Remaining Need
Table 40A shows Visalia’s remaining RHNA based on income category and the need that has
already been satisfied during the Housing Element period (i.e., January 1, 2014, to December 31,
2015 by built and approved units). Market-rate and affordable units satisfy only about 14.4 percent
of the City’s RHNA for this Housing Element period. This leaves a remaining 8,779 units to be
accounted for in the vacant land inventory. Units for lower-income categories (i.e., extremely low-,
very low-, and low-income) have 4,201 units that need to be satisfied—about 92.4 percent remains.

 IV. Resource Inventory
The Resource Inventory section assesses the availability of land and services to meet the needs
documented in the previous Section IV (Future Housing Needs). This section discusses Visalia’s
available residentially-zoned land, calculates the buildout potential of this land, and reviews the
adequacy of services to support future housing development.
Available Sites Inventory Requirements
An adequate supply of land for residential construction is one of the most critical resources
necessary to meet future housing demand. State law governing the preparation of housing elements
emphasizes the importance of an adequate land supply by requiring that each housing element
contain “an inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities
and services to these sites” (Government Code Section 65583(a)(3). The phrase “land suitable for
residential development” in Government Code Section 65583(a)(3) includes all of the following:
       Vacant sites zoned for residential use;
       Vacant sites zoned for nonresidential use that allows residential development;

 Part 1. Background Report                                                                    City of Visalia
 Housing Element
        Residentially zoned, underutilized sites that are capable of being developed at a higher
         density; and
        Vacant or underutilized sites zoned for nonresidential use that can be rezoned for, and as
         necessary, redeveloped for, residential use.
 Without adequate vacant land, Visalia cannot demonstrate how it will accommodate its regional
 housing need allocation. The amount of land required to accommodate future housing needs
 depends on its physical characteristics, zoning, availability of public facilities and services, and
 environmental conditions.
 In order to calculate the number of units that will accommodate its share of the regional housing
 need for lower-income households, a jurisdiction is required to do either of the following
 (Government Code Section 65583.2I(3)):
        Provide an analysis demonstrating how the adopted densities accommodate this need. The
         analysis shall include, but is not limited to, factors such as market demand, financial
         feasibility, or information based on development project experience within a zone or zones
         that provide housing for lower-income households.
        Use the “default density standards” that are “deemed appropriate” in State law to
         accommodate housing for lower-income households given the type of the jurisdiction. Visalia
         is classified as a “metropolitan jurisdiction” even though it is within a county that is considered
         a “suburban jurisdiction” because its population is over 100,000, meaning the default density
         standard is “sites allowing at least 30 units per acre.” HCD is required to accept sites that
         meet this density standard as appropriate for accommodating Visalia’s share of the regional
         housing need for lower-income households.
 The extent to which the City has “adequate sites” for housing affordable to very low- or low-income
 households will depend, in part, on General Plan and zoning standards, particularly typical density,
 parking, building coverage, height, and set-back standards.
 Once the City has demonstrated that it has the theoretical development capacity to accommodate
 the RHNA, it has two obligations. First, the City must maintain a “no net loss” policy of its residential
 development capacity over the five-year housing element timeframe. Sites listed in the adopted
 Housing Element land inventory may not be down-zoned to lower density residential uses or
 rezoned to non-residential uses, unless the City up-zones/rezones alternative sites prior to the
 density reduction or rezone on the inventoried site. Second, the City must continue to allocate
 available funding resources to and facilitate the development of affordable housing, as it has done
 frequently in the past. The City is not obligated to ensure construction of low income housing on any
 particular site within its city limits.
 Methodology
 The City developed an accurate picture of Visalia’s residential development potential as of August
 2015. The inventory identifies vacant and underutilized sites that could accommodate new
 residential development within the city limits. The City identified available sites based on existing
 city records, aerial photography, and field observation and then mapped the sites using its
 Geographic Information System (GIS).

                                                                                          Housing Element
Land Use Designation and Affordability
Visalia is one of the most affordable housing markets in California. Because of low land costs,
housing type and density is not much of a factor in reducing the affordability gap as it is in other
jurisdictions throughout California. As a result, affordable housing projects are developed in almost
every residential zone, regardless of the allowable density. Table 39A shows several deed-
restricted affordable housing projects that were zoned for medium-density residential uses. These
affordable housing projects include the following:
        Visalia Village: zoned/designated R-M-D/RMD; 36 very low-income units (new construction);
        115 E. Main St., Commercial space converted to apartment units, 6 units moderate income::
         zoned/designated C-DT/C-DT (new construction);
        105-117 NW Strawberry Street Apartments: zoned/designated R-1-6/RLD; 4 units of
         abandoned apartments converted to very low-income units (rehabilitation).
For the purposes of this analysis, this Housing Element takes a conservative approach to identifying
appropriate sites for the RHNA’s five income groups. This inventory assumes that above moderate-
income households will only be accommodated in lower density zoned sites (i.e., R-1-20, R-1-12.5,
R-1-6, and R-A districts). The development of housing for affordable and lower-income households
can be accommodated on a range of land use designations that include low, medium, and high
density residential and various commercial, office, and industrial designations as demonstrated in
Table 41 below. Housing Elements are required to identify sites that can accommodate a
jurisdiction’s share of affordable and lower-income households, and must include an analysis that
demonstrates appropriate densities to facilitate such housing. Visalia has been assigned as a
suburban jurisdiction with a default density of at least 20 units per acre as appropriate for meeting its
low-income household allocation.
The analysis in this chapter concludes that Visalia has adequate sites to accommodate all of its
RHNA allocation for Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low Income categories in land use designations
with default density standards above 20 units per acre. In the Extremely Low and Very Low Income
categories there is a remaining need of 2,553 units, and Table 43A reveals that there are available
sites with R-M-3 zone having a typical density of 23 units / acre (maximum density of 35 units / acre)
that can accommodate 3,276 units. In the Low Income category there is a remaining need of 1,648
units, and Tables 44A, 45A, and 46A reveal that there are available sites in commercial zones
having typical densities between 40 and 80 units / acre that can accommodate 3,002 units. The
inventoried densities that are used to calculate each site’s inventories units towards the RHNA
reflect the typical densities in each land use designation.
Table 41 summarizes the land use designations and corresponding zoning districts that were
assumed to meet each income category. These land use designations were retained with the City’s
General Plan Update, adopted in October 2014. The exception is the addition of the CMU
(Commercial Mixed Use) land use designation. This designation was added to the land use
inventory specifically to encourage and facilitate higher density residential development integral with
commercial developments. Each land use designation corresponds with at least one zoning district,
in some cases more than one. For example, the commercial land use designations (e.g., CDT, CS,

 The sites inventory assumes that the RHD land use designation, and the corresponding R-M-3
 district, provides sufficient density for the construction of extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
 units. Additionally, the inventory assumes that the RMD land use designation, and corresponding R-
 M-2 district, provides sufficient density for the construction of low-income units. The sites inventory
 assumes that the R-1-4.5 zoning district is suitable for moderate-income units because of the
 number of lower-income housing projects built under this zone. For example, the Mill Creek Parkway
 Family Apartments, located at 3433 East Manzanita Drive, are on land designated RLD, and zoned
 R-1-4.5. This project is 100 percent affordable with 35 units for very low-income and 34 units for
 low-income households. Projects like Mill Creek Parkway Family Apartments demonstrate that the

R-1-4.5 district provides sufficient density to accommodate affordable housing projects for lower-
income households in addition to moderate-income households.
While density is important in determining affordability of a project, the size of a site can also
determine the feasibility of developing an affordable housing project. The inventory includes several
small parcels (less than 0.5 acres) that are available for higher-density residential development. The
majority of these parcels are adjacent to other vacant or underutilized parcels and could be
consolidated into larger sites suitable for an affordable housing project. However, vacant and
underutilized parcels in the inventory that are not contiguous with other parcels have been
inventoried as available for moderate-income projects. This assumption is based on the project
types (e.g., small multi-family project, four-plex, duplex) that could be expected on these small
parcels.
The sites inventory includes a significant amount of land that is zoned for commercial zones that
allow a wide range of residential uses and densities. Many of these parcels are underutilized and/or
targeted for redevelopment because they are located within a redevelopment project area or has
been identified in a strategic plan. These sites are largely located in strategic growth areas, such as
the East Downtown Visalia, Central Business District, and along the South Mooney Boulevard
corridor. The City intends to revitalize these areas through the construction of mixed use
development and a variety of housing types.
Available Sites Inventory
Vacant Sites
Moderate and Above Moderate-Income Unit Potential
The RHNA for moderate and above-moderate units can be accommodated on vacant land
designated Residential Very Low Density (RVLD) and Residential Low Density (RLD), which
comprises a large majority of the vacant residential land inside the City limits. This analysis takes a
conservative approach by assuming that lower density residential designations/zones will
accommodate only above-moderate income households. As of January 1, 2016, there are 1,347
acres of vacant land designated RLD, which has a total capacity for approximately 7,005 units of
above moderate and moderate-income units. Visalia also has a limited supply of land (39 acres)
designated RVLD with a total capacity for approximately 77 above moderate-income units.
Moderate income units are inventoried for sites with R-1-4.5 zoning, and above moderate income
units are inventoried for all RLD-designated sites with zoning other than R-1-4.5 and for all RVLD-
designated sites. As shown in Table 42A, there is a potential for 7,082 units under the RLD and
RVLD designations. Parcel-specific information for moderate income level site (R-1-4.5 zoning) is
located in Appendix B (Table B-1).
The lot counts were based on the City of Visalia’s current General Plan Land use designations,
which were comprehensively updated in October 2014 following the update of its General Plan, and
the City’s current Zoning designations for sites with an R-1-4.5 zoning. The City’s zoning
designations are currently being updated to reflect the corresponding General Plan land use
designation as part of the ongoing Zoning Ordinance Update, which is expected to be completed in
August 2016                                                                                        Page 61

 Lower-Income Unit Potential
 The RHNA for Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low units can be accommodated on vacant land
 designated Residential Medium Density (RMD) and Residential High Density (RHD) designations.
 As of January 1, 2016, there are 417 acres of vacant residential land with a development capacity of
 6,569 units. A summary of the total units is shown in Table 43A, with parcel-specific information
 located in Appendix B (Table B-1). High-density residential sites (RHD designation) have the
 capacity for 3,276 units, using a typical density of 23 units per acre. Medium-density residential sites
 (RMD designation) have a capacity for 3,293 units, using a typical density of 12 units per acre. As
 mentioned previously, the lot counts were based on the City of Visalia’s current General Plan Land
 use designations, which were comprehensively updated in October 2014 following the update of its
 General Plan.       The corresponding zoning designations are being updated to reflect the
 corresponding General Plan land use designation as part of the ongoing Zoning Ordinance Update,
 which is expected to be completed in late 2016/early 2017. As of 2015, the amount of lands
 currently zoned for medium or high density residential zoning (i.e. R-M-2 or R-M-3 zone) are less

than the amount of lands designated as RMD and RHD. With regard to infill sites primarily in the
Downtown, East Downtown, and Mooney Corridor areas, no minimum density is prescribed for sites
identified as potential re-development for very high density or mixed use projects. Consequently,
there is the potential that future development projects could propose residential densities that are
below those corresponding to housing affordable for lower income occupants. New Housing
Element Policies 9-4 and 9-5 have been added to ensure that full ongoing accounting for anticipated
residential densities shown on the RHNA Land Inventory compared with actual development
densities are reconciled on a project by project basis and annually by aggregate in the Annual
Report.

Underutilized Sites
The City has identified several areas with infill, redevelopment, and adaptive reuse opportunities that
could lead a variety of housing types close to its existing core, including the Downtown, East
Downtown, and South Mooney Boulevard Corridor. The sites identified in the following paragraphs
include a summary of both physically and economically underutilized sites.
Downtown
The City of Visalia has made a strong commitment to revitalizing its Downtown area. That
commitment has been demonstrated by the redevelopment of underutilized parcels to high-density
residential development. In 2003, Oak Meadows, a six-story, 60-unit housing project that
accommodates very-low income seniors, was constructed on a 0.6 acre site at a density of 100 units
per acre. Additionally, the 100-unit, ten story Town Meadows senior apartment complex was
constructed in 1980 on a .76 acre site at a density of over 130 units per acre . Both senior
apartments were developed in the Downtown area under the Central Business District designation.
During the Housing Element update period (2015 – 2023), the City feels that other downtown sites
could develop/redevelop with projects with a comparable density. This is based on the demand for;
in particular, senior housing due to the City and Tulare County’s growing senior population, and the
need for both affordable market rate and deed-restricted housing as land costs have returned to pre-
recession levels. Additionally, the Downtown area has sufficient infrastructure to serve these sites at
the targeted densities. Notably, the City has numerous public parking lots throughout the Downtown
area. This can facilitate a substantial reduction of otherwise required on-site parking, thus
substantially contributing to the ability for development densities at 80 units per acre and above.
This inventory identifies seven developed-but-economically underutilized sites that have potential for
redevelopment within the Housing Element timeframe. These sites were selected because they
have strong potential for high-density residential uses, have low improvement-to-land cost ratios, are
pedestrian-friendly, and located less than ¼ mile from prime transit services.
Although there are many underutilized commercial sites (that allow residential), the sites identified in
Table 44A are similar in nature to the Oak Meadows site and are the most suitable for
redevelopment as a residential use. Four of the sites are designated as Central Business District
(CDT) and the other three as Service Commercial (CS). Both of these designations and their
corresponding zoning districts allow high-density, multi-family residential with a use permit. Since
there is no maximum density specified, densities are determined by how appropriate they are to the
surrounding neighborhood.
For the purposes of this analysis, an assumption of 22 units per acre for five of the sites, and 40
units per acre for two of the sites (094-283-001 and 093-201-008 thru 093-201-020) is used to
determine potential capacity of these sites. This is a substantial reduction in reliance on density
potential for RHNA purposes than the80 units per acre potential capacity of these sites contained in
the 2010 RHNA Land Inventory. Based on an updated review of the sites, including development
rends and the verification of infrastructure availability to each of the sites, the density is purposely
conservative in calculating density at only 33 percent of the densities of past projects (i.e., Oak
Meadows and Towne Meadows). Using the previous density assumptions, the seven sites could
accommodate 904 high-density, multi-family units.

 Housing Element
 The two sites for which 40 units per acre are anticipated are based on the City’s intent to leverage its
 ownership of these larger and fully developable sites, with a not for profit affordable housing
 developer. The terms of such a partnership will be contingent on the partnering developer to achieve
 this minimum density. (Program 9.4)
 This density range is substantially conservative compared with Downtown medium and high rise
 affordable housing project in comparable Central Valley cities, such as Fresno (Silvercrest, 121
 units/ac on 1.3 acre site), Modesto (Ralston Towers 11 stories), Stockton (Silvercrest, 5 stories on
 less than 1 acre), and the recently approved Anchor Village in downtown Stockton (51 units, 72
 units/acre).In addition, the downtown hospital district has continued to experience growth, including
 hospital expansion and ancillary office growth. Before the recession, this growth has generated
 additional demand for office, retail, and residential uses in the downtown. All of the underutilized
 sites identified in Figure 7 are within walking distance of the hospital district.
 With regard to infill sites primarily in the Downtown area, no minimum density is prescribed for sites
 identified as potential re-development for very high density or mixed use projects. Consequently,
 there is the potential that future development projects could propose residential densities that are
 below those corresponding to housing affordable for lower income occupants. New Housing
 Element Programs 9-4 and 9-5 have been added to ensure that full ongoing accounting for
 anticipated residential densities shown on the RHNA Land Inventory compared with actual
 development densities are reconciled on a project by project basis and annually by aggregate in the
 Annual Report, or in partnership negotiations with affordable housing development entities.

East Downtown
The East Downtown is a 175-acre area located immediately east of the existing downtown. The
areas is comprised primarily of industrial, warehouse, and service commercial uses dominated by
auto sales and repair. There are also several vacant lots, large underutilized parking lots, and
abandoned buildings dispersed throughout the area. As described in Table B-2A, most of the
existing uses on the sites in the inventory are dilapidated or abandoned industrial, warehouse, or
auto service buildings; unused parking areas, or vacant lots. Many of the structures are metal sheds
and junk yards, which could easily be removed. While the entire East Downtown area could be
considered underutilized, the inventory does not include all potential housing sites in the East
Downtown, but only those with significant redevelopment potential. With the release of the East
Downtown Strategic Plan (2005) and other efforts, the City has demonstrated a strong commitment
to revitalizing its downtown. The City prepared the East Downtown Strategic Plan in 2005 to create
a strategy for encouraging residential and commercial reinvestment in the area directly east of the
Central Business District. The plan identifies over 80 acres of opportunity sites, including vacant
land and developed sites with strong redevelopment and adaptive reuse potential. The City controls
40 acres of vacant land in this area. One of the primary strategies of the plan emphasizes mixed-use
development, adaptive reuse of older buildings, and new construction that reinforces the creation of
new neighborhoods. The plan anticipated the development of over 1,000 residential units and 1.15
million square feet of employment space. There are three phases of development identified in the
plan: near-term (2005 to 2010), mid-term (2011 to 2020), and long-term (2020 and beyond). Some
of the sites have already transitioned or are in the process of transitioning to more urban uses. For
example, the Downtown Visalia Transit Center is located in the East Downtown. The City also
cleared another City-owned site using Federal brownfield grants.
The East Downtown Strategic Plan identifies three neighborhoods (Santa Fe, East Main, and Central
Park) with the strongest potential for residential development in the near and mid-term. A
description of the expected housing types and buildout potential for these three neighborhoods is as
follows:
        Santa Fe Neighborhood. The Santa Fe neighborhood is envisioned to become a mixed-use
            commercial district with residential uses as a secondary use to complement offices in
            mixed-use projects. This neighborhood’s proximity to Downtown’s restaurants and the
            transit station provides amenities that are already available to those interested in a
            downtown lifestyle. This neighborhood has seven acres of vacant and underutilized land
            that have potential for 86 dwelling units within the timeframe of the Housing Element. This
            dwelling unit assumption is based on an assumed density of 23.5 units per acre. Since the
            Santa Fe neighborhood is a mixed-use neighborhood that emphasizes commercial and
            employment uses, with residential uses as a secondary use, the Housing Element
            inventory assumes only 50 percent of the site capacity will develop as residential uses and
            the other 50 percent will develop as commercial.
             Since adoption of the previous Housing Element Update, three sites have been
             developed for the expansion of the Family Healthcare Network Downtown campus, which
             removes them from the available residential sites inventory (please see Table 45A).
        East Main Street.    East Main is the largest neighborhood and has the opportunity to develop
            a variety of housing types through the development on vacant land and the adaptive reuse

             of buildings into lofts, stacked flats, and townhomes. Adaptive re-use in this context means
             utilizing a candidate site’s existing features for the re-development of the site to a
             residential or mixed use. Such features may include existing utility connections, or unique
             building design or materials that would enhance the attraction and uniqueness for the site
             as a residential or mixed use.
   The area has a large number of existing buildings that can be adaptively reused for commercial
   and/or residential uses. Many of these buildings are single-story consisting of large open
   buildings. The area has a greater amount of vacant and underutilized land that can be developed
   with new construction consisting of new multi-story mixed use buildings and residential
   townhomes and other dwellings consistent with the area’s new general plan designation of
   Commercial Mixed Use. The plan envisions early opportunities for ownership townhouse projects
   that take advantage of a proven market and financial feasibility.
   This neighborhood has approximately27.3 acres of land of vacant and underutilized land that have
   potential for 504 dwelling units within the timeframe of the Housing Element based on an assumed
   density of 25 units per acre. The sites with the greatest potential for reaching the 25 units per acre
   density would be the vacant and underutilized sites, being that these sites can be developed with
   multiple levels. Since East Main Street neighborhood is envisioned as a primarily residential
   neighborhood with complementary commercial uses, the Housing Element inventory assumes that
   75 percent of the site capacity will develop as residential uses. This assumption accounts for 25
   percent of the area potentially developing as non-residential uses.
          Central Park Neighborhood.        The Central Park Neighborhood is envisioned as five blocks
             of townhouses, stacked flats and apartments with ground floor commercial or live-work
             uses facing the park and Burke Street. This neighborhood has approximately 1.5 acres of
             vacant and underutilized land that have potential for 28 dwelling units within the timeframe
             of the Housing Element based on an assumed density of 25 units per acre. Like the East
             Main Street neighborhood, the Central Park Neighborhood is envisioned as a primarily
             residential neighborhood and the Housing Element assumes that 75 percent of the site
             capacity will develop as residential uses and 25 percent as non-residential.
 Since adoption of the previous Housing Element Update, two parcels in this area were selected as
 the location for the City’s new Public Safety and Emergency Operations Center Consequently they
 have been removed from the available residential sites inventory (please see Table 45A).
 The new General Plan adopted in October 2014, continues the East Downtown Strategic Plan vision
 of a vibrant mixed use area. The underlying CS land use and zoning designation is changed to
 CMU (Commercial Mixed Use) to reinforce this vision.
 Table 45A is a summary of the sites available for higher-density development within the East
 Downtown Strategic Plan area. Table B-2 in Appendix B shows detailed, parcel-specific information
 about the sites in each neighborhood, including existing uses. Figure 8 illustrates the location of
 each of the sites. The residential buildout potential for the Santa Fe, East Main, and Central Park
 neighborhoods in the East Downtown area has been revised from a previous 1,393 dwelling units
 (1,360 lower-income and 33 moderate-income units) to 619 units (605 Low Income and 14 Moderate

Income units). Their average expected density of 25 dwelling units per acre demonstrates these
units have significant potential to accommodate moderate-, and low--income households.
With regard to infill sites primarily in the East Downtown area, no minimum density is prescribed for
sites identified as potential re-development for very high density or mixed use projects.
Consequently, there is the potential that future development projects could propose residential
densities that are below those corresponding to housing affordable for lower income occupants.

Market Feasibility
An analysis of real estate market conditions was prepared in mid-2004 to assist in identification of
planning objectives for East Downtown. The analysis focused on the following:
        Existing real estate market conditions for office, retail and residential uses;
        Potential real estate development opportunities for office, retail and residential uses; and

          Role and capacity of the Redevelopment Agency to assist in implementation of a strategic
             plan.
 Based on the 2004 market study, and as re-analyzed in the 2014 General Plan Update, there
 appears to be potential demand for development of urban scale, detached or attached single family
 housing units, such as town homes, condominiums and/or live-work/loft housing units. There also
 appears to be the potential to develop additional rental units in smaller developments that are of an
 urban scale and density (e.g., stacked flats). Initial new developments could include two- to four-
 story buildings, either as stand-alone residential or as part of mixed-use (i.e. over office uses). The
 density range anticipated for underutilized and infill sites primarily in the Downtown, east Downtown
 and Mooney Corridor areas, is consistent with Downtown medium and high rise affordable housing
 project in comparable Central Valley cities, such as Fresno (Silvercrest, 121 units/ac on 1.3 acre
 site), Modesto (Ralston Towers 11 stories), Stockton (Silvercrest, 5 stories on less than 1 acre), and
 the recently approved Anchor Village in downtown Stockton (51 units, 72 units/acre). However, a
 typical density of only 25 units per acre is used to determine potential capacity of these sites. This is
 a substantial reduction in reliance on density potential for RHNA purposes than the 40 units per acre
 potential capacity of these sites contained in the 2010 RHNA Land Inventory. Based on an updated
 review of the sites, including development rends and the verification of infrastructure availability to
 each of the sites, the density is purposely conservative in calculating density at only 60 percent of
 the densities of past estimates.
 Redesignation/Rezoning
   The 2014 General Plan Update formally establishes two new land use designations: CMU
 (Commercial Mixed Use), and DMU (Downtown Mixed Use). Both of these new designations
 encourage vertical and horizontal mixed use developments. Both designations encourage high
 commercial floor area ratios (2.0 for CMU and 5.0 for DMU), and also allow residential densities as
 high as the site and setting can facilitate. The CR (Regional Commercial) Zone District ( VMC
 Section 17.18.010 B 6) sets forth the development standards and allowances that facilitate mixed
 use developments within the density ranges envisioned by the Housing Element.
 As is customary, as well as required by State Planning law, the City is currently updating its Zoning
 Code (VMC Title 17) and Zoning map to incorporate the Code and Map changes prescribed by the
 General Plan update. The Zoning use and development standards will further expand the existing
 measures that will facilitate development projects in conformance with the new commercial Zone
 Districts.
 Second Units
 Second units can be an important source of affordable housing since they can be constructed
 relatively cheaply because of no associated land costs and most often do not require government
 subsidies to bridge the affordability gap. In addition, second units provide other benefits, such as
 supplemental income to the homeowner and “lifecycle housing” for seniors.
 Thirty-four second units were built between 2004 and 2015 (see Table 47A). The requirement for the
 home owner to occupy one of the two units on the property is a Zoning Code detractor among
 inquiries received by the City. This requirement is intended to avoid a situation where unmanaged

 Adequacy of Public Facilities and Infrastructure
 This section addresses the adequacy of public facilities and services (i.e., water and sewer services)
 to accommodate planned residential growth through the end of the Housing Element planning period
 (September 30, 2023). The following information regarding the adequacy of public facilities and
 infrastructure is based largely on information provided directly from the California Water Services
 Company and the Superintendent of the City of Visalia Wastewater Treatment Plant.
 Water
 The California Water Services Company is the water service provider for the City of Visalia. The
 City’s water supply system consists of a total of 74 groundwater wells and an underground network
Page 76

City of Visalia                                                                                         Part 1. Backg
                                                                                       Housing Element
of interconnected subsystems located throughout the city. The total number of wells that are
operational at any given time depend on current water demands and routine maintenance of the
wells. There is an overall pumping capacity of about 69 million gallons per day (mgd). In 2015, the
average pumping capacity was about 32 mgd. Visalia, along with the majority of California cities is
in the fourth year of a severe drought. The City faces a critical water supply issue, owing to its sole
reliance on underground aquafers that provide the City with its potable water supply.
The City declared a Mandatory Stage 2 Condition of its previously approved Water Conservation
Ordinance in order to preserve the underground water supply. The key to the City’s strategy to
preserve the underground water supply is to reduce water consumption by limiting landscaping
watering, which is the largest source of urban water consumption. By reducing water consumption,
in conjunction with an ambitious groundwater recharge program (discussed below), the City can
ensure that water service is available to homes and industries even after the end of the current
Housing Element reporting period (2023).
Groundwater recharge: The City embarked upon an ambitious groundwater recharge program even
before the onset of the current statewide drought conditions. The City and its water service provider
(California Water Service Co.) noted the severe overdraft situation occurring as the City’s population
increased year over year. The City instituted a groundwater impact fee in 2010. The proceeds of
this fee have been used to construct an extensive system of surface water capture, including water
purchases from area agricultural irrigation water providers. In addition, a major feature of the City’s
$125 million wastewater treatment plant upgrade includes treating water to tertiary standards and re-
directing the treated water back to the City for park landscaping purposes.
Sewer
The City of Visalia owns and operates a wastewater treatment facility that provides sewerage
service to about 135,000 residents of Visalia and Goshen. According to Jim Ross, Superintendent
of the treatment plant, the average daily flow in February 2009 was 13 million gallons per day (mgd).
The plant has a maximum design capacity of 22 mgd, which is more than sufficient to meet the
needs of the current (2014) and at least through the end of the Housing Element time frame (year
2023). According to Mr. Ross, no capacity issues are anticipated over the time frame of this
Housing Element. While no shortage of future capacity or need to prioritize provision of sewer
service, new General Plan Housing Element Program 3.20 has been added to ensure that projects
offering market rate or assisted projects that have the potential to provide housing affordable to
lower-income residents receive priority sewer service.

 Inventory of Local, State, and Federal Housing and Financing Programs
 The City of Visalia utilizes local, State, and Federal funds to implement its housing strategy. More
 than one source of public funds is typically required to construct an affordable housing development.
 The City of Visalia does not act as a developer in the production of market-rate or affordable units,
 but relies primarily upon the private sector to develop new units with the assistance of these various
 public funding sources.
 Local Agency and Administrative Resources
 The City of Visalia Community Development Department and the Housing Authority of Tulare County
 (HATC) are the two major governmental agencies responsible for local housing programs.
 Additionally, the City works closely with non-profit organizations involved in affordable housing
 funding and programs in the city such as Community Services and Training, Inc. (CSET), Self-Help
 Enterprises, Inc. (SHE) and Habitat for Humanity of Tulare County. This section describes the roles,
 funding and programs they administer.
 City of Visalia
 The Community Development Department is responsible for administering State and Federal grants,
 for affordable housing activity in the City of Visalia. Previously, the responsibility was held by the
 Visalia Redevelopment Agency, Redevelopment Division.
 In order to provide affordable housing opportunities to the community, the City relies on several
 sources of funding to accomplish its goals including, but not limited to: Community Development
 Block Grant Funds (CDBG); HOME Investment Partnership funds (HOME); and remaining
 Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) funding. The City will also consider pursuing funding
 under the federal Affordable Housing & Sustainable Communities (AHSC) program.
 The City of Visalia is an entitlement community under the CDBG program and a participating
 jurisdiction under the guidelines of the HOME program. The City receives funds annually; however,
 the allocation is based on the federal budget. For example the City received a grant allocation of
 approximately $1,108,150 of CDBG funds and $338,898 of HOME funds for FY 2015. Projects
 benefiting from the use of these funds, from 2010 to 2015 include:
         Sierra Meadows. In partnership with Christian Church Homes, in 2011, completed a 42-unit
             senior complex. The City provided $2.8 million in HOME funding toward the $9.6 million
             dollar project, which included approximately $6.3 million in HUD Section 202 funding. The
             non-profit developer was the first LEED Gold certified HUD Section 202 recipient in
             California.
         Highland Gardens. In partnership with Self -Help Enterprises, construction began in
             December 2015, on this 36-unit multi-family project for Low and Very-Low income qualified
             families. The City contributed $2.0 million HOME-Community Housing Development
             Organization (CHDO) Funds toward the $8.3 million project.

       Foreclosure Acquisition Program II. The City utilized its HOME funds between 2012 and
            2015 to acquire eight (8) single family dwellings, rehabilitated and resold to income
            qualifying households at or below eighty-percent (80%) of the area median income.
       Self-Help Enterprises (CHDO) Acquisition/Rehabilitation Projects. The City provided
            HOME- CHDO funding to its certified CHDO, a 501c, non-profit agency in 2015, who
            continues to acquire both single and multi-family properties and rehabilitate. To date, SHE
            has acquired and resold four (4) single family homes, and acquired one 5-unit multi-family
            complex, which SHE will continue to own, providing affordable rents to very low and low
            income tenants.
The City received a one-time $2.3 million Neighborhood Stabilization Program grant through the
Housing and Economic Recovery Act in 2008. The City re-purposed these funds as program
income, creating additional funding over $3.2 million to acquire foreclosed homes, rehabilitate and
resale to income qualifying households. Affordable housing was provided to 42 households, of
which 16 were households with income at or below 50% of the area median income. This included a
partnership with Habitat for Humanity, who continues their efforts with the remaining funding.
The Redevelopment Agency of the City of Visalia was established in 1968 for the primary purpose of
eliminating blighted conditions, developing a strong economic base, and providing affordable
housing opportunities to low income households. The Redevelopment Agency was dissolved in
2012 by State legislation, along with all redevelopment agencies throughout the State. The City of
Visalia elected to retain the housing assets and functions previously performed by the
Redevelopment Agency, pursuant to Parts reflected under Division 24 of the California Health and
Safety Code. The functions of the successor (housing) are now performed by the City’s Community
Development Department. Projects completed since 2008 include:
       Paradise & Court. In 2010, in partnership with Kaweah Management Company, the City
            provided $500,000 in HOME Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO)
            funds and $500,000 Redevelopment set-aside funds, towards the $3.9Milllion dollar multi-
            family development. This project developed nine (9) new two-story units and rehabilitated
            eleven (11) existing single-story units and 4-9 percent tax credits for Kaweah Management
            Company.
       East Kaweah Project. In partnership with Kaweah Management Company, the City’s
            Redevelopment Agency provided $480,000 in Low Mod funding, prior to the dissolution of
            the Redevelopment Agency. This allowed demolition of a distressed six unit multi-family
            complex, with re-construction of eight multi-family units.
Housing Authority of the County of Tulare (HATC)
The Housing Authority of the County of Tulare (HATC) was established in 1945 pursuant to the
United States Housing Act of 1937 and state enabling legislation. By the mid-1950s the Housing
Authority had assumed the management responsibilities of two farm labor housing centers, which
were built in the late 1930s by the Federal government.
The mission of the Housing Authority of the County of Tulare (HATC) is to provide affordable, well-
maintained rental housing to qualified families. As a result of the high demand for housing for

 working families, seniors, and disabled individuals and households, HACT prioritizes these
 populations in its delivery of housing assistance. HACT has implemented regulations which
 standardize priority to house families and single persons who are near-elderly (55 or over), disabled,
 handicapped, or displaced by Government Action. Eligible applicants are housed prior to single
 persons who do not qualify for one of those categories.
 Over time, HATC has incorporated numerous programs into its housing portfolio — many of which
 are funded by different types of agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
 Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Tax Credit Allocation Committee of the
 State Treasurer’s Office, California’s Rental Housing Construction Program, HOME, City
 Redevelopment Agencies (RDA) and other local agencies. Currently, HACT provides affordable
 rental housing to over 5,000 households throughout the County.
 HACT is a public housing authority with jurisdiction within the City and the County. It administers
 federal and state funds for its public housing projects and government-assisted housing units, such
 as Section 8 and Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers.
 HATC provides funding and programs for below moderate-income households: the Housing Choice
 Vouchers Program (HCVP), Public Housing, Farm Labor Centers, and Senior Housing. The Public
 Housing Program provides rental assistance in four main areas: Visalia, Tulare, Porterville and the
 north county area. Through the Farm Labor Centers, the Housing Authority manages five farm labor
 housing developments throughout the county.
 Community Services Employment Training, Inc.
 Community Services Employment Training (CSET) is a non-profit organization that provides a
 variety of community services for Tulare County. Their mission is to strengthen youth, families, and
 communities and reduce the causes of poverty. Established in 1976, CSET has partnered with the
 City of Visalia on multiple affordable housing programs including: foreclosure counseling,
 weatherization programs, utility assistance, housing assistance, and senior home repair.
 CSET devotes more than $50,000 a year in HUD Permanent Supportive Housing grant funds
 exclusively to Visalia to house and support persons who would otherwise be homeless. CSET
 administers another larger HUD Permanent Supportive Housing grant to serve homeless persons
 throughout Tulare County, some of them located in Visalia. CSET is pursuing a HUD Rapid
 Rehousing grant that would allow Tulare County residents who have recently lost their homes to
 settle quickly into safe and stable housing and avoid chronic homelessness. CSET provided over $1
 million in Rapid Rehousing services to Tulare County when ARRA stimulus funds were available.
 CSET’s state certified and federally recognized 21CSC youth conservation corps, the Sequoia
 Community Corps, provides labor for several affordable housing programs. In partnership with Self-
 Help Enterprises, its construction training crews work side by side with home owners and
 supervisors in building new self-help housing in several locations. Corps members also help with
 home repairs and installation of weatherization measures.
 During the 2013-14 fiscal year, CSET and the Corps weatherized 243 homes; placed 21 households
 in permanent supportive housing; provided utility assistance to 22,810 clients; provided rental or

Self Help Enterprises, Inc.
Self-Help Enterprises (SHE) is a nationally recognized community development organization whose
mission is to work together with low-income families to build and sustain healthy homes and
communities. In the last 50 years, SHE has helped more than 6,000 families build their own homes,
rehabilitated over 6,000 unsafe homes, developed over 1,300 units of affordable rental housing and
has provided technical assistance for reliable access to safe drinking water and sanitary sewer
infrastructures to more than 160 small communities.
SHEs’ commitment to providing resources and training for individuals builds capacity of highly
effective leaders in communities that also promote collaborative solutions for improving
communities. These combined efforts have touched the lives of over 50,000 families, providing
security and stability for families and building strong, healthy and sustainable communities.
SHE develops quality, affordable rental apartments to serve the housing needs of low-income Valley
residents and underserved farmworker communities. Residents in these underserved communities
face over-crowding and overpaying, with most working families struggling to obtain decent,
affordable housing for their families. Affordable rental apartments are important to the sustainability
of communities and developing an overall vibrant community. All of SHE’s rental communities are
professionally managed and are located near schools, bus lines and other community services. The
rental housing communities are developed with ample space inside and outside along with plenty of
green space and play areas for children. They also feature multi-use community centers complete
with computer labs and kitchen facilities. SHE’s rental communities also feature: energy efficient
appliances, gas stove/oven, dishwasher, refrigerator and central air conditioning and heat.
SHE’s newest project and first project in Visalia, Highland Gardens, features 36-affordable one- and
two-bedroom rental units. The project includes a centrally located community building, open
recreation space, a community garden, solar PV to offset 100% of the electrical consumption, and a
robust offering of resident services, such as an after school program and financial literacy classes.
Funding Programs and Financial Resources
The City of Visalia and its non-profit partners have access to a variety of existing and potential
funding sources available for affordable housing activities. The City leverages Federal and local
housing funds (i.e., CDBG, HOME Funds) to assist non-profit developers in delivering affordable
housing in the city. Described below are programs in which the City provides matching funds, and/or
services to the community, in relation to affordable housing, rehabilitation, preservation, and fair
housing education:
     •   SHE-CHDO Scattered Single Family Acquisition/Rehabilitation/Resale. The Community
         Housing Development Organization (CHDO) Scattered Site Acquisition, Rehabilitation and

          Designated (funded ) property unit(s).
      •   Neighborhood Stabilization Program. As part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act
          of 2008, the Federal Government established the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP)
          to deal with the national foreclosure crisis. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program provided
          targeted emergency assistance to state and local governments to acquire and redevelop
          foreclosed properties that might otherwise become a source of abandonment and blight. The
          City of Visalia received $2,388,331in 2008 in NSP funds to address foreclosures, vacant and
          abandoned properties, and other eligible uses. The NSP funds have been targeted for
          priority neighborhoods with the greatest need. The remaining funds have been provided to
          Habitat for Humanity, which has acquired to homes. Upon finalizing expenditures, the grant
          will be finalized.
      •   Voucher Program. CDBG funding is provided to support Family Services and the Tulare
          Housing First Program. The program is structured to specifically serve the chronically
          homeless by providing Shelter Plus Care vouchers to assist a homeless family with housing
          expenses. The funding would continue to support a Case Manager to oversee the program,
          which includes mental, and health counseling, job search, and life skills training. Specific
          data will continue to be collected to reflect the outcome.
      •   Fair Housing Services. The City is finalizing its contract for services with the Fair Housing
          Council of Central California, who specializes in providing broad-based and comprehensive
          fair housing services (i.e. education, outreach, complaint intake, testing, investigation,
          mediation and enforcement).
 Free Foreclosure Counseling. Starting in 2008, Self-Help Enterprises began offering weekly
 foreclosure counseling seminars in both English and Spanish and a foreclosure hotline. While no
 longer a program line of service, Self-Help provides credit counseling and financial planning
 counseling for prospective first time homebuyers, and for current clients at risk of foreclosure.
 The City has also included affordable housing programs for future funding, in its recent 2015-2019
 (5-Yr) Consolidated Plan as follows:

         low-income homeowners (owner occupied), with home improvement needs, including
         accessibility, and to upgrade the quality of the housing stock within the area. The specific
         objectives of the program are to improve housing conditions for lower income households; to
         preserve the existing housing stock when it is economically feasible; and to improve the
         quality, accessibility, amenities and affordability of existing neighborhoods within the City of
         Visalia.
    •    Emergency Repair and Accessibility Program (ERAP). The Emergency Repair and
         Accessibility Program (ERAP) provides low interest rate loans to owner occupants, which

         household.
    •    Senior Mobile Home Repair Program. A program provided to Visalia mobile home park
         residents, who own and occupy a mobile home, as their primary residence. The program is
         provided as a grant between $7,000 and up to $10,000 on a case-by-case, to eligible
         applicants’ units that are in need of repairs for unhealthy or unsafe conditions that pose an
         immediate threat to the well-being of the occupants, such as failing floors and roofs, as well
         as, hot water heaters, heating and cooling, electrical, plumbing and/or alterations for disabled

    •    First-Time Homebuyers Program. In this program, low- and moderate-income families may
         qualify for a low interest second mortgage loan that can go toward the purchase of a home.
         As funding is available, this program may be administered internally or by a non-profit
         agency. Programs provided by local non-profit agencies, include, but are not limited to:
    •    Housing Choice Vouchers Program (HCVP). The Housing Authority manages the Section
         8 housing voucher program. The Section 8 vouchers provide assistance to help low-income
         residents of Tulare County, including residents of Visalia, afford safe, decent, and sanitary
         rental housing. The program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the current
         fair market rent and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g., 30 percent of their income). The
         voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may cost above the payment standard, but
         the tenant must pay the extra cost. The Housing Authority allows CSET to refer/enroll a
         maximum of three families a month for Section 8 assistance.
    •    Self-Help Enterprises. Self-Help Enterprises is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
         Development (HUD) certified counseling agency, offers educational and counseling services

         and online, cover home selection, realtor services, lenders, loan programs, homeownership
         responsibilities, saving for a down payment, and other valuable information to support
         homeownership goals. Completion of the program helps families qualify for certain
         homebuyer assistance programs, mortgage interest premium reductions, and lower financing
         interest rates with some lenders.

 Additional State and Federal Housing Programs
 In addition to the funding programs available through the City and County, there are several State
 and Federal funding programs that assist first-time homebuyers, build affordable housing, and help
 special needs groups, such as seniors and large households. In most cases other entities, including
 for-profit and non-profit developers, apply for funds or other program benefits. For example,
 developers apply directly to USDA for Section 515 rural loans, to HUD for Section 202 and Section
 811 loans, or to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC) for low-income housing tax
 credits. In general, the City of Visalia relies upon the private sector to develop new affordable units.
 The following is a description of some of the most significant State and Federal funding programs
 that are available to fund affordable housing opportunities.
 Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) Program is provided from the
 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), administered by the Strategic Growth Council,
 implemented through the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), provides
 grants and/or loans to projects that will achieve GHG reductions and benefit Disadvantaged
 Communities through increasing accessibility of affordable housing, employment centers and key
 destinations.
 Section 811 Program. The Section 811 program, sponsored by HUD, provides interest-free capital
 advances and rental assistance funds to private, non-profit sponsors to help finance the
 development of housing for persons with disabilities. Public sponsors are not eligible to apply for
 Section 811 funds. The capital advance can cover the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of
 supportive housing. The sponsor does not have to repay the capital advance as long as the project
 serves the target population for 40 years. Additionally, rental assistance funds are provided for three
 years to cover the difference between the HUD-approved operating cost for the development and
 the rent paid by tenants–usually 30 percent of adjusted income. These three-year contracts are
 renewable based on the availability of funds.
 Section 202 Program. The Section 202 program, also sponsored by HUD, is similar to the Section
 811 Program; however, the target population for the Section 202 program is the very low-income
 elderly. The same capital advance and rental assistance is available to private, non-profit sponsors
 of affordable elderly housing. As with the Section 811 program, public sponsors are not eligible for
 the Section 202 program.
 Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was
 created in 1986 by the Federal Government as a method for funding affordable housing. Depending
 on the project, the program gives either a 4 percent or 9 percent income tax credit over a 10-year
 period to the housing developer to help leverage the private costs of construction and rehabilitation
 of affordable housing units. Since the amount of credit available to the developer often exceeds the
 amount that the developer can use, private investors frequently participate in the LIHTC project
 through a syndication process and receive Federal tax credits in return for an upfront investment.
 Applying for the LIHTC program is a competitive process. Projects are ranked relative to each other
 based on criteria in the State’s Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP). The QAP considers factors such as
 cost, amenities, and project location, when comparing proposed projects. To qualify for the LIHTC

City of Visalia                                                                   Part 1. Background Report

program, projects must also meet specific minimum requirements. These requirements are as
follows:
            •   At least 20 percent of the residential units must be affordable to individuals whose
                income is 50 percent or less of the area median income; or
            •   At least 40 percent of the residential units must be affordable to individuals whose
                income is 60 percent or less of the area median income; and
            •   The housing units must remain affordable for a 30-year period.
Additional Private Funding. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) directs the
Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to encourage and assist the institutions they
regulate to meet the credit needs of their communities. These agencies must assess the records of
their member institutions when evaluating applications for a charter or other regulated transactions.
As a result of the CRA, many major financial institutions have elected to actively participate in
funding low- and moderate-income housing developments developed by non-profit corporations.
The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) provides direct project financing through its member
institutions as part of its Affordable Housing Program. FHLB administers the Affordable Housing
Program (AHP), which facilitates the development of affordable rental housing and homeownership
opportunities, through a competitive application process, a bank provides grants or subsidized
interest rates on advances to members to finance their affordable housing initiatives. The California
Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC) was formed to pool the resources of the state's
banks to assist in financing affordable housing. CCRC specializes in programs for families, seniors,
citizens with special needs and mixed use developments. Finally, the Federal National Mortgage
Association (Fannie Mae) provides permanent financing for affordable housing development by
purchasing or securitizing the lender-originated first mortgages on mutually agreeable terms.
Assisted Housing Projects Eligible for Conversion
The expiration of housing subsidies may be the greatest near-term threat to California’s affordable
housing stock for low-income families and individuals. Rental housing financed 30 years ago with
Federal low interest mortgages are now, or soon will be, eligible for termination of their subsidy
programs. Owners may then choose to convert the apartments to market-rate housing. Also, HUD
Section 8 rent supplements to specific rental developments may expire in the near future. In
addition, State and local subsidies or use restrictions are usually of a limited duration.
State law requires that housing elements include an inventory of all publicly assisted multi-family
rental housing projects within the local jurisdiction that are at risk of conversion to uses other than
low-income residential during the current planning period (January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2014)
and the subsequent eight years (January 2014 through September 30, 2023).
California Government Code Section 65863.10 requires that owners of Federally-assisted properties
must provide notice of intent to convert their properties to market rate at twelve months prior to, and
again at six months prior to the expiration of their contract, opt-outs, or prepayment. Owners must
provide notices of intent to public agencies, including HCD the City, and the local public housing
authority, and to all impacted tenant households. The six-month notice must include specific

 information on the owner’s plans, timetables, and reasons for termination. Under Government Code
 Section 65863.11, owners of Federally-assisted projects must provide a Notice of Opportunity to
 Submit an Offer to Purchase to Qualified Entities, non-profit or for-profit organizations that agree to
 preserve the long-term affordability if they should acquire at-risk projects, at least five years before
 the sale or expiration of use restrictions. Qualified entities have first right of refusal for acquiring at-
 risk units.
 Qualified entities are non-profit or for-profit organizations with the legal and managerial capacity to
 acquire and manage at-risk properties that agree to maintain the long-term affordability of projects.
 The following are organizations that can serve as qualified entities in Tulare County:

 Housing Element
 Disadvantaged Communities
 The City recognizes the recent change to State law (SB244), upon update of the Housing Element,
 to update the Land Use Element to address the provision of public services and infrastructure to
 disadvantaged unincorporated communities within the City of Visalia Sphere of Influence (SOI).
 Senate Bill 244 (SB244), which became law in October 7, 2011, requires that following an update of
 the Housing Element occur to address the provision of public services and infrastructure to
 disadvantaged unincorporated communities (DUCs) within the City of Visalia’s Sphere of Influence.
 SB 244 defines a DUC as a place that meets the following criteria:
      •   Contains 10 or more dwelling units in close proximity to one another.
      •   Is either within a city Sphere of Influence (SOI), is an island within a city boundary, or is
          geographically isolated and has existed for more than 50 years; and,
      •   Has a median household income that is 80 percent or less than the statewide median
          household income. In California this equates to $61,094 annually.
 The Tulare Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is responsible for identifying DUCs within
 the City’s SOI. LAFCO provided the City data that describes DUCs within the City of Visalia SOI.
 There are two qualifying DUCs within the City SOI: K Street County Island, and Tract 92. There are
 three additional DUCs within the City’s larger Planning Area, but are outside of the City SOI.
 The City of Visalia currently has an Annexation policy that encourages all voluntary island
 annexations. Six island annexations have been completed since 2010. Presently City policy limits
 proceeding with annexations when the number of residents and/or assessed valuation of the
 annexation area exceed protest thresholds. With regard to annexations that would expand the City’s
 corporate boundaries, the City adheres to its own Growth Boundary Policies (LU-P-19, 20, and 21)
 which preclude premature annexations for residentially designated properties.
 The two DUCs within the current City SOI have paved public roads, but private roads within the
 DUCs are unpaved. The City and County have a mutual aid agreement for fire protection and police
 service. Both DUCs have domestic water service available to them by California Water Company
 (CalWater). However, several of the habited parcels have private wells. The K Street county island
 has sanitary sewer mains with adequate unused capacity adjacent to the island boundaries. Tract 92
 has sewer capacity available to it but the closest sewer main is 1 1/2 mile to the west. The K Street
 island has drainage lines and storage capacity available to it upon demand. Neither of the DUCs are
 candidates for annexation at the present time. Nor are there any pending development proposals
 reported by Tulare County within or adjacent to the DUC areas. Consequently, no immediate action
 is required by state law or by local policy at this time.
 In order to comply with SB 244, the City shall periodically conduct an Annexation Survey to gauge
 interest in voluntary annexation by the residents, registered voters and property owners within the K
 Road County Island. Annexation Surveys shall be sent to these parties on a semi-annual basis
 beginning in Calendar Year 2017. The survey shall comply with Tulare County Association of
Page 90                                                         August 2016

Governments (TCAG) guidelines, including: Content neutrality, bi-lingual text (English/Spanish), and
delivered to addressees of property owners, residents, and registered voters. The City shall initiate
the Annexation if less than 25% of registered voters and less than 25% of property owners object to
the annexation.
The Annexation Program shall be included as Program 9.8. The program shall specify that the
Program shall be replicated as a General Plan Land Use Policy and Program within one year of
certification of the Housing Element Update.
Energy Conservation Opportunities
State housing law requires an analysis of the opportunities for energy conservation in residential
development. Energy efficiency has direct application to affordable housing because the more
money spent on energy, the less available for rent or mortgage payments. High energy costs have
particularly detrimental effects on low-income households that do not have enough income or cash
reserves to absorb cost increases and may have to choose between basic needs such as shelter,
food, and energy. In addition, energy price increases since 2004 have led to a renewed interest in
energy conservation.
New Residential Energy Standards
All new buildings in California must meet the standards contained in Title 24, Part 6, of the California
Code of Regulations (Building Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential
Buildings). These regulations respond to California's energy crisis and need to reduce energy bills,
increase energy delivery system reliability, and contribute to an improved economic condition for the
state. They were established in 1978 and most recently updated in 2013. Through the building
permit process, local governments enforce energy efficiency requirements. All new construction
must comply with the standards in effect on the date a building-permit application is made. The
standards found in Title 24 create energy savings of approximately 50 percent over residential
construction practices used prior to the standards. The City of Visalia adopted the 2013 California
Building Code, Title 24, Part 2 as the building code for the city, and has adopted Part 6, Building
Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings.
Weatherization Activities
Southern California Edison (SCE) provides electric services for the City of Visalia. Southern
California Gas Company provides natural gas service for the City. SCE offers a variety of programs
to increase energy conservation and reduce monthly energy costs for lower-income households.
The following programs are aimed at increasing energy efficiency and are available to SCE
customers in Visalia:
         CARE/FERA Rate Programs.        The California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program
            offers income-qualified customers a discount of 20 percent or more off their monthly
            electric bill. The Family Electric Rate Assistance program (FERA) also provides a
            discount rate on monthly SCE bills for families of 3 or more who fall within certain income
            guidelines and exceed their baseline usage by 30 percent or more. Tenants of sub-

             metered residential facilities and non-profit group living facilities also qualify for CARE and
             FERA.
          Energy Management Assistance Program.            The Energy Management Assistance Program
             (EMA) helps income-qualified households by paying all the costs of purchasing and
             installing energy-efficient appliances and equipment, which are free to eligible customers.
             Both homeowners and renters qualify for the program.
          Energy    Assistance Fund. The Energy Assistance Fund (EAF) helps customers in need
             pay their SCE bill through donations by SCE customers, employees, and shareholders.
             SCE has partnered with United Way of Greater Los Angeles to raise and disburse EAF
             funds. A maximum of $100 is made available to qualified customers once in a 12-month
             period.
 Community Services and Employment Training (CSET) provides a weatherization program at no
 cost to low-income families who own or rent an apartment, house, or mobile home in Tulare County.
 The goal of the weatherization program is to help low-income households reduce heating and
 energy costs by improving the energy efficiency of their homes. Clients are given valuable
 information on how to conserve energy and improve efficiency with minor repairs or installing:
 weather stripping all exterior doors; water restrictors and low-flow shower heads; water heater
 blankets; switch and outlet gaskets; lighting retrofits; carbon monoxide detectors; and new glass
 windows.
 In addition to the local programs described above, the California Department of Community Services
 and Development (CSD) administers the Federally-funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance
 Program (LIHEAP). This program provides two types of assistance: Home Energy Assistance and
 Energy Crisis Intervention. The first type of assistance is a direct payment to utility bills for qualified
 low-income households. The second type of assistance is available to low-income households that
 are in a crisis situation. CSD also offers free weatherization assistance, such as attic insulation,
 caulking, water heater blankets, and heating and cooling system repairs to low-income households.

V. POTENTIAL HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
State housing law requires local governments to review both governmental and non-governmental
constraints to the maintenance and production of housing for all income levels. Since local
governmental actions can restrict the development and increase the cost of housing, State law
requires the Housing Element to “address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove
governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing”
(Government Code Section 65583(c)(3)).
Potential Governmental Constraints
Local governments have little or no influence upon the national economy or Federal monetary
policies; yet these two factors have some of the most significant impacts on the overall cost of
housing. State law requires that housing elements contain an analysis of the governmental
constraints on housing maintenance, improvement, and development (Government Code, Section
65583(a)(4)). The Housing Element must also analyze potential and actual constraints upon the
development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
It is in the public interest for the government to regulate development to protect the general welfare
of the community. At the same time, governmental regulations can potentially constrain the supply
of housing available in a community if the regulations limit the opportunities to develop housing,
impose requirements that unnecessarily increase the cost to develop housing, or make the
development process so arduous as to discourage housing developers. By reviewing local
conditions and regulations that may impact the housing market, the local government can prepare
for future growth through actions that protect the public’s health and safety without unduly adding to
the cost of housing production
The City of Visalia’s primary regulations and procedures that could affect residential development
and housing affordability include land use controls, development processing procedures and fees,
impact fees, on- and off-site improvement requirements, and building codes and enforcement. This
section discusses these standards and assesses whether any serve as a constraint to affordable
housing development.
General Plan Land Use Designations and Policies
General Plan land use designations and zoning can create significant housing constraints in a city or
county. By definition, local land use controls constrain housing development by restricting housing
to certain sections of the city and by restricting the number of housing units that can be built on a
given parcel of land.
The 2014 General Plan includes four residential land use designations that permit a range of
residential development types with densities that range from 2 units per acre to 33 units per acre.
The 2014 General Plan has added three commercial land use designations that encourage
horizontal or vertical commercial/residential mixed use developments. Table 51 shows the density
range and consistent zoning district for each residential land use designation: Rural Residential
(RA), Low-Density Residential (RLD), Medium Density Residential (RMD), and High-Density

The 2014 General Plan Update was developed over the course of five years beginning in the
Summer of 2009. Part of the General Plan Update process was a thorough review of existing
General Plan policies, including the retirement of those policies that were determined to no longer be
relevant, and the addition of new policies that reflect policy directions from the time of its adoption in
2014 to the end of the Planning horizon (2030).
General Plan policies in the Land Use Element provide a more detailed picture of the intent and
application of the land use designations. The City of Visalia General Plan policies encourage new
mixed use development in the downtown and at locations determined to be optimal for mixed use
development; higher densities for infill and affordable housing development; new higher density
residential development along major corridors and at major intersections; and revitalization of vacant
or underutilized sites, as follows:
       LU-P-19     Ensure growth occurs in a compact and concentric fashion by implementing the
           General Plan’s phased growth strategy.
       LU-P-20 Allow annexation and development of residential, commercial, and industrial land to
           occur within the “Tier I” Urban Development Boundary (UDB) at any time, consistent with
           the City’s Land Use Diagram.
       LU-P-21 Allow annexation and development of residential, commercial, regional retail, and
        industrial land to occur Allow annexation and development of residential, commercial,
        regional retail, and industrial land to occur within the Urban Development Boundary (Tier II)
        and the Urban Growth Boundary (Tier III) consistent with the City’s Land Use Diagram,
        according to the following phasing thresholds:
        “Tier II”: Tier II supports a target buildout population of approximately 178,000. The
        expansion criteria for land in Tier II is that land would only become available for development
        when building permits have been issued in Tier I at the following levels, starting from April 1,
        2010:
                  Residential: after permits for 5,850 housing units have been issued; and,
                  Commercial: after permits for 480,000 square feet of commercial space on
        designated                 Commercial, Mixed Use, Downtown Mixed Use, Office, and Service
        Commercial land
                  have been issued.
       LU-P-45 Promote development of vacant, underdeveloped, and/or re-developable land within
        the City limits where urban services are available and adopt a bonus/incentive program to
        promote and facilitate infill development in order to reduce the need for annexation and
        conversion of prime agricultural land and achieve the objectives of compact development
        established in this General Plan.
        Techniques to be used include designation of infill opportunity zones as part of the
        implementation process and provision of incentives, such as reduced parking and
        streamlined review, and residential density bonuses, and floor area bonuses for mixed use
        and/or higher-density development, subject to design criteria and findings of community
        benefit.
       LU-P-46 Adopt and implement an incentive program for residential infill development of
        existing vacant lots and underutilized sites within the City limits as a strategy to help to meet
        the future growth needs of the community.

 Part 1. Background Report                                                                    City of Visalia
 Housing Element
          Infill will be supported by increasing allowable density or decreasing minimum lot size
          under zoning to the maximum limits set by the General Plan, by reducing off-street
          parking requirements, by creating an Infill Incentive Zone where reduced fees and
          other incentives may apply because infrastructure is in place, and by providing incentives
          that respond to different challenges (for example in Downtown or in historically
                     underutilized areas). Infill development also is supported by growth management
                     policies; see Policy LU-P-21 for details.
         LU-P-50 Provide development standards to ensure that a mix of detached and attached
          single-family and multi-family housing types can be compatible in a single development.
          Development standards may include but not be limited to requiring heights, setbacks, and
          building massing to be in scale with surrounding uses or to provide a transition in scale and
          character; and establishing the spacing of curb cuts and location of parking.
         LU-P-52 Facilitate high-quality building and site design for multi-family developments by
          updating development standards in the zoning ordinance and providing clear rules for
          development review and approval and by creating and adopting design guidelines to be used
          in the development review and approval process.
          Characteristics of high-quality site and building design include connectivity to the public
          realm; compatibility with surrounding development; small-scale buildings with variation in
          architecture and massing; usable open space and recreation facilities; orientation to natural
          features; and solar orientation
         LU-P-53 Integrate multi-family development with commercial, office, and public uses in
          neighborhood nodes, Downtown, and with Commercial Mixed Use areas in East Downtown,
          along the Mooney corridor and elsewhere. Multi-family housing should be accessible on foot
          to public parks and gathering places, commercial areas, and transit.
         LU-P-55 Update the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the Low Density Residential designation on
          the Land Use Diagram for development at 2 to 10 dwelling units per gross acre, facilitating
          new planned neighborhoods and infill development in established areas.
          This designation is intended to provide for single-family detached housing with densities
          typical of single-family subdivisions. Duplex units, townhouses, and small-lot detached
          housing may be incorporated as part of Low Density Residential developments.
          Development standards will ensure that a desirable single-family neighborhood character is
          maintained.
         LU-P-56 Update the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the Medium Density Residential
          designation on the Land Use Diagram for development at 10 to 15 dwelling units per gross
          acre.
          This designation can accommodate a mix of housing types including small-lot single family,
          townhouses, two- and four-plexes, and garden apartments, on infill lots or new development
          areas within walking distance of neighborhood nodes and corridors. Medium Density
          Residential development may also be permitted on corner lots in single-family zones and in
          infill areas where it can be made to be consistent with adjacent properties through the
          conditional use process. Development standards will ensure that new development
          contributes positively to the larger community environment. Projects on sites larger than five
          acres or involving more than 60 units will require discretionary review.
Page 96                                                              August 2016
       LU-P-57 Update the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the High Density Residential designation on
        the Land Use Diagram for development at 15 to 35 dwelling units per gross acre,
        accommodating townhouses, two- and four-plexes, and multistory condominium and
        apartment buildings.
        The designation is appropriate for some infill sites and new areas in close proximity to
        neighborhood centers and major transportation routes. High Density Residential
        development may also be permitted in infill areas where it can be made to be consistent with
        adjacent properties through the conditional use permit process. Development standards will
        ensure that new development contributes positively to the creation of neighborhood nodes or
        districts. Projects on sites larger than five acres or involving more than 60 units will require
        discretionary review.
       LU-P-58 Establish an Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning District (AHO) to promote the
        development of affordable housing on infill land within the existing City limits in areas
        designated by the General Plan for multi-family residential development. Participation by
        affordable housing developers in the AHO program would be voluntary, with the incentives
        offered intended to make development of affordable housing feasible.
        The City will continue to work with affordable housing developers to provide housing
        development opportunities that are geographically accessible to services, retail clusters,
        transportation corridors, and key nodes. The AHO District would be an alternative to the
        State-mandated Residential Density Bonus Program and could be applied for qualifying
        projects as a “floating zone” and not require a General Plan amendment. It should be noted
        that in some cases re-zoning would be required to be consistent with the General Plan Land
        Use designation. Such re-zoning would be done concurrently with adoption of the AHO
        zoning district for the site. Application requirements would be the same as those for the
        State-Mandated Residential Density Bonus Program, modified, as appropriate for the
        purposes of this district.• The City will initiate a work program to analyze the various options
        for an AHO District including the consideration of at a minimum the following development
        incentives:
             • Residential density increase beyond those provided by State Density Bonus Law;
             • Flexible zoning standards, including reduced development and parking standards,
             coupled with Form-Based Code standards for infill sites to ensure land use compatibility;
             • Priority permit processing, including any applicable CEQA exemptions;
             • Design Review requirements; and
             • Deferral or reduction of City permit and development impact fees based on the Priority
             Zone designation for the site, as defined by the Infill Development Incentive Program.
       LU-P-60 Continue to enforce code compliance and provide support to neighborhood
        improvement efforts to ensure repair and maintenance of existing dwelling units.
       LU-P-66 Update the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the Commercial Mixed Use designation on
        the Land Use Diagram, to allow for either horizontal or vertical mixed use development and a
        range of commercial, service, office, and residential uses.
        New development in Commercial Mixed Use Areas should have an FAR of at least 0.4 and
        up to 1.0 for commercial space. If residential uses are included, density may be up to 35
        dwelling units per gross acre. Commercial development must be part of all new development
        in the Commercial Mixed Use district.

          serves surrounding residential areas, wherein small office uses as well as horizontal or
          vertical residential mixed use are also supported. Provide standards to ensure that
          neighborhood commercial uses are economically-viable and also integrated into
          neighborhoods, with multimodal access and context-sensitive design.
         LU-P-73 Support new mixed-use development in Downtown and East Downtown, with an
          emphasis on ground-level retail and entertainment uses and upper-level residential and
          office uses. Support may involve expedited permit review and approval, loans, public-private
          partnerships, and floor area bonuses.
         LU-P-75 Provide incentives for infill development of opportunity sites and adaptive reuse and
          restoration of existing buildings in Downtown and East Downtown.
          New development in Downtown and East Downtown will realize the inherent potential for
          higher intensity use of this district, and should include offices, mixed-use and live-work
          buildings, storefront commercial buildings, apartments, condominiums and townhouses, and
          small-lot single-family houses. See also policies in section 2.8.
         LU-P-90 Update the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the Downtown Mixed Use designation on
          the Land Use Diagram.
          This designation permits the highest density and intensity of development in the City in order
          to keep Downtown a vibrant, walkable environment. Vertical mixed use is strongly
          encouraged. Retail, restaurant, entertainment, office, public and community facilities, and
          urban residential uses are all allowed. New development should have commercial FAR of no
          less than 1.0, including 0.25 FAR for retail, and up to 5.0. If residential use is included, it
          should have a density of at least 15 dwelling units per gross acre.
 Ongoing General Plan Consistency
 Chapter 9-2 of the General Plan states:
     The City will use a variety of regulatory mechanisms and administrative procedures to
     implement the General Plan. Overall responsibility for plan implementation is vested in
     the Planning Agency, consistingof the City Council and the Community Development
     Director. The General Plan requires consistency between the General Plan and the
     zoning ordinance to ensure that Plan policies will be implemented and that
     environmental resources earmarked for protection in the Plan will be preserved. Other
     regulatory mechanisms, including subdivision approvals, building and housing codes,
     capital improvement programs, and environmental review procedures also will be used
     to implement Plan policies. All project approvals should be found consistent with the
     General Plan. The City has two standing commissions and six advisory committees to
     assist in General Plan implementation and other responsibilities assigned to them by the
     City Council.
 Inclusive in maintaining ongoing General Plan consistency among all General Plan Elements are the
 Housing Element policies and programs that establish responsibilities for annual review of the
 success of the Housing Element’s performance and implementation. The current Housing Element
 Goals, Policies, and Programs are consistent with the 2014 General Plan. The proposed added
 Programs are consistent with all other General Plan Elements, including the Safety Element
 pertaining to management of flood and fire hazards. Further, Housing Element Programs 9.4, 9.5,
 and 9.10 require annual review of actions undertaken by the City for their consistency with the
 Housing Element. In addition to internal City review and reporting by City staff to the City Council,
Page 98                                                            August 2016

the Housing Element Annual Report is reviewed by the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) annually.
Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section 65583(c)(1) and 65583.2(c)) requires that
local governments analyze the availability of sites that will “facilitate and encourage the development
of a variety of types of housing for all income levels, including multi-family rental housing, factory-
built housing, mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees, supportive housing, single-room
occupancy units, emergency shelters, and transitional housing.” This section discusses the
availability of sites and relevant regulations that govern the development of the types of housing
listed above and also discusses sites suitable for redevelopment for residential use (as required by
Government Code Section 65583(a)(3)) and second units.
Residential Zoning Standards
Land use controls provided in the Zoning Ordinance influence housing production in several ways.
The permitted and conditionally permitted uses in each district guide new development and provide
both developers and the public with an understanding of how vacant land will develop in the future.
This includes the density of development that will occur within a particular zone, the compatibility of
planned uses in a given area, and the range and type of buildings and uses that will be located
throughout the city.
The City regulates the type, location, and scale of residential development primarily through the
Zoning Ordinance. Table 53A shows the setback, lot coverage, and maximum height requirements
for residential zones and the design districts for commercial, office, and industrial zones where
residences are also allowed. The existing ordinance includes side-yard setback requirements
designed to ensure access to the rear-yard for large recreation vehicles. These development
standards are typical for most Central Valley and California communities and do not pose any
potential constraints to the development of affordable housing in Visalia. The height restriction of 35
feet in the R-M-2 was increased from the previous 30-foot limit to encourage development in this
zone to three stories.

 It should be noted that in mid-2015, the City contracted with a Planning consultant to assist in the
 preparation of a comprehensive revision of the Zoning Ordinance (VMC Chapter 17) and Subdivision
 Ordinance (VMC Chapter 16). This effort is to incorporate the changes in the existing City Codes
 and to codify new regulations to implement the City’s recently adopted General Plan. Part of the
 strategy invoked in revising the Zoning Ordinance is preserving and enhancing the portions of the
 Zoning Ordinance that were adopted in March 2011 to implement the 2010 Housing Element
 Update. These include revisions to the threshold of units permitted by right in multi-family zones from
 40 units to 60 units, revision to the density bonus and incentives provisions to exceed the State
 requirements of SB 1818 and SB 435, adding single-room occupancy and emergency shelters, and
 re-defining “family” to meet State law requirements.
 As noted above, the City continually seeks to identify and resolve constraints to affordable housing.
 In addition, changes in State Housing laws and their evolving interpretations and applications
Page 100                                                              August 2016

necessarily require the City to re-examine its codes and policies to further promote affordable
housing opportunities, and to ensure that its codes and policies are fully consistent with State
Housing laws.
In accordance with its update of the Housing Element, the City has identified the following revisions
to the Municipal Code (Title 17, Zoning Code). Details of these Code revisions are contained in the
applicable section of this Part 1 of the Housing Element Update and/or in Part 3 (Housing Element
Goals, Policies, and Programs)
     State mandated Code revisions to comply with State Housing laws:
     •   Revise definition of “Affordable Housing”
     •   Revise the definition of “Transitional Housing”
     •   Revise the permitting process by zone district for the following housing classifications:
          •   Farmworker Housing
          •   Transitional Housing
          •   Supportive Housing
          • Codify the exemption          from   zoning  code standards       to  facilitate  reasonable
         accommodation for persons                       with disabilities.
     City-Initiated Code revisions to implement the Housing Element:
       Increase the unit threshold for multi-family projects permitted by right
       Revise Mobile Home Parks development standards.
       Codify the In-fill Incentive program (General Plan Policies LU-P-45 and LU-P-46)
 It should be noted that the City can meet its RHNA Land Inventory without implementing the City-
initiated Code revisions. These revisions will serve to augment the City’s ability to provide affordable
housing opportunities.The new Zoning Code will incorporate the codification of all applicable new
Housing Element policies adopted by the City Council in its approval of the Housing Element
Update. These Code revisions will be included in the Zoning Code update or as a subsequent Code
Amendment, dependent upon the relative timing of the two documents.
Multi-Family Rental Housing
Previous to the 2010 Housing Element Update, multi-family residential units were a permitted use in
three residential zoning districts: the R-1-4.5 district allows for 2 to 10 units per acre; the R-M-2
district allows for 10 to 15 units per acre; and R-M-3 allows for 15 to 29 units per acre. Multi-family
housing projects over 40 units in size required a Conditional Use Permit, which were seen as a

 Part 1. Background Report                                                                    City of Visalia
 Housing Element
 constraint to the development of some projects. The 2010 Housing Element Update amended the
 unit threshold for multi-family residential projects to be permitted by right from 40 to 60 units.
 Multi-family developments have been allowed in non-residential zones (e.g., CDT, CS), but require a
 conditional use permit. Maximum development densities are not prescribed for residential or mixed
 use projects in non-residentially zoned districts. Rather, the Zoning Code allows each project to be
 evaluated by its overall design, particularly with respect to the project’s compatibility with the
 surrounding area and infrastructure, and its suitability in furthering the City’s General Plan Land Use
 and Housing goals.
 The 2016 Housing Element Update includes new policies to further encourage and facilitate multi-
 family housing. These new policy initiatives include:
         Increase of multi-family project unit size permitted by right from 60 to 80 units;
         Increase in Height allowance for projects in the R-M-3 (High Density Residential) Zone to
          four stories;
         Implement new Land Use Policy LU-P-46 (Infill Incentive Program) by instituting impact fee
          reductions and density bonuses to residential projects that include affordable housing
          provisions;
 Manufactured Housing
 Manufactured housing can serve as an alternative form of affordable housing in low-density areas
 where the development of higher-density multi-family residential units is not allowed.
 Manufactured Homes on Lots
 California Government Code Sections 65852.3 and 65852.4 specify that a jurisdiction shall allow the
 installation of manufactured homes on a foundation on all “lots zoned for conventional single-family
 residential dwellings.” Except for architectural requirements, the jurisdiction is only allowed to
 “subject the manufactured home and the lot on which it is placed to the same development
 standards to which a conventional single-family residential dwelling on the same lot would be
 subject.” The architectural requirements are limited to roof overhang, roofing material, and siding
 material.
 The only two exceptions that local jurisdictions are allowed to make to the manufactured home siting
 provisions are if: 1) there is more than 10 years difference between the date of manufacture of the
 manufactured home and the date of the application for the issuance of an installation permit; or 2) if
 the site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and regulated by a legislative body
 pursuant to Government Code Section 37361.
 Visalia’s Municipal Code is consistent with State law. Manufactured homes that are placed on
 permanent foundations are , like houses that are built of standard construction, permitted by right in
 any zoning district allowing single-family homes that are permitted by right.           In non-residential
 zoned districts, a single-family residence requires a conditional use permit, whether the proposed
 residential unit is of standard construction or is a manufactured home.
Page 102                                                           August 2016

Mobile Home Parks
Section 69852.7 of the California Government Code specifies that mobile home parks shall be an
allowed use on “all land planned and zoned for residential land use.” However, local jurisdictions are
allowed to require use permits for mobile home parks. Chapter 17.32 of Visalia’s Municipal Code
describes the City’s regulations of mobile home parks. According to Visalia’s Municipal Code, mobile
homes may be placed on individual lots in all single-family residential zones except on lots located
within the city historic preservation district. Mobile homes must be attached to a foundation system
in compliance with all applicable building regulations and subject to review including consideration of
roof overhang, roofing material, and siding material to assure aesthetic compatibility with traditional
single-family housing structures.
The 2010 Housing Element Update includes a new policy to further encourage and facilitate mobile
home park projects by amending Zoning Ordinance section 17.32.040. These new policy initiatives
include:
        Eliminate the maximum density of six units in favor of the underlying allowable density for the
         zone district in which the project occurs;
        Making the mandatory site improvement requirements more flexible.
This policy is carried forward as part of the 2016 Housing Element Update.
Farmworker Housing
The provisions of Section 17020 (et seq.) of the California Health and Safety Code relating to
employee housing and labor camps supersede any ordinance or regulations enacted by local
governments. Such housing is allowed in all jurisdictions in California pursuant to the regulations set
forth in Section 17020. Section 17021.5(b) states, for example:
         “Any employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be deemed
         a single-family structure with a residential land use designation for the purposes of this section.
         For the purpose of all local ordinances, employee housing shall not be included within the
         definition of a boarding house, rooming house, hotel, dormitory, or other similar term that implies
         that the employee housing is a business run for profit or differs in any other way from a family
         dwelling. No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be
         required of employee housing that serves six or fewer employees that is not required of a family
         dwelling of the same type in the same zone.”
Section 17021.6, concerning farmworker housing, states that:
         “no conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be required of
         employee housing that serves 36 or fewer employees and is not required of any other
         agricultural activity in the same zone.”
These State Code provisions are collectively known as the Employee Housing Act. Visalia’s
Municipal Code complies with most of the provisions of the Employee Housing Act. The City’s
Zoning Code defines farm employee housing as: “living quarters, including dwellings with sleeping

 Part 1. Background Report                                                                   City of Visalia
 Housing Element
 accommodations and dining facilities, maintained for occupancy by persons employed principally in
 farming and related pursuits on land owned, leased or rented by the owner, lessee, or tenant of the
 site on which the farm employee housing is located; excepting a labor camp or trailer park.” The
 Code does not prohibit or constrain the provision of farm employee housing, nor does it set limits on
 the number of occupants permitted to be housed in farm employee housing. Farm labor and
 employee housing is treated like any other single-family home or group housing project, depending
 on the type of development. However, farm employee housing is presently only allowed in the
 Agricultural Zone District, and only provided that the housing is incidental to a primary use that is
 permitted or allowed by a conditional use permit.
 The City’s Zoning Code relative to employee housing is deficient because since adoption of the 2010
 Housing Element, the Employee Housing Act (EHA) (Health and Safety Code Section 17000 et.seq.)
 requires that employee housing for up to 12 units or 36 beds be permitted in the same manner as
 other agricultural uses in Zone districts that allow agricultural uses. The City’s Zoning Ordinance
 allows agricultural uses in all residential zones, as well as in the IL and IH (Light and Heavy
 Industrial) Zone Districts. Currently, farmworker housing is permitted by right, but only as an
 accessory to a primary residential use in the AG (Agricultural) Zone District.
 In light of recent State Housing Law revisions in this regard, the Zoning Ordinance shall be amended
 to comply with Section State law (Health and Safety Code Section 1702.5) and treat employee
 housing for up to 12 units or 36 beds the same as a single-family structure and use, and shall be
 permitted in the same “Permitted By Right” fashion as other dwellings in the same type in the same
 zone. Specifically, the Zoning Code provision pertaining to employee housing shall be expanded to
 also permit employee housing by right in all residential zones, and the IL and IH Zone Districts. This
 is in addition to being permitted by right in the AG Zone District (Also see Tables 54A and 54B, page
 110 and111), In addition, the Zoning Code shall be revised to reflect the term “farmworker housing”
 is synonymous with the term “employee housing”. This Ordinance Amendment shall be
 accomplished within one year of the certification of the Housing Element (Please see Part 3,
 Program 5.9).
 Emergency Shelters
 SB 2, passed in 2007 and in effect as of January 1, 2008, amended State housing law (California
 Government Code Sections 65582, 65583, and 65589.5) regarding shelter for homeless persons.
 This legislation requires local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for addressing the housing needs
 of homeless persons, including the identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are
 allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit.
 California Health and Safety Code Section 50801(e) defines “emergency shelters” as:
          “housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy
          of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied
          emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
 The new legislation added provisions to State housing law (Section 65583(a)(4)(A)) that require local
 governments to identify:
Page 104                                                           August 2016

         “a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a
         conditional use or other discretionary permit. The identified zone or zones shall include
         sufficient capacity to accommodate the need for emergency shelter identified in paragraph
         (7), except that each local government shall identify a zone or zones that can accommodate
         at least one year-round emergency shelter. If the local government cannot identify a zone or
         zones with sufficient capacity, the local government shall include a program to amend its
         zoning ordinance to meet the requirements of this paragraph within one year of the adoption
         of the housing element. The local government may identify additional zones where
         emergency shelters are permitted with a conditional use permit. The local government shall
         also demonstrate that existing or proposed permit processing, development, and
         management standards are objective and encourage and facilitate the development of, or
         conversion to, emergency shelters.”
The provisions go on to discuss that emergency shelters “may only be subject to those development
and management standards that apply to residential or commercial development within the same
zone” along with a list of exceptions that may be made. Local governments that already have one or
more emergency shelters within their jurisdiction or “pursuant to a multijurisdictional agreement” that
accommodates that jurisdiction’s need for emergency shelter are only required to identify a zone or
zones where new emergency shelters are allowed with a conditional use permit.
Under the current Municipal Code, emergency shelters are allowed in the Central Business District
(CDT) as a conditional use, Light Industry (I-L) as a permitted use, and Heavy Industry (I-H) zones
as a conditional use.
The City’s IL zone has been identified as the most appropriate Zone District to facilitate the
permitting by right of emergency shelters. There are 1,180 acres of IL Zoned land; of which 975
acres are fully developed, and 205 acres are vacant or underutilized. The IL Zone Districts are
strategically placed in several areas. The largest assemblage of IL lands and newer light industrial
building inventory is located immediately to the east and south of the City’s Industrial Park. The
second largest concentration of IL land and building inventory is along the Ben Maddox Way
Corridor, approximately ½ mile east of Downtown. The third area of IL land is approximately one
mile south of Downtown. All of these IL zoned areas are fully served by City services and utility
infrastructure.
While the IL zone is an industrial zone, it is relatively close to services such as food, parks, social
services, and schools. The IL zone emphasizes low-intensity research and development,
warehousing, and limiting manufacturing. It is not a heavy industrial zone. The zone also permit
other compatible uses such as restaurants, fast food restaurants, medical clinics, churches and
other religious institutions, and residential units associated with a commercial activity. There is
abundant land in this zone with adequate infrastructure to support new development, and land costs
are generally lower in this zone than in commercial or residential zones. There are several vacant or
available industrial buildings in this zone that could be converted to emergency shelters. For
example, the Olive Plant Warehouse on Tulare Avenue at Bridge Street and several service
commercial buildings, approximately 5,000 square feet on average, along Pershing Avenue near
Shirk Road.
The Zoning Ordinance was amended in March 2011 to be fully compliant with SB2.

 Part 1. Background Report                                                                     City of Visalia
 Housing Element
 Transitional Housing
 While SB 2 added specific new requirements for local governments to meet in terms of planning for
 emergency shelter facilities, Government Code Section 65583(a)(5) also states that “transitional
 housing and supportive housing shall be considered a residential use of property, and shall be
 subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the
 same zone.”
 Transitional housing is designed to assist homeless individuals and families in moving beyond
 emergency shelter to permanent housing. California Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2(h)
 defines “transitional housing” and “transitional housing development” as:
          “buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program
          requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit
          to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall
          be no less than six months.”
 The Zoning Ordinance was amended in March 2011 with the intention that it be fully compliant with
 SB 2. Since adoption of the 2010 Housing Element, which included new provisions to accommodate
 Transitional and Supportive Housing, State law has been interpreted to require that there be no
 numerical limitations on permitting by right Transitional and Supportive housing.
 The current Zoning Ordinance incorrectly sets a six person threshold for requiring a Conditional Use
 Permit (CUP) for these types of housing in residential zone districts. To correct this deficiency, the
 City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit these uses regardless of unit size or occupancy, by
 right, in all Residential zone districts (Also see Table 54A, page 116), and by CUP in all other zone
 districts. This shall bring the City’s Zoning Ordinance into full compliance with SB 2.This shall be
 accomplished within one year of the certification of the Housing Element (Please see Part 3,
 Program 5,3).
 Supportive Housing
 Supportive housing is permanent rental housing linked to a range of support services designed to
 enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead fuller lives. Typically, a part of the housing is
 targeted to people who have risk factors such as homelessness, or health challenges such as
 mental illness or substance addiction. Supportive housing comes in all shapes and sizes. It could be
 a renovated motel offering furnished single-room occupancy (SRO) apartments; a multi-family
 development where tenants with disabilities live alongside other families with low incomes; a small,
 more service-intensive building; or scattered-site apartments. Whatever the configuration, all of the
 housing allows tenants to access support services that enable them to live as independently as
 possible.
 California Health and Safety Code Section 53260(c) defines “supportive housing” as:
          “housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that is
          linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the tenant to retain the housing, improve his or
          her health status, maximize their ability to live and, when possible, to work in the community.
Page 106                                                           August 2016

         This housing may include apartments, single-room occupancy residences, or single-family
         homes.”
Section 5116 (“Zoning Preemption”) of the California Welfare and Institutions Code (Zoning of
Homes or Facilities for Mentally Disordered, Handicapped Persons, or Dependent and Neglected
Children) states:
         “Pursuant to the policy stated in Section 5115, a state-authorized, certified, or licensed family
         care home, foster home, or group home serving six or fewer mentally disordered or
         otherwise handicapped persons or dependent and neglected children, shall be considered a
         residential use of property for the purposes of zoning if such homes provide care on a 24-
         hour-a-day basis. Such homes shall be a permitted use in all residential zones, including, but
         not limited to, residential zones for single-family dwelling.”
The Visalia Municipal Code currently permits 24-hour care facilities for 6 persons or fewer in all
residential zones, but incorrectly requires a CUP for 7 persons or more in all residential zones.
Since adoption of the 2010 Housing Element, which included new provisions to accommodate
Transitional and Supportive Housing, State law has been interpreted to require that there be no
numerical limitations on permitting by right Transitional and Supportive housing.
The current Zoning Ordinance sets a six person threshold for requiring a Conditional Use Permit
(CUP) for these types of housing in residential zone districts. To correct this deficiency, the City will
amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit these uses regardless of unit size or occupancy, by right, in
all Residential zone districts (Also see Table 54A, page 116), and by CUP in all other zone districts.
This shall bring the City’s Zoning Ordinance into full compliance with SB 2.This shall be
accomplished within one year of the certification of the Housing Element (Please see Part 3,
Program 5,3).
Second Units
A second unit is an additional self-contained living unit, either attached to or detached from the
primary residential unit on a single lot. It has cooking, eating, sleeping, and full sanitation facilities.
Second dwelling units can be an important source of affordable housing since they can be
constructed relatively cheaply and have no associated land costs. Second units can also provide
supplemental income to the homeowner, allowing the elderly to remain in their homes or moderate-
income families to afford houses.
To encourage establishment of second units on existing developed lots, State law requires cities and
counties to either adopt an ordinance based on standards set out in the law authorizing creation of
second units in residentially-zoned areas, or where no ordinance has been adopted, to allow second
units on lots zoned for single-family or multi-family use that contain an existing single-family unit
subject to ministerial approval (“by right”) if they meet standards set out by law. Local governments
are precluded from totally prohibiting second units in residentially-zoned areas unless they make
specific findings (Government Code, Section 65852.2).
In the City of Visalia second units are a permitted use in all single-family residential zoning districts
(i.e., A, RA, and R-1). The Visalia Zoning Ordinance limits the construction of second units to lots
with an area of 6,000 net square feet or larger, requires that the floor area of second units not

 Housing Element
 exceed 850 square feet or 30 percent of the main dwelling unit, whatever is greater, and shall be
 used as an accessory to the primary building. The Zoning Code further requires that either the
 primary or the second dwelling unit shall be occupied by the owner of record, enforced by the
 recording of a covenant running with the land between the city and the property owner. The same
 residential development standards, including setbacks, height limits, and maximum lot coverage
 apply to second units. The City of Visalia meets State requirements for second units.
 According to the City of Visalia, there have been 47 second units (an average of 4.7 units per year)
 constructed between 2004 and 2015.
 Single-Room Occupancy Units
 Single-room occupancy (SRO) units can provide affordable private housing for lower-income
 individuals, seniors, and persons with disabilities. An SRO unit usually is small, between 200 to 350
 square feet. These units can serve as an entry point into the housing market for formerly homeless
 people.
 The Visalia Zoning Ordinance was revised pursuant to the 2010 Housing Element Update to
 incorporate SRO units in the City’s housing inventory. Zoning Ordinance section 17.16.020 was
 adopted to permit by right SRO units in the medium density and high density zone districts.
 Constraints on Housing for Persons With Disabilities
 Per CG Section 65583(c)(1), the Zoning Code must specify that Zoning standards cannot restrict the
 ability to provide access for persons with disabilities. This includes ensuring that persons with either
 physical or mental disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation for access to and the
 enjoyment of all facilities, including housing.
 Further, Government Code Section 65583(a)(4) requires “An analysis of potential and actual
 government constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing…for
 persons with disabilities as identified in the analysis pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a),
 including land use controls, building codes,and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and other
 exactions required of developers, and local processing and permit procedures. The analysis shall
 also demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental constraints that hinder the locality from
 meeting …the need for housing for persons with disabilities.”
 Government Code Section 65583(c)(3) requires the Housing Element provide a program to “address
 and where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance,
 improvement, and development of housing for persons with disabilities. The program shall remove
 constraints to and provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for, intended for
 occupancy by, or with supportive services for persons with disabilities.”
 Pursuant to State Law, the City has reviewed its General Plan, Municipal Zoning Ordinance,
 operating regulations and policies, and the City’s standing Disability Advocacy Committee to identify
 potential constraints to providing reasonable accommodation to persons with disabilities.
 Additionally, the 2015 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choices, part of the 2015-2019
Page 108                                                          August 2016

federal HUD Consolidated Plan was reviewed for potential constraints to reasonable accommodation
that should be included in the Housing Element Update and/or elsewhere.
Based on the analysis of these source policy documents, the City has concluded that there are no
explicit or overt policies in place that would constrain housing for persons with disabilities, as
prescribed by State law. The City has policies and programs in place that ensure that housing
access is not limited for disabled persons; that mobility in public places and transit are provided, that
education for both housing customers and providers are in place and active, This also includes a
program for reporting, investigating and resolving potential incidents of illegal housing exclusion
practices by public or private housing providers. Finally, all requisite accessibility standards for new
residential construction, including minimum accessible-ready units are in place and enforced through
the City’s building inspection and zoning administration.
However, it has been noted that the Zoning Code provisions that require structural setbacks could
unduly contstrain reasonable accommodation practices in new residential construction and in the
retrofit of existing residential units. Without a codified exemption or relief from the standard zoning
provisions, persons who require accessibility devices and structures (such as wheelchair ramps or
specialized mechanical equipment required for life and health (such as air purifiers). Presently, such
structures or devices whose installation would fail to meet the standard zoning requirements, would
first require approval of a discretionary administrative adjustment or Variance before approval before
building permits could be issued for the needed improvement.
The City will adopt a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance addition to the Zoning Ordinance
within one year of the certification of the Housing Element (Please see Part 3, Program 5,3). The
Ordinance shall state that structures or devices necessary to facilitate access to a building for
persons with physical and non-physical disabilities shall be accommodated without the requirement
to file an application for an exception or variance. Further, Program 5.3 and the associated
Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance shall include procedures for providing exception in zoning
and land use that may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing for persons requiring
reasonable accommodation. For example, a housing development is allowed in any non-
residentially zoned district (eg. Commercial or Office zone district), subject to approval of a
Conditiona Use Permit (CUP). In the event a CUP for housing that includes a request for reasonable
accommodation for a person or persons with disabilities, the CUP shall be evaluated and approved
in the same manner as that of a CUP without a similar request for reasonable accommodation.
However, any accommodations necessary to support reasonable accommodation shall not require a
request for exception or variance as may be necessary to provide reasonable accommodation.
In addition, announcement of this new Zoning Code allowance will be prominently displayed on the
City website, front Community Development Department permit counter, as well as disseminated
through the local Building Industry Association (BIA) and the City’s Disability Advocacy Committee
(Please see Part 3, Program 5.4).

 Part 1. Background Report                                                                 City of Visalia
 Housing Element
 Growth Controls/Growth Management
 The City of Visalia has utilized a growth management system through the use of a series of urban
 growth boundaries since the 1970’s.            The City’s 1991 General Plan employed three Urban
 Development Boundaries that identified which lands may be developed and when the lands will be
 eligible to be developed. The boundaries were referred to as Urban Development Boundaries for a
 population of 98,700, 129,000, and 165,000. The latest comprehensive update to the General Plan
 adopted in October 2014, analyzed and updated the urban growth boundaries to ensure for the
 logical contiguous growth of the City for the next 20 years and beyond. The new General Plan
 continues the overall concentric growth control concept, however the previous population based
 growth triggers were replaced with building permit triggers. This was done to more definitively
 associate physical land absorption needs with the empirical variable of building permits issued;
 rather than the more speculative variable of population growth estimates. Both methods achieve
 eventual physical buildout of the City in incremental stages. Please see Land Use Element Policy
 LU-P-21 for details.
 The first growth boundary (Tier I) generally corresponds to the City’s current corporate boundaries.
 Tier II includes lands that are outside of but adjacent to Tier I lands. Tier II will be available for
 development only after 5,850 residential building permits have been issued in Tier I. This roughly
 corresponds to a population of 160,000. Tier II has a residential development capacity of 12,800
 units and a population of 178,000. Tier III is the final growth boundary and supports the City’s
 buildout population of 210,000.
 Buildout is projected to occur in the Year 2030. However, since the growth boundary triggers are
 based on building permit activity as the primary determinant of physical buildout, the actual buildout
 date could vary from the 2030 date by several years in either direction. All of the General Plan
 Elements were prepared to adjust to this variability. Finally, the Regional Housing Needs
 Assessment (RHNA) land inventory is contained entirely within the Tier I growth boundary.
 Consequently, all lands are determined to be developable immediately at or above the development
 densities that correspond to their land use designations.
 Building Codes
 Building codes and their enforcement influence the style, quality, size, and costs of residential
 development. Such codes can increase the cost of new housing construction and impact the
 feasibility of rehabilitating older properties that must be upgraded to current code standards. In this
 manner, building codes and their enforcement can act as a constraint on the supply of housing and
 its affordability.
 The City of Visalia has adopted the 2013 California Building Code (CBC) based on the 2012
 International Building Code. Visalia has not amended the CBC requirements, nor added its own
 requirements. The minimum requirements of the CBC and other model codes may have added to
 the cost of housing over the years. However, governmental agencies at all levels as well as
 organizations representing building officials have decided that these requirements are necessary to
 achieve a minimum level of health and safety.
Page 110                                                          August 2016

The City’s building codes are consistent with the codes applied in other jurisdictions throughout
California and do not negatively impact the construction of affordable housing.
Processing and Permit Procedures
Similar to other jurisdictions, the City has several procedures it requires developers to follow for
processing development entitlements and building permits. Although the permit approval process
must conform to the Permit Streamlining Act (Government Code Section 65920 (et seq.)), housing
proposed in the city is subject to one or more of the following review processes: environmental
review, zoning, subdivision review, and building permit approval.
Many of the City’s review procedures are handled at the staff level. For example, site plan review is
conducted by staff representative of various City divisions, and administrative adjustments and
Temporary Conditional Use Permits are conducted by the City Planner.
The Planning Division is charged with making an environmental determination on a project,
determining if that project is exempt from CEQA review or requires that an environmental document
be prepared and adopted. If a discretionary entitlement project (i.e. Conditional Use Permit,
Variance, Tentative Map) is not exempt from CEQA review, then the application along with its
supporting environmental document is reviewed and acted upon by the Planning Commission. Table
54A shows permitted and conditionally permitted residential uses by zoning district in Visalia.

Residential uses are allowed in all zoning designations with a Conditional Use Permit on a case-by-
case basis; however, development standards currently are not specified in the City’s Municipal Code
for residential units located outside of areas zoned for residential uses.
For conditional use permits, the decision-making authority may approve or conditionally approve an
application for a use permit if it finds all of the following:
        The    proposed use is consistent with the goals and policies of the General Plan and any
             applicable specific plan;
        The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the applicable district or districts;
        The proposed use is listed as a use subject to a use permit in the applicable zoning district or
             districts or a use determined to be similar to a listed conditional use;
        The    proposed use meets the minimum requirements of the Zoning Code applicable to the
             use and complies with all other applicable laws, ordinances and regulations of the city and
             state; and
        The proposed use will not be materially detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the
             public or to property and residents in the vicinity. This finding is determined on the basis of
             material evidence in the record, rather than subjective conclusion unsupported by
             evidence in the record. Historically, Visalia approval bodies (Planning Commission and
             City Council) have determined projects meeting the prior findings also meet the criteria for
             this finding.
Currently (December 2015), the City requires a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for all projects over 60
units in size, or for mixed use or residential units in non-residentially zoned districts (See Table 54B).
The conditional use permit process involves a review by City Staff of the proposed development to
ensure that it meets City standards and policies, including the policies of the Housing Element. A
public hearing is held before the Planning Commission. The process ensures that the approved
development is appropriately integrated into the existing neighborhood. None of the conditions
placed on the project have served as an impediment to development nor substantially increased the
price of housing. For instance, in 2015 the City approved a CUP for a 168 multi-family residential
units in the Medium Density Residential (R-M-2) zone on approximately 13 acres . The City required
the following conditions: review and approval of the landscaping and irrigation plans by the City as a
part of the building permit package, construction of solid masonry perimeter walls, view shed
analysis to ensure for the privacy of existing residences adjacent to the project, and acceptance of
the City’s Good Neighbor Policies” for ongoing management of the project.
The processing time for projects in the City of Visalia varies based upon the type of activity involved.
If a negative declaration is required under the California Environmental Quality Act, there is a
mandatory review period. Following Planning Commission approval, there is a 10-day appeal
period. Finally, the developer must submit detailed plans to the City’s Building and Safety Division to
ensure compliance with the building code. Combined, these items can easily add up to several
months. In order to avoid project delays, Planning Division staff works with developers throughout
the process, presenting options such as reducing plan check time by working with building officials

 early on to ensure that plans meet code requirements when they are submitted. Processing and
 permit procedures do not constitute a development constraint in Visalia Individual Residential
 building permits have plan check completed within 10 days; and, 20 days for Commercial and multi-
 family residential projects. The City uses an electronic permit tracking system (Permits Plus) to
 monitor the work flow and progress of each permit. Where a permit is delayed at the functional
 departmental stop (e.g. Fire, Building, Engineering, Planning), the delay is reported at the City
 Manager and Department head level for immediate resolution. Additionally, applicants are able to
 monitor the progress of their permit via the City’s website. The system is purposely transparent and
 interactive to ensure that applicant is assured their permit(s) are being processed in a timely and
 accurate manner, and that they have resolution and recourse in the event the City’s processing
 standards are not being met for their individual permits.
 Development Fees and Other Exactions
 The City collects various fees from developers to cover the costs of processing permits,
 environmental review, building inspections, and capital improvements. Certain residential projects
 that require General Plan amendments, zoning code changes, or other planning-related functions
 require fees in addition to those listed above. Some of these typical fees are summarized in Table
 55A.
 Building permit and planning fees are the method the City uses to defray the cost of the Planning
 and Building Departments. These fees can impact the cost of constructing affordable housing.
 Basic planning and building fees for the City of Visalia are listed below. Building permit fees are
 based on the square footage of the property, and multi-family apartment complexes cost less per
 square foot to inspect than single-family unit. The building and planning fee rate for a “typical” multi-
 family and single-family is difficult to define, but Table 55 estimates comparable costs.
 The City collects development impact fees in accordance with California Government Code Sections
 66000-66025 for the provision of services such as water, sewers, and storm drains. These fees are
 generally assessed based on the number of units in a residential development. When raising fees,
 the City complies with applicable provisions of the government code.

 Housing Element
 The estimated cost of development impact fees and planning fees is $19,620.50 per single-family
 unit and $13,577.36 per multi-family unit. The City of Visalia’s development impact and planning
 fees are similar, if not less than, those of surrounding jurisdictions and do not represent a significant
 constraint to the production of affordable housing.
 On/Off Site Improvement Requirements
 On/off-site improvement standards establish infrastructure or site requirements to support new
 residential development such as streets, sidewalks, water and sewer, drainage, curbs and gutters,
 street signs, park dedications, utility easements and landscaping. While these improvements are
 necessary to ensure that new housing meets the local jurisdiction’s development goals, the cost of
 these requirements can represent a significant share of the cost of producing new housing.
 The City has residential development requirements for residential streets, sidewalks, solar access,
 landscaping, walls, street lighting, and parking. The City adopted these standards to ensure that
 minimum levels of design and construction quality are maintained and adequate levels of street and
 facility improvements are provided.
 While many of the City’s development standards are similar to those in other jurisdictions, there may
 be some standards that exceed the level necessary to ensure adequate circulation and parking,
 drainage, environmental protection, and protection from visual nuisances. The City’s standards are
 summarized below. The standards included in this summary are those with the greatest potential to
 affect housing costs.
 Residential Streets (widths, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks): Chapter 16.12.010 of the Visalia
 Municipal Code describes the development standards for streets in residential subdivisions. The City
 requires the following rights-of-way for streets:
          Divided arterial streets: at least 134 feet wide;
          Undivided arterial streets: at least 110 feet wide;
          Collector streets/local streets: at least 84 feet wide;
          Minor loop streets: at least 60 feet wide;
          Cul-de-sac streets: at least 60 feet wide;
          Frontage roads: at least 50 feet wide; and
          Residential alleys: minimum dedicated width of 20 feet.
 The City requires full-width street improvements including curb, gutter, matching paving, and parking
 lanes. Curbs and gutters are required to be installed at all grades for all locations for any site within a
 subdivision. Sidewalks are also required except on double fronting lots, where sidewalks are only
 required along one frontage, and for a corner lot where a fence or wall is constructed along the
 street-side lot line.
 Parking: Since off-street parking often requires large amounts of land, parking requirements are one
 of the development standards that can most negatively impact the development of affordable
 housing. Off-street parking requirements increase the cost of development, limiting the funds
Page 118                                                           August 2016

available for providing housing. Most municipalities have adopted parking standards that exceed the
actual parking needs of the population.
Visalia’s off-street parking standards for residential uses are summarized in Table 56A. The City
requires two parking spaces (one covered) per single-family unit. For multi-family units, 1.5 parking
spaces per unit is required except under the following conditions:
        Senior citizen multi-family housing development requires one parking space per unit; and
        Planning Commission has the authority to require an additional 0.25 parking spaces per unit
            for guest parking if on-street parking is not available to provide the 0.25 spaces, more than
            50 percent of the units are 2 or 3 bedroom units, or the development does not require
            planning commission review.

             Required parking spaces.
The City allows for reduced parking standards for other types of uses. For example group homes are
required to provide one parking space for every three beds. The Municipal Code does not specify
any reductions in parking spaces for affordable housing projects.
Other Improvements: Section 16.36 of the Visalia Municipal Code (Subdivision Ordinance) requires
that storm drains, water mains, fire hydrants, and fire department access must be provided at the
expense of the subdivider. Connections to existing city sewer system must be provided for each lot
in a subdivision. In addition, street lights must be installed at a minimum on all arterial roadways at
intervals of 220 feet for along both sides, and local roadways must have street lights at intersections.
The City does not have landscaping, circulation improvement, or level of service requirements
associated with subdivisions.
Off-site requirements can be considered regulatory barriers to affordable housing if the jurisdiction
determined requirements are greater (and hence, more costly) than those necessary to achieve
health and safety requirements in the community. While Visalia’s standards are similar to other
jurisdictions, the City offers modified residential standards for affordable housing (i.e., from one to
120 percent of the area median income); infill development (e.g., single vacant lots, underutilized
lots); or lots that are difficult to develop because of size, shape, or vicinity. The modified residential
standards also allow for substantial aesthetic and/or functional improvement over what is permitted
by the underlying residential zone. In Section 17.30.280, Article 6, Modified Residential Standards,
August 2016

 Part 1. Background Report                                                                     City of Visalia
 Housing Element
 the City permits a variation of front yard setbacks to provide more interesting streetscape options
 and allows flexibility in side yards to permit different groupings of units. The modified standards
 ensure that design features achieve the intent of conventional R-1-6 standards of privacy, open
 space, adequate parking and compatibility with neighborhood, as well as, or better than, the
 standards themselves. The density of sites approved under modified standards cannot exceed the
 density allowed under the underlying zone. The modified standards cannot be applied in the R-1-4.5
 zone. The City of Visalia subdivision regulations for off-site improvements are similar to other
 jurisdictions, and do not present a constraint to the development of affordable housing. In addition,
 the City offers flexibility for affordable projects that serves to reduce the number and type of
 requirements and encourages aesthetic and/or functional improvements over what is permitted.
 Open Space and Park Requirements
 Open space and park requirements can decrease the affordability of housing by increasing
 developer fees and/or decreasing the amount of land available on a proposed site for constructing
 units. Chapter 12.36 of Visalia’s Municipal Code describes open space and park requirements. All
 housing units constructed in the city must pay a park acquisition and improvement fee to fund the
 development of neighborhood and community parks. As of September 4, 2015, the combined park
 acquisition and development fee is $3,386 per single-family unit, $2,982 per multi-family unit, and
 $2,330 per mobile home.
 The park dedication requirement, the park improvement fees, and the open space requirements do
 not represent excessive constraints on residential development.
 Density Bonus
 A density bonus is the allocation of development rights that allows a parcel to accommodate
 additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel is
 zoned. On January 1, 2005, SB 1818 revised California’s density bonus statutes by reducing the
 number of affordable units that a developer must provide in order to receive a density bonus. The
 bill also increased the maximum density bonus to 35 percent. The new minimum affordability
 requirements are as follows:
          The  project is eligible for a 20 percent density bonus if at least 5 percent of the units are
             affordable to very low-income households, or 10 percent of the units are affordable to low-
             income households; and
          The project is eligible to receive a 5 percent density bonus if 10 percent of for-purchase units
             are affordable to moderate-income households.
 The law also established a sliding scale, which determines the additional density that a       project can
 receive. A developer can receive the maximum density bonus of 35 percent when                  the project
 provides either 10 percent very low-income units, 20 percent low-income units, or              40 percent
 moderate-income units. In 2005, SB 435 was passed. This legislation served to clarify          California’s
 density bonus law by explaining that a project can only receive one density bonus.
 Prior to SB 1818 and SB 435, jurisdictions were required to grant one incentive, such as financial
 assistance or development standard reductions, to developers of affordable housing. The new laws
Page 120                                                           August 2016

require that cities and counties grant more incentives depending on the percentage of affordable
units developed. Incentives include reductions in zoning standards, reductions in development
standards, reductions in design requirements, and other reductions in costs for developers. Projects
that satisfy the minimum affordable criteria for a density bonus are entitled to one incentive from the
local government. Depending on the amount of affordable housing provided, the number of
incentives can increase to a maximum of three incentives from the local government. If a project
utilizes less than 50 percent of the permitted density bonus, the local government must provide an
additional incentive.
Additionally, the new laws provide density bonuses to projects that donate land for residential use.
The donated land must satisfy all of the following requirements:
        The   land must have general plan and zoning designations which allow the construction of
            very low-income affordable units as a minimum of 10 percent of the units in the residential
            development;
        The land must be a minimum of one acre in size or large enough to allow development of at
            least 40 units; and
        The land must be served by public facilities and infrastructure.
SB 1818 also imposes statewide parking standards that a jurisdiction must grant upon request from
a developer of an affordable housing project that qualifies for a density bonus. The developer may
request these parking standards even if they do not request the density bonus. The new parking
standards are summarized in Table 57. These numbers are the total number of parking spaces
including guest parking and handicapped parking.

The Visalia Zoning Ordinance was amended pursuant to the policies adopted in the 2010 Housing
Element Update. Ordinance 2012-12 revised the City’s previous density bonus and incentives
provisions to exceed State requirements. Table 58A shows the differences between State law and
the City’s current Code.

 incentive identified in Section 17.32.220(B). The number of incentives and concessions offered to
 developers of affordable housing units increase to up to three for each 10 percent increase in the
 number of affordable units within a housing development. The City offers incentives including: a
 reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements (e.g.,
 reduction in setback and square footage requirements or in parking space requirements); approval
 of mixed-use zoning; other regulatory incentives or concessions which result in identifiable cost
 reductions. The City does not provide direct financial incentives or publicly-owned land for the
 housing development, or waive fees or dedication requirements. Table 58A describes the

 Article 34
 Article 34 of the State Constitution requires voter approval for specified “low rent” housing projects
 that involve certain types of public agency participation. Generally, a project is subject to Article 34 if
 more than 49 percent of its units will be rented to low-income persons. If a project is subject to
 Article 34, it will require an approval from the local electorate. This can constrain the production of
 affordable housing, since the process to seek ballot approval for affordable housing projects can be
 costly and time consuming, with no guarantee of success.
 The provisions of Article 34 allow local jurisdictions to seek voter approval for “general authority” to
 develop low‐income housing without identifying specific projects or sites. If the electorate approves
 general parameters for certain types of affordable housing development, the local jurisdiction will be
 able to move more quickly in response to housing opportunities that fall within those parameters.
 Potential Environmental Constraints
          Flooding: The City is located on relatively level terrain typical of the Tulare Lake Basin.
 However, Visalia does rest in the heart of the Kaweah River Delta system. The Terminus Dam
 which forms Lake Kaweah about 18 miles to the east, controls river flows of the Kaweah River. St.
 Johns River, a branch of the Kaweah River extends along the City’s northern corporate boundary. In
Page 122                                                          August 2016

addition, the City contains an extensive network of creeks and irrigation ditches that carry
programmed releases of water from Lake Kaweah and from the Friant Irrigation Canal to area farms
and orchards. These creeks and ditches also channel and carry area-wide and local storm water
runoff through the City in a generally northeast to southwest pattern, terminating west of the City
near Tulare Lake bed.
Visalia has experienced several major floods in its history: 1950, 1955, 1966, and 1969. The
waterways noted above have historically been used to control and convey stormflows. In June 2009,
FEMA updated its Flood Insurance Rate Map panels for Visalia. The changes from the previous
maps generally reflected the improvements in storm water managements, including automatic
pumps, and local detention basins, However, the Maps adversely rated older parts of the City
(particularly north of Hwy 198) . This was due to the unreinforced levee banks of the St. Johns River.
FEMA flood evaluators determined the levees could eventually fail and cause shallow area wide
flooding during a 100-year storm event. Consequently, many of the City’s older and more affordable
neighborhoods were placed in Moderate and High Risk Flood Zones (Zones A, B).
Houses located in Flood Zones A and B are required to have FEMA approved flood insurance in
order to qualify for federally backed home loans, mortgage assistance, or rehabilitation grants and
loans. The added cost of this insurance (average $1,200 per year) must be factored into decisions
whether to fund mortgage assistance or rehabilitation loans in many of the City’s more affordable
neighborhoods.
         Hazardous Materials and Sites: There are 42 contaminated sites throughout the City that
have been identified and are under the jurisdiction of federal, state, or county of Tulare jurisdiction.
This includes one Superfund site, comprising four small (1,000 sq. yards or less in area) in the East
Downtown area that was fully remediated in 2009. Other sites identified as contaminated are
primarily former dry cleaning shops, agricultural chemical storage sites, and leaking underground
fuel storage sites. Typical remediation of the sites consisted of soil excavation, soil replacement and
continuous groundwater testing to ensure the presence of the contaminants has abated.
The City continues to perform Phase 1 Environmental surveys, and subsequent detailed soil testing
prior to offering City-owned sites to affordable home construction partners. This represents an added
cost of ensuring that suitable residential development sites are provided for new affordable housing
projects.
In addition, federal law requires detailed preclusion analyses to be performed by the City for all
candidate sites before mortgage assistance or rehabilitation funds can be authorized. City staff
performs the site preclusion analysis for each candidate site. City staff uses local and state data
bases as well as the federal EPA Enviro-tracker program to perform this analysis. Where the
proximity to contaminated sites is less than the acceptable threshold per applicable regulations, the
site is eliminated from eligibility. To date, no candidate site has been eliminated due to either direct
site contamination, or for its proximity to a former or active contaminated site.
         Noise: The General Plan Noise Element serves as the guide for establishing a pattern of
land uses that minimizes the exposure of residents and other sensitive receptors (e.g. schools) to
excessive noise. The primary noise generator that affects residents is roadway noise. The City
employs number of mitigation measures to attenuate noise to acceptable levels (30 dBA interior, 45

 dBA exterior). These include sound walls, enhanced design and construction techniques for both
 noise generators and noise receptors, and regulatory limits on the times when excessive noise
 generation may be allowed.
 Noise impacts is an environmental category that is reviewed under the National Environmental
 Policy Act (NEPA). Consequently, Candidate houses for federally backed mortgage assistance
 programs must demonstrate that the house interior and exterior noise levels will fall below the
 Community noise acceptance levels. Typically, houses adjacent to collector or arterial roads where
 perimeter sound walls are not installed will not qualify for assistance programs to noise level
 exceedance.
 Potential Non-Governmental Constraints
 The availability and cost of housing is strongly influenced by market forces over which local
 governments have little or no control. Nonetheless, State law requires that the Housing Element
 contain a general assessment of these constraints, which can serve as the basis for actions to offset
 their effects. The primary non-governmental constraints to the development of new housing in
 Visalia can be broken into the following categories: availability of financing and development costs.
 All resources needed to develop housing in Visalia are subject to the laws of supply and demand,
 meaning that these resources may not always be available at prices which make housing
 development attractive. Thus, cost factors are the primary non-governmental constraints upon
 development of housing in Visalia. This is particularly true in the case of housing for low- and
 moderate-income households, where basic development cost factors such as the cost of land,
 required site improvements, and basic construction are critical in determining the income a
 household must have in order to afford housing.
 Availability of Financing
 Financing has historically been available for credit-worthy projects, with interest rates determined
 largely by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board. Beginning in the 1990s, rising housing
 values and a growing housing industry boosted investor and homebuyer portfolios and contributed to
 a sense of security that encouraged continued investment in the housing market. Alternative
 mortgage products increased the number of homebuyers, especially investors who purchased
 single-family homes as non-primary residences. Virtually every business or profession related to
 homes sales, construction, mortgages, and titles had increased business opportunities during this
 period.
 The use of alternative or “creative” mortgage products, such as graduated payment mortgages,
 variable and adjustable rate mortgages, interest-only loans, “stated income” loans with no income
 verification, and zero down payment loans allowed consumers to purchase high-priced housing
 without the qualifications required by a traditional loans, such as sufficient income level. These
 mortgage products increased homeownership rates–a goal of affordable housing advocates. Even
 during periods of higher interest rates, homeownership and home sales increased. However,
 starting in 2006, home prices in Visalia and throughout California began to level off and then
 declined for both new and existing homes.. The mortgage market collapse also impacted borrowers
 with “jumbo” loans, relatively large loans that are not Federally backed. A jumbo mortgage is a loan
Page 124                                                          August 2016

amount above conventional conforming loan limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Federally-
chartered financial institutions that purchase the bulk of residential mortgages in the U.S. Resets of
interest rates and mortgage payments in the subprime mortgage market resulted in huge waves of
foreclosures between 2007 and 2011. Beginning in 2012, the local housing market began to stabilize
and again show gains. This was concurrent with absorption of foreclosed homes into the housing
market, and interest rates at or below 5% for qualifying home buyers. As a result, sales of existing
homes and new residential construction have achieved more stable volumes that predated the
extremes of highs and lows that characterized the local housing market between 2000 and 2011.
The U.S. Census American Community Survey provides data at the county-level regarding
overpayment. In 2015, 35.4% of Visalia homeowners spent more than 30% of their gross income on
housing costs. Comparatively, 49.8% of Visalia households renting spent more than 30% of their
gross income on housing costs. (U.S. Census, American Community Survey, 2015). The high
percentage of both homeowners and renters spending a disproportionate percentage of income on
housing, suggests that housing, while relatively affordable when compared to Statewide averages,
represents a substantial burden to local residents. This is due in large part to the relatively low
household incomes in Visalia relative to the costs of both owner-occupied and rental housing.
Development Costs
Land Costs
Costs associated with the acquisition of land include both the market price of raw land and the cost
of holding the property throughout the development process. Land acquisition costs can account for
over half of the final sales price of new homes in small developments and in areas where land is
scarce. During the housing boom, raw residential land (without site improvements) received
upwards of $200,000 per acre in Visalia (or over $40,000 per unfinished lot). This was due to in
large part to speculative land purchasing and development entitlements, and resulted in a glut of
over 6,000 residential units (paper lots) approved for development as of early 2009, at the start of
the Great Recession.. The value of land declined as home building dramatically slowed to as few as
216 units annually (compared to the high of over 1,500 in FY 2005/06). Residential permits have
risen to over 600 as of December 2015. This is considered by the City and by development experts
as a more sustainable rate of housing production, as compared to both the highs and lows
experienced during the last ten years.
According to local housing developers, raw residential land costs have remained well below their
historic highs in in 2006. This is in large part due to the large quantity of residential lands that held
approved development projects, but that fell into foreclosure and re-purchase at very favorable
prices (between 20%-50% of their original purchase prices and entitlement costs). Most of these
projects remain in their entitled status, owing to the series of automatic State subdivision map time
extensions granted between 2009 and 2015. As a result, Visalia’s raw residential land costs are
estimated to be between $35,000 and $45,000 per acre depending on location.
Site Improvement Costs
Upon securing the raw land, a residential developer would have to make certain site improvements
to “finish” the lot before a home could actually be built on the property. Such improvements include

 connections to existing utility systems, rough grading, construction of streets, installation of water
 and sewer lines, and construction of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. Site improvement costs for a
 single-family home in Visalia were estimated as ranging between $25,000 and $35,000 per lot. This
 is approximately the as before the severe development downturn of the Great Recession.
 Development Impact and Planning Fees
 As previously discussed in the section on Development Fees and Exactions, the City collects various
 fees from developers to cover the costs of processing permits and providing necessary services and
 infrastructure. The development impact fees vary on a case-to-case basis but for the purposes of
 this discussion, it is estimated that fees for a single-family home would be $19,620 and $13,577 for
 a multi-family unit (refer to Table 55A). This represents a 9.4% increase for single-family units, and a
 9.0% increase for multi-family units over a six year period (less than 2% increase per year).
 Construction Costs
 Housing construction costs can act as a constraint to the affordability of new housing. However, the
 cost of construction varies with the type, size, location, and amenities of the development. “Entry-
 level” homes have fewer amenities than other higher priced units. According to the City Building
 Official, , an entry-level, 1,500 square foot, three-bedroom, two-bath home costs $70 to 75 per
 square foot to build, totaling $105,000 to $112,500in construction costs. Generally wood-frame
 construction at 20 to 40 units per acre is the most cost-efficient method of residential development.
 The increased use of prefabricated factory-built or manufactured housing, which is permitted in all
 residential districts throughout the city (consistent with California State law), may provide for even
 lower-priced housing by reducing construction and labor costs.
 There is little that the City can do to mitigate the impacts of high construction costs except by
 avoiding local amendments to uniform building codes that unnecessarily increase construction costs
 without significantly adding to health, safety, or construction quality. Because construction costs are
 similar in the City to those in other Central Valley areas, the cost of construction is not considered a
 major constraint to housing production.
 Total Housing Development Costs
 High construction costs coupled with high land costs make it difficult for private sector developers to
 provide housing for lower-income residents. Subsidies, incentives, and other types of financial
 assistance are available to private sector developers to bridge the gap between actual costs of
 development and the sale price of affordable housing.
 As shown in Table 59, the total of all housing development costs discussed above for a typical entry-
 level single-family home (1,500 square feet on at 0.25 acre lot) is $164,259.50 to $181,759.50,
 including site improvements, construction costs, and fees and permits (as shown in Table 59A).
 This figure does not include developer profit, marketing, or financing costs.

Review of Existing (2010) Housing Element
The following section reviews and evaluates the City’s progress in implementing the 2010 Housing
Element. It reviews the results and effectiveness of policies and programs for the previous Housing
Element planning period.
                                 To provide for a broad range of housing types and densities to meet the

Programs
HE Program 1.1 DESIGNATE FOR SUFFICIENT LAND
The City shall maintain a sufficient supply land at various densities to allow for the construction of sufficient
housing to meet its TCAG regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) between 2003 and 2008. The City shall
review, as needed, the amount of land designated for various residential uses in conjunction with the amount
and types of housing produced in the previous year to determine if any changes in the General Plan may be
needed to meet City housing needs. A review of the supply of vacant land and development patterns over the
preceding year will be incorporated into each annual evaluation of the City's implementation of its Housing
Element programs.

         Funding: General Fund
         Timeframe: FY 2009, review annually
         Quantified Objective: N/A
Evaluation: The City fully achieved its RHNA land supply responsibilities immediately upon adoption of the
2010 Housing Element. This was accomplished because there is sufficient developable vacant sites in the
Medium and High density residential land use categories to accommodate the City’s allocation. These
densities default to Low, Very Low and Extremely Low income categories. In addition, housing unit potential
in Low and Median Income categories were credited to mixed use and re-use of vacant and developed but
underperforming sites in the Downtown, East Downtown and Mooney Commercial Corridor areas of the City.
Further, development and rezoning of Medium and High Density residential to lower densities occurred in
only limited amounts during the effective period ending December 2014. In each case, the available land
inventory maintained an adequate surplus capacity (1,801 units) within the same affordability density and
develop ability potential. The primary losses of inventory sites or potential units were due to sites developed
by the VUSD for school sites and for multi-family projects that developed below target densities.
HE Program 1.2 CONTACT WITH CITY OFFICIALS
The City shall accept and consider written requests to examine specific City land use controls and building
standards which are deemed by the local housing industry to discourage innovative design or that exclude low
and moderate income households from the local housing market. Such requests will be reviewed with the
appropriate City agency and a response provided on the request’s disposition.

Evaluation: The City maintains multiple venues wherein in receiving recommendations on improving both the
availability and affordability of housing and the preservation of existing housing can be submitted by the
housing industry. These have resulted in several partnership efforts such as City funding on two new projects,
and in coordinating outreach and service programs to key stakeholder groups, such as elderly mobile home
owners in need of emergency repairs, and in participating in homeless services programs (case management)

Evaluation: The City adopted this revision by Zoning Code amendment in March 2011.
HE Program 1.5 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT PROCESS
To ensure that the conditional use permit process for multi-family projects of greater than 60 housing units
does not impact the timing, cost, or supply of multi-family development, the City shall continue to monitor the
conditional use permit process on multi-family applications to determine whether or not the process impacts
the development of multi-family units. During the annual report to the Planning Commission, an assessment
shall be made of multi-family projects considered during the year. If it is determined that the conditional use
permit process impacts the timing, cost, or supply of multi-family housing, especially affordable housing
projects, the City shall reconsider its position on this matter and adopt mitigations, which could include
increasing the project size threshold based on typical affordable housing projects or eliminating the conditional
use process, within six months.

          Time Frame: FY 2010-11; Ongoing
          Quantified Objective: 20 second units annually
Evaluation: The City offers assistance at the front counter. However, the City has not found it practical to
specify prototypes for second dwelling units, nor has funding been available to prepare a video or other
electronic promotional/instructional materials.
HE Program 3.18 ASSISTED HOUSING PROJECTS ELIGIBLE FOR CONVERSION
The City shall monitor the status of the affordable housing projects (e.g., The Meadows and Clark Court) with
expiring affordability covenants and contact owners concerning their plans to continue in or opt out of the
subsidy programs. If necessary, the City shall identify potential buyers of at-risk projects, such as the Tulare
County Housing Authority, Christian Church Homes of Northern California, Inc., Self-Help Enterprises, and
possible sources of City funding to supplement primary State and Federal sources. The City shall refer to
HCD's Internet site (www.hcd.ca.gov) for the listing of individuals and organizations interested in the first
right of refusal program.

Housing Element
Evaluation: The City received one request for development of large site listed on the RHNA available lands
inventory. However, the site, which is located on the south side of Houston Ave., west of Mooney Blvd., was
entitled as a market rate development, without requests for funding assistance.
HE Program 3.20 TARGETING EXTREMELY LOW-INCOME DEVELOPMENTS
The City shall seek State and Federal funding specifically targeted for the development of housing affordable
to extremely low-income households, such as the State Local Housing Trust Fund program and Proposition 1-
C funds. Additionally, the City shall identify development opportunities and provide incentives for the
development of housing for extremely low-income households (e.g., priority processing, fee waivers or
deferrals). The City shall promote the benefits of this program to the development community by posting
information on its webpage and creating a hand out to be distributed with development applications.
Additionally, the City shall conduct outreach to extremely low-income service providers, on at least an annual
basis, to encourage the development of housing for extremely low-income households.
          Responsibility: Housing and Economic Development Department
          Funding: State and Federal funds
          Timeframe: Ongoing
          Quantified Objective: 50 extremely low-income units

          Time Frame: Ongoing
          Funding: General Fund (Staff Time)
          Quantified Objective: N/A
Evaluation: The City actively supports this program through assistance to its NGO partners, and in requiring
this education as a condition of receiving mortgage/ down payment assistance in conjunction with its first time
homebuyer program.
HE Program 4.2 FORECLOSURE PREVENTION RESOURCES
The City shall promote foreclosure prevention resources by posting information on the City website about
foreclosure prevention hotlines and services offered by HUD-approved housing counseling agencies (e.g.,
Self-Help Enterprises).

Housing Element
Evaluation: The City provides referral services concerning foreclosure risks though its partnership with
associated NGOs.
HE Program 4.3 NUISANCE ABATEMENT IN IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOODS
To help secure and maintain vacant, foreclosed properties, the City shall expand code enforcement in the areas
most impacted by foreclosures. The City shall strive to effectively follow up on code violations to ensure that
problems are addressed.
         Responsibility: Building Department, Finance Department, Redevelopment Agency
         Funding: General Fund, Neighborhood Stabilization Program
         Time Frame: Ongoing
         Quantified Objective: N/A
Evaluation: The City consistently commits substantial Code Enforcement resources in identifying and
following up on foreclosed properties. This is accomplished by maintaining an effective notification,
enforcement and follow up program, primarily with banks and lending institutions. Where the City is unable
to gain voluntary compliance in property management, the City utilized its administrative recovery process.
The administrative recovery process allows the City to take corrective action as needed, and where the
property owning entity has failed to pay the judgement fees, the property is leaned and, as needed, a daily fine
is also imposed on the property owner which could also be recovered through lean action.
HE Program 4.4 FORECLOSURE REGISTRATION ORDINANCE
To ensure that foreclosed homes are not a source of blight, the City shall explore the feasibility of adopting an
ordinance that requires owners of foreclosed homes, including banks, mortgage lenders, or any other holder of
a deed of trust, to register their properties with the Building Department and pay a fine if the properties fall
into disrepair. The City shall establish an electronic registration system through the City’s website that would
allow neighboring homeowners to report problem homes.
         Responsibility: Building Department, Community Development Department
         Funding: General Fund, Neighborhood Stabilization Program
         Time Frame: FY 2010-11
         Quantified Objective: N/A
Evaluation: The City found it unnecessary to compile a separate foreclosure listing. Rather, the City
subscribes to public documents that track foreclosures. This is valuable for identifying candidate properties
for the City’s foreclosure purchase and rehabilitation program.
HE Program 4.5 FORECLOSURE ACQUISITION
The City shall continue to work with qualified non-profit partners to acquire foreclosed properties, rehabilitate
properties if necessary, and redevelop properties as affordable housing. The City may use other housing
programs, such as the first time homebuyer down-payment assistance program, in conjunction. In some cases,
the City may demolish foreclosed homes and re-use the land for mixed-use or non-residential purposes when
the demolition will create an opportunity to create more amenities and carry out a comprehensive rebuilding or
revitalization strategy.

          Quantified Objective:     Rehabilitate 5 historical homes and upgrade 20 units per year
Evaluation: The City did not receive any requests for assistance associated with the rehabilitation and/or
adaptive reuse of historic residences during the evaluation period. However, rehabilitation funds were used to
restore the exterior of one historic home when it was discovered the materials installed by the low-income
homeowner were non-compliant with the City’s historic preservation ordinance.
HE Program 6.9 REHABILITATION/DEMOLITION
When funding becomes available, the City shall initiate a study to assess the need and feasibility for significant
rehabilitation or demolition of dilapidated housing units and identify potential funding sources to fund
rebuilding efforts.

Housing Element
INTRODUCTION
Under California law, the housing element must include the community's goals, policies, quantified
objectives, and housing programs for the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
This Housing Element includes nine goal statements. Under each goal statement, the element sets out
policies that amplify the goal statement. Implementation programs are listed at the end of the
corresponding group of policies and describe briefly the proposed action, the City agencies or
departments with primary responsibility for carrying out the program, funding source, and the time frame
for accomplishing the program. Several of the implementation programs also identify quantified
objectives.
The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of goals, policies, implementation
programs, and quantified objectives as they are used in the Housing Element Policy Document:
         Goal: Ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature and immeasurable.
         Policy: Specific statement guiding action and implying clear commitment.
         Implementation Program: An action, procedure, program, or technique that carries out policy.
         Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the action and an
         estimated time frame for its accomplishment. The time frame indicates the fiscal year in which
         the activity is scheduled to be completed. These time frames are general guidelines and may be
         adjusted based on City staffing and budgetary considerations.
         Quantified Objective: The number of housing units that the City expects to be constructed,
         conserved, or rehabilitated; or the number of households the City expects will be assisted through
         Housing Element programs based on general market conditions during the time frame of the
         Housing Element.
The housing element law recognizes that in developing housing policy and programs, identified housing
needs may exceed available resources and the community's ability to satisfy these needs. The quantified
objectives of the housing element, therefore, need not be identical to the identified housing need but
should establish the maximum number of housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and
conserved or households assisted over a five-year time frame.
Affordable: For purposes of this section the term “affordable” is defined as: Housing that is affordable
to Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low income categories, regardless whether the housing is market
priced, or is deed restricted as a result of Federal, State, or Local funding assistance, non-monetary
incentive program, or tax increment reduction or waiver program. Affordable housing is housing that
requires no more than 30% of an income qualifying occupant’s gross salary to maintain the housing unit .
In addition, for purposes of the Housing Element, affordable housing includes any housing developed at a
gross density of 20 units or more per acre.

Housing Element
NEW CONSTRUCTION
Between 2010-2015 single-family detached housing units accounted for the majority of housing in Visalia. At
about 77 percent of the total housing stock, single-family detached units in Visalia make up a much larger
share of the total than in the state overall, where only 57.4 percent of all units are single-family detached.
From 2010 to 2015, over 2,047 single-family detached units were built in Visalia, making up nearly 93 percent
of all new units constructed. The vast majority of these single family homes constructed within the past ten
years in Visalia are occupied by homeowners. However, in many of the older sections of the city, including
the Oval Park and Washington School neighborhoods, more than two thirds of the single-family homes are
occupied by renters. Visalia has managed to address its’ demand for affordable and rental market housing
through the retention of single-family homes as evidenced in the older neighborhoods throughout the city.
Based on the city’s changing demographic profile, the City will need to provide a variety of housing types to
meet the needs of its diversifying population. Therefore, the City will need rely less on large single family
residential units and more on other types of units (e.g., townhomes, apartments, live-work units, small lot
single family, etc.) to meet the housing needs of its population.
Goal HE-1                          To provide for a broad range of housing types and densities to meet the
                                   needs of all Visalia residents.
Policies
HE Policy 1.1 The City shall ensure that sufficient land is available and zoned at a range of residential
densities to accommodate the City’s regional share of new construction housing.
HE Policy 1.2 The City shall encourage the development of new residential projects that are designed to
facilitate non-automobile modes of travel.
HE Policy 1.3 The City shall encourage the consolidation of parcels designated for multi-family residential
development when it facilitates efficient development of the parcels.
HE Policy 1.4 The City shall encourage a mix of residential development types in the city, including single
family homes on a variety of lot sizes, as well as townhomes, row houses, live-work units, planned unit
developments, and multi-family housing.
HE Policy 1.5 The City shall encourage housing developers to provide community outreach for all their
housing projects to address concerns about the project.
HE Policy 1.6 The City shall work to educate the public regarding the myths and realities of multi-family and
affordable housing.
HE Policy 1.7 The City shall promote development standards that ensure that new residential developments
are long-term assets to the City, make effective use of land, and are compatible with adjacent land uses.
HE Policy 1.8 The City shall continue to provide assistance by and access to City Staff, in person or by
phone, so as to encourage increased public awareness and understanding of the City’s housing regulations and
standards as they pertain to new construction.

Programs
HE Program 1.1 DESIGNATE FOR SUFFICIENT LAND
The City shall maintain a sufficient supply land at various densities to allow for the construction of sufficient
housing to meet its TCAG regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) between 2014 and 2023. The City shall
review, as needed, the amount of land designated for various residential uses in conjunction with the amount
and types of housing produced in the previous year to determine if any changes in the General Plan may be
needed to meet City housing needs. A review of the supply of vacant land and development patterns over the
preceding year will be incorporated into each annual evaluation of the City's implementation of its Housing
Element programs.
         Responsibility: Community Development Department
         Funding: General Fund

         Low Income Categories
HE Program 1.2 CONTACT WITH CITY OFFICIALS
The City shall regularly solicit requests to examine specific City land use controls and building standards
which are deemed by the local housing development industry that may tend to discourage innovative design
and new construction standards, or that exclude affordable income households from the local housing market.
Such requests will be placed on the standing Building Advisory Committee (BAC) annually.
         Responsibility: Community Development Department, Building Official
         Funding: General Fund
         Timeframe: Annually

HE Program 1.4 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT PROCESS
To ensure that the conditional use permit process for multi-family projects of greater than 60 housing units
(greater than 80 units in the R-M-3 zoning designation when not adjacent to R-1 zoning designation) does not
impact the timing, cost, or supply of multi-family development, the City shall continue to monitor the
conditional use permit process on multi-family applications to determine whether or not the process impacts
the development of multi-family units. During the annual report to the Planning Commission, an assessment
shall be made of multi-family projects considered during the year. If it is determined that the conditional use
permit process impacts the timing, cost, or supply of multi-family housing, especially affordable housing
projects, the City shall reconsider its position on this matter and adopt mitigations, which could include
increasing the project size threshold based on typical affordable housing projects or eliminating the conditional
use process, within six months.

MIXED USE, INFILL, AND DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT
The City of Visalia has made a serious commitment to accommodate its regional housing need over the next
five years within the existing city limits. This strategy relies primarily on promoting infill development,
revitalizing economically underutilized commercial districts as mixed-use neighborhoods, and intensifying
Visalia’s Downtown core. Not only will this approach provide hundreds of new housing opportunities, it will
also have a myriad of other benefits, including:
     •    Reducing urban sprawl;
     •    Reducing energy consumption;
     •    Reducing emissions that contribute to climate change;

ENCOURAGING AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Between 2009 and 2012, Visalia home prices dropped to half of their pre-recession values. This raised the
affordability index, although it simultaneously raised the cost of rental housing due to the large number of
misplaced families who had left their previous homes. Since 2012, prices of existing homes have been almost
fully restored to their pre-2009 levels. New housing construction, which waned to less than 20 percent of its
pre-previous highs (over 1,500 units per year), has been restored to a fully sustainable 500 to 600 units per
year. However, the cost of new housing has outpaced the household incomes of most first-time homebuyers.
Although Visalia’s housing stock is still considered relatively affordable by California standards, there still
exists a sizable demand for quality, affordable housing for a significant part of Visalia population.
There is no best strategy for providing affordable housing in Visalia. Most affordable housing projects require
multiple subsidies to bridge the affordability gap. Through a combination of successful partnerships with other
public agencies (e.g., Housing Authority) and other local non-profits (i.e., CSET, Self Help Enterprises,
Habitat for Humanity, and Christian Group Homes), the City continues to administer successful housing
programs, as well as provide millions of dollars in funding for affordable housing.
Housing Market Analysis Overview:
There is a disparity between the need and availability of affordable housing in the City. Three quarters (75
percent) of the City’s housing stock is comprised of single-family detached homes. The newly adopted General
Plan, however, designates a higher proportion for multi-family development than the previous General Plan,
which will allow for the development of diverse housing opportunities for LMI households. The City’s median
household income is not keeping pace with the cost of housing, which may pose financial challenges for
households seeking to purchase or rent a home. With 2012 median prices at almost double 2000 rates, families
seeking rental units might experience greater difficulty affording housing.
According to 2007-2011 CHAS data, approximately 2,760 households are at 0-30% AMI, yet there are only
375 rental units available that are affordable to these households (no data is available on homeowner units). In
total, there are 11,455 units affordable for LMI households earning 80% or less AMI, and yet there are 13,480
households within this income bracket in need of housing. While the shortage of affordable units is most acute
for those in the lowest income bracket, even households earning 50-80% AMI might have difficulty finding
affordable units.
The following provides a brief overview of the results of the Housing Market Analysis, with more detail
included in each corresponding section.
Units Available
     • The City is comprised of a total housing stock of approximately 43,000 units.
     • Single-family detached and attached housing units represent over three quarters (79 percent) of all
          housing units in the City, while multi-family homes make up less than a quarter (21 percent) of the
          City’s total housing stock.
Cost of Housing
     • Forty percent of all households (35 percent of owners and 50 percent of renters) spend more than 30
          percent of their income on housing costs (including utilities).

FORECLOSURES
Following a decade of exponential growth in the housing market, housing growth began to crash in 2006 after
one of the biggest financial crises of the past half century. Declining home values and sharp interest rate
resets have combined to drive foreclosures to record levels, and the losses to homeowners, communities, and
investors have thrown the economy into recession. California has been one of the hardest hit states in the
nation with California’s foreclosure rate being nearly twice the national average. Home prices in the Central
Valley have been plummeting due in large part to the high rates of foreclosure and oversupply of new homes.
As of December 31, 2008, there were about 1,700 pre-foreclosed, auctioned and foreclosed properties in
Visalia. These foreclosures have led to a number of problems including neighborhood blight, increased crime
activity, declining property values, loss in property tax revenue for the City, overcrowding, and numerous
economic impacts.
In the wake of the national mortgage crisis, preventing or mitigating foreclosures and facilitating recovery
from the damage they cause have become tremendous challenges for local governments. Local government,
community groups, and the local private sector by themselves can only do so much to address rising
foreclosures. The root causes of the foreclosure crisis, including lending and regulatory policies and practices,
lie at a much larger geographic scale than a particular city or metropolitan area, and local governments are
typically limited in their ability to do things like regulate lending or change foreclosure processes. However,
there are a number of foreclosure mitigation strategies available to local governments, such as:
     •    Reaching out to distressed borrowers and those facing resets to prevent additional foreclosures;
     •    Expanding access to services to households who are in the foreclosure process to ensure that they
          receive help in finding rental housing, credit repair services; and
     •    Mitigating the negative impact of foreclosures and REO properties on neighborhoods.
In September 2008, the Federal government established the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to combat the
foreclosure crisis throughout the United States. Several cities and counties across the nation were granted
funds to address the blighted conditions resulting from the abandonment and loss of homeowners. The City of
Visalia received a $2.3 million grant from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to acquire,
rehabilitate, and resell foreclosed homes. Home purchases have been targeted in low/mod areas primarily in
the central Visalia where homes tend to be older and in disrepair. The City plans to purchase and rehabilitate
between 30 and 50 foreclosed homes and then resell them to moderate- to low-income buyers. The City is
targeting 3-bedroom, 2-bath homes selling between $55,000 and $125,000. The intent of this program is to
minimize blighted conditions in neighborhoods and boost homeownership rates while assisting homeowners in
securing fixed rate mortgages.
The City recycles funds from the resale of the homes, which turned the original $2.3 M into over $5.5 M,
allowing the purchase of additional properties, targeting 3+bedroom, 2-bath single family dwellings.
Purchases were targeted in low/mod areas primarily in the central Visalia where homes tended to be older and
in disrepair. From 2008 to 2015, the City acquired, rehabilitated and resold 34 homes as well as an additional
8 homes acquired, rehabilitated and resold by Habitat for Humanity. Additionally, the City utilized HOME
funds to acquire, rehab and resale an additional eight homes primarily on the southern areas of Visalia
boundaries. With the improved market conditions, funding has now been directed to the City’s non-profit
partners to acquire properties, whether foreclosed, abandoned, vacant or available on the open market. The
goal is to continue improving neighborhoods and provide affordable housing throughout Visalia.

Within the general population there are several groups of people who have special housing needs. These
special needs can make it difficult for members of these groups to locate suitable housing.
Visalia’s special needs groups include the following:
         Seniors. With the overall aging of society, the senior population (persons over 65 years of age) will
         increase in most communities. Consequently, the need for affordable and specialized housing for older
         residents will grow. Typical housing types used to meet the needs of seniors include smaller attached
         or detached housing for independent living (both market-rate and affordable), second units, shared
         housing, age-restricted below-market-rate rental developments, congregate care facilities, life-care
         facilities, residential care homes licensed by the State, and skilled nursing homes.
         Homeless Persons. Homeless individuals and families have perhaps the most immediate housing
         need of any group. They also have one of the most difficult set of housing needs to meet, due to both
         the diversity and complexity of the factors that lead to homelessness, and to community opposition to
         the siting of facilities that serve homeless clients.
         Single-Parent Households. Single-parent households need affordable housing with day care and
         recreation programs on-site or nearby, in proximity to schools and with access to services. Households
         with single-parent heads, like large households, may have difficulty in finding appropriate-sized

         housing. And despite fair housing laws and programs, discrimination against children may make it
         more difficult for this group to find adequate housing.
         People with Disabilities. People with disabilities represent a wide range of different housing needs,
         depending on the type and severity of their disability as well as personal preference and lifestyle.
         “Barrier-free design” housing, accessibility modifications, proximity to services and transit, and group
         living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations and accommodations that are
         important in serving this need group.
         Large Households. Large households, defined in the 1990 census as households with five or more
         persons, have special housing needs. Large households tend to have difficulties purchasing housing
         because large housing units are rarely affordable and rental units with three or more bedrooms may
         not be common in many communities.
         Farmworkers. Farmworkers are an essential component of Tulare County’s agricultural sector of the
         economy. Farmworkers tend to be relatively young, predominantly male, and almost always members
         of a minority group, primarily Hispanic. While a number of farmworkers are single men, many have
         family members accompanying them, especially after the recent changes in immigration laws. Most
         farmworkers have high rates of poverty, live in overcrowded housing units, and have a low
         homeownership rate.
         Extremely Low-Income Households. Extremely low-income households are defined as those
         households with incomes under 30 percent of the area median income. Extremely low-income
         households typically consist of minimum wage workers, seniors on fixed incomes, the disabled, and
         farmworkers. This income group is likely to live in overcrowded and substandard housing conditions.
         This group of households has specific housing needs that require greater government subsidies and
         assistance, housing with supportive services, single room occupancy (SRO) and or shared housing,
         and/or rental subsidies or vouchers.

NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION/HOUSING REHABILITATION
There is often public anxiety based on the misperception that affordable and multi-family housing will devalue
the neighborhoods in which they are established. Careful design and enforcement of design standards can
ensure compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods and reduce opposition. Recent affordable housing
projects in Visalia have helped to dispel misperceptions of affordable and multi-family housing by maintaining
high-quality standards.
While it is important to encourage the development of new affordable housing, reinvestment in the existing
supply of housing is equally important. Since approximately 25 percent of the City’s housing stock was built
before 1970, there are number of these units that are in need of some form of rehabilitation. There are several
neighborhoods and mobile home parks that are in need of substantial rehabilitation.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITY HOUSING AND DISCRIMINATION PREVENTION
According to California State Law, all households have the right to rent or purchase housing without
discrimination. State law also requires local governments to “promote housing opportunities for all persons
regardless of race, religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, national origin or color.” Local governments are
prohibited from discriminating against low-income persons, subsidized housing, and homeless shelters.
The City has continued to ensure equal housing opportunity through the enforcement of fair housing practices
and the dissemination of fair housing information throughout the community. The City’s support for the
Tulare County Housing Authority in the operation of its fair housing counseling services has proven to be an
effective means for addressing housing issues and ensuring fair housing in the city.

ENERGY CONSERVATION
Energy conservation and efficiency is not only environmentally responsible and economically efficient, but it
has direct application to affordable housing. The more money spent on energy, the less there is available for
rent or mortgage payments. High energy costs have particularly detrimental effects on low-income households
that do not have enough income or cash reserves to absorb cost increases and must choose between basic needs
such as shelter, food, and energy.
In addition to reducing residential energy costs which makes housing more affordable, there are a number of
benefits to providing better design and building practices and energy conserving technologies, including:
providing enormous reductions in demand for fossil fuels and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG); and
addressing environmental challenges such as natural resource depletion; waste disposal; and air, water, and soil
pollution.

           Housing Element
           QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
           One of the requirements of State law (California Government Code Section 65583[b]) is that the Housing
           Element contain quantified objectives for the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of
           housing. State law recognizes that the total housing needs identified by a community may exceed available
           resources and the community’s ability to satisfy this need. Under these circumstances, the quantified
           objectives need not be identical to the total housing needs. The quantified objectives shall, however, establish
           the maximum number of housing units by income category that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and
           conserved over a five-year time period. Table 1A summarizes the quantified objectives for the construction,
           rehabilitation, or conservation of units during the time frame of the Housing Element (2014-2023).

                         Level of Service
                         To determine the operating conditions of a roadway
                         segment or intersection, the concept of level of ser-
                         vice (LOS) is commonly used. The LOS grading sys-
                         tem is a scale ranging from LOS A to LOS F, with
                         LOS A representing free-flow conditions and LOS F
                         representing congested conditions. Table 4-1 provides
                         more specific definitions.
                           Table 4-1:  Intersection Level of Service Definitions
                                                                                                                   Stopped Delay/Vehicle (sec)

                           A        Free Flow or Insignificant Delays: Vehicles are completely                  < 10.0           < 10.0            < 10.0
                                    unimpeded in their abil-ity to maneuver within the traffic stream.
                                    Control delay at signalized in-tersections is minimal.
                           B        Stable Operation or Minimal Delays: The ability to maneuver        >10 and < 20.0    >10 and < 15.0    >10 and < 15.0
                                    within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted, and control
                                    delay at signalized intersections are not significant.
                           C        Stable Operation or Acceptable Delays: The ability to              >20 and < 35.0    >15 and < 25.0    >15 and < 25.0
                                    maneuver and change lanes is somewhat restricted, and average
                                    travel speeds may be about 50 percent of the free flow speed.
                           D        Approaching Unstable or Tolerable Delays: Small increases in       >35 and < 55.0    >25 and < 35.0    >25 and < 35.0
                                    flow may cause sub-stantial increases in delay and decreases in
                                    travel speed.
                           E        Unstable Operation or Significant Delays: Significant delays       >55 and < 80.0    >35 and < 50.0   >35 and < 50.0
                                    may occur and average travel speeds may be 33 percent or less of
                                    the free flow speed.
                           F        Forced Flow or Excessive Delays: Conges-tion, high delays,                 > 80.0            > 50.0            > 50.0
                                    and extensive queuing occur at critical signalized intersections
                                    with urban street flow at extremely low speeds.

multimodal circulation, where pedestrians, bicyclists,
and vehicles share the right-of-way. Street trees and
lighting play an important role on these streets in
providing a consistent landscape scheme and shad-
ing. Typically, street parking would be provided on
a collector but not on an arterial. Arterial versions
of green corridors may include major east-west and
north-south connections like Goshen Avenue, Wal-
nut Avenue, and Demaree Street. Figure 4-2c shows
a green corridor in a Downtown context where right-
of-way may be more limited and buildings are built
to the street edge.
Figure 4-2d shows an arterial that accommodates
transit in its own lane, and supports a pedestrian-
realm that complements transit. The “transit corri-
dor” may be considered a type of four-lane arterial.
This design could be appropriate along the route of
a future light rail or bus rapid transit line on Gos-
hen Avenue, South Mooney Boulevard, Main Street
or Murray Avenue.
“Gateway boulevards,” as shown in Figure 4-2e, pro-
vide a sense of identity and entrance into the city.
Double rows of trees, enhanced plantings, and light-
ing elements are the primary components of the
streetscape design. Gateway boulevards may be an
appropriate design for six-lane arterials that could
include Shirk Road, Riggin Avenue, Lovers Lane,
and Caldwell Avenue.

(1) Only about one half of the pocket park acreage is assumed to meet the design criteria of Policy PSCU-P-8 and count toward the overall
    parkland standard.
(2) Only half of the future park on east edge of City is counted toward the parkland standard because this facility also will be used for
    groundwater recharge.
(3) Proposed additional park land along St. Johns River is estimated to be appropriate as a regional effort.

Surface mining in California is regulated through the
Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA), a
State law adopted in 1975 to address the dual goals
of protecting the state’s need for a continuing sup-
ply of mineral resources, while protecting public and
environmental health. SMARA mandates that land
be reclaimed after mining has ceased. Reclamation
plans often restore land for agricultural uses or as
wildlife habitat.
SMARA requires that all cities incorporate into their
general plans mapped mineral resource designations
approved by the State Mining and Geology Board.
The Visalia Planning Area contains three former sand
and gravel mines, but no currently operating mines
and no designated Mineral Resource Zones.
Objectives
OSC-O-9	 Protect agricultural land from premature
           urban development.
Policies
Note: Policies in Section 2.6 of the Land Use Element
(Rural Buffer and Edge Conditions) also address pres-
ervation of agricultural land and the interface between
urban development and farmland.
