                                                        are the quiet and safe environment, which has

                                                        is evident during the annual Fourth of July

6.        HOUSING (UPDATE)
Although the Housing Element of the existing
City of Orland General Plan is current and
does not need to be updated until 2003,
changes to land use designations have resulted
in modifications to the Housing Element in
order to ensure consistency between the
General Plan Elements. This does not
constitute a revision of the Housing Element,
rather an update of information such as
population projections, land use controls,
residential land resources, and policies.
GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
The City of Orland must meet a broad range
of challenges and obligations with limited
financial resources. Many of the programs
described within this General Plan address
situations which have evolved over a number
of years and will not easily be resolved.

3.6       RAIL RELATED HAZARDS
Hazardous materials are also regularly shipped
via the rail line and, while unlikely, an incident
involving a rail accident within the City could
have serious effects. Unfortunately, the City
has little control over the types of materials
that are shipped via the rail line. With regard
to government activities, the content of
shipments may be confidential for reasons of
security.
While the City has little influence over the
types of material transported via the rail line,
ensuring that at-grade crossings within the
City are operating in a safe and effective
manner can reduce the potential for rail
incidents.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Goal 3.6: Minimize the potential for
hazards related to rail service in and
around the City of Orland.
Policy 3.6.1: Rail related hazards shall be
considered prior to approval of new
development         projects     and      roadway
improvements in the immediate vicinity of the
Union Pacific Railroad tracks.
Program 3.6.A.1: The City shall consult with
the Union Pacific Railroad Company to
determine ways to minimize hazards related to
at-grade rail crossings within Orland.
Program 3.6.B.2: The City shall endeavor to
monitor the operation of at-grade crossings
within the City limits and shall immediately
report any problems with gate function to the
rail line operator.

Note:  The predicted distances to the Ldn contours assume a mean railroad sound exposure level of 100 dB
      without horn usage and 105 dB with horn usage at a reference distance of 100 feet from the tracks and that
      all train operations occur during daytime hours.
