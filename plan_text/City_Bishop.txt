Working group.
City of Bishop staff invited business and commu-
nity leaders to serve on the EDE Working Group. On
average, 30 stakeholders participated. In addition
to reviewing interim work products, members of the
Working Group participated in four strategy sessions to
develop the EDE vision, goals and policies and imple-
mentation plan. At the fourth and final EDE Working
Group meeting, members shifted their efforts from
EDE development to implementation planning (see
Appendix A for the preliminary implementation plan),
including the formation of four separate committees.
This underscores the importance of ongoing commu-
nity involvement in close partnership with the City
during implementation.
REGIONAL COOPERATION
Bishop’s economy functions within the context of the
greater Eastern Sierra region, providing goods and
services to locals, visitors and residents of nearby
communities. Developing an understanding of the
regional economy included review of applicable
economic development plans and studies and
in-depth conversations with key stakeholders from the
Town of Mammoth Lakes, Inyo and Mono counties,
the Bishop Paiute Tribe and the Sierra Business Council.
This EDE includes goals and policies that address the
regional nature of Bishop’s economy, recognizing

Industry centered on regional commerce and
tourism.
Figure 10 shows the percentage of workers employed
in a specified industry, as defined by the U.S. Census
Bureau, in 2012.
Slightly more than one in four residents is employed in
arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, or
food services. The educational services, health care
and social assistance jobs (18%), along with retail
trade (18%), are the other primary industries in the
Bishop area.
Bishop industry clusters in two general sectors: regional
services (government, health care, education, social
services, etc.) and tourism businesses (lodging, enter-
tainment, recreation, retail, etc.). With over half of the
population working in these two broad categories,
an emphasis should be placed on developing other
industries within the local economy, mitigating the risk
of being overly reliant on a few industry sectors. For
example, with the emergence of broadband internet
service in Bishop, the city has the ability to attract new
enterprises or individuals that require a high-band-
width internet connection to work.
Large public sector employers and collection of
small employers.
The largest employer in the area is the Northern Inyo
Hospital, with over 250 employees. Government
(federal, state, and local) is a large source of employ-
ment in the Bishop area, as is the school district. Kmart
and Vons are the only two major employers in the
retail sector.
It is important to note that Bishop’s retail and tourism      Source:	 2008-2012 ACS.
sector is made up of a collection of small employers. As
these small employers are vital to Bishop’s economy,
gathering input from this contingent regarding retail
and commercial development is beneficial in ensur-
ing that all relevant stakeholder needs and opinions
are addressed.

steadily decreased between 2009 and 2011.
However, between 2011 and 2012 the median home
value increased by 5 percent for Bishop, close to the
value observed in 2010. In Inyo County, the down-
ward trend continued into 2012, resulting in roughly a

Bishop and the county.

                                   ECONOMIC AND HOUSING MARKET SNAPSHOT
the continued trend of potential residents, many of
whom may work in Bishop, opting to live in surround-
ing communities, representing lost opportunity (social,
economic, etc.) for Bishop. Furthermore, there is a
shortage of rental properties within Bishop and the
surrounding area. Given the relatively expensive real
estate market throughout much of the area, purchas-
ing a home may be cost-prohibitive for many house-
holds. Consequently, increasing the supply of rental
properties is important to allow for population growth.
Bishop faces a unique challenge in its pursuit of
economic development as DWP has a substantial
amount of land holdings within the city limit, as well
as owning the majority of land parcels surrounding
the city. While this is certainly a constraint on where
prospective businesses can locate, it is also a defining
feature of Bishop. Bishop would benefit from develop-
ment of a strategic plan for what parcels to acquire
and how to appropriately develop them thereafter,
ideally striking a balance between economic growth
and preservation. Perhaps DWP parcels located within
City limits would be most appropriate to consider for
development.
The Hispanic community in Bishop grew at a rapid
pace between 2000 and 2012. One-third of all Bishop
residents identifies as Hispanic. While this demo-
graphic has rapidly grown in recent years, it is unlikely
that retail and commercial businesses that target the
Hispanic community have kept pace. Consequently,
actively engaging the Hispanic community and
understanding where there are unmet needs in the
retail and commercial sectors can lead to economic
growth for Bishop.

BISHOP AIRPORT
With respect to how the airport can contribute to
Bishop’s economic growth, nearly all Open House
attendees were very supportive of investing in
expanding the airport for commercial flights. In addi-
tion to providing reliable air transport, they suggested
that expansion of the airport would make Bishop a
more attractive location for light industry or high tech
companies because the ease of reaching other desti-
nations would be greatly improved. It is important to
not that establishing and maintaining commercial
flights into the Bishop Airport would likely require a size-
able subsidy.

GOALS
To orient Open House attendees to the general plan process, one station featured the goals from the previous
EDE as well as selected goals from the recently completed housing and mobility elements that are relevant to
economic development. The station featured several maps of Bishop showing where commercial business are
located by industry as well as a map showing parcels owned by LADWP within and surrounding Bishop. As a part
of this station, Open House attendees were encouraged to craft their suggestions for goals for this EDE. These are
presented below as written by attendees and show the number of “ditto” dots (if any) placed by other partici-
pants who agreed with the goal.
■■ Preserve and protect local small business.
■■ Grow tourism dollars—get people here.
■■ Revitalize Downtown—uniform look and beauty.
■■ Give the residents an opportunity to invest in Bishop's growth. Offer an avenue to act
    as venture capitalist or angel investor.
■■ Establish a Town theme. Support Chamber to market Bishop. Reduce empty Main
    Street. We need a town promoter like Mammoth.
■■ Work with the County to develop more airport services.
■■ The City needs to be in charge. Buildings standing empty is poor advertisement for
    business and community. City take charge.
■■ Empty big box storefronts = rural blight!!! How can we creatively repurpose? Library?
    Post Office? Conference or community center?
■■ Find ways to increase the density of development— more housing, more retail, more
    business.
■■ The 1990 goals still sound like good ideas.
■■ Create a lively, vibrant focal point for the city.
■■ Light industry. Be more bicycle friendly. Airport development.
■■ Preserve small town.
■■ Grow tourism dollars, raise the TUT. Tourists are paying most of it anyway.
■■ More attractive pedestrian signage.
■■ Airport and tourism development are the key. We are a natural as a destination for
    conferences, corporate retreats, etc. Dependable air service is the answer!
■■ Remove expired business signs.
■■ Signage needs to be improved - existing is almost invisible to tourists.

■■ All these "goals" are very beautiful but have no depth, no plan of action or specifics.
■■ Mammoth was in the same boat 30 years ago. They made a decision to DO something about it.
   Summer was dead. Today summer is bigger than winter. We need to sit down with Mammoth and
   learn.
■■ Not sure about all that money on Warren Street.
■■ 100% business occupancy on Main Street.
■■ A recruiter or headhunter for GMC, Dodge, Subaru - businesses that will bring in people from other
   areas to shop in Bishop and boost economy.
■■ Businesses don't have to be uniform, but storefronts painted and kept up.
■■ Create architectural committee - make Bishop pedestrian friendly and prettier.
■■ Finish the 395.
■■ More housing for students or younger adults starting out on their own. Maybe apartments. I see this
   as a plus because we get a lot of young mountain climbers and outdoor enthusiasts here.
■■ Placemaking.
■■ Please remain true to high quality of life for residents. Don't bring in noisy, polluting ATVs as
   economic base. Bike paths and trails attract bicycles.
■■ Re-examine all general plan elements to ensure they support economic development priorities or
   leverage to attract new businesses.
■■ The need for additional housing to meet employment needs. Collaborate with larger employers for
   employee housing. Seek additional funding for needed city infrastructure.
■■ Use some of the parking area behind City Hall for "Town Center" for community concerts, gathering
   place (like Farmer's Market but also programs to attract tourists who are in town).

GOALS FROM THE WORKING GROUP
Each working group member crafted at least one
goal for the EDE. Goals were written on large post-it
notes and grouped by topic on the meeting room
walls. These initial goals (43 total) addressed:
■■ Tourism and regional cooperation;
■■ Main Street/Warren Street/Downtown Bishop;
■■ Business retention;
■■ Bishop airport;
■■ Entrepreneurship and business development;
■■ Supportive infrastructure;
■■ Education, training and workforce development;              Source:	 EDE Working Group September 2014 session.

SIERRA BUSINESS COUNCIL
The Sierra Business Council is a great resource for
communities in the midst of economic development.
One of the Council’s publications (“A Commercial
and Mixed Use Handbook”) provides a great deal
of information pertaining to building successful and
vibrant communities in the area. The publication is
free of charge and available at their website.12 Some
of the high level takeaways from the handbook are:
■■ Infill development in downtown areas that
     preserves or enhances the “main street” feel;
■■ The development or improvement of neighbor-
     hood convenience centers; and
■■ Development and support of shopping districts
     that avoid duplicating downtown/main street
     services.

I.         INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element is one of seven mandatory elements of the General Plan. The purpose of the Housing Element is to
identify and analyze existing and projected housing needs, and to set forth the City’s goals, policies and implementing
actions for the preservation, improvement and development of housing in the City of Bishop. Housing Elements are
required by California law to be regularly updated. The current Housing Element covers the 5-year period extending from
2014-2019.
The Government Code requires that each draft Housing Element be reviewed by the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD), and that the HCD’s findings be incorporated prior to adoption, or that specified findings
be made in response to the HCD’s comments. A City of Bishop Regional Location Map is provided as Figure 1.
A.         BACKGROUND
In 1967, the housing Element became the third mandated part of a General Plan in
California. During the ensuing years, numerous revisions were made to the required
contents of community housing elements. Article 10.6 of the Government Code was                        What is a Housing Element?
enacted in 1981 and now describes the content requirements of local housing
elements. The legislation, commonly referred to as the Roos Bill, requires local                          The State of California helps
housing elements to offer an assessment of housing needs, an inventory of resources                    identify local housing needs and
and constraints, a statement of goals, policies and objectives and a 5-year housing
                                                                                                       requires an action plan from the
program. The Housing Element is one of 7 required elements included in the
Bishop General Plan. The Housing Element, in complying with the letter and spirit                           city to meet those needs.
of Article 10.6, responds to the four major issues listed below:
                    What are the housing needs of the City of Bishop?
                    What can the City realistically do about meeting these needs?
                    What are the housing goals and policies of the City?
                    What specific actions can the City take to meet housing needs?
B.         PURPOSE
The purpose of the Housing Element is to identify local housing problems and to identify measures necessary to mitigate and
alleviate these needs and problems for all economic segments of the community. General statewide purposes of local housing
elements are influenced by the legislative policy and intent of Article 10.6. Section 65581 contains the following description of
the legislative intent in enacting the most recent revisions to the housing element law:
           ʺTo assure that counties and cities will prepare and implement housing elements which, along with federal and state programs,
     will move toward attainment of the state housing goal.ʺ
           “To recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are required by it to contribute to the attainment of
     the state housing goal, provided such a determination is compatible with the state housing goals and regional housing needs.ʺ
           ʺLocal and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to facilitate the improvement and
     development of housing to make adequate provisions for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community.ʺ
           ʺThe legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local government also has the responsibility to consider
     economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the general plan and to cooperate with other local
     governments and the state in addressing regional housing needs.ʺ
The Housing Element is organized to present information according to the four principal topics listed below:
                    Housing Needs Assessment
                    Inventory of Resources and Constraints
                    Statement of Goals and Policies
                    Actions ‐ Five Year Housing Program
C.         AUTHORIZATION
As noted above, housing elements were mandated by legislation enacted in 1967. In 1977, ʺHousing Element Guidelinesʺ (the
“Guidelines”) were published by the Dept. of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The Guidelines spelled out the
content requirements of housing elements, and also gave the HCD a ʺreview and approvalʺ function over this element of the
General Plan. Passage of the Roos Bill in 1981 enacted Article 10.6 of the Government Code. This bill placed the guidelines
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                                    6

into statutory language and changed HCDʹs role from ʺreview and approvalʺ to one of ʺreview and commentʺ on local
housing elements, and also required an update of the housing element every five years.
Senate Bill 2, which was signed into law on October 15, 2007, amended Government Code Sections 65582, 65583, and 65589.5
of State Housing Element Law. This legislation required local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for addressing the
housing needs of the homeless, including the identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a
permitted use without a conditional use permit.
In 2008, the California legislature adopted Senate Bill 375 which built upon foundations set in California’s 2006 climate
change law (AB 32). SB 375 regional transportation agencies to develop a “Sustainable Communities Strategy” (SCS) for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and modified Housing Element Law to achieve consistency between the land use pattern
outlined in the SCS and Regional Housing Needs Assessment allocation. The legislation also increased local agencies’
accountability for carrying out their housing element plans. With adoption of SB 375, communities that covered by an
adopted Regional Transportation Plan became eligible for an extended housing element planning period of 8 years (instead
of 5 years). The City of Bishop is not part of a region with an adopted Regional Transportation Plan, and is therefore not
subject to the requirements of SB 375.
D.        CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
State law requires the Housing Element to be consistent with other elements of the General Plan. Residential land uses
identified in the Land Use Element provide a basis for identification of adequate residential sites in the Housing Element.
The City’s recently updated 2012 Mobility Element describes circulation improvements for future development. The Noise
Element sets standards to protect areas designated for housing use from inappropriate noise levels. The Safety Element
addresses a range of environmental issues. And the Conservation & Open Space Element provides open space and
recreational areas for community use. No internal inconsistencies have been identified between the goals of this Housing
Element and the goals and policies contained in the remaining elements of the General Plan. In order to maintain compliance
and consistency between elements, City conducts an annual review of the General Plan and reports to the City Council on the
findings of the review. The City is also currently in the very early stages of a process that will eventually update the General
Plan Land Use Element, the Conservation and Open Space Element, and the address Economic Development Element.
E.        HOUSING ELEMENT CREATION AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The 2014 Housing Element Update was prepared by City staff and the Bishop City Council with planning consultant
assistance. It is based on guidelines originally set forth as part of the overall Bishop General Plan Update, during which the
City Council held a series of public workshops.
Public outreach and participation during the current Housing Element update has encompassed several elements, beginning
with a workshop and open house held on 8 February 2011 (between the hours of 4 and 6 pm) to present to the public a
proposed zoning amendment that would create an overlay zone in northeastern Bishop where emergency shelters would be
allowed by right. Notice of the workshop was advertised in the Inyo Register, provided on the City website, and posted at
City Hall and various City locations. The meeting was well attended, with an estimated 25-30 residents stopping by at some
point (mostly in the first hour), and generated a wide range of comments and suggestions including a recommendation that
the western boundary be shifted slightly eastward to create a more uniform setback, clarification as to how background
checks may be conducted, discussion about how to accurately estimate need, confirmation that emergency shelters would be
subject to all applicable provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). A public hearing was subsequently
held by the Bishop Planning Commission on March 29, 2011 to adopt the zoning amendment.
On 22 September 2013, the Planning Commission held a Public Hearing/Workshop to review and consider the Action Plan
recommended with the Draft 2014-2019 Housing Element. Only 1 member of the public was present at this meeting, but the
discussion (including input from the public participant) was extensive and focused on action items to support the 2014-2019
Housing Element RHNA goals. Notice of this workshop was advertised in the Inyo Register and posted at City Hall (note
that all public hearings and workshops are posted at City Hall and advertised in the Inyo Register, which is the local
newspaper most widely circulated in the project area).
Two additional public hearings were held prior to final approval of the 2014-2019 Housing Element. The Planning
Commission held a second public review meeting on January 28, 2014, and a third Public Workshop and Hearing on
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                      7

February 25, 2014 that was attended by four members of the public and characterized by discussion and input that
emphasized the importance of effective public outreach. The City Council held one additional Public Hearing, on 10 March
2014 to consider a first reading approval of the environmental document and the Housing Element update. City Council
held a second reading on 24 March 2014 at which time the environmental document and Housing Element were approved.
No written comments on the Housing Element were received; public comment at the March 24 noted that the updated
Housing Element was comprehensive in scope and reflected multiple opportunities for public involvement and input. The
Planning Commission and the City Council have reaffirmed their commitment to public outreach and participation in
tandem with the Housing Element Action Plan that will occur over the next 5-year Housing Element update period.
The draft Housing Element was submitted to HCD for a first review on October 17, 2013. After comments and
recommendations were received, the Housing Element was revised and resubmitted to HCD in early November. HCD on 9
December 2013 issued a letter indicating that the Housing Element meets the statutory requirements of housing element law,
and would be complete once adopted (as occurred on March 24, 2014) and submitted to HCD for final approval.
F.         COMMUNITY PROFILE
Provided below is an overview of demographic trends in the City of Bishop, drawn from results of the 2010 Census. The
profile includes summary information about population growth and trends, household characteristics, special needs
populations, and housing stock characteristics in the City of Bishop.
       Between 2000 and 2010, Bishop’s population grew by 8.5%, which was much faster than the rate of growth in Inyo County
        as a whole (3.3%), but lower than the growth rate in California (10%).
       Bishop has become more racially diverse in the past decade but is still more homogenous than California as a whole
        (73.9% white v. 57.6% statewide; 0.6% black v. 6.2% in California; 18.6% ‘some other race’ v. 17.0%; 30.9% Hispanic v.
        37.6% statewide; and 2.9% some other race v. 4.9%).
       The proportion of males to females has increased in Bishop in recent years (from 47.9% in 2000 to 50% in 2010).
        Bishop residents are still older than California residents as a whole (median age of 38.9 years for Bishop residents
        versus 35.2 years statewide), but the City has become more youthful in recent years (with the percentage of persons
        over 65 falling from 19.2% in 2000 to 15.7% in 2011 (v. 11.5% statewide), and the percentage of persons under 5 years
        of age increasing from 6.1% to 7.2% (v. 6.8% statewide).
       Bishop households are smaller than in California generally (2.37 persons per owner household in Bishop versus 2.97
        in the state, and 1.79 persons per rental household in Bishop versus 2.82 generally).
       Bishop has more renters than the state as a whole (61.3% in Bishop v. 44.1%), and rents in Bishop are lower than in
        California ($845/month v. $1,185) as are home values (median value of $306,000 in Bishop v. $421,600). Still, Bishop
        has a higher percentage of households paying more than 30% of income toward housing costs than residents
        statewide (72/9% in Bishop v. 55/7% statewide).
       Bishop residents have a lower poverty rate than California residents generally (13.2% v. 14.4% statewide), even
        though Bishop has a median household income less than half of California residents as a whole ($34,258 v. $70,231).
        65% of Bishop residents are employed (compared to 58.1% statewide), and Bishop workers are more likely to work in
        management and business (37.9% v. 36.5%), and be employed by the government (21.4% v. 14.7%) and less likely to
        work in sales (19.1% v. 25% statewide) and be self-employed (7/4% in Bishop v. 8.6% statewide).
G.         PROGRESS UNDER PREVIOUS GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT
Unlike most other General Plan elements, the Housing Element is required to summarize the progress achieved under the
previous Element. The 2009 City of Bishop Housing Element contained a number of goals and policies related to the
provision of adequate housing for all segments of the population. The 2009 Housing Element also contained specific
quantified objectives. The policy goals and the quantified objectives were organized according to eleven primary categories
of action as identified below:
   G.1-CITY OF LOS ANGELES LANDS: Continue to work with City of Los Angeles towards purchase, transfer or long-
   term lease of vacant City of Los Angeles DWP land to the City of Bishop for residential development, including affordable
   housing. Anticipated number of units: 75-100.
   Outcome: Communication and cooperation with the City of Los Angeles is an ongoing responsibility for both agencies. The City of
   Los Angeles has not yet released the parcel which the City of Bishop previously identified for residential development. However, the
   City of Bishop anticipates that this parcel may become available during the period of the current housing element update (2014-2018).
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                              8

  When the parcel does become available, the City of Bishop intends that it will be developed for residential use, including affordable
  housing to meet the needs of City residents. The City of Los Angeles has recently elected a new mayor, and Bishop plans to establish
  communication with the new administration in service of this objective.
  G.2-EMERGENCY SHELTERS, TRANSITIONAL AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING: Revise Zoning Ordinance to permit
  emergency shelters, in one or more commercial and/or R-3 residential zoning districts without discretionary approval. The
  zoning ordinance amendment for emergency shelters shall be completed within one year of approval of this Housing
  Element. Transitional and supportive housing are considered residential uses and must be subject only to the same
  restrictions that apply to other residential uses in the same zone. Development standards for emergency shelters will
  encourage and facilitate the use and only subject shelters to the same development and management standards that apply
  to other allowed uses within in the identified zone.
  Outcome: The City Council adopted Ordinance 535 on April 25, 2011 approving the ES emergency shelter combining district (the
  district includes C-1, R-3 R-3-P zoning) to permit a specified area in which emergency shelters are allowed by right. This ES
  combining district was selected because it reflects a close association with, provides convenience access to, and is compatible with a
  range of complementary services including the availability of public transportation, basic goods and grocery stores, and social welfare
  facilities. On April 22, 2013, the Bishop City Council adopted Ordinance 544 which expanded the ES emergency shelter combining
  district to incorporate supportive housing and transitional housing developments as uses that are permitted by right. As with the ES
  district generally, this location provides a range of services that complement and support transitional and supportive housing. A Copy
  of Ordinance No. 535 is provided in Appendix A and a copy of Ordinance No. 544 is provided in Appendix B.
  G.3-REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES: Create and adopt in a timely manner a formal reasonable
  accommodation procedure for zoning, land use, permit processing and building codes to ensure that local land use
  regulations facilitate modifications that would allow disabled persons to remain in their homes as long as possible, and do
  not unnecessarily constrain the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
  Outcome: The City of Bishop City Council adopted Ordinance 543 on 26 March 2013 to ensure that individuals with disabilities
  receive reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices and procedures to ensure equal access to housing and facilitate the
  development of housing for individuals with disabilities. The ordinance established a procedure for making requests for reasonable
  accommodation in land use, zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures of the jurisdiction to comply fully with
  the intent and purpose of fair housing laws. A copy of Ordinance 543 is provided in Appendix C.
  G.4-DENSITY BONUSES: Give density bonuses to developers who construct infill projects to generate the maximum
  number of dwelling units in a limited space and to guarantee the set-aside of affordable/senior/disabled units.
  Outcome: The City has received only one application for residential development since the 2009 Housing Element was completed; the
  one application was for an affordable single family unit. There has been no opportunity to grant density bonuses for infill development.
  However, it is the policy of the City of Bishop to comply with state laws governing density bonuses, and the City will readily provide
  such bonuses when the opportunity arises to do so. In order to stimulate job growth for its youth, the City is actively seeking to invite
  out-of-town businesses to relocate in Bishop and is simultaneously working with the community, the Council and local builders to
  identify ways to expand housing opportunities and meet future needs if the business expansion efforts are successful.
  G.5-MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENT OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (MPROP): Facilitate MPROP by advertising its
  availability to mobile home park residents and serving as co‐applicant for resident organizations seeking HCD funding.
  Outcome: The City continues to own the mobile home park that serves a predominantly very-low and low income population, and in
  which fully 60% of the residents have successfully purchased their units with the City’s assistance. Additionally, there are a number of
  privately-owned mobile home parks in Bishop, and the residents in these private parks are also encouraged to purchase their units.
  Residents are assisted in their efforts by Mammoth Lakes Housing, which the City supports with funding. Mammoth Lakes Housing
  offers guidance in the application process, serves as co-applicant where needed, and also provides funding assistance.
  G.6-COMMERCIAL/RESIDENTIAL MIXED USE: Encourage encroachment of residential uses into selected commercial
  zones.
  Outcome: The City has actively encouraged the encroachment of residential units into the downtown area through creation of the ES
  emergency shelter combining district which includes C-1, R-3 and R-3-P zoning in an area with good access to services, social welfare
  facilities and public transportation. The City is also pursuing the Warren Street Improvement Project. This corridor is parallel to and
  west of Main Street, and already allows a mix of residential, commercial and business uses. Planned improvements will include
  pedestrian friendly sidewalks, seating and benches, areas for street performances, decorative planters and shade trees, banners, pocket
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                                 9

  parks, restrooms and other elements to expand and enhance the downtown area for wider community participation and activities.
  G.7-MONITOR HOUSING STOCK: The City will monitor the housing stock to ensure that properties in the minor and
  moderate categories do not slip into lower categories.
  Outcome: The City’s Public Services Officer makes weekly drives around the City to check on the condition of housing and to check on
  the condition of street drainage facilities and the condition of street lighting, curbs and gutters, and similar municipal improvements,
  and also offers assistance and public education as needed for residents who have problems with code compliance. To maintain the
  affordability of housing, the City has very low building permit fees. These activities are designed to ensure that low and moderate
  income residential areas remain available to meet the housing needs of local residents, more than 53% of which fall within the low to
  moderate income category.
  G.8-HCD COORDINATION: City will work with HCD to seek a case-by-case waiver that would allow HCD funding on
  property leased for 40 years (which is the maximum allowed by the City of Los Angeles) instead of 55 years (which is the
  current minimum period set by HCD) and to seek assistance in resolution of incompatible loan terms wherein federal and
  state agencies will consummate a grant only after the other agency makes the first loan commitment. The City will also
  seek HCD assistance in establishing program terms that allow the City of Los Angeles and the City of Bishop to share
  affordable housing credits in cases where LADWP lands are sold or leased through the aegis of the City of Bishop for the
  purpose of providing affordable housing opportunities. Finally, the City and IMACA will continue to pursue all
  applicable grant and funding opportunities to assist in the development of housing for extremely-low, very low, low and
  moderate income households. The timing of such applications will be shaped by the notification of dates for the filing of
  applications.
  Outcome: Since the 2009 Housing Element, the City’s long-term City Manager (Rick Pucci) retired from office and the position was
  filled by a temporary City Manager who was succeeded in January 2012 by a new permanent City Manager, Keith Caldwell. This task
  is a priority objective for the City of Bishop due to the importance of HCD and the City of Los Angeles to meeting the City’s housing
  goals. The new City Manager is familiar with the difficulties posed by incompatible loan terms for HCD project efforts, and has already
  spoken with HCD about the City’s goal to resolve this issue. The City Manager plans to meet with HCD and with the City of Los
  Angeles in coming months to identify ways in which the conflict might be resolved to facilitate a successful outcome for future efforts.
  G.9-PUBLIC EDUCATION: Assist IMACA in the preparation and distribution of literature that describes equal housing
  opportunities and promotes public access to this resource. Provide information about weatherization programs and
  drought-tolerant plant materials.
  Outcome: The City has actively assisted IMACA in public education and outreach during the term of the 2009 Housing Element and
  plans to continue such efforts through the entirety of the current 2014 Housing Element. These efforts have been wide ranging and
  highly successful, including the rehabilitation by IMACA of 10 dwelling units to provide for weatherization, insulated windows,
  energy efficient heating, and repairs to electrical and plumbing systems. The City also provides free information handouts and
  literature both at City Hall and through IMACA, and routinely drives informally around residential areas to talk with homeowners
  about the range of information and assistance available to help Bishop residents access housing assistance, resources and information.
  G.10-COMPREHENSIVE INVENTORY: In preparation for the 2014 Housing Element update, the City will work with
  IMACA to develop a more thorough inventory of trailer parks, mobile home parks and apartments provide housing for
  disadvantaged populations, as well as programs that provide housing assistance to disadvantaged populations, in the City
  of Bishop.
  Outcome: The City and IMACA have monitored the status of affordable apartments, trailer and mobile home units throughout the
  prior 2009-2014 Housing Element. During that time, four trailer park units were replaced by two modular units at a facility that had
  been rated as ‘dilapidated’ during the 2003 housing survey and is now rated as good under all criteria; the 2013 survey indicates that
  there have been improvements at several additional facilities as well (as has been true for permanent housing), but no further inventory
  reductions. Economic conditions have restrained housing values during the past 4 years, and the City anticipates that prices may
  begin to rise as the economy strengthens over the coming months. Over the next four years, the City and IMACA will continue to
  monitor the inventory of apartments, trailer and mobile home units to ensure that this pool of affordable units remains available to
  residents of Bishop.
  G.11-AFFORDABLE HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM: The City will formalize a program within 2 years of
  Housing Element approval to assist with the development of affordable housing with a particular focus on the needs of
  low income and extremely low income residents of Bishop. Emphasis will be placed on provision of family housing as
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                                10

  well as non-traditional housing (such as single room occupancy and transitional housing). At a minimum, this program
  will include (a) continued support to IMACA in identifying grant opportunities and in preparing grant applications for
  low- and extremely low-income housing projects, (b) priority processing and a waiver or deferral of building and remodel
  permit fees for projects that provide affordable housing assistance to assist extremely-low, very low, low and moderate
  income households, and (c) outreach to developers to incentivize the development of housing for households earning 30%
  or less of Inyo County median family income.
  Outcome: The City of Bishop has continued to provide support to IMACA in identifying grant opportunities and assisting in the
  preparation of grant applications for low and extremely-low income housing projects. The most recent application for a Community
  Development Block Grant, submitted in April 2013, was successful and will be used to fund rehabilitation of the Valley Apartments, a
  multi-family housing facility that serves low income residents of Bishop. The City was also awarded CDBG funds to support
  preparation of an update to its Economic Development Element. The City policy remains in effect to support affordable housing
  projects with priority assistance and low building permit fees. The City also has maintained communication with local builders about
  the (albeit limited) availability of parcels for development as well as lands that may become available through the purchase, transfer or
  long-term lease of vacant City of Los Angeles DWP land. Only one new housing unit (an affordable unit) has been developed in
  Bishop since the 2009 Housing Element was approved, but with completion in 2014 of the Fiber Optic Cable that will provide hi-speed
  internet access throughout Owens Valley, the City is now actively encouraging out-of-town businesses to consider Bishop for training
  sessions and relocation, and is simultaneously working with the community, the Council and local builders to consider ways to meet
  future housing needs if the business expansion efforts are successful.
  G.12-SUMMARY OF PROGRESS UNDER 2009-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
  The objectives contained in the current City of Bishop Housing Element Update reflect the guidelines set forth by HCD in the
  most recent Regional Housing Allocation Model. Thus, the overall goal for new housing construction between 2014 and
  2019 is set at 65 units, which would call for about 13 new units each year. This Housing Element Update generally
  maintains the objectives set forth in 2009 for housing conservation and housing rehabilitation, reflecting the City’s
  expectation that the forthcoming Housing Element compliance period will see continued strength in the number of permits
  issued by the City for home improvements at all income levels. Table 1 shows the 2009-2014 and the 2014-2019 objectives
  for new housing construction by income group.

The current update reviews the City’s progress in achieving goals set forth in 2004. Table 2 summarizes the extent to which
the numeric objectives were accomplished for each of the primary categories during the period from 2008-2014.
The City met and exceeded RHNA goals for the low and moderate income categories, and fell short of RHNA goals for very
low and above-moderate income units during the 2009-2014 planning period.                       These compliance efforts were aided
substantially by the credits allowed by HCD for housing conservation and rehabilitation. Only one home (of any price) was
constructed in Bishop during the 5-year period from 2009-2014. That one home did fall within the Very Low Income
category. Additionally, 121 units were rehabilitated over this period, all of which fell within the very low, low, moderate and
above moderate income levels.

The HCD allows cities to take a 1:4 ratio credit for rehabilitation projects, in terms of meeting the Regional Housing Need
Analysis numbers that have been incorporated into the Housing Element. The units rehabilitated during 2009-2014 therefore
qualified for significant RHNA credits. IMACA provided additional rehabilitation during this period, but because these
efforts focused on non-eligible improvements (weatherization, insulated window replacements, energy efficient appliances
and electrical and plumbing repairs) none were included in the 1:4 ratio represented in Table 2.
Although rehabilitation activities allowed the City of Bishop to achieve substantial progress toward compliance, it is evident
in Table 2 above that the City continues to experience a shortfall in housing opportunities at all income levels. The lack of
available privately owned land and the reluctance of the City of Los Angeles to sell or lease land on a long-term basis
continue to be primary obstacles to new housing development. Additionally, as discussed in §IV.D.1 of this Housing
Element, Bishop has been significantly impacted by economic conditions over the past 5 years which has further constrained
new housing development.
Implementation tasks to be undertaken by the City for the 2014-2019 Housing Element update will focus on continuing
efforts to buy or lease parcels from the City of Los Angeles, and the potential to expand the downtown mixed-use overlay
zone to permit a wider range of housing opportunities. The City has seen signs of economic revival in recent months, and
anticipates that conditions will continue to improve along with expanded affordable housing opportunities over the next 5-
year period.
Key goals identified in the prior Housing Element included continued work with the City of Los Angeles, zoning code
revisions to incorporate provisions for emergency shelters and transitional and supportive housing, adoption of a procedure
for reasonable accommodation, density bonuses for affordable housing developers, strengthening the mobile home park
resident ownership program, mixed land use areas the permit residential and commercial uses, continued monitoring of the
housing stock, a strengthened relationship with HCD to resolve conflicting lease provisions and enhance grant opportunities
for IMACA, Mammoth Housing and the City, continuing public education, development of a more thorough inventory of
affordable housing, and formalized efforts to assist IMACA with grants, prioritize the processing of affordable housing
projects, and outreach to incentivize development of affordable housing. Although economic constraints have dampened the
success of many efforts, the past 5 years have nonetheless been very productive in creating conditions that will foster
affordable housing in the future.
The following summary describes the programs available to residents of Bishop, as well as the goals and objectives that have
been achieved since the 2009 Housing Element Update was prepared. Please see §III.F for a discussion of programs that will
facilitate achievement of the goals for 2014-2019.
Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Assistance Program
The HCV Assistance program (formerly Section 8) provides vouchers that eligible families can apply to rental costs at the
housing units of their choice. The vouchers are issued for the County, and not specifically to the City. In 2004 there were 29
vouchers allocated to Inyo County residents as a whole. Of these, 15 vouchers were issued to City of Bishop residents.
1 Note that only one housing unit (of any price) has been constructed in Bishop since the 2009 Housing Element was approved. That one unit
was in the ‘very low income’ price range, as shown in Table 2.
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                                12

Currently, there are 29 vouchers allocated to Inyo County, 10 of which were issued to residents in the City of Bishop.
      Project ‐ As of July 2013, 10 vouchers have been issued to qualified residents in Bishop. There are no available
        vouchers as of July 2013, and the waiting list includes 28 residents throughout Inyo County. IMACA now considers
        the Program to be closed, at least temporarily, and Stanislaus Housing Authority is not accepting any new
        applications at this time.
      Status – Vouchers have been distributed to eligible families
      Timing – Ongoing as of 2009
      Lead Agency ‐Inyo‐Mono Advocates for Community Action (IMACA)

        with 72 senior/disabled apartment units. The grants could not be utilized due to various property lease issues.
        However, IMACA in 2013 sought $1 million in funding through the Community Development Block Grant program
        to reconstruct the Valley Apartments. This application was successful, and IMACA plans to initiate this effort late in
        2013, seeking supplemental funding as needed to complete this project opportunities during the term of the current
        Housing Element. In addition, the City of Bishop has commissioned an appraisal of the Silver Peaks project site,
        with the goal of submitting a purchase offer (if feasible) during the term of the 2014-2019 Housing Element and
        proceeding with this senior/disabled housing project if feasible.
Housing Rehabilitation ‐HCD/CDBG/RECD                                                               The Homeless Prevention

        Rancho), as well as assistance to programs available at the County-run Wellness Center at the Elm Tree trailer park.
        IMACA recently received a $100,000 grant through the State CSBG Program for Homeless Services to provide
        emergency shelter vouchers, and rental and deposit assistance for one year (from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014). The
        grant is also to establish a Continuum of Care coalition of homelessness prevention stakeholders in the Eastern Sierra
        to continue funding for these services.
Program to Assist in Development of Low‐Moderate Housing
      Objective – Facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower‐and moderate‐income households by
        establishing and maintaining a list of developers with the capacity to do so. Developers are apprised of the City’s
        efforts to identify parcels for affordable housing, funding sources that can subsidize construction of affordable
        housing, and any incentives/concessions associated with the application for such funding.
      Timing ‐Ongoing
      Responsibility – City of Bishop with assistance from IMACA and other agencies
      Status –The City regularly consults with developers and IMACA to ensure that affordable housing opportunities are
        included in new projects.

      Objective – To ensure that local land use regulations do not unnecessarily constrain the development, maintenance
        and improvements of housing for persons with disabilities.
      Program Description – The City will provide a formal reasonable accommodation procedure for its zoning, land use,
        permit processing and building codes to ensure local land use regulations do not unnecessarily constrain the
        development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
      Timing – Ongoing.
      Responsibility – Bishop Planning Department.
      Status – The City has updated and streamlined codes and the permit process to facilitate development, maintenance

      Status—Ongoing
Results of this analysis have been used to reassess and strengthen the Goals, Policies and Actions of the 2014-2019 City of
Bishop Housing Element. The Goals, Policies and Actions of this updated Housing Element will support prior
accomplishments and form the basis for meeting future housing needs of the residents of the City of Bishop.
H.        NEW COMPONENTS: SB 812
Pursuant to SB 812, the current Housing Element addresses the housing needs of the City’s developmentally disabled
residents in accordance with requirements of SB 812. This analysis includes an estimate of the number of persons with

developmental disabilities, an assessment of the housing need, and a discussion of potential resources. A "developmental
disability" is in turn defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues (or can be
expected to continue) indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual, including mental retardation,
cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. Section IV.C.5 provides a discussion and analysis of the developmentally disabled.

II. SUMMARY OF OPPORTUNITIES & CONSTRAINTS
A.         LAND AVAILABILITY ISSUES
As of 2014, the vast majority of vacant buildable parcels within the city limits continue to be owned by the City of Los
Angeles. Over the years the City has conducted ongoing negotiations with the City of Los Angeles to acquire parcels for use
in building affordable/senior/disabled housing projects. At times the City of Los Angeles has issued letters of intent to sell
parcels; negotiations have been derailed for various reasons, including change of management at Los Angeles DWP. The
City will continue to work with the City of Los Angeles DWP in an effort to secure sale or long-term lease of parcels.
Additionally, the City will more proactively seek HCD assistance to reconcile incompatible lease terms (wherein the City of
Los Angeles will lease for a maximum of 40 years3 but affordable housing funding agencies require a minimum 55-year
lease), and incompatible grant terms (where federal and state agencies will consummate a grant only after the other agency
makes the first loan commitment). The City will also seek HCD assistance to establish provisions where the City of Los
Angeles and the City of Bishop can share affordable housing credits in cases where LADWP lands are sold or leased through
the aegis of the City of Bishop for the purposes of providing affordable housing opportunities. Preliminary contact with
HCD has already been initiated, and the City will follow up in coming months to seek HCD guidance in resolving these high
priority issues.
B.         LAND USE POLICY ISSUES
The City has considered how the General Plan and Zoning policies can be strengthened to encourage adequate and safe
housing opportunities for all residents, and has determined that these goals can best be served through five measures. The
measures are outlined below along with a brief discussion of steps that have been taken to implement the measures and
thereby achieve the underlying goals:
     1. Identify one or two neighborhoods of increased densities in existing residential neighborhoods or redesignation
     of other land uses to residential uses in order to meet affordable housing needs in Bishop: Since the 2009-2014
     Housing Element was adopted, the City has identified a downtown neighborhood and established an overlay zone that
     permits mixed uses and densities in an location proximate to transportation and services. For the 2014-2019 Housing
     Element, the City will consider expanding this overlay zone to take in lands west of Main Street along the evolving
     Warren Street corridor.
     2. Ease restrictions on mixed residential/commercial use of commercial land: The adopted overlay zone
     accomplishes this goal, and the City plans to consider expanding the area in which mixed uses are allowed, during the
     current Housing Element term (2014-2019), to include lands west of Main Street.
     3. Monitor conversion of duplex/triplex/quadriplex/mobile units to single family units: in concern with IMACA, the
     City has continued to monitor its inventory of multiplex and mobile home units to ensure that this affordable housing
     resource remains available to Bishop residents. Since the prior Housing Element was adopted, four trailer park units
     were replaced by two modular units at a facility that had been rated as ‘dilapidated’ during the 2003 housing survey and
     is now rated as good under all criteria; the 2013 survey indicates that there have been improvements at several
     additional facilities as well (as has been true for permanent housing), but no further inventory reductions.
     4. Consider Interface Zoning Overlay that allows a CUP for nonconforming residential uses: This measure continues
     to be evaluated by the City, particularly in connection with use of CUPs for onsite housing at employment sites.

     Additionally, the City has continued to support and experience widespread development of second units. These units
     have provided a continued supple of affordable housing options and helped to somewhat overcome the limitations on
     available land as well as the inventory of housing options for residents of Bishop.
     5. Change the Zoning policies to permit construction of emergency shelters without a CUP in one or more zones:
     This measure was accomplished during the term of the 2009-2014 Housing Element, and has helped to pave the way for
     the upcoming focus on expanding the mixed use zoning overlay as described in Items 1 and 2 above.
C.        OPPORTUNITIES
In addition to opportunities associated with the land use policy issues above, the City has various tools at its disposal to
support development of affordable housing:
      Density Bonuses: The City continues to support the use of density bonuses to optimize affordable housing
          development, and has continued to expand infrastructure and public facilities since the 2009 Housing Element was
          adopted. The City is currently embarking on a project to identify standards for curbside drainage on local routes
          throughout the City.
      Employment Housing: Continue to evaluate opportunities to issue conditional use permits for on‐site housing at
          employment sites. Local employers have occasionally expressed interest in assisting with housing development
          activities as a means to attract and retain employees, and this tool may also support future efforts to attract
          technology firms in light of the new fiber optic cable serving Owens Valley.
          HCD Assistance: Seek HCD assistance to reconcile incompatible lease terms wherein the City of Los Angeles will
          lease for up to 40 years but affordable housing funding agencies require a minimum of 55-year leases)
          Shared Credits: Explore with the City of Los Angeles the possibility of sharing affordable housing credits in cases
          where LADWP lands are sold or leased through the aegis of the City of Bishop to provide affordable housing
          opportunities.
D.        CONSTRAINTS
Lack of available land is the single largest constraint to development in the City of Bishop. Less than one half acre of
privately-owned developable land is located inside the Bishop City limits; the remaining undeveloped properties are owned
                                          by the City of Los Angeles. Only 2% of the land area County-wide is privately owned;
                                          the remainder is owned by governmental or tribal entities. The limits on land

         or tribal entities.              ASSESSMENT
                                          Housing element law requires a quantification and analysis of existing housing needs.
The Housing Needs Assessment provided in this section is based on a Housing Element Data Package provided by HCD. The
package addresses the statutory requirements for the quantification of existing housing needs, including:
      Identification of population and employment trends;
      Household characteristics (i.e., existing households, existing extremely low income households, lower and extremely
       low income households overpaying, overcrowded households);
      Special needs (i.e., number of persons with disabilities, persons with developmental disabilities, female headed
       households);
      Projected housing needs; and
      Inventory of at-risk units
Agencies that use the HCD-prepared Data Package are not be subject to further HCD review as part of the housing element
update process. As required, however, this section of the Housing Element offers an analysis of the Housing Element Data
Package data as appropriate.

 robust 8% growth rate over the decade between 2000 and 2010 (increasing from 3,575 to 3,879). The City’s population as of
 January 2013 (3,877) is essentially unchanged from the 2010 Census. As before, the City’s growth has continued to parallel
 that of Inyo County as a whole, comprising 20.9% of the County total (compared with just under 20% in 2008).

 The number of housing units increased by a much smaller share, increasing from 1,867 to 1,926 (a 3% increase overall) in the
 decade between 2000 and 2010. Vacancy rates declined from 9.8% to 9.24% during this time, while occupancy rates increased
 from 2.077 persons per household to 2.157 persons per household. As shown in Table 4, the housing unit increase was most
 pronounced for multifamily housing (a 20.9% increase) while the number of single family homes declined by 7.6%. These
 data suggest that the City has continued to provide affordable housing options to its residents despite the many constraints
 listed in §II above.

 A.2          Employment Trends
 A total of 1,955 civilian residents of Bishop were employed as of 2011; this reflects a relatively significant increase over the
 2000 employment total of 1,635. Table 5 summarizes 2011 employment by sector for Inyo County and Bishop. One measure
 of the balance between employment opportunities and residents’ needs is a ʺjobs ‐housing balanceʺ test. Generally, a
 balanced community would have a ratio of one job for every housing unit, theoretically enabling most residents to also work
 in the community. As of 2011, there were 1,684 occupied households in Bishop, and 1,955 employed individuals. This yields a
 ratio of 1.16 jobs per household for the City as a whole (compared with 1.05 jobs per household in 2008). These data
 indicating a continuing improvement from the 2000 Census results of 0.97 jobs per household. As noted in prior Housing
 Elements, the findings are not surprising given the distance from most Inyo County towns to workplaces outside the County.
 In whole, the data reflect a satisfactory ʺjobs‐housing balanceʺ in Bishop and the greater Bishop community.

A.3        Overcrowding and Household Size
Overcrowding and household size are important housing indicators. Household size is defined as the number of people per
dwelling, and overcrowding exists when there are more than 1.01 persons per room (the 1.01 factor is established by the
federal government as a standard or measure of overcrowding). Both factors indicate whether the existing housing stock
meets occupant space needs.
Overcrowding appears to be a function of household size, income and tenure. Information from the 1970 Census indicated
that 5% of Bishop planning area households encountered overcrowded conditions. Census data for 1980 put the percentage
at 4.4%, the 1980 Census at 5.5%, the 1990 Census at 5.5%, and both the 2000 and 2010 Census at 5.0%. As shown in Table 6,
there is no severe overcrowding in Bishop (including both owner-occupied and renter-occupied units). These data indicate
that overcrowding is a relatively stable and minor problem for area households.

A.4        Overpayment
In addition to statistical data on total households and vacancy rates, it is useful to analyze data on housing overpayment to
understand the housing situation in Bishop, particularly for lower income households. Table 7 compares housing costs as a
percentage of income for Owner and Renter households, as well as total households, as of 2011 for Inyo County as a whole,
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                         18
Bishop, and the unincorporated lands. Note that HCD considers housing costs over 25% of income to be “overpayment.”
As shown in Table 7, 73.8% of all Bishop renter households met the HCD criteria for overpayment for housing costs,
compared with 37.7% of owner households. Both of these measures show a significant increase over 2000 Census data, when
54% of renter households and 25.8% of owner households were overpaying. The decade between 2000-2010 was particularly
volatile for housing, which has undoubtedly contributed to the worsening overpayment problem. However, as discussed
above, the increased supply of multifamily and mobile home housing opportunities has outstripped the increase in
population of Bishop, which may point to a reduced overpayment problem in the years ahead.

Bishop household size varies between owner- and renter-occupied units, with an average of 2.37 occupants in owner-
occupied dwelling types (2000 Census) and an average of 1.79 occupants per rental unit. This represents a continuation of a
long‐standing trend towards smaller household sizes in the City as evidenced by the fact that the average Bishop household
size in 1960 was 3.0 persons. The Bishop population in 2000 was younger overall (with 22.4% of residents age 60 or older)
than in 2008, when 25.8% of residents were age 60 or older. As shown in Table 9, this trend has continued with 30% of
Bishop residents now in the 60+ year age bracket. Almost 40% of owner-occupied units fall into this group, whereas renters
are a comparatively younger proportion of the overall Bishop population (18.6% age 60 or older).

Some localities have established density bonus programs for developers who build units that can accommodate large families
(i.e., households with 5 or more persons. Other jurisdictions have reduced parking requirements, waived fees or expedited
processing of permits for projects providing some additional units with three or more bedrooms. This does not appear
warranted for Bishop. As shown in Table 10, there were no rental households in Bishop with 5 or more persons as of 2011,
and there were only 47 owner-occupied units with 5 or more persons (none with 6 or more). Overall, household sizes
continue to reflect societal changes, including reduced family size and lower birth rates. These factors result in continued
need for new housing formation since smaller households require a greater number of dwelling units to house an equivalent
size population.

A.6        Housing Stock
There are differences between housing stock condition and housing improvement needs. The term ʺconditionʺ refers to the
physical quality of the housing stock. The quality of the individual housing units or structures may be defined as sound,
deteriorating or dilapidated. Housing improvements, on the other hand, refer to the nature of the ʺremedialʺ actions
necessary to correct defects in the housing condition such as demolition, minor repairs, major repairs, and rehabilitation. As
of the 2010 Census (see Summary Table 20), the City of Bishop had a housing stock comprised of 2,041 total dwelling units,
compared to 1,894 total units in January 2008. As shown in Table 11, single family dwellings continue to represent a majority
of the City’s housing units
                                                                     TABLE 11

As shown in Table 20 (Summary of Selected Census Data), there are 10 residences in the City of Bishop that lack complete
plumbing facilities, 100 residences that lack complete kitchen facilities, and 113 residences that have no telephone service.
These are the units with a critical need for rehabilitation            The Bishop Code Enforcement and Public Safety Officer would
have knowledge of these conditions only if a complaint is filed, and when complaints are received the City takes prompt
action. To date, however, no such complaints have been received by the City nor is the City aware of any such units. As a
result, the current Housing Element does not contain any action items pertaining to these units.
A.7        Vacancy Rates
Table 10 presents housing stock data by type of vacancy as of the 2010 Census. As shown, the 2010 vacancy rate in Bishop
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                                       21

was estimated at 9.24% of households (178 units). This represents a reduction from the 9.7% vacancy rate in 2000 (183
units).the vacancy rate overall was 9.2%. As noted in the 2004 and 2009 Bishop Housing Element updates, the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development considers a housing market with a vacancy rate of three percent or less to
have a ʺshortageʺ of housing. Some households in a housing market with a vacancy rate of three percent or less for a
sustained period of time can be expected to experience an ʺoverpayment problem.ʺ An overall vacancy rate of about five
percent is considered desirable to assure an adequate selection of reasonably priced housing without discouraging
investment in housing. More specifically, a minimum vacancy rate of 2% for dwellings for sale is desirable while a minimum
vacancy rate for rental units is 6%.
The homeowner vacancy rate in Bishop has been tight for a long period (1.8% as of 2007 and 1.0% as of 2004), but has
recently worsened with only 0.3% of homeowner units vacant as of the 2010 Census. The rental vacancy rate has long been
below the 6% minimum level deemed desirable by HCD, but has improved in recent years to 5.8%.

A.7          Special Households
The HCD has explained how special housing needs differ from other housing needs in the following terms: ʺSpecial housing
needs are those associated with relatively unusual occupational or demographic groups, such as farm workers, or large families, or those
which call for unusual program responses, such as preservation of residential hotels or the development of four bedroom apartments.”5
            Disabled Persons and Households including persons with Developmental Disabilities

2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                                                22

Households with one or more members with some physical disabilities may require special housing design features and may
also have housing assistance needs. The primary focus of disabled residents as a special need segment is on their number and
economic situation. The major housing problems of disabled people are the lack of affordable accommodations and
inadequate accessibility. These basic problems are caused by a variety of factors: a) subtle, or not so subtle, discrimination; b)
lack of financial resources and incentives available to those who want to make their buildings accessible; and d) lack of
knowledge as to how accessibility can be improved. General solutions include: a) public recognition and commitment to
correcting the problems; b) education and dissemination of information to the public and building owners; c) modifications
to existing codes and regulations; d) enforcement of existing laws and regulations; and e) increased financial assistance for
housing programs.6
As shown in Tables 13 and 14, results of the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2011 indicate that the proportion of
disabled persons in Bishop has decreased in recent years. Whereas the 2000 Census indicated that 18.6% of the Bishop
population over age 5 was disabled,7 data from the 2011 ACS indicate that persons with disability now comprise 11% of the
total Bishop population. Employment disability comprises the largest share of disability type (17.85%) for persons 16-64 years
old, and physical disability comprises the largest share (17.35%) for persons 65 years and older. The City’s zoning code does
not define ‘family’ or identify special concentration or permitting requirements for this type of use, and will not constitute a
hindrance to the provision of housing for disabled persons.

As of January 2011, housing elements must include an analysis of the special housing needs of disabled persons including
persons with developmental disabilities. This requirement stems from the fact that special needs groups encounter significant
challenges in obtaining secure and decent housing and are disproportionately subject to discrimination. SB 812amended
State housing element law to require that an evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with developmental
disabilities must be included in the assessment of the housing needs of the disabled, including estimates of the number of
persons with developmental disabilities and their housing need with a discussion of potential resources. A "developmental
disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues, or can be expected to
continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. This includes Mental Retardation, Cerebral
Palsy, Epilepsy, and Autism.

The US Census does not compile information regarding persons with developmental disabilities, but this information is
available through each nonprofit regional center operating under contract with the California Dept. of Developmental
Services (DDS). Table 15D, 15E and 15F summarize housing needs of people with developmental disabilities per SB 812 by
zip code, by age and by status. As shown, the City of Bishop (zip code 93514) has a total of 57 persons with developmental
disabilities including 1 person in the 3-5 year age, 4 individuals aged 6-9 years, 5 individuals aged 10-13 years, 8 individuals
aged 14-17, 2 individuals aged 18-21, 13 individuals aged 22-31, 7 individuals aged 32-41, 10 individuals aged 42-51, 4
individuals aged 52-61 and 3 individuals aged 61 or older. Of this population, twenty are in independent living situations,
36 are living at home with a parent or guardian, and 1 has other living arrangements.

        Farm Workers
Farm workers represent 1 of 7 special needs groups referenced in state law. Data developed for prior Housing Elements indicated
that the majority of persons within the category of ʺagriculture, forestry, fishing and huntingʺ occupations were actually
employed in the fields of veterinary medicine, horticulture, and landscaping—not farming. This broad‐based group of
agriculture‐related workers constituted 3.1% of all employed residents of Bishop in 2000, but has since fallen. As shown in Tables
16 and 17, the City of Bishop has no farming, forestry or fishing businesses are known to operate in the City as of 2007. The City’s
Zoning Ordinance complies with the Employee Housing Act, specifically Health and Safety Code §§17021.5 and 17021.6. Section
17021.5 requires that employee housing for six or fewer employees to be treated as a single family structure and permitted in the
same manner as other single family structures of the same type in the same zone. Section 17021.6 requires employee housing
consisting of no more than 12 units or 36 beds to be permitted in the same manner as other agricultural uses in the same zone.

          Homeless Residents
Although there are no accurate homeless statistics available for the Bishop area (and no data on homelessness was included with
the Housing Element Data Package provided by HCD, as shown in Tables 18 and 19), IMACA estimates that the population is
growing. Statewide statistics indicate approximately 36 homeless per 10,000 residents; this would indicate roughly 36 homeless
in Inyo and Mono Counties combined, and approximately 13 homeless individuals in the Bishop City limits. These numbers are
higher than estimates from 2009, when the Inyo County Mental Health Director estimated a total of 25 homeless individuals in
Inyo County, five (5) of whom were thought to reside in the City. The prolonged economic downturn has played a key role in
this trend, and IMACA notes that daily calls and referrals for assistance have increased noticeably over the past year or so.
During 2013, IMACA received a $100,000 grant from the California Department of Community Services and Development to fund
its new Homeless Prevention Program. The funds will be used for emergency shelter vouchers, rental deposit assistance and
relative services designed to assist homeless individuals in Inyo and Mono Counties. In addition, the program can issue camping
equipment and pay campground fees. The program is funded for the July 2013/June 2014 fiscal year, during which IMACA will
keep records with the goal of expanded state and federal funding if the program succeeds in its goal of creating a ‘continuum of
care’ by which provider agencies (counseling, healthcare, rental and employee assistance) unit to provide an effective and
responsive range of services to populations in need.
Additionally, IMACA has played a key role in the recent formation of a Continuum of Care program to answer the unmet needs
of the homeless population in Inyo, Mono and Alpine counties. Stakeholders in this multi-agency effort include Inyo and Mono
County Social Services and Health and Human Services, the Salvation Army, Northern Inyo Hospital, Inyo County veteran
services, Mammoth Lakes Housing and several churches. The Continuum of Care program will serve as a collaborative way to
provide integrated services to the homeless population. The program will also establish eligibility for state and federal funding
sources that would not be available to the individual stakeholders. Through this avenue, the Continuum of Care aims to obtain
funding for shelters and housing for homeless individuals as well as essential services and homelessness prevention programs. 8
          Female Heads of Household
2000 Census data identified that 327 households were headed by females in Bishop, compared with 152 female-headed
households in 1990. Data from the 2010 Census indicate that this number has decreased to 234 households (27.8% of all
households). Female heads of household comprise the majority of households under the poverty line, representing 64% of the
total 108 families living under the poverty level. However, the proportion of female headed households below the poverty line is
slightly under 30%. These statistics reflect improvements since the 1990 Census, when Bishop was home to 114 female‐headed
households with children, half with incomes below the poverty level. Nearly a third of female-headed households were under the
federal poverty level, compared with nearly a quarter of all households in Bishop. Affordable housing for female heads of
households in the City has been provided through existing programs. The rental rate structure and rental assistance programs
available in Bishop continue to adequately address housing needs of this group. A majority of female heads of household are
without children, though 42% of the total live with children.

A.8                         At-Risk Units
HCD has identified one housing project in the City of Bishop that is at risk of converting to Non-Low Income Uses: the Willow
Plaza, located at 324 Willow Street (see Table 20). This project was placed in service in 2007, and HCD indicates that there are
more than 20-years of affordability remaining. This new-construction project provides a total of 12 low income housing units
(100% of the units at this site) and is designed for large families.

A.9                         Census Summary
Table 20 on the following page provides an overall summary of selected data from the 2010 Census for the City of Bishop and, for
comparison, for the State of California as a whole.
A.9                         Energy and Water Conservation
Energy used for space heating, air conditioning, and water heating is the major utility cost faced by renters and homeowners.
Electricity, propane, firewood and oil are the main sources of energy used. The surrounding national forest lands allow wood
cutting for home use for a small fee. Firewood also may be purchased from local suppliers. However, many households rely on
other forms of energy for a number of reasons. These include personal preference, lack of wood cutting/gathering equipment, lack
of wood‐burning stoves, no wood storage areas, ash disposal problems, etc. Many rely on electricity for water heating, water
heating being second only to space heating/air conditioning in total household use. Water heating by electricity is the most
expensive water heating energy source and can run well over $100 per month.
The large number of older homes in Bishop adds to cost of energy for heating and cooling. Insulating poorly insulated homes
could markedly decrease energy costs given the cold winters and hot summers in this area. Weatherization of homes is the most
effective way to reduce energy costs. The most effective weatherization activities include caulking, weather stripping of windows
and doors, installing gaskets behind switch-plates, replacing broken window panes, rehabilitating window frames and sashes,
building and installing storm windows, installation of proper siding, and adding wall or ceiling insulation. Potential savings due
to reduced heating costs may range from 25% to 50% or more depending upon the extent of weatherization activities.
IMACA administers the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) on behalf of the State of California. Eligibility
is 80% of state median income. Approximately half of Inyo County’s funds are expended in serving an average of 350 Bishop
households in the Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP) and an additional 20 in weatherization. ECIP is available each year
as either $300 for electricity or 2 cords of wood, or $700 in propane or $700 in wood pellets. The LIHEAP Weatherization Program
assists an average of 20 Bishop households each year with up to $3,000 in energy conservation/home repairs. The SCE programs
assist some 30 households in Bishop each year with energy efficient refrigerators.
Use of solar energy, such as solar water heating systems, can conservatively save 50% or more on annual hot water costs when
properly designed and installed. Another affordable energy saving program involves the enclosure of south facing porches
during winter with thermo‐pane glass or other similar material. Such installations can prove cost effective in reducing overall
energy costs.

 9 Explanation of Symbols:
  An '**' entry in the margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to
 compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.
  An '-' entry in the estimate column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an
 estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an
 open-ended distribution.
  An '-' following a median estimate means the median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution.
  An '+' following a median estimate means the median falls in the upper interval of an open-ended distribution.
  An '***' entry in the margin of error column indicates that the median falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended
 distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate.
  An '*****' entry in the margin of error column indicates the estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate.
  An 'N' entry in the estimate and margin of error columns indicates that data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number
 of sample cases is too small.
  An '(X)' means that the estimate is not applicable or not available.

To remain current with evolving energy conservation standards, the City of Bishop utilizes the most current California Energy
Building Code during plan check review for new building construction and remodel of existing structures. Replacement of older
wood burning stoves with new and efficient models is among the energy standards addressed and recommended during
applications to remodel older homes. In addition, Southern California Edison offers free online energy audits, summer discounts
for air conditioner cycling, and a direct install program that includes free energy conserving equipment in some areas. 10 The City
of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also provides a comprehensive Energy Efficiency Program that includes a
refrigerator exchange program and free lighting upgrades to qualifying companies,11 and the City encourages residents to take
advantage of these programs.
As noted earlier in the discussion of progress Section F (progress under the previous Housing Element), 121 housing units (fully
6% of the entire housing stock) were rehabilitated over the past 5-years, all of which fell within the very low, low, moderate and
above moderate income levels. Many of the rehabilitation efforts involved significant activities including reroofs, mechanical
upgrades, and plumbing repairs. An even larger number of rehabilitation activities (many of which were not eligible for Housing
Element credit) involved resource and energy efficiency improvements including weatherization, insulated window
replacements, energy efficient appliances and electrical repairs. It is anticipated that energy and conservation activities will
continue to represent a significant percentage of home improvements in the City of Bishop over the coming 5 years.
B.        PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
This section of the Housing Element discusses various factors that influence housing demand. The factors include a review of
population and employment trends as well as the Cityʹs housing assistance need, also known as ʺshare of regional housing
need.ʺ The Bishop population has held fairly steady over the past 40 years. Between January 1970 and January 2008, the City’s
population increased by 52 persons. Concurrently, the housing stock had a net positive change of 444 dwelling units between
1970 and 2008. Table 21 on the following page summarizes population and housing stock changes from 1970 to 2008. These data
indicate that housing formation has met or outstripped population growth (assuming an average of 2.1 occupants per unit) for
every decade over that nearly 40‐year period.
                                                                          Table 2112

B.1       Housing Needs
Consistent with Government Code §65584.06, HCD prepares a determination of the Regional Housing Need for counties not
represented by councils of governments (COGs), including Inyo County, as part of each Housing Element update cycle. The
purpose of the needs determination is to ensure that each local government is allocated a proportional share of responsibility for
meeting the housing needs of very-low, low, moderate and above-moderate income residents. The assessments are guided by
four statewide objectives that include:
         Supply: increasing the housing supply and mix of housing types
         Infill: promoting infill and socioeconomic equity, environmental protection and efficient development
         Balance: promoting an improved intraregional balance of jobs and housing
         Proportionality: allocating a lower proportion of housing need to a category when the jurisdiction already has a
          disproportionately large share of households in that category.

2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                         34

The 2014-2019 assessment incorporated a one-time adjustment to account for the prolonged recessionary conditions, high
unemployment and unprecedented foreclosures in California and elsewhere. The assessment also reflects specified assumptions
regarding household growth and population increases, household size, rate of household formation, vacancy rates, population
composition, the relationship between jobs and housing, and projected absorption of vacant sale and rental units. Based on these
assumptions, HCD identified a need for 72 new housing units in Bishop between 2003‐2008 and an additional 111 units between
2007 and 2014. Table 22 compares the 2014-2019 needs assessment for Bishop and Inyo County with the needs assessments
prepared for the prior two Housing Element update cycles.

Primarily as a result of the one-time adjustment for unprecedented economic conditions, Inyo County’s projected housing need
allocation as a whole was less than half the allocation in 2007, and lower by a third than the 2002 allocation. The City’s 2012
allocation was also significantly reduced although by a much smaller factor than the County overall (the City’s current total
allocation is 59% of the share allocated in 2007 and 90% of the share allocated in 2002). The City’s adjustment was most
pronounced for the very low income group, where the 2012 allocation is 54% of the allocation in 2007. Overall, HCD’s Regional
Housing Allocation Model for 2008 allocates fewer housing needs to Bishop and to Inyo County in all categories than did the
allocation plan developed in 2007.
B.2       Quantified Objectives
The objectives developed in the current City of Bishop Housing Element Update reflect the guidelines set forth by HCD in the most
recent Regional Housing Allocation Model. Thus, the overall goal for new housing construction between 2014 and 2019 is set at 65
units, which would call for about 13 new units each year. This Housing Element Update maintains the key objectives set forth in
2004 and in 2009 for conservation and rehabilitation of housing; these are two areas where Bishop has been most successful in
meeting Housing Element objectives and ensuring a continued supply of affordable housing. The current Housing Element
identifies a goal for replacement or substantial rehabilitation of 6 housing units, based on findings obtained during the June 2013
updated housing survey. The City’s goals for rehabilitation are allocated across income groups in the same proportion shown by
HCD in the Regional Housing Allocation for new construction, and it is again noted that rehabilitation credits for the past 5 year
period are all for housing in the very low, low, moderate and above moderate income levels. Table 23 shows the objectives for
new construction and/or rehabilitation by income group over the coming 5-year cycle.
                                                                  Table 23

The objectives shown in Table 23 represent goals through 2014. On an annual basis, these goals would average new construction
of 3 “very low” income units (or rehabilitation of 12 units), 2 new units (or rehabilitation of 10 units) in the ʺlowʺ income category,
4.4 new units (or rehab of 9 units) in the ʺmoderateʺ category, and 5.6 new units (or rehab of 22 units) in the ʺabove
16Estimates of extremely low-income housing are based on 50% of the very low income category, per §65585(a)(1) of the Govt. Code.
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                             35

moderateʺ income category.
AB 1233 (Jones), Chapter 614, Statutes of 2005, requires local governments to zone or rezone adequate sites, within the first year of
the new planning period, to address any portion of the RHNA for which the jurisdiction failed to identify or make available sites
in the prior planning period. As described in §II.A above, the City is stymied in its attempts to acquire or annex land for
construction of housing. Intense good-faith efforts to acquire land from the City of Los Angeles have not yet borne fruit, but the
City has proactive plans to work with the new mayor of Los Angeles as well as HCD to seek opportunities for affordable housing
development in the coming 5-year period. The City’s efforts will be supported by the fact that roughly half of the 456-acres of
residential land in Bishop are zoned for development at 16 units per acre or higher.
The City met and exceeded RHNA goals for the low and moderate income categories, and fell short of RHNA goals for very low
and above-moderate income units during the 2009-2014 planning period. These compliance efforts were aided substantially by
the credits allowed by HCD for housing conservation and rehabilitation. Only one home (of any price) was constructed in Bishop
during the 5-year period from 2009-2014. That one home did fall within the Very Low Income category. Additionally, 121 units
were rehabilitated over this period, all of which fell within the very low, low, moderate and above moderate income levels. The
HCD allows cities to take a 1:4 ratio credit for rehabilitation projects, in terms of meeting the Regional Housing Need Analysis
numbers that have been incorporated into the Housing Element. The units rehabilitated during 2009-2014 therefore qualified for
significant RHNA credits. IMACA provided additional rehabilitation during this period, but because these efforts focused on
non-eligible improvements (weatherization, insulated window replacements, energy efficient appliances and electrical and
plumbing repairs) none were included in the 1:4 ratio represented in Table 24.
                                                                     Table 24

IV.        HOUSING RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
This section provides an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to residential land supply and development in the City of
Bishop. Under present law, the Element must include an inventory of resources and constraints, including land suitable for
residential development, vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment. It also should analyze the relationship of
zoning and public services to potential residential sites.
A.         LAND USE
The Land Use Element of the Bishop General Plan contains goals and policies that describe the nature, location, extent, and
intensity of land uses within the incorporated areas of the City. The focal point of the Land Use Element is the Land Use Map.
This Map indicates where specific types of land uses will be permitted, thus guiding future development in Bishop. Residential
land uses comprise approximately 40 percent of Bishop land area. Of the ten land use designations identified in the Land Use
Element, four deal primarily with residential development. These four are described below.
     Low Density Residential (LDR, 2.0 to 5.0 Dwelling Units / Acre)
      This residential category typically consists of single family dwelling situated on individual land parcels ranging in size from
      8,700 to 22,000 square feet. The Land Use Element designates 50± acres for low density residential uses.
     Medium Density Residential (MDR, 5.1 to 9.9 Dwelling Units / Acre)
      This residential category consists of single-family dwellings situated on individual land parcels, two single or attached
17 Note that only one housing unit (of any price) has been constructed in Bishop since the 2009 Housing Element was approved. That one unit
was in the ‘very low income’ price range, as shown in Table 2.
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                                 36

       dwellings (such as duplexes or triplexes) on individual parcels, and mobile home subdivisions. Overall land use
       requirements average from 4,400 to 8,000 square feet of land per dwelling unit. The Land Use Element designates 211 acres
       for Medium Density Residential uses.
      Medium‐High Density Residential (MHDR, 10 to 22 Dwelling Units/Acre)
       This residential land use category is characterized by single-family town houses, patio homes, duplexes, triplexes, garden
       apartments and mobile home parks. Gross site area per unit ranges between 2,000 and 3,500 square feet per dwelling unit.
       The Land Use Element designates 52 acres for Medium‐High Density Residential uses.
      High Density Residential (HDR, 22.1 to 35.0 Dwelling Units/Acre)
       This residential category is characterized by cluster-dwelling accommodations including multistory apartment houses and
       condominium developments with 1,250 to 2,000 feet of gross area per dwelling unit. The Land Use Element designates
       approximately 143 acres for High Density Residential uses.
 The City is currently in the very early stages of a process that will eventually update the General Plan Land Use Element, the
 Conservation and Open Space Element, and the Economic Development Element. It is anticipated that the updated Land Use
 Element will provide an additional residential designation for mixed uses similar to the range of land uses currently permitted in
 the downtown overlay zone.
 B.        VACANT LAND INVENTORY
      Land Currently Available
       As shown in Table 25, Bishop has a total 440.55 acres of undeveloped land within city limits. Of this, 95.5% is owned by the
       City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. There are currently only 2.72 acres of undeveloped, utility
       serviceable, residentially designated land in Bishop. Applying current zoning and assuming 80% of maximum allowed
       density, the realistic capacity of these 2.72 acres is approximately 45 units. The remaining undeveloped acreage is either
       designated for non‐residential uses (such as commercial or industrial) or is not serviceable with utilities.
                                                                          Table 25

       The information provided in Table 24 underscores the importance of goals that focus on working with LADWP to acquire
       land for affordable housing, and the importance of HCD assistance in reconciling lease terms and loan terms and exploring
       the feasibility of sharing affordable housing credits with the City of Los Angeles,
      Additional Vacant Land that May Become Available to the City (City of Los Angeles‐Owned Properties)
       Historically, the land held by the City of Los Angeles has not been available for development of residential uses and this
       continues to be the case at present. Taken in whole, it is estimated that the City of Los Angeles-owned lands within the City
       could support 3,000 dwelling units.19 In 2004, , the City was in negotiation with the City of Los Angeles for two specific

2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                          39

      properties: a 15-acre parcel which would have provided 75-100 housing units, and the McIver Street/Pacifica (now
      McIver/IMACA) project which would have provided 55 senior housing units. If this land is released by the City of Los
      Angeles for development, the additional housing would be more than adequate to meet the City’s fair share allocation of
      regional housing needs. However, the City is constrained in planning for their future use because these lands are owned by
      another public entity. There are no negotiations pending as of July 2013, and no opportunities in the foreseeable future.
      However, the City continues to closely monitor the availability of City of Los Angeles lands for purchase or long-term lease
      as a cornerstone of their efforts toward constructing affordable housing.
      Another project area that could become available in the future involves two parcels in the vicinity of Spruce Street and E.
      Yaney Street. Efforts during 2007-2008 to acquire the parcel on the south failed when State and Federal funding
      commitments were withdrawn because each agency wanted the other agency to make the first commitment, but the City
      anticipates that one of these parcels may again become available in the future. The northern parcel may be more suitable for
      a future effort because recent surveys have revealed the presence of cultural resources on the southern site.
      Table 25 presents information about the three parcels noted above, as well as the currently occupied sites discussed in the
      following section. Potential capacity for all parcels is estimated at 80% of the maximum density shown in Table 25.
      Development capacities may be even higher than shown, since the City allows developers to mitigate for impacts to
      sensitive resources (including biological and cultural resources) by obtaining approvals from the appropriate state and
      federal permitting agencies. None of the sites shown in Table 25 is known to have unavoidable environmental impacts that
      would preclude development, and only a small part of the DWP site is located in the 100-year flood plain. The City
      anticipates that any future environmental constraints on these sites, all of which are shown in Figure 2 (Bishop Zoning Map,
      see Appendix A) can be mitigated to a level that would permit development to occur within the current planning period.
      Development of all three parcels at the maximum allowed densities would yield affordable housing far exceeding the 2014
      RHNA allocation for the City of Bishop (110 units total). As in the prior Housing Element, the projects described in Table 26
      below are considered to represent the City’s best opportunity for meeting RHNA goals through 2019. The City will place a
      priority on realization of these projects, and considers it possible though by no means certain that at least one of the projects
      will be achieved during the current planning period. Because of the recognized challenge in obtaining development rights
      for these properties, the City during the prior planning period implemented zoning changes to allow affordable housing as

     Currently Occupied Sites that May Become Available to the City (Private Parcels)
      The City and IMACA have had a long-term interest in the potential acquisition of an existing motel (the Elm Street Motel)
      located on East Elm Street. IMACA previously bid to acquire this site in 1998 and had the funds available to proceed, but
      the deal failed due to problems in the real estate transaction. The owner has not since 1998 shown an interest in selling, but
      IMACA continues to keep an eye on this site for possible future purchase.
      Another property that has approached IMACA with an offer to sell is the Starlight Motel located at Short and Sneden. The
      offer was not accepted previously due to the absence of sufficient funds, but the site is well suited for conversion as an
      affordable living unit and IMACA has continued interest in future acquisition when a suitable funding opportunity is
      identified. The City estimates that the Elm Street Motel and the Starlight Motel parcels have a combined potential capacity
      for 41 units, based on the existing number of units. Both parcels are fully served by utilities and infrastructure, and neither
      parcel is subject to development constraints, As noted previously, however, neither of these properties is current available
      for purchase and therefore neither project is under active consideration at this time.
     Infrastructure and Public Service Considerations
      The City of Bishop Department of Public Works provides water service to the entire city and sewer service to most of the
      city. The Eastern Sierra Community Services District (ESCSD) provides sewer service in the northeast part of the city. The
      city has adequate water production, treatment, and distribution capacity to serve the entire city, including parcels that are
      currently undeveloped. Through flow exchange agreements with ESCSD, the city has adequate sewer treatment, disposal,
      and collection facilities to serve the same area.
      The city periodically reviews its water and sewer infrastructure and their operation, maintenance, and improvement needs.
      Funding for these needs are built into yearly rates assessed to water and sewer customers. These reviews, in addition to In
      addition to the Water and Sewer Master Plans prepared in 2008, indicate there is adequate capacity to serve the 2019 RHNA
      development outlined in this Housing Element.
      Other essential services such as public safety (police and fire) would also be provided by the City, with possible
      modification to staffing levels depending on the rate and intensity of development. Neither of the privately owned vacant
      properties is constrained by earthquake faults or by flooding potential. A determination as to whether a parcel would pose
      “wetland” issues would require site specific studies at the time of development review.
C.        EVALUATION OF GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS
According to state law, local housing elements must analyze existing and potential governmental constraints on the maintenance,
improvement or development of housing for all income levels. The potential and actual constraints included and required in the
scope of analysis are listed below:
                   Fees and Site Improvement Costs
                   Processing and Permit Procedures
                   Building Codes
                   Land Use Controls
                   Applicable State Laws
The law does not imply that the above factors constrain all jurisdictions. However, Article 10.6 requires that these factors be
analyzed to determine if any constrain the maintenance, improvement or development of housing in a community. As described
in the discussion below, the procedures and fees and controls adopted by the City of Bishop pose no substantive obstacles to
development in comparison with other agencies in California because (a) site improvement costs and municipal fees remain at or
below the level of comparable jurisdictions, (b) the City is efficient in its processing of various applications and handles such
applications in a single department, (c) residential zoning categories are permissive (allowing all densities up to the category
limit), and (d) zoning restrictions contain no unusual or prohibitive requirements. There are no governmental policies or
requirements that impede the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities, and the City
has outlined a process to enhance housing opportunities for its disabled population.
The City of Bishop maintains an open‐ended regulatory process. The process provides access to all persons including those
concerned about issues involving persons with disabilities or special needs, as well as advocates and opponents of special
projects. The City has found that open‐ended access is more responsive than attempting to codify every issue that arises as a city
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                           41

ordinance, particularly for a jurisdiction as small as Bishop. With a planning staff of one person, the City is able to give full and
individual attention to each person facing constraints on housing for persons with disabilities or and other special needs. These
cases are considered individually and decisions are contingent upon the full range of circumstances found to affect each case.
As discussed throughout this Housing Element, constraints on the availability of private land sharply limit the number of new
development projects in the City of Bishop. However, no restrictions apply to new developments and all proposals are handled
individually, often by a request for special use permits. In 2001, the City of Bishop adopted a Building Code based on the
Universal Building Code. In August 2008, the Municipal Code was amended to adopt by ordinance the California Code of
Regulations, Title 24, parts 1 through 10 and 12, which are the California Administrative, Building, Electrical, Mechanical,
Plumbing, Energy, Elevator Safety, Construction, Historical Building, Fire, Existing Building and Referenced Standard Codes.
The City addresses permits, policies and processing with regard to group homes strictly on a discretionary basis, with community
input and all extenuating circumstances taken into account. The R2000 zone is used as a guide for policies regarding group
housing and often requires conditional use permits. Changes in policies are also considered on a case by case basis and standards
(such as residential parking requirements) do not differ for persons with disabilities. The City’s affirmative implementation
program for housing to meet the needs of persons with disabilities is outlined in the 5‐Year Action Plan, §V.C.
C.1       Fees and Site Improvement Costs
The City of Bishop assesses fees for the processing of building permits and land use approvals. As was true in the 2009-2014
Housing Element, the City uses a permit fee schedule to determine the cost of a building permit; it is based on the valuation of the
project at hand. As an example, a $65,000 valued project would be charged a building permit fee of $749. A project valued at
$100,000 would be charged $994. Plan check fees are charged at 65% of the building permit fee. These fees apply equally to all
types of residential construction (single family, multi-family etc.), and are similar to fees charged in other jurisdictions and do not
significantly constrain housing; the fees help offset the costs of inspection. The building permit fee schedule is periodically
updated and readily available to the public at City offices.
Processing costs for a general plan amendment, zone change and/or use permit are minimal. For example, the fee for a general
plan amendment or a zone change is based on the actual cost for staff time, while a use permit costs $1500, as does a negative
declaration. Environmental Impact Reports are contracted out at cost, and there are no parkland dedication fees or requirements.
The City adjusts these fees periodically; the last increase occurred in July of 2013. As is evident, processing costs do not pose
serious limitation on the production of housing in Bishop.
The City of Bishop owns and operates the sewer and water system. Unlike many jurisdictions in the state, Bishop does not charge
a hook-up fee for these services. There is a labor cost (averaging about $1,200 per hookup as of 2013) to offset the costs of the
physical connection to the sewer line and/or water line, and builders are required to fund the cost of any other needed sewer and
water system improvements. Common trenching for utilities is encouraged where allowed by state health codes. The City has
adequate total capacity in its sewer and water systems to accommodate its 65-unit share of the regional housing need over the
coming 5‐year planning period (2014-2019). On-site improvements are the responsibility of the developer of housing projects.
These include sidewalks, curb, gutter, street lights and roadway improvements as needed to meet City standards. The standards
are typical of small communities. Fees are otherwise not charged
The City has no special requirements such as landscaping, fencing and sprinkler systems. Similarly, there are no fees for offsite
improvements such as traffic signals, light standards or other roadway improvements. Again, there is very limited impact on
housing costs from City-imposed regulations. Again, the low fees do not pose any obstacle for development of housing.
School impact fees are charged by the respective school districts. The districts charge the maximum fees allowed by state law.
This is the only locally imposed fee that might be considered a constraint on the production of housing. The City does not have
authority to change or reduce the fees established by local school districts.
To encourage construction of low-moderate housing, the City offers assistance with the preparation and filing of building and
permit applications if requested. In sum, the availability of adequate capacity, coupled with reasonable fees and charges, indicate
that fees and site improvement costs do not pose an obstacle to affordable housing development in the City of Bishop. Again, all
fees are applied equally regardless of housing type; a typical 1,500 square foot new single family attached housing unit in Bishop
would require total fee payments of approximately $6,882.69 including $1,273.75 for the building permit fee, $827.94 for the plan
check fee, and $4,800 for the school impact fee (charged at a rate of $3.20/sf). In addition, the City passes on certain state fees
based on the value of the permit; for the example given, these state fees would amount to $21.

C.2        Processing and Permit Procedures
When residential projects are initiated in the City, specific approvals are required that can involve Planning Commission action,
City Council action, permits and inspections. Table 27 indicates average processing times for the various processes; as shown, the
City maintains a relatively fast processing time for all categories. Although there is no officially designated ʺone stopʺ processing
of permits, there is in fact only one stop for applicants since the planning, building and public works departments are all housed
at the same location and utilize at the same staff and front counter. Table 28 summarizes the range of housing types permitted in
residential zones. Note that most of these process elements can be conducted concurrently (for example, the review and approval
for a general plan amendment, zone change, EIR and TT Map are all processed in parallel), and projects that conform to all
applicable standards receive ministerial approval. The typical processing time for a new single family attached housing unit in a
conforming zone would be approximately 1 month (longer if the plan submittal is incomplete). The typical processing time for a
conforming multi-family development would also be about one month (provided the submittal documents are complete).

generally concurrently with General Plan amendment applications.
21The R-M category (residential mobile home district) is strictly for mobile home housing.
22 Multifamily (5+ units) is a permitted use only in the residential portion of the overlay zone.
23 A CUP is required for mobile home development in the mixed use overlay zone.
24Second units are not governed by specific ordinance, but are permitted in all zones in keeping with state law.
25Emergency shelters are permitted in all residential zones with a CUP. The Bishop Zoning Code does not address single room occupancy as a
specific type of housing but, as described in this Element, there are 2 single‐room occupancy projects in Bishop. One is located in R‐3 (MHDR) and
the other is in a C‐1 zone. Similar requirements would apply to transitional housing.
26 The City during 2011 adopted the formal terminology for Transitional and Supportive Housing, and will consider adopt ion of the new revised
terminology as part of the 2014-2019 Housing Element Action Plan.
27 The City adopted Ord. 543 in March 2013 (see App. C) to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive reasonable accommodation to ensure
equal access to housing and facilitate the development of housing for individuals with disabilities. The ordinance was patterned after the Model
Fair Housing Ordinance developed by HCD to assist cities in preparing their own ordinances.
28 A CUP is required for Group Homes up to 6 residents in the overlay zone.

Emergency Shelters provide housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
months or less by a homeless person. Transitional housing is designed to facilitate the movement of homeless individuals and
families into permanent housing. Supportive housing is permanent rental housing linked to a range of support services designed
to enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead fuller lives. As a result of ordinances adopted during the 2009-2014
Housing Element cycle, all three types of housing are now permitted by right in the mixed use overlay zone and subject only to
the same development and management standards that apply to other allowed uses in the identified zone. As part of the current
Housing Element Action Plan, the City plans to consider expanding the boundaries and range of uses allowed in the mixed use
zone to provide for a wider range of affordable housing opportunities. The overlay zone was selected for these uses because of its
proximity to a wide range of complementary services including public transit facilities, basic goods and grocery stores, and social
welfare services. Because the Municipal Code does not define ‘family’ or set minimum separation requirements for these uses, it
will not impede the implementation of these goals.
C.3        Building Codes
The City of Bishop has adopted the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Parts 1 through 12, which establishes standards for
new construction. The City could establish more stringent standards but has not done so. Relative to other jurisdiction in the state,
there are no special building code constraints present that would inhibit housing construction. Further, the City conducts its code
enforcement on a complaint basis or as needed through normal field visits.
C.4        Land Use Controls and Other Considerations
In some jurisdictions, the land use element, zoning code and/or subdivision ordinance impose potential constraints on housing,
especially affordable housing. In Bishop, these regulations contain no unusual or stringent provisions that would unduly inhibit
housing production. The Land Use Element contains a wide range of residential densities including single family, duplex, triplex,
apartments, condominiums, mobile home subdivisions, mobile home parks, and ʺgranny unitsʺ on single-family properties.
The City of Bishop has no unusual or prohibitive lot coverage requirements. Unit size is controlled only through the lot coverage
requirement; there are no minimums or maximum unit sizes required by the City except through the CBC. Height requirements
are also not unduly restrictive; there is a two-story maximum for single-family units and a two-story maximum for multifamily
units. Similarly, the standards set for the overlay zone, where emergency shelters are allowed, were reviewed by Inyo County
staff as well as IMACA and Salvation Army during the public review process and not found to be unduly restrictive.

There are neither open space dedication requirements nor design review requirements in Bishop; the free marketplace dictates
open space and design. The City allows manufactured housing meeting the CBC requirements. Density bonuses are allowed in
the City in accordance with state law. Small lot developments are allowed but few have been proposed. Code enforcement is
complaint‐driven. Overall, the City imposes no unusual requirements or regulations that would impose constraints on housing
production. In fact, compared to most other cities in the state, the City of Bishop has very few constraints either through fees,
regulations or land use requirements. Table 29 summarized relevant zoning and development standards for the City of Bishop,
and Table 30 summarizes street widths, curb and gutter standards, sidewalk requirements and other applicable requirements.

The State of California has imposed potential constraints on housing through the requirement for a Comprehensive Land Use
Plan (CLUP) in relation to airports. Inyo County has adopted the Bishop CLUP which deals with noise and safety issues from the
Bishop Airport. Due to the proximity to airport operations, proposed residential development in the vicinity of the designated
safety/noise zones in the CLUP would have to be reviewed by the Airport Land Use Commission. The area in question is in the
northeast corner of the City limits where the majority of land has been designated for commercial or industrial development.
These land uses tend to be more compatible with airport operations than residential uses. 32
In most respects, the City is well suited to meet the needs of its lower-income and disabled population. Mobility is enhanced by
numerous factors (including the City’s compact size, the availability of transit services, and relatively uniform and flat
topography throughout the City limits) and the cost of municipal services and utilities is relatively low. Moreover, housing costs
have declined substantially from the inflated values that were reflected in the City’s 2008 cost of living index of 106.1 (above the
national average33). Again, it is the lack of available and developable land that represents the most significant constraint to
ensuring an adequate supply of affordable housing.
C.5         Applicable State and Local Laws
During 2002 the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 1866, with the intent to provide affordable housing through
development of second‐units. To achieve this goal, AB 1866 amended 2 sections of the existing Government Code:
           Section 65852.2 (Second‐unit law)
            This amendment requires local governments with a second unit ordinance to ministerially review second‐unit
            applications as of July 2003. Local governments without a second‐unit ordinance, or with an ordinance that conflicts
            with this law, should ministerially consider second‐unit applications in accordance with State standards.
           Section 65583.1 (A portion of State Housing Element Law)
            This amendment clarifies existing housing element law to allow identification of realistic capacity for second units in
            addressing a locality’s share of regional housing need. The amendment encourages identification of potential capacity
            based on development trends of second‐units. This amendment took effect on January 2003.
The City of Bishop has not formally adopted a second unit ordinance, although this has been a subject of discussion and review
by the City Council. As a key outgrowth of this discussion, the City Council adopted Ordinance 50634 to provide relief to
homeowners living in nonconforming structures that have been subject to damage or destruction. The ordinance affirms the
City’s goal that land uses should reflect approved designations, but allows the repair or reconstruction of otherwise legal non-
conforming structures that have been damaged or destroyed through natural or intentional destruction. The City intends to
31Some    special street standards apply to condos & condo conversions regardless of adjacent street category. No other special requirements apply.
32Note   that LADWP during 2011 granted to Inyo County an easement in perpetuity for airport-related uses at the Eastern Sierra Regional Airport
in Bishop. The new easement will enable the County to obtain funding from FAA for aviation development.

       Senate Bill 812 and Senate Bill 520 (Persons with Disabilities)
        In January 2011, SB 812 took effect and amended California housing element law. The new law requires an analysis of the
        special housing needs of persons with disabilities, including an estimate of the number of persons with developmental
        disabilities, an assessment of their housing needs, and discussion of potential resources. SB 812 defines a "developmental
        disability" as a continuing disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, and includes Mental
        Retardation, Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, and Autism.
        The US Census does not compile detailed local information regarding persons with developmental disabilities, but does
        conduct a regular Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) survey about the income of Americans and their
        participation in income transfer programs that support social welfare. Based on surveys conducted in 2005 and 2010, the
        Census Bureau has determined that about 56.7 million people living in the United States (18.7% of the civilian non-
        institutionalized population) had some kind of disability as of 2010, and about 38.3 million people (12.6% of total
        population, and 67.5% of all disabled persons) had a severe disability. The overall percentage did not change between 2005
        and 2010, although the percentage of persons with a severe disability increased as did the percentage of persons needing
        assistance with daily living. Disability rates (including severe disabilities) were found to increase with age (people 80-years
        and older are about 8 times more likely to have a disability than persons under 15-years of age). Forty percent of disabled
        persons 21-years or older were employed, and persons with severe disabilities are substantially more likely to experience
        persistent poverty than those with non-severe or no disabilities.35
        The U.S. Census also collects limited information at the state level (and for geographic areas with more than 65,000
        residents) through the American Community Survey (ACS), a nationwide survey designed to provide communities with
        annual demographic data (based on a sample size of about 3 million addresses). Based on results of the 2009 and 2009 ACS,
        a total of 1,898,118 persons with disabilities lived in California as of 2009 (7.9% of the total population), which reflected a
        very slight decrease of -0.1% over the 1,920,577 persons with disabilities living in the state as of 2008. West Virginia had the
        highest disability rate for people aged 16 to 64 years (16.8%), while Hawaii had the lowest rate (not statistically different
        from California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Utah).36
        Applying these data to the City of Bishop, it can be estimated that approximately 35 residents have disabilities (7.9% of the
        population, as per the California average), and that 24 of these residents have severe disabilities. As discussed throughout
        this Housing Element, the Bishop housing stock includes a substantial number of affordable and accessible homes, both of
        which are critical to enable persons with developmental disabilities to live in integrated community settings, and a wide
        range of social services and specialized housing are also available. This Housing Element contains a new goal wherein the
        City will work with IMACA to develop an outreach program so that residents are aware of the housing resources available
        to persons with disabilities.
        SB 520, approved in October 2001, prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of familial status or disability, and recasts
        earlier provisions pertaining to handicapped persons in terms of disabled persons. The law essentially clarified existing
        state requirements, including specifications for assessing housing needs, developing an inventory of housing constraints
        and resources (including land availability to meet needs), analyzing population and employment characteristics, identifying
        means to conserve existing affordable housing resources, a statement of applicable goals and policies, and development of a
        5‐year program to achieve those goals consistent with state requirements and regional housing allocations.
        This Housing Element provides an assessment of disabled residents, establishes goals and policies that give priority to the
        housing needs of disabled, elderly, single‐parent and homeless residents with limited incomes, and identifies programs
        specifically designed to address the housing needs of this segment of the population. The programs include Community
        Development Block Grant funding, Housing Assistance Program rental assistance vouchers, use of density bonuses, rental
        housing construction program funds, the energy crisis intervention program, enforcement of existing state laws, and
        enforcement of the Bishop Land Use Element guidelines pertaining to density limits. Additionally, the 5‐year action
        program includes specific goals for working with IMACA to develop an outreach program to inform Bishop residents of
        housing and services available for persons with disabilities.

     Section 65584.09
      AB 1233 (Jones), Chapter 614, Statutes of 2005, requires local governments to zone or rezone adequate sites, within the first
      year of the new planning period, to address any portion of the RHNA for which the jurisdiction failed to identify or make
      available sites in the prior planning period. As described in §IIA above, the City has been stymied in its attempts to acquire
      or annex land for construction of housing. Intense good-faith efforts to acquire land from the City of Los Angeles were
      unsuccessful. As discussed in §IV.A above, however, of the roughly 456 acres zoned for residential development in the City,
      approximately 195 acres, or 43%, are already zoned at 16 dwelling units per acre or higher. Although the 2004 RHNA for
      above-moderate housing was not met, the City did remove obstacles to high-density, affordable housing and has continued
      to work closely with IMACA and other groups to develop senior and low-cost housing whenever possible.
     Section 65583
      Chapter 633, Statutes of 2007 (SB 2) strengthens housing element law to ensure zoning facilitates emergency shelters and
      limits the denial of emergency shelters and transitional and supportive housing under the Housing Accountability Act. The
      law will facilitate efforts to address the critical needs of homeless populations and persons with special needs throughout all
      California. Generally, SB 2 amends housing element law regarding planning and approval for emergency shelters and
      transitional and supportive housing as follows:
      o At least one zone shall permit emergency shelters without a conditional use permit or other discretionary action.
      o Sufficient capacity must be identified to accommodate the need for emergency shelters and at least one year-round
      emergency shelter.
      o Existing or proposed permit procedures, development and management standards must
      be objective and encourage and facilitate the development of or conversion to emergency
      shelters.                                                                                                The City permits
      o Emergency shelters shall be subject only to development and management standards that                second units in most
      apply to residential or commercial uses within the same zone.
      o Written and objective standards may be applied as specified in statute, including                      residential zones.
      maximum number of beds, provision of onsite management, length of stay and security.
      o Includes flexibility for jurisdictions to meet zoning requirements with existing ordinances
      or demonstrate that the need for emergency shelters can be met in existing shelters or through a multi-jurisdictional
      agreement.
      o Transitional and supportive housing shall be considered a residential use and subject only to those restrictions that
      apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
      As noted in §III.A.7 (Special Needs), IMACA estimates that the homeless population in Bishop has grown in recent years.
      Though there are no formal homeless statistics available for the Bishop area, IMACA estimates that the population is
      growing. Statewide statistics indicate about 36 homeless per 10,000 residents, which would indicate roughly 36 homeless in
      Inyo and Mono Counties combined, and about 13 homeless individuals in the Bishop City limits. These estimates are higher
      than in 2009, when the Inyo County Mental Health Director estimated a total of 25 homeless individuals in Inyo County, 5
      of whom were thought to reside in the City. The prolonged economic downturn has played a key role in this trend, and
      IMACA notes that daily calls and referrals for assistance have increased noticeably over the past year or so.
      The County of Inyo Full Service Partnership (FSP), operated under the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), provides
      services to children, Transition Age Youth (TAY), adults, and older adults. Through provision of a nurse to meet the needs
      of older adults, the program has successfully integrated physical health care with mental health care to help elders to stay in
      their homes and manage their health and mental health needs. The FSP works with local churches to offer free lunches to
      community members three days a week; TAY and adult clients volunteer their time to help cook and serve the meals. The
      FSP also facilitates coordination and access to medications, clinical services, substance abuse services, vocational
      rehabilitation, benefits advocacy, and medical care, as well as assistance with finding housing, housing vouchers, and
      programs to foster the skills necessary to promote the most independent, least restrictive housing possible in the
      community. Community-based locations for the adult program will be obtained to help integrate these services into the
      community and help improve access. The MHSA operates two wellness centers in Inyo County, including one in Bishop
      and a second in Lone Pine. The wellness centers offer outreach by mental health staff, referrals for homeless individuals in
      need of mental health services, and other similar recovery and support programs.
      Housing and employment services are a critical component of the FSP. A ‘housing first’ model is used, in conjunction with
      developing a number of different housing options. Supportive housing services are provided. An array of support services
      are available that are intended to promote housing stability, recovery, and wellness. Participation in these support services

       is voluntary and not a requirement for eligibility for any rent subsidy or housing voucher. 37
D.         NONGOVERNMENTAL AND MARKET CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The very limited acreage of private land is by far the most significant constraint to achieving Housing Element objectives. Fees
and site improvement costs, processing and permit procedures, building codes, land use controls, availability of public services
and environmental considerations are important but do not impose significant constraints to development in Bishop. Moreover,
the cost of housing in Bishop has been substantially reduced since the 2009 Housing Element was adopted, primarily as a result of
the recent economic downturn; as of July 2013, the City’s housing inventory is notably affordable in comparison with California
housing generally. The discussion below focuses on the non‐governmental and market constraints to housing development.
D.1        Limited Land Resources
The City of Los Angeles owns significant land area in the City of Bishop as well as the entire Owens Valley. As noted in previous
sections, the total area of serviceable and residentially designated City of Los Angeles‐owned land in the Bishop city limits could
accommodate over 3,000 dwelling units. This is almost twice the number of dwelling units in the City of Bishop in the 1990
Census. However, Los Angeles DWP has gradually reduced the housing stock in Bishop through the demolition of older
dwellings on DWP‐owned land. As in prior years, the purpose of Los Angeles DWP in the Owens Valley is to procure water for
southland uses. The City of Los Angeles has secured land and water rights throughout the Bishop region and generally has not
released land for residential development. Where the City of Los Angeles has released land for development, it primarily has
been for non‐residential uses. This policy has severely restricted housing development in Bishop and the Owens Valley. It
remains the number one housing growth constraint in Bishop.
Although City of Los Angeles lands surround most of Bishop, the western boundary adjoins the Piute‐Shoshone Indian
Reservation. The tribe is a self-directed and nearly autonomous nation that is not subject to City regulations (Bishop cannot
develop or govern the development of tribal lands) or to state mandates such as housing elements. It is tribal policy to use tribal
lands for tribal purposes. This constraint adds to the limited land resource available to the City in meeting housing requirements.
The remaining acreage of privately held, developable property in the City of Bishop is very limited; as shown previously in Table
23, less than 20 acres of privately-owned vacant land remains in Bishop, most in small parcels scattered throughout the City. The
zoning density overlays permit a considerable increase in density when land is redeveloped.
D.2        Affordability (based on Current Trends in Housing Costs)
The Bishop housing market has undergone wide fluctuations over the past decade. To provide an updated snapshot of housing
trends, several real estate sources were reviewed including the Market Activity Report (for the period from January 2010 through
19 July 2013), the Real Estate Inventory-Supply and Demand Report Market Indicator (for the period from January 2010 through 19 July
2013), July 2012 through 18 July 2013), an Inventory Comparison (for the period from July 2012 through June 2013), and to provide a
basis for comparison the Current Market Statistics (from January 2007 through December 2010). A good overview of regional
trends is provided in Table 31 below, which summarizes total sales for the 4 year period from 2007 through 2013. These data
show a continuous and continuing decline in values (a 34.2% drop over the 6.5-year period), coupled with continuous increases in
sale volume and associated reductions in days on the market. For the 2- square mile Bishop area, the median price of homes
reached a high of $413,980 in 2007; values have been falling since then, with a current average value of $272,447 as of July 2013.

These data show that all housing types in Bishop are today significantly lower in price than when the prior Housing Element was
completed in 2009. Nonetheless, rental and mobile homes remain an important affordable housing option in Bishop, available to
a wider range of potential buyers than single-family units. Table 33a summarizes rental values for the first quarter of 2013 and
Table 33b summarizes mobile home sales in the larger Bishop area for each of the four quarters between July 2012 and July 2013.
The data suggest that rental and mobile homes in Bishop have remained affordable to even very low income residents, though the
available supply has been limited through this period.

D.3        Land Prices
Land costs are a major contributor to overall housing production prices. The very small amount of privately owned vacant land
appears to contribute to land costs, at least as compared to a similar community without the constraints noted previously. As a
result the ʺfiltering downʺ process, which can enable lower income or first‐time buyers to enter the housing market, is affected.
Although no data was available for the City proper, data for the 20 square mile Bishop area indicates that there were 4
commercial lots and 188-acres of vacant land lots sold between January 2010 and July 2013.
D.4        Construction Costs
Construction costs include materials, labor, financing charges and builder profit. These costs will vary depending on structural
requirements (such as snow, wind and seismic conditions) and by the quality of the construction (such as roofing materials,
carpeting, cabinets, bathroom fixtures and other amenities). Because of these factors, it is hard to establish an absolute measure of
construction cost. According to data obtained from Eastern Sierra Realty, residential properties are currently averaging about
$153 per square foot in the Bishop City limits for active listings, compared with $164 for recent sales in the City limits 38; by
comparison, homes were averaging about $200 per square foot in 2009, $135 in 2001 and $50 per square foot in 1995. Custom
homes and units with extra structural requirements or amenities can run much higher.
D.5        Conclusions
The data presented above indicate that Bishop housing costs have declined considerably since the 2009 Housing Element was
completed, as is true elsewhere in California and beyond. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes that the housing
market is now strengthening nationwide. As of May 2013, NAR records show a 4.4% increase in existing-home sales and a 2.9%
increase in prices in the Northeast (compared with the first quarter of 2012); in the Midwest, sales increased by 15% and prices by
8.2% in the same period, and in the South sales increased by 13.3% along with price increases averaging 9.3%.                 In contrast,

housing supplies in the west have remained sharply limited: existing home sales increased only 0.6% since the first quarter 2012,
while prices have increased by 24.4%. 39
Despite the short supply, price increases have not been reflected in the Bishop housing market to date. Bishop continues to offer
a range of affordable housing opportunities such as HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher housing assistance, assistance offered by the
California Housing Finance Agency, privately owned mobile home parks, and various programs available through IMACA and
Mammoth Housing. If and as housing costs increase, however, the City may again face challenges associated with a
comparatively low income job base and high housing costs. An increase in the supply of rental units could help to alleviate this
concern as the City continues to work with the City of Los Angeles to obtain lands (through lease or purchase) for the
construction of affordable housing projects. Both approaches are reflected in the 5-Year Plan below. Mammoth Housing
Authority offers down-payment assistance programs to assist families and individuals without sufficient incomes or equity to
enter the housing market. Finally, it remains a very high priority to continue to encourage the City of Los Angeles to release
residential land within the present urban boundary that can be used to meet long term housing opportunities in the City of
Bishop. Other programs are described under Item F (Affordable Housing Resources).
E.        RHNA COMPLIANCE
HCD’s 2012 Regional Housing Need Allocation Plan for Inyo County Local Governments reflects a number of changes from the
allocation prepared by HCD in 2009. The projected 2014-2019 0.45% annual household growth rate is now less than half the 1.3%
rate used in 2008, vacancy rates are now higher (2% for owners versus 1.8% in 2007; the renter vacancy rate was held steady at
5%); and the ‘Rural County’ 150% increase adjustment used in 2008 has been replaced by a one-time reduction in projected need
to reflect unprecedented economic conditions over the planning period. Although Bishop did not meet the numeric goals for the
prior housing element compliance period (2009-2014), the City has striven to comply
with the underlying RHNA objectives (per §65584(d), as discussed below:
                                                                                                                               Despite the short supply of
   1.     RHNA GOAL 1 - Increase the housing supply and the mix of housing types,
                                                                                                                            housing, price increases have
          tenure and affordability in an equitable manner. Since housing prices in
          Bishop have abated substantially in recent years, the housing inventory is now                                    not been reflect in the Bishop
          affordable to an increased number of residents. HUD lists a total of 4 affordable
                                                                                                                                housing market to date.
          rental housing facilities in Inyo County as a whole. Three of these facilities are
          located in the City of Bishop: the Sunrise Mobile Home Park on McIver, the
          Valley Apartments on East Clarke, and Willow Plaza Apartments on Willow Street. HUD lists only one other affordable
          rental facility in Inyo County – the Mt. Whitney Apartments, located in Lone Pine (about 60 miles south of Bishop). 40
          Bishop has continued to work closely with IMACA to preserve these affordable facilities, and has also worked with
          Mammoth Housing and local mobile home park owners to ensure that every possible affordable housing resource is
          preserved and expanded where possible.
   2.     RHNA GOAL 2 – Promote infill development and socioeconomic equity, environmental protection and efficient
          development patterns. During 2012, Bishop applied for funding through the Sustainable Communities Grant Program,
          missing the scoring cutoff by less than 1% (Bishop plans to reapply for the 3rd and final funding cycle in 2014). As noted
          in that application, Bishop has invested $5 million in downtown improvements and planning has focused on
          consolidating uses in the city rather than expanding into surrounding unincorporated lands. By focusing on infill, the
          Bishop General Plan has avoided encroachment onto the open space areas immediately surrounding the city. Creation
          and later expansion of the downtown mixed use overlay zone (since the 2009 Housing Element was adopted) has
          established an area of Bishop where infill residential development is permitted by right and encouraged. The overlay
          zone, in combination with the nearby Warren Street Improvement Project, will also update the downtown core area and
          may contribute to the City’s parallel efforts to balance jobs and housing (see below).
   3.     RHNA GOAL 3 – Promote an improved intraregional relationship between jobs and housing. The City of Bishop is in
          the very early stages of a targeted General Plan Update and Code Revisions that will include policies and regulations
          supporting housing in close proximity to commercial and public services, and economic development that maximizes
          efficient use of infrastructure (including the new fiber optic cable serving the length of Owens Valley). The programs
          will include a sustainable economic strategy that examines existing and future land use and housing demand in the
          context of job growth and policies, programs and codes to encourage public and private investment in the community.

   4.     RHNA GOAL 4 – Allocate housing need in proportion to the availability of supply in a given category. The 2012
          need allocation for Bishop is similar (in terms of the proportion of need at the very low, low, moderate and above
          moderate income levels) to the allocation in 2008. HCD made very a slight decrease in the City’s proportion of very low
          income units (from 23.6% to 23.4% now), and a somewhat larger decrease in the City’s proportion of above-moderate
          income units (from 45% to 43.7% now); the proportion of low income units was increased from 13.6% to 14.9% now, and
          the proportion of moderate income units increased from 17.3% to 18.1%. These adjustments suggest that Bishop income
          levels may have slipped very slightly in relation to Inyo County incomes as a whole, but the proportions are generally
          unchanged overall. Bishop is in the early stages of developing an economic development strategy to diversify job
          opportunities, and associated household income, by capitalizing on the new fiber optic cable. (Note too that HUD lists 3
          affordable rental housing facilities in Bishop: the Sunrise Mobile Home Park on McIver, the Valley Apartments on East
          Clarke, and Willow Plaza Apartments on Willow. Beyond the 3 Bishop facilities noted above, HUD lists only one other
          affordable rental facility in Inyo County – the Mt. Whitney Apartments, located in Lone Pine (see RHNA Goal 1, above).
F.        AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOURCES
Provided below is an outline of the wide range of programs designed to facilitate the construction, acquisition, rehabilitation
and/or preservation of affordable rental and ownership housing, homeless shelters and transitional housing, public facilities and
infrastructure, and the development of jobs for lower income workers. 41 Several state and federal programs are also designed to
assist in the provision of these services. Note that the state Legislature in 2011 approved the dissolution of all California
redevelopment agencies, and the agencies were officially dissolved as of February 2012; as a result, the Redevelopment Set-Aside
programs are no longer applicable and have been deleted from the 2014-2019 Housing Element discussion of potential affordable
housing resources.
F.1       Development Block Grant (CDBG)
CDBG funds represent another resource to improve the quality of life for residents of Bishop. CDBG monies have in the past been
used for a variety of projects benefiting low and moderate income households, including fund for the low‐moderate senior
housing facility at Sunrise Park. Block grant monies can also be used for rehabilitation, repair and loan programs. In recent years,
the City’s applications for CDBG funding have not been successful. In recent communications with HCD staff, the City has
gained added insight into how future applications might be structured to compete more successfully for the available CDBG
programs, and was able to utilize the information in a recent successful CDBG application, part of which will fund IMACA
improvements to the Valley Apartments, and part of which will preparation of an update to the Economic Development Element
of the Bishop General Plan. HCD has awarded funding for both of these projects. IMACA plans to use its $1 million in funding
to refurbish the Valley Apartments (which represent an important component of the affordable housing stock), and the City plans
to use the Economic Development Element update to create an expanded base of long-term professional employment
opportunities to benefit residents (particularly young residents) in Bishop and surrounding communities. HCD administers the
federal CDBG program for non‐entitlement cities and counties (including Bishop). CDBG funding could be pursued through the
following programs:
         Housing rehabilitation: Eligible activities are health and safety and complementary improvements made to units
          occupied by low-income households. Such improvements may include repair or replacement of foundations, roofs,
          siding, flooring, plumbing, and electrical systems. Rehabilitation may also include repair or installation of water or
          sewer laterals on private property, and complementary rehabilitation activities such as repainting and recarpeting.
         Activities in support of housing new construction may include: land acquisition; water and/or sewer improvements (to
          provide increased capacity needed); site improvements; clearing of site; construction of directly-related streets,
          curbs/gutters and sidewalks, parks, and recreation facilities; pre-construction studies, plans and funding applications;
          acquisition, rehabilitation or cost write-down of existing housing; and down-payment assistance and closing costs.
         Community facilities: Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of buildings and
          grounds for public purposes such as training, health, education, recreation, nutrition, emergency shelter, day care, or fire
          protection, or the removal of architectural barriers from public buildings.
         Public services: CDBG funds may be spent for labor, supplies and materials used to provide or improve services (such
          as employment, crime prevention, child care, health, drug/alcohol abuse prevention, and/or recreation).
         Public works: activities to correct health and safety hazards include acquisition, construction, rehabilitation and
          installation.
F. 2      Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program
The Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly Section 8) rental assistance vouchers extend rental assistance to low income
41Department  of Housing and Community Development website, http://www.hcd.ca.gov/fa/
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                            51

families and elderly or disabled which spend more than 30% of their income on housing. The subsidy represents the difference
between the excess of 30% of the monthly income and the actual housing cost. Vouchers permit tenants to locate their own
housing and, unlike prior programs, participants are permitted to rent units beyond the federally determined fair market rent in
and area provided the tenant pays the extra rent increment (vouchers are limited to the standard payment versus fair market rent;
standard payment is usually lower than fair market rent). IMACA is the designated agency in Inyo County to administer the
HCV vouchers. In 2004 there were 29 vouchers allocated to Inyo County residents (15 vouchers to Bishop residents), and
currently, there are 29 vouchers allocated to Inyo County, 10 of which were issued to residents in the City of Bishop. However,
there are no available vouchers as of July 2013, and the waiting list includes 28 residents throughout Inyo County. The Program
is currently closed, and Stanislaus Housing Authority is not accepting any new applications, but may reopen in the future.
F.3       Mobile Home Park Resident Ownership Program (MPROP)
This program, offered by HCD, provides financial and technical assistance to mobile home park residents who wish to purchase
their mobile home parks and convert the park to resident ownership. Loans are made to low income mobile home park residents
or public organizations to control housing costs. Low interest short and long term loans are offered to cover the costs of:
         Purchase (conversion) of a mobile home park by a resident organization, nonprofit entity or local public agency;
         Rehabilitation or relocation of a purchased park;
         Purchase by a low income resident of a share or space in a converted park.
With nearly 20% of Bishopʹs housing stock comprised of mobile home units, this is an important program to allow tenants to
control their housing costs. Where the present owner is a willing seller, the City can facilitate use of this program by advertising
its availability to mobile home park residents and by serving as co‐applicant for resident organizations applying to HCD for
funding. The City also provides information to residents about MPROP units that have become available (usually through
vacancy) and assists in the sale of MPROP units. As of July 2013, there are three units available with a long list of potential
buyers. The City collaborates with a real estate agent in assisting potential buyers submit offers and obtain loans. All of the
MPROP units in Bishop fall within the low or very low income categories.
F.4       Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
The closure of a motel can open up opportunities for conversion of existing units into transitional housing units called SROs.
SROs are like apartments with the exception that common kitchen facilities may be used when separate facilities are not available
in each unit. SROs are less costly to rent and maintain than full service units. With support from the City of Bishop, IMACA
converted a motel into affordable apartments for senior housing; however, in this instance, separate kitchen facilities were
provided. This housing is still owned and operated by IMACA. In addition, as noted in §IV.B, the City and IMACA have had a
long-term interest in the potential acquisition of two additional motel sites that may be suitable for SRO or other similar
affordable housing conversation projects. These sites include the existing Elm Street Motel located at the corner of West Elm and
North Warren Street, and the existing Starlight Motel located at Short and Sneden. With respect to the Elm Street Motel, IMACA
had previously made a bid to acquire this site in 1998 and had the funds available to proceed, but the deal fell through due to
problems in the real estate transaction. Since 1998, the owner has not shown an interest in selling, but IMACA has continued to
keep an eye on this site for possible future purchase. With respect to the Starlight Motel, IMACA has received prior offers to but
has not accepted previously due to the absence of sufficient funds. However, the site is well suited for conversion as an
affordable living unit and IMACA has maintained continued interest in future acquisition when a suitable funding opportunity is
identified. There has been no change in status for either the Elm Street Motel or the Starlight Motel.
F.5       Building Equity and Growth in Neighborhoods Program (BEGIN)
This HCD program is designed to reduce local regulatory barriers to affordable ownership housing, and provide down-payment
assistance loans to qualifying first-time low- and moderate-income buyers of homes in BEGIN projects. It offers grants to cities,
counties, or cities and counties to make deferred-payment second mortgage loans to qualified buyers of new homes, including
manufactured homes on permanent foundations, in projects with affordability enhanced by local regulatory incentives or barrier
reductions. It also offers loans by grant recipients at simple interest to qualifying homebuyers, not to exceed 20 percent of home
sales price or $30,000, whichever is less. As of July 2013, IMACA has three grants in the BEGIN program through Mammoth
Housing, but none of the grants are for projects in Bishop.
F.6       CalHome Program
The CalHome program was established to enable low and very-low income households to become or remain homeowners.
Program funds are available for public agencies or nonprofit corporations in the form of:
          Grants for first-time homebuyer down payment assistance, home rehabilitation, including manufactured homes not on
          permanent foundations, acquisition and rehabilitation, homebuyer counseling, self-help mortgage assistance programs,
          or technical assistance for self-help homeownership.
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                          52

          Loans for real property acquisition, site development, predevelopment, construction period expenses of homeownership
          development projects, or permanent financing for mutual housing and cooperative developments. Project loans to
          developers may be forgiven as developers make deferred payment loans to individual homeowners.
          Assistance to individual households in the form of deferred-payment loans, payable on sale or transfer of the homes, or
          when they cease to be owner-occupied, or at maturity.
F.7       HOME Program
The HOME Program was created under the National Housing Affordability Act of 1990. Under HOME, HUD awards funds to
localities on the basis of a formula that considers the ʺtightnessʺ of the local housing market, inadequate housing, poverty, and
housing production. HOME funding is provided to jurisdictions to assist either rental housing or home ownership through
acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and/or rehabilitation of affordable housing. Also possible is tenant‐based rental
assistance, property acquisition, site improvements, and other expenses related to the provision of affordable housing. Assistance
is also available for projects that serve a group identified as having special needs related to housing. The local jurisdiction must
make matching contributions to affordable housing under HOME. The State administers the HOME program for non‐entitlement
jurisdictions like Bishop, and has $44 million in funding to distribute state‐wide during each fiscal year. The City of Bishop will be
notified of funding availability by HCD, and IMACA has indicated an interest in pursuing this program to apply for funding in
support of the Silver Peaks project (as noted earlier, the City is current obtaining an appraisal with the goal of submitting a
purchase offer, if feasible, in support of this project). Mammoth Lakes Housing has also participated in Home Program funding
opportunities and will assist with future applications as the opportunities arise.
F.8       Density Bonus Law
State Government Code §65915, amended by SB 1818, provides for density bonus or similar incentives when a housing developer
agrees to construct at least one of the following:
    10% of total units in a housing development for persons/families of lower income as per Health & Safety Code §50079.5
    5% of the total units of a housing development for very low income HH as defined in Health and Safety Code §50105.
    Thirty-five units of a housing development for qualifying senior residents as defined in §51.2 of the Civil Code.
HCD has significantly reduced these goals since the 2004 Housing Element was adopted in response to feedback from builders
and developers. The Density Bonus Law is intended to provide an incentive to developers to provide low income housing, senior
housing or both to provide a balance of housing opportunities in the City. As part of the density bonus program, the City may
consider granting a density bonus or, in lieu of granting a density bonus, the City may grant an incentive of direct financial
assistance programs. In order to assure the long‐term affordability of housing units, the developer may be required to enter into a
development agreement or other binding contract with the City, and bonus programs are be subject to compliance with adopted
urban water management plans and other service constraints and programs. The City continued to support the use of density
bonuses but has not had an opportunity due to the lack of development in Bishop over the past 5 years,
F.9       Non‐Profit Housing Development Corporations (HDC)
The non‐profit Housing Development Corporations promote, assist or sponsor housing for low and moderate income persons.
An HDC does not build ʺpublic housing;ʺ rather, it builds or rehabilitates housing for people who cannot afford market rate
housing but whose incomes are generally above the poverty level and acts as the applying agency for grants and loans. To keep
rents within affordable limits, government assistance of some kind is usually necessary. Thus, such housing is often referred to
as ʺassisted housing.ʺ An HDC may build rental housing or sponsor housing developments intended for ownership. IMACA has
managed and owned some affordable housing projects county‐wide and is currently pursuing several HCD housing programs in
the City of Bishop, particularly the 72-unit Silver Peaks affordable housing project (as a joint endeavor with the City of Bishop).
IMACA has sought and will continue to seek additional affordable housing opportunities such as this program affords.
F.10      Hope for Homeowners (H4H) Program The federal Housing and Urban Development Dept. (HUD) offers a wide range
of programs to assist homeowners modify and/or refinance their home loans. The range of available programs and assistance has
been expanded over recent years to respond to the economic recession. Included are programs to modify or refinance loan
payments, programs specifically designed to help homeowners with ‘underwater’ mortgages, assistance for unemployed
homeowners, and managed exit programs for borrowers who cannot afford their mortgage or are dealing with foreclosure.
F.11      Weatherization Program
The Department of Energy, Weatherization Assistance Program (DOE WAP) has long served as the core program for delivering
energy conservation services to low-income Californians. Through IMACA, the Weatherization Assistance Program reduces the
heating and cooling costs for low-income families by improving the energy efficiency of their homes and ensuring their health
and safety. Among low-income households, the program focuses on those with elderly residents, individuals with disabilities,
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                            53

and families with children.
IMACA also administers the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) on behalf of the State of California.
Residents who meet income guidelines are eligible for roof, furnace or water heater repairs and replacements when funding is
available. Eligibility is 80% of state median income.
F.12     Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP)
The ECIP is another very active program in Bishop, and approximately half of Inyo County’s funds are expended in serving
Bishop households enrolled in the Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP) and the weatherization program. ECIP is available
each year as either $300 for electricity or 2 cords of wood, or $700 in propane or $700 in wood pellets. The LIHEAP Weatherization
Program assists about 20 eligible low-income Bishop families and individuals each year with up to $3,000 in energy conservation,
home repairs and heating and cooling assistance in the form of propane, pellets, kerosene, oil or electricity support to
F.13     Homeless and Emergency Shelter Programs
HCD administers several programs for the funding of homeless and emergency shelters. Included are:
        Emergency Housing and Assistance Program Operating Facility Grants (EHAP) provide facility operating grants for
         emergency shelters, transitional housing projects, and supportive services for homeless individuals and families. Each
         county receives a formula grant allocation; 20% of the total allocation is available to non-urban counties to provide direct
         client housing, including facility operations and administration, residential rent assistance, leasing or renting rooms for
         provision of temporary shelter, capital development activities of up to $20,000 per site, and administration of the award
         (limited to 5 percent).
        Emergency Housing and Assistance Program Capital Development (EHAPCD) funds capital development activities
         for emergency shelters, transitional housing, and safe havens that provide shelter and supportive services for homeless
         individuals and families through deferred payment loans at 3 percent simple interest, forgiven when loan term is
         complete. Term ranges from 5 to 10 years based on the development activity. Again, 80% of the total allocation is
         available to urban counties, and 20% to non-urban counties.
        Governor's Homeless Initiative is an interagency effort aimed at reducing homelessness. The funding program
         component of the Governor’s Homeless Initiative assists with the development of permanent supportive housing for
         persons with severe mental illness who are chronically homeless. It is a joint project of HCD, the California Housing
         Finance Agency (CalHFA), and the Department of Mental Health (DMH). The program provides deferred payment
         permanent loans under HCD’s Multifamily Housing Program (MHP); construction, bridge and permanent loans from
         CalHFA; and limited grant funds for rental assistance from DMH. These loans may be used for new construction,
         rehabilitation, or acquisition and rehabilitation of permanent rental housing, and the conversion of nonresidential
         structures to rental housing. Projects must have commitments of Mental Health Services Act funds for supportive
         services, and typically require rent subsidies as well.
F.14     Other Affordable Housing Resources
The City of Bishop operates a code enforcement program that is focused on the elimination of housing conditions that violate
public health, safety and welfare codes. The following are additional programs currently undertaken by the City to provide new
housing and improvement of existing housing stock:
        Continue streamlining all planning procedures to assist developers.
        Encourage use of the Title 1 Loan Program to provide low interest loans to low and moderate income home owners who
         need to borrow for rehabilitation work.
        Permit mobile and modular housing on residential lots.
        Enforce energy regulations to provide better housing and lower maintenance costs.
        Take advantage of ongoing programs to assist developers in site selection and utilization of existing federal and state
         programs to construct or rehabilitate units for low and moderate income housing.
        Use state/federal loans & grants for public improvements; retain tax dollars for infrastructure development &
         maintenance.
        Allow construction of second units on residentially zoned lots consistent with state law.
        Continue to support equal opportunity actions.
        Enforce State regulations for disabled residents (Title 24 and SB 520).
        Encourage the maintenance of all residential units even if nonconforming as a means of conserving the housing stock.
        Promote the establishment of programs that are aimed at maintaining existing housing units that are in need of repair.
The City works closely with IMACA, Wild Iris, Mammoth Housing and the County Department of Mental Health Services to
obtain available grants and loans to assist at-risk populations, including the homeless, disabled, elderly, low-income and those
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                           54

with mental health problems. The lack of availability of developable sites hampers the City’s ability to acquire and construct
projects under some of these programs.
The Senior Shared Housing Program is no longer operating in Bishop or Inyo County. The 2009 Housing Element described this
as a program operated by the Inyo Mono Area Agency on Aging (IMAAA) to help seniors locate roommates to share housing,
thereby generating additional income to support the household. IMAAA has been replaced by the Eastern Sierra Area Agency on
Aging (ESAAA), and although ESAAA continues to provide a range of services to senior citizens in Inyo and Mono Counties, the
services no longer including housing assistance.
V.        GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
A.        Goals
The City of Bishop General Plan Land Use Element establishes the following housing goal: ʺTo provide for quality residential life by
maintaining and improving the existing housing stock and by insuring that the housing needs of the entire community are being met. This

         As part of the economic development strategy, Bishop will explore ways in which the Warren Street Improvement
          Project can facilitate housing opportunities in the overlay zone to help meet the housing needs of an increased job base.
C.        ACTIONS – FIVE YEAR HOUSING PROGRAM
The Bishop Housing Element policies and actions were developed as a result of an analysis of existing and future housing needs
contained in the Planning Analysis. The Analysis concluded that, in general, the housing needs of the community will continue to
be met by the private sector. However, the Analysis also indicated that the private sector will not be able to meet the needs of all
present and future residents. In particular, many of the City’s elderly, younger and single parent households will have
considerable difficulty in obtaining and maintaining housing. These difficulties include excessive payment for rents due to an
undersupply of affordable rental units, a market closed to many first time buyers, and displacement and loss of repairable units
resulting from commercial development and higher intensity residential uses.
While the causes of these problems are varied, several are inherent in Inyo County. A shortage of available land due to extensive
public ownership, a relatively high proportion of senior citizens and service industry employed households, an absence of
governmental housing funding capability, obstacles and constraints on the private sector, and a community preference for single
family ownership units all contribute in varying degrees to the existing problem.
The Five‐Year Housing Program below identifies specific programs aimed at these particular housing‐related problems. The
Housing Program encompasses actions considered most likely to be effective in meeting community housing needs. The financial
resources needed to provide ʺadequate housing for all economic segmentsʺ are largely available from state and federal housing
agencies in the form of grants, loans and other forms of assistance. The Bishop‐based IMACA was created for this purpose and
will continue to assume the major responsibility for achievement of the housing objectives contained in this Housing Element.
In addition, the City will continue to maintain corporate and police powers for meeting the City’s housing and economic
development objectives including zoning and assistance with grant applications in conjunction with the specific program
components of the overall Housing Action Program. The City also will support IMACA (and Mammoth Housing) in providing
non‐market rental housing opportunities for low, moderate and special needs households and individual through the
construction of assisted housing, rental assistance, rehabilitation and other direct housing assistance.
This Housing Program as shown in Tables 34 and 35 sets forth a five-year schedule of actions for the City of Bishop to implement
housing policies and achieve identified housing goals. The City will strive to review and adopt feasible policy goals as soon as
possible, and will continue to work diligently to purchase or lease land from the City of Los Angeles.
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                          56

                                                             Table 34
                                CITY OF BISHOP HOUSING PROGRAM GOALS FOR 2014‐2019
                                    OVERALL 5‐YEAR HOUSING PROGRAM GOALS
1.        CITY OF LOS ANGELES LANDS: Continue to work with City of Los Angeles towards purchase, transfer or long-term
lease of vacant City of Los Angeles DWP land to the City of Bishop for residential development, including affordable housing.
Establish a dialogue with the new Los Angeles Mayor and administration to facilitate renewed opportunities for this key housing
element goal. Timeline: Ongoing.
2.        HCD LEASE TERMS: Work with HCD to seek a case-by-case waiver that would allow HCD funding on property
leased for 40 years (which is the maximum allowed by the City of Los Angeles) instead of 55 years (which is the current minimum
period set by HCD) and to seek assistance in resolution of incompatible loan terms wherein federal and state agencies will
consummate a grant only after the other agency makes the first loan commitment. Seek HCD assistance in establishing program
terms that allow the City of Los Angeles and the City of Bishop to share affordable housing credits in cases where LADWP lands
are sold or leased through the aegis of the City of Bishop for the purpose of providing affordable housing opportunities.
Timeline: Ongoing.
3.        GRANT FUNDING: Maximize value of 2013 CDBG funds for rehab of Valley Apartments and for updating the
Economic Development Element, and continue to pursue all applicable grant and funding opportunities to assist in the further
development of affordable housing and employment opportunities for current and future Bishop residents. Timeline: Grant
monies to be expended within 3 years; grant review process to be annual and ongoing with goal of submitting at least one
application during the planning period.
4.        UPDATES TO THE GENERAL PLAN LAND USE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENTS. The City is
currently in the very early stages of a process that will eventually update the General Plan Land Use Element and Economic
Development Element. It is anticipated that the updated Land Use and Economic Development Elements will explore the value
and feasibility of establishing an expanded range of residential designations compatible with mixed land uses, similar to the
range of land uses currently permitted in the downtown overlay zone. Timeline: General Plan updates to be completed within 3
years (contingent on funding availability).
5.        WARREN STREET IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. In tandem with the General Plan updates above, the City will
consider whether the Warren Street Improvement Project may be expanded to support and extend the uses (particularly
residential uses) of the downtown mixed use overlay zone. Timeline: Expanded uses within the Warren Street Improvement
project area will be considered as part of the General Plan update process, over a period of 3 years (contingent on funding
availability).
6.        MUNICIPAL CODE UPDATE: Toward completion of the General Plan updates above, the City will evaluate an update
to the Bishop Municipal Code to incorporate (as appropriate) the land use planning modifications developed through the General
Plan process. As part of this update, the City will also consider ways in which the zoning regulations can be modified to
encourage higher density housing to support goals of the land use and economic development strategies. Timeline: Municipal
Code update to be completed within 4 years, following the General Plan updates (contingent on funding availability).
7.        PERSONS WITH DIABILITIES: Continue working with IMACA to strengthen programs that inform families in the
City of Bishop about housing and services available for persons with developmental disabilities. Timeline: General Plan updates
to be completed within 3 years (contingent on funding availability).
8.        DENSITY BONUSES: Continue to offer density bonuses to developers who construct infill projects as a means to
optimize the availability of housing (despite significant limitations on available land) and facilitate the set-aside of
affordable/senior/disabled housing units. Timeline: Ongoing.
9.        MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENT OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (MPROP): Facilitate this program by advertising its
availability to mobile home park residents and by serving as co‐applicant for resident organizations applying to HCD for funding
in support of MPROP objectives. Timeline: Ongoing.
10.       MONITOR HOUSING STOCK: Continue to maintain an inventory of trailer parks, mobile home parks and apartments
provide housing for disadvantaged populations, and monitor this housing stock to ensure that it remains affordable for low
income and disadvantaged residents. Timeline: Ongoing.
11.       AFFORDABLE HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM: Continue to (a) support IMACA and Mammoth Housing
Authority in identifying grant opportunities and in preparing grant applications for low- and extremely low-income housing
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                                      57

projects, (b) provide priority processing and a waiver or deferral of building and remodel permit fees for projects that provide
affordable housing assistance to assist extremely-low, very low, low and moderate income households, and (c) maintain outreach
to developers to incentivize the development of housing for households earning 30% or less of Inyo County median family
income. Timeline: Ongoing; grant review process to be annual and ongoing with goal of assisting IMACA and Mammoth
Housing in the submittal of at least two applications during the planning period.

       17.82 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION TO TITLE 17 OF THE BISHOP MUNICIPAL
       CODE PROVIDING A PROCEDURE FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IN THE
       CITY’S LAND USE AND ZONING AND BUILDING REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO FAIR
       HOUSING LAWS
         THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF BISHOP, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, DOES ORDAIN AS
FOLLOWS:
         SECTION 1. Title 17 of the Bishop Municipal Code entitled ZONING be, and is hereby amended,
by adding Section 17.82 Reasonable Accommodation to read as follows:
                                                 “Chapter 17.82
                                    REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS
Sections:
17.82.010        Purpose.
17.82.020        Findings.
17.82.030        Applicability.
17.82.040        Notice to the public of availability of accommodation process.
17.82.050        Requesting reasonable accommodation.

17.82.070        Required findings.
17.82.080        Written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation.
17.82.090        Appeals
     17.82.010 Purpose. It is the policy of the jurisdiction, pursuant to the federal Fair Housing
Amendments Act of 1988 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (hereafter “fair housing
laws”), to provide individuals with disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices and
procedures to ensure equal access to housing and facilitate the development of housing for individuals
with disabilities. This ordinance establishes a procedure for making requests for reasonable
accommodation in land use, zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures of the
jurisdiction to comply fully with the intent and purpose of fair housing laws.
         17.82.020 Findings.    The City Council of the jurisdiction finds:     The federal Fair Housing
Amendments Act of 1988 and California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                 67

on local governments to make reasonable accommodation in their land use and zoning regulations and
practices when such accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with disabilities an equal
opportunity to housing;
             A. The Housing Element of the jurisdiction must identify and develop a plan for removing
governmental constraints to housing for individuals with disabilities including local land use and zoning
constraints or providing reasonable accommodation;
             B. The Attorney General of the State of California has recommended that cities and counties
implement fair housing reasonable accommodation procedures for making land use and zoning
determinations concerning individuals with disabilities to further the development of housing for
individuals with disabilities;
             C. A fair housing reasonable accommodation procedure for individuals with disabilities and
developers of housing for individuals with disabilities to seek relief in the application of land use, zoning
and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures will further the jurisdiction’s compliance with
federal and state fair housing laws and provide greater opportunities for the development of critically
needed housing for individuals with disabilities.
        17.82.030 Applicability.
             A.   Reasonable accommodation in the land use and zoning context means providing
individuals with disabilities or developers of housing for people with disabilities, flexibility in the
application of land use and zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures, or even
waiving certain requirements, when it is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.
             B. An individual with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that
limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone
with a record of such impairment.
             C. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability,
his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the
application of a land use, zoning or building regulation, policy, practice or procedure acts as a barrier to
fair housing opportunities.
        17.82.040 Notice to the public of availability of accommodation process. Notice of the availability
of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently displayed at public information counters in the
planning and public works departments, advising the public of the availability of the procedure for
eligible individuals. Forms for requesting reasonable accommodation shall be available to the public in
2014 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE                                                                                   68

the Planning and Building and Safety departments.
        17.82.050 Requesting reasonable accommodation.
             A. In order to make housing available to an individual with a disability, any eligible person as
defined in Sec. 3 may request a reasonable accommodation in land use, zoning and building regulations,
policies, practices and procedures.
             B. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be in writing and provide the following
information:
                 (1) Name and address of the individual(s) requesting reasonable accommodation;
                 (2) Name and address of the property owner(s);
                 (3) Address of the property for which accommodation is requested;
                 (4) Description of the requested accommodation and the regulation(s), policy or
                procedure for which accommodation is sought; and
                 (5) Reason that the requested accommodation may be necessary for the individual(s) with
                the disability to use and enjoy the dwelling.
             C. Any information identified by an applicant as confidential shall be retained in a manner so
as to respect the privacy rights of the applicant and shall not be made available for public inspection.
             D. A request for reasonable accommodation in regulations, policies, practices and procedures
may be filed at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. A
reasonable accommodation does not affect an individual’s obligations to comply with other applicable
regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation.
             E. If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the
jurisdiction will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible.
        17.82.060 Reviewing Authority.
             A. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the “reviewing authority,”
using the criteria set forth in 17.82.070.
             B.   The reviewing authority shall issue a written decision on a request for reasonable
accommodation within thirty (30) days of the date of the application and may either grant, grant with

modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with the required findings
set forth in 17.82.070.
             C. If necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the
reviewing authority may request further information from the applicant consistent with fair housing laws,
specifying in detail the information that is required. In the event that a request for additional information
is made, the thirty (30) day period to issue a decision is stayed until the applicant responds to the request.
             D. For purposes of this ordinance ‘reviewing authority’ means the Director of Public Works,
or his/her designee.

request for reasonable accommodation shall be consistent with fair housing laws and based on the

will be used by an individual with disabilities protected under fair housing laws;
             B.   Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an
individual with disabilities protected under the fair housing laws;
             C. Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative
burden on the jurisdiction and;
             D. Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the
nature of the jurisdiction’s land use and zoning or building program.
        17.82.080 Written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation.
             A. The written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation shall explain in detail
the basis of the decision, including the reviewing authority’s findings on the criteria set forth in 17.82.070.
All written decisions shall give notice of the applicant’s right to appeal and to request reasonable
accommodation in the appeals process as set forth below. The notice of decision shall be sent to the
applicant by certified mail.
             B. The written decision of the reviewing authority shall be final unless an applicant appeals it
to the jurisdiction’s planning commission.
             C. If the reviewing authority fails to render a written decision on the request for reasonable
accommodation within the thirty (30) day time period allotted by 17.82.060, the request shall be deemed
granted.
             D. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations

or federal remedy available.

INTRODUCTION
           The Mobility Element (ME) of the General Plan (GP) sets out
the desired goals and strategies for enhancing mobility in and near the
City. It is closely coordinated with the Land Use, Housing, Noise, and
Public Facilities Elements of the GP in recognition of the
interrelationships between them. The ME includes all travel modes,
addressing mobility in the context of driving, cycling, walking, and       The city of Bishop has . . .
accessibility to transit and air services. Along with the other elements
of the GP, it focuses on the economic stability and vitality of the City,
while providing for safe and efficient means of travel within the City     A scenic environment
and adjacent areas.
           California Government Code Section 65302(b) mandates City
and County agencies to include within their General Plans a ME, which
describes and locates the basic systems that provide for the
transportation needs of the community, including local and regional
traffic. Previously referred to as the “Circulation Element” of the        Nearby recreation activities
General Plan, the ME as presented here satisfies that mandate.
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
           The purpose of the ME is to define how the City will serve the
mobility needs of residents, businesses, and visitors while protecting its Diverse shopping
environmental, economic, and natural resources. The goals and              opportunities
policies of the ME are statements of intent with respect to enhancing
Citywide mobility and the implementing actions define how those
goals and policies can be achieved.
           In accordance with State General Plan guidelines, the ME
includes goals and policies that will:
                                                                           Entertainment
               Coordinate transportation systems with planned land uses
               Promote the safe and efficient transport of goods and the
                safe and effective movement of all populations
               Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities
               Protect environmental quality and promote the wise and
                equitable use of economic and natural resources

           The City of Bishop ME embraces these guidelines and
addresses the City’s mobility needs in the context of the following
topics:
               Roadways
               Public Transportation                                      The Mobility Element

               Pedestrians
               Parking and Access
           The ME shows and describes the general location and nature of
street and bicycle facilities. Public transportation, air transportation
and pedestrian and parking facilities are also discussed. Goals and
policies related to each of these transportation modes are presented,      Cycling
establishing a framework for achieving enhanced mobility for the
community.
MOBILITY ELEMENT TRANSPORTATION REPORT
           The Mobility Element Transportation Report (TR) provides        Public Transportation
technical information in support of the ME. It is a separate document
the presents current data and addresses a variety of related topics,
providing technical information in support of the ME. Information in
the TR will be the subject of regular updates, and includes the
following:
               Existing Conditions – As these change over time, the TR    Walking
                will be updated to show current data on traffic volumes,
                levels of service, etc.
               Related Actions/Studies – These include changes that
                occur over time (in some cases implementing a specific
                feature of the ME), studies that have relevance to the ME,
                and regional changes influencing the City’s transportation as well as air
                system.                                                    transportation, parking
               Future Conditions – As new information is obtained and/or  and access
                special studies are carried out, traffic forecast data and
                related information in the TR will be updated.

               Implementing Actions – Recommendations regarding
                implementation projects, special studies, and other actions
                together with a list of proposed projects are presented in
                the TR.
           The intent is that as information becomes available and
conditions change, the TR will document that information without a
need to formally update the ME. The TR is an administrative
document that may include recommendations requiring City Council
approval for implementation but which does not require formal
approval itself.
ROADWAY COMPONENT
           The roadway component of the ME describes the City’s arterial
street system used for vehicular travel in the City. The street system is
planned to meet existing and future transportation demands, and
provide for safe and efficient vehicular travel within the City. This is
accomplished by designing traffic routes according to their functions,
while maintaining sensitivity to surrounding land uses and resources.
The effectiveness of the street system directly influences mobility and      The Mobility Element seeks
the overall vitality of the City, and its visual appearance contributes to   to enhance the drivability of
the image of the City held by residents, businesses, and visitors.           the City’s roadway system.
           Roadways have two basic classifications, state highways and
local streets. The City is served by three State Highways, Highway
395, Highway 168, and Highway 6. These are planned, constructed,
and operated by the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans), and the City has no jurisdiction over these streets. The
arterial streets under City jurisdiction serve both local and regional
traffic in varying capacities.
           Streets under City jurisdiction are referred to as Local Streets.
They differ in their physical characteristics according to function and
adjacent zoning. Essentially there are four variations:
           1.   Local Residential Streets
           2.   Local Commercial Streets

of a local street and can transition to a Residential Street or
Commercial Street when conditions change and the need arises.
           4. Alleys - In addition to local streets, the City has numerous
alleys in both residential and commercial areas. These are City owned
and maintained, and have an important function with respect to
providing accessibility for adjacent land uses. Their functions include
access to parking (e.g., residential garages), access to loading and
unloading areas for local businesses, and access to utilities and other
services. They are encouraged in new developments where they can
provide additional access and locations for utilities, and create
separation between properties.
           Figure 2 shows the street designations for the Roadway
Component of the ME. Selected future roadways on the ME are
referred to as Opportunity Corridors. These are routes that are of
strategic importance as far as connectivity is concerned, but because of
right-of-way and other constraints, cannot simply be considered as
future roadways. The intent is for these routes to be pursued as new

Wye Road Opportunity Area                                                    Accessibility
           The triangle defined by Highway 395, North Main Street /
Highway 6 and Wye Road has traffic issues related to the intersections
created by this triangle. Also, the proximity of the Kmart / Vons
shopping center driveway presents significant operational issues in the
area. Because three of the intersection legs are State Highways, and
land under the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP)               Walkability
ownership and other private ownership would be affected, a
coordinated approach to land use and traffic will be required to identify
a comprehensive solution for this area. Land use and transportation
demands may make a wider than standard cross section appropriate for
Wye Road.

Park Street Opportunity Area
           The traffic signal at Park Street is a four-way configuration
with Park Street on the east side and access to a commercial property
on the west side. Operational issues sometimes occur with vehicles
queuing to enter the commercial property and traffic can be heavy in
and out of the park during special events. Parking opportunities on the
east side of Main Street in the City Park and land use changes could
create a focal point for tourists and residents. Hence, this intersection
and the adjoining land uses provide an opportunity for enhancements
that can benefit residents, visitors, and local businesses, thereby helping
promote the overall goals of the ME. Potential beneficial enhancements
to this area could include the relocation of the Park Street intersection
slightly northward and the construction of new street providing
connections to the west (this is shown as an opportunity corridor in the
street map).
Grove-Pine Opportunity Area
           East-west access between West and East Pine Street or between
Grove Street and Pine Street is constrained by the offset intersections.
Only Grove Street is signalized, and the offset tends to discourage this
location as a means of providing east-west relief to the Line Street
intersection to the south. While a direct connection between Grove
Street and East Pine Street would be the preferred connection, there are
land use constraints involved in creating a single intersection. Ideally,
any such change would be accompanied by land use changes that could
enhance the adjacent commercial areas. The TR discusses potential
strategies that could be included in a study of this area.

Pedestrians
           The City provides an attractive walking environment, with
many open space areas and scenic vistas. The goals and policies seek
to ensure that the mobility impaired including those confined to
wheelchairs can share in that walking environment. For residential and
commercial streets that include sidewalks, this environment is largely
provided through paved sidewalks and associated facilities. While
pedestrian facilities are not designated on the ME, the goals and
policies include a directive to actively facilitate and enhance walking
opportunities for residents and visitors. Sidewalks and walkways
should be provided in all developed areas and in areas with pedestrian
demand. Creating walking tours, with maps and information to
encourage such activities, is an example of actions that could assist in
achieving such goals.
