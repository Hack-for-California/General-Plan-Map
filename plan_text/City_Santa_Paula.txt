City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                             I. Introduction
I.      INTRODUCTION
A.      Purpose of the Housing Element
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability
of housing. Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive,
long-term General Plan for the physical development of the city or county. The Housing
Element is one of the seven mandated elements of the General Plan. Housing Element
law, first enacted in 1969, mandates that local governments adequately plan to meet
the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community.
The law recognizes that, in order for the private market to adequately address housing
needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory
systems that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing develop-
ment. As a result, housing policy in California rests largely upon the effective implementa-
tion of local General Plans and, in particular, local Housing Elements. Housing Element
law also requires the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
to review local housing elements for compliance with state law and to report its written
findings to the local government.
Santa Paula’s Housing Element provides policies and programs to address the following
important housing issues as well as other identified local needs.
           Preservation and improvement of its aging housing stock;
           A relatively high level of household overcrowding and housing overpayment;
           A limited supply of large rental units;
           Provision of adequate housing for farm workers;
           The need to promote homeownership opportunities; and
           The desire to achieve a more economically balanced community.
As mandated by state law, the planning period for this Housing Element extends from
2008 to 2014. This Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on: 1) conserving
and improving existing affordable housing; 2) providing adequate housing sites;
3) assisting in the development of affordable housing; 4) removing governmental and
other constraints to the housing development; and 5) promoting equal housing
opportunities.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
           An analysis of the city’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
            (Chapter II);
           An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to
            address the City’s housing goals (Chapter III); and
           A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental,
            to meeting Santa Paula’s identified housing needs (Chapter IV);
                                               1                                    April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                             I. Introduction
           The Housing Action Plan for addressing the City’s identified housing needs,
            including housing goals, policies and programs (Chapter V).
B.      Community Context
Incorporated in 1902, the City of Santa Paula is in the geographical center of Ventura
County, and is located in the rich agricultural Santa Clara Valley (see Figure I-1).
Surrounded by orange, lemon and avocado groves, Santa Paula is commonly referred
to as the “Citrus Capital of the World.” The City is a major distribution point for citrus fruits
in the United States and is also well-known for its avocado producing and processing.
Compared to most other cities in the County, Santa Paula has been a relatively stable
community, experiencing modest population growth over the past 30 years. As of 2007,
the City had an estimated population of 29,182 residents.
Demographic shifts are taking place in the city impacting housing needs. First, Santa
Paula has a growing Hispanic population. In 1990, 59% of the city’s population was of
Hispanic origin, and by 2000 this figure had increased to 71%. Second, the city is home to
an increasing number of younger families, as evidenced by the growth in both the young
to mid-adult (age 25 to 44) and school age (5 to 19) populations between 1980 and
2000. The provision of adequate affordable housing, including larger rental units and first-
time homeownership opportunities for younger growing families, is thus an important issue
facing Santa Paula.
Santa Paula is a predominantly lower- and moderate-income community. The 2000
Census reported that half of the city’s households had annual incomes of less than 70%
of the County median income. The City also has the lowest median household income
among all Ventura County cities. Santa Paula desires to be a more economically and
socially balanced community. To achieve this goal, additional “executive-style” or
higher-end housing opportunities are necessary to attract working professionals and
upper-income households to the community.
Santa Paula currently has a housing stock totaling approximately 8,500 units. Of these,
68% are single-family houses or condos, 22% are multi-family units, and 9% are mobile
homes and trailers. Because a significant amount of its residential growth occurred prior
to 1970, over half of the housing stock in Santa Paula is over 30 years old, the age when
most homes begin to require major repairs. Recognizing this as a significant housing
concern, the City will continue to promote neighborhood upgrading through a
combined approach of code enforcement and provision of home rehabilitation
assistance. Continuation and expansion of these programs is necessary as a growing
share of the housing stock requires improvement or rehabilitation.
Housing costs in Santa Paula are relatively affordable in comparison to most Ventura
County cities. Even so, the median sales price of a resale single-family home in 2007 was
about $540,000 – well beyond the reach of low-income families. Rent for a typical two-
bedroom apartment unit ranges from $1,100 to $1,250 per month, which is more
affordable. However, many households in Santa Paula are overpaying and many
“double up” with other families to afford rents, which in turn contributes to overcrowding.

C.      Public Participation
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Santa Paula,
and this update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested
parties numerous opportunities for involvement. Appendix C contains a summary of
these opportunities as well as a list of persons and organizations that were notified during
the Housing Element update process.
D.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
State law requires that all portions of the General Plan be internally consistent. The City of
Santa Paula General Plan consists of seven elements: 1) Land Use; 2) Circulation;
3) Housing; 4) Open Space; 5) Conservation; 6) Noise; and 7) Safety. This Housing Element
builds upon the other elements and is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth
by the General Plan. Examples of inter-element consistency include: residential
development capacities established in the Land Use Element are incorporated within the
Housing Element, and the discussion of infrastructure and public services in the Housing
Element is based upon information from the Land Use and Safety elements. As the
General Plan is amended through time, the City will review the Housing Element for
internal consistency, and make any necessary revisions.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water
and sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these
agencies immediately upon adoption.

II.     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Incorporated in 1902, the City of Santa Paula is the geographical center of Ventura
County, and is located in the rich agricultural Santa Clara Valley. Surrounded by orange,
lemon and avocado groves, Santa Paula is commonly referred to as the “Citrus Capital
of the World.” The city is a major distribution point for citrus fruits in the United States and is
also well-known for its avocado producing and processing. Compared to most other
cities in Ventura County, Santa Paula has been a relatively stable community,
experiencing modest population growth over the past 30 years. As of 2007, the city has a
population of 29,182 residents.
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends,
such as age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size,
household income, and special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g.,
number of units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally,
the city’s projected housing growth needs based on the 2007 Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the 2000 U.S. Census,
California Department of Finance (DOF), California Employment Development Depart-
ment (EDD), Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and other relevant
sources. Supplemental data was obtained through field surveys and from private
vendors. In addition, Ventura County’s Consolidated Plan provides useful information for
this update of the Housing Element. The implications of these findings for the city’s
housing policies and programs are also discussed.
A.      Population Characteristics
        1.     Population Growth Trends
Compared to the decade of the 1990s, Santa Paula’s growth slowed considerably since
2000, going from a 1.4% average annual growth rate to less than 0.5% annual growth
rate from 2000 to 2007 (see Table II-1 and Figure II-1). The current population growth rate
is substantially less than Ventura County as a whole. The California Department of
Finance estimates that the population of Santa Paula as of January 1, 2007 was 29,182,
representing 3.5% of Ventura County’s total population of 825,512.

        2.      Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family types, income levels, and
housing preference. Table II-2 provides a comparison of the city’s and county’s
population by age group in 2000. This table shows that the age distribution of the city’s
population is, overall, younger than Ventura County as a whole (median age of 29.6 vs.
34.2 for the county). The under age 18 cohort increased from 33% to 42% of the city’s
population from 1990 to 2000. However, the percentage of the population 65 years and
over is slightly higher for Santa Paula than the county average.

        3.     Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the Santa Paula differs from Ventura County in that
a higher proportion of city residents are Hispanic/Latino. Approximately 72% of city
residents are Hispanic/Latino, contrasted with 33.4% for the County (Table II-3). The city's
proportion of non-Hispanic minority racial population (2.4%) is less than Ventura County’s
(9.8%).

B.      Household Characteristics
        1.       Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for the city and Ventura County
as a whole, as reported in the 2000 Census. Family households comprised approximately
79% of all households in the city, approximately 4% higher than the county. The city’s
average household size is higher than Ventura County as a whole (3.49 persons per
household in the city vs. 3.06 persons per household in the county). These statistics
suggest that there is a somewhat greater need for large units in Santa Paula than for
some other areas of Ventura County.

        2.       Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities need an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in
order to accommodate a range of households with varying incomes, family sizes and
composition, and lifestyles. Table II-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-
occupied and renter-occupied units in the city in 2000 as compared to the county as a
whole. It reveals a lower level of homeownership in the city, approximately 10
percentage points lower than the county.

        3.     Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room. Overcrowded households are
usually a reflection of the lack of affordable housing. Table II-6 indicates that
overcrowding in the City of Santa Paula is substantially more prevalent than for Ventura
County as a whole.

               Source: 2000 Census, Table H20
Overcrowding is an increasing problem in both the city and county as a whole.
According to the 1990 census, overcrowding in the city averaged only 3% to 4% of all
households, and only 2% to 3% of all county households. Within 10 years, rates of
overcrowding have increased greatly, particularly for renter households.

        4.      Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community – the
ability of residents to afford housing is directly related to household income. According to
the 2000 Census, the median household income in Santa Paula was $41,651, the lowest
household income of incorporated cities in Ventura County (Table II-7).

        5.      Overpayment
According to State housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table II-8 displays estimates for overpayment in 1999 by lower-
income households. According to SCAG, 33% of all lower-income renter households and
36% of all lower-income owner households were overpaying for housing. While extremely-
low-income owners suffer the greatest cost burden, at least 34% of all categories of
lower-income households, both renters and owners, were found to be overpaying for
housing.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to
defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For
lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up resulting in
overcrowding and related problems.
The relatively high cost of housing in Santa Paula is the primary cause of overpayment for
lower-income households. Several programs in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V)
designed to address housing affordability will also help to alleviate overpayment. These
programs include the owner-occupied housing rehabilitation program, rental housing

stabilization program, mobile home park resident ownership program, downpayment

Authority), mortgage credit certificate program, workforce and senior housing
development program, multi-family housing acquisition and rehabilitation program, and
the inclusionary housing program.
Extremely Low Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely low-income (ELI) households. Extremely low income is defined as households
with income less than 30% of area median income. The 2007 area median income for
Ventura County was $79,500 (see Table II-19). For extremely-low-income households, this
results in an income of $25,700 or less for a four-person household. Households with
extremely-low-income have a variety of housing needs.
Existing Needs
In 2000, approximately 1,590 extremely-low-income households resided in Santa Paula,
representing 19.5% of the total households. Over 80% of extremely-low-income
households faced housing problems (defined as cost burden greater than 30% of income
and/or overcrowding and/or without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities).1
Additionally, 58% of extremely low-income households paid more than 50 percent of their
income toward housing costs, compared to 15% of all Santa Paula households.
Projected Needs
The projected housing need for extremely-low-income households is assumed to be 50%
of the very low income regional housing need of 453 units. As a result, the City has a
projected need for 227 extremely-low-income units. The resources and programs to
address this need are the same as for low-income housing in general and are discussed
throughout the Housing Element, including the Chapter V, Housing Action Plan. Because
the needs of extremely-low-income households overlap extensively with other special
needs groups, further analysis and resources for extremely-low-income households can
be found in Chapter II, Needs Assessment, Section E, Special Needs, and Chapter IV,
Constraints, Section A.g. Special Needs Housing.

C.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
        1.      Current Employment
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing
needs during this planning period. Table II-9 shows that the city had a workforce of 12,221
persons, or 59% of the working-age population, as reported by Census 2000. This table
shows that a somewhat smaller proportion of the city’s population is in the labor force as
compared to the county. About 1.6% of city residents worked at home, less than one-half
the county’s proportion of home-based employment.

In 2000, the largest occupation sector for city residents was sales and office-related
occupations, constituting almost 28% of the city’s working residents (Table II-10). A
                                                                     12                                                April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                         II. Housing Needs Assessment
substantial proportion of the city’s working residents were employed in service or blue
collar occupations that are commonly paid mid- to low-level wages (e.g., waiters,
waitresses and beauticians, machine operators, assemblers, farming, transportation,
handlers and laborers). Collectively, these occupations constituted 54% of the workforce.
About one-tenth of the workforce was employed in agricultural-related occupations
(farming, fishing and forestry).

As of 2005, the four largest employment sectors within Ventura County were
manufacturing (40,929 employees), retail trade (38,702 employees), health care & social
services (27,480 employees), and accommodation & food services (25,815 employees)2.
          2.      Projected Job Growth
Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during
this planning period. Table II-11 shows projected job growth by occupation for the
Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura MSA (Ventura County) along with median hourly wages
for the period 2004-2014. Total employment in Ventura County is expected to grow by
12% between 2004 and 2014. The overall growth is expected to add 39,900 new jobs and
bring the employment of Ventura County to almost 371,000 by 2014.
Generally, residents that are employed in well-paying occupations have less difficulty
obtaining adequate housing than residents in low paying occupations. Table II-11
illustrates the growth trend in low-wage service jobs such as health care support, food
preparation and serving, cleaning and maintenance, sales, and office/administrative
support.

            3.        Jobs-Housing Balance
A regional balance of jobs to housing helps to ensure that the demand for housing is
reasonably related to supply. When the number of jobs significantly exceeds the housing
supply, the rental and for-sale housing markets may become overheated, requiring
households to pay a larger percentage of their income for housing. In addition, a tight
housing market can result in overcrowding and longer commute times as workers seek
more affordable housing in outlying areas. The current jobs-housing objective within the
SCAG region is one new housing unit for every 1.5 jobs.3

The largest employment sector within Santa Paula is health care and social assistance
(791 employees), followed by retail trade (655 employees). With 5,196 jobs and 8,365
housing units, there were only 0.62 jobs per housing unit in the city as of 2002. The city’s
jobs/housing ratio is less balanced than Ventura County as a whole, which had ratio of
0.78 jobs per housing unit in 2002 (Table II-13).

D.      Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile
home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for
occupancy as separate living quarters.
        1.         Housing Type and Growth Trends
As of 2000, the housing stock in Santa Paula was comprised mostly of single-family
detached homes, which made up 60% of all units, while multi-family units comprised
about 22% of the total. About 9% of units were single-family attached (condo) units, while
mobile homes comprised the remaining 9%. Table II-14 provides a breakdown of the
housing stock by type along with growth trends for the city compared to the county as a
whole for the period 2000-2007.

Between 2000 and 2007, single-family detached homes represented 42% of all units built
in the city. While detached homes comprised the largest proportion of new construction
in both the city and county during this period, approximately 30% of all residential
development in the city was comprised of multi-family units, and nearly 60% consisted of
higher-density attached housing, either condos or apartments.

        2.     Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed, may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by lead-based paint
coated windows and doors opening and closing.
Table II-15 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Santa Paula compared to
Ventura County as a whole as reported in the 2000 Census.

This table shows that the majority of owner-occupied and rented units in Santa Paula
were constructed prior to 1970. These findings suggest that there may be strong need for
maintenance and rehabilitation, including remediation of lead-based paint, for a large
proportion of the City’s housing stock.
Table II-16 identifies the number or owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units
lacking complete kitchen or plumbing facilities in the city and the county as a whole. This
table shows that less than 1% of owner-occupied units and 2% of renter occupied units
lacked complete plumbing or kitchen facilities. The lack of complete kitchen or

According to a citywide survey conducted by City staff in 2007, it was determined that
single-family home neighborhoods in Santa Paula are generally well-maintained and
contain only isolated properties in deteriorated condition that require moderate
rehabilitation. However, the survey also confirmed that the housing stock of the city’s
denser, older residential neighborhoods to the south and east of downtown are in need
of varying degrees of upgrading, and some units are likely to qualify for rehabilitation
assistance. Of the 5,517 residential structures surveyed, 36% (or 2,009 structures) were
observed to have one or more substandard building conditions as defined by the
Uniform Housing Code (Table II-17). Of four categories of code violation:
           14% were nuisance and sanitation violations,
           49% were faulty weather protection violations,
           6% were structural hazards; and
           31% were substandard/ hazard violations.

                           exceeds the number of units with problems.
With a total housing stock of 8,478 units in 2007, applying the factor of 36% from the
survey results in an estimate of approximately 3,052 units that may be in need of some
type of repair to correct deficiencies.
The City currently administers four programs to facilitate upgrade of the housing stock
and stabilization of neighborhoods, including Code Enforcement, owner and renter
rehabilitation programs, and the Remove and Replace Program.
        3.     Vacancy
Housing vacancy rates as reported in the 2000 Census are shown in Table II-18. The table
shows that vacancy rates in the city were relatively low, with just 2.5% of rental units and
2.2% of for-sale units available for rent or sale, respectively. The rental vacancy rate for
the county as a whole was approximately the same as the city, while the vacancy rate
of for-sale housing was less than the City at 0.9%. Rental vacancy rates in the 2% range
indicate nearly full occupancy, and contribute to upward pressures on rents.

        4.      Housing Cost
a.      Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., county) median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-
low (31-50% of AMI), low (51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above
moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing affordability is based on the relationship between
household income and housing expenses. According to HUD and the California
Department of Housing and Community Development4, housing is considered
“affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than 30% of a household’s gross income.
In some areas (such as Ventura County), these income limits may be increased to adjust
for high housing costs.
Table II-19 shows current (2009) affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase
prices for housing in Ventura County by income category. Based on state-adopted
standards, the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is
$656, while the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $1,094. The
maximum affordable rent for low-income households is $1,750, while the maximum for
moderate-income households is $2,583.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the

b.      For-Sale Housing
Housing sales price statistics for the period January 2006 through August 2007 (Table II-20)
show that the vast majority of new homes and resale condominiums homes sold for
under $500,000 during this period. However, only 27% of single-family resale homes sold
for under $500,000.
The median new home sales price was about $466,500 (SFD and condo combined),
while the median price for resale single-family detached homes was $542,000. For resale
condos, the median price was $326,000. Based on the estimated affordable purchase
prices shown in Table II-19, less than one-half of for-sale units (condominiums only) were
affordable to low- or moderate-income residents. These data illustrate the fact that
public subsidies are generally required to reduce sales prices to a level that is affordable
to low- and moderate-income buyers. At a median price of $326,000 for condominiums,
there is a “gap” of over $26,000 between the market price and the maximum price a
moderate-income household can afford to pay for a home. For low-income households,
this gap is over $111,000. (Note: as a result of the severe downturn in the real estate
market since late 2007, the affordability of for-sale housing has improved significantly
since these sales statistics were compiled).

provide a basis for the land inventory assumptions in Chapter III and Appendix B. Two
units that were completed in 2006 were resold in 2009 for prices ranging from $179,000 to
$250,000, which fall within the Low-income category (see Table II-21).

Table II-22and Table II-23 show rental market data for apartments or condos in Santa
Paula based on a 2007 survey of listings. The average rent advertised for all units in Santa
Paula was about $1,250 per month, with a range of $700 for a 1-bedroom apartment to
$1,650 for a 3-bedroom unit. This survey shows that rents in Santa Paula are significantly

lower than the average of $1,5425 for Ventura County as a whole. A more recent
targeted survey of recently-built units was conducted in March 2009 (see Appendix A,
Tables A-5i and A-5j)
When market rents are compared to the amounts lower-income households can afford
to pay (Table II-19), it is clear that extremely-low and very-low-income households have a
difficult time finding rental housing without overpaying. However, market rents generally
fall into the low-income category (Table II-23). The average 2-bedroom apartment rent
was found to be $1,155 while the average for 3-bedroom units was $1,505 compared to
the affordable range of $1,075 to $1,750 for low-income households. These affordability
conclusions are supported by the updated 2009 survey, which found that all recently-

E.      Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Santa
Paula residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or
other housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing
needs facing each of these groups.
                                                                   24                                  April 16, 2012

        1.       Persons with Disabilities
In 2000, approximately 2,799 people between the 16 and 64 years of age, or 16% of the
working age population, reported a work-related disability (see Table II-24). Of those
aged 65 and over, 2,710 had some form of disability. Included within these disabilities are
persons whose disability hinders their ability to go outside the home (10% of the working
age population and 20.3% of the senior population). Housing opportunities for the
handicapped can be expanded through housing assistance programs and providing
universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered countertops, single-
level units and ground floor units. Program 21 in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V)
addresses these needs by committing the City to processing a Municipal Code
amendment that would establish procedures to ensure reasonable accommodations for
persons with disabilities pursuant to Government Code Sec. 65008 and 65583 (SB 520).

In 2000, there were 1,865 households in Santa Paula where the householder was 65 or
older (Table II-25). Of these, 264 persons were below the poverty level in 19996. Many
elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes and many have disabilities. Elderly
homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone.
The housing needs of this group can be partially addressed through smaller units, second

The City encourages affordable and accessible housing options for seniors through a
variety of programs described in the Housing Action Plan, including the Santa Paula
Housing Authority’s Section 8 program (Program 5), Mobile Home Park Tenant Protections
(Program 6), Mobile Home Rent Stabilization (Program 7), Workforce and Senior Housing
Development (Program 11), and a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance (Program
21).

         3.     Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. The city's average household size increased
significantly from 1980 to 2000, from 2.96 to 3.22 persons per unit from 1980 to 1990, and
to 3.49 persons per unit by 2000. About 21% of owner households had five or more
members, while about 34% of renters were large households (Table II-26). This distribution
is significantly higher than the county’s percentage of large households (16% owner and
20% renter), and indicates that there is a greater need for large units with four or more
bedrooms in Santa Paula as compared to many other areas of the county. . The City
responds to the needs of large households through participation in the Housing
Authority’s Section 8 program which allows renters to afford larger units and the CDBG
funded Owner-Occupied Housing Rehabilitation (Loan) Program which can be used for
the addition one bedroom and one bathroom.

         4.        Female-Headed Households
Of the 8,157 households in the city, 955, or about 12%, were headed by a female (Table
II-27). While female-headed households represent a relatively small portion of all
households, they often have special challenges of balancing work and childcare
responsibilities. On a percentage basis, over twice as many renter households were
female-headed as compared to owners (18% vs. 7%, respectively). 7. The City responds to
the needs of female-headed households through participation in the CDBG program
and the Housing Authority’s Section 8 program. The inclusionary housing program and

          5.     Farm Workers
Unlike most areas of the Southern California metropolitan area, agriculture is still a
significant component of the economy in Ventura County, with a total value of over $1
billion per year8. There is strong public sentiment for retaining agricultural production, as
reflected in the SOAR (Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources) initiatives that have
been approved by voters. Figure II-2 illustrates the wide variety of crops produced in the
county.
According to the Ventura County Workforce Investment Board, over the past two
decades the number of farm workers continued to increase – there were 5,000 more
agricultural jobs in Ventura County in 2003 than there were in 1983. This represents more
than 30% growth in an industry that is stagnant in the value of its output. As a result, while
agriculture has become a less significant component of the county’s economy, its
relative importance as a source of jobs has slipped only a little.
In spite of the increase in agriculture sector jobs, wages have shown no tendency to
increase. Quite the opposite has occurred, in fact. The real, inflation-adjusted agricultural
worker’s average salary has fallen in 2000 dollars from $20,503 in 1983 to $19,729 in 2003.
This is counter to the national trend where real agricultural wages grew by 15% between
1993 and 2002. The local trend appears to be for continued erosion of real agricultural
sector salaries9.

Official employment data suggests that there are over 20,000 agricultural workers in
Ventura County. Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail estimates that 17,000 to 24,000
immigrant workers come to the county each year at peak growing seasons. Other
estimates of the Ventura County farm population come from the Migrant Health
Program, housed in the federal Bureau of Primary Health Care, Health Resources and
Services Administration10. In their most recent study (2000), MHP researchers estimated
the number of farm workers in several categories: total number of farm workers, the
number of seasonal farm workers, and the number of migrant farm workers (those who
establish temporary residences in connection with their work), as well as the total number
of people living in farm worker households (Table II-28).

The 2000 Census reported about 11,000 residents of Ventura County who are employed
in agricultural occupations. Of these, 1,291 reported Santa Paula as their place of
residence (12% of the county total). The 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package
(CTPP) also provides data on farmworkers tabulated by job location. The CTPP identified
852 agricultural jobs in Santa Paula, about 6% of the county total (Table II-29). A variety of
factors could explain the difference between Census data and the Bureau of Primary
Health Care estimates, including the difference between job location and residence
location, the undocumented status of some workers, or their living arrangements. Census
data indicated that about 12% of the county’s farm workers live in Santa Paula, whereas
6% of agricultural jobs were located in the city. By comparison, the city’s population is
only 3.7% of the county total.While it is not possible to determine with certainty which of
these sources is most accurate, it is clear that farm worker housing issues have a
significant impact on Santa Paula.
The City responds to the needs of migrant farmworkers by permitting migrant farm labor
camps/housing in the R-4, C/LI and LI zones, subject to a CUP. The City responds to the
needs of permanent and seasonal farmworkers by assisting non-profit developers in
finding sites which qualify for state and federal funding (see Programs 11 and 17).

        6.       Homeless Persons
Homelessness is a continuing national problem that persists within local cities and
communities including Ventura County. During the past two decades, an increasing
number of single persons have remained homeless year after year and have become
the most visible of all homeless persons. Other persons (particularly families) have
experienced shorter periods of homelessness. However, they are often replaced by other
families and individuals in a seemingly endless cycle of homelessness. Within Ventura
County, 6,000 people are at risk of becoming homeless in 2007.11

displaced through evictions, women and children displaced through abusive family life,
persons with substance abuse problems, or persons passing through the city. The most
significant differences between the city’s homeless population and the county’s are that
a greater percentage of the city’s homeless are children and white males.
Although there are myriad causes of homelessness, among the most common causes
are the following:
            Substance Abuse and Alcohol
            The incidence of alcohol and other drug abuse within the Ventura County
            homeless population is estimated to be three times higher than the general
            population (30% vs. 10%).12 This estimate is closely aligned with national survey
            statistics. According to the 2006 Shelter Survey, 54% of the shelter clients
            declared issues of alcoholism and/or drug abuse. The Ventura County Housing
            and Homeless Coalition has identified need for additional treatment facilities
            with supportive housing. They also recommend that a treatment facility be
            established for youth with drug and alcohol addiction.
            The State of California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs licenses
            residential facilities and/or certified alcohol and drug programs in Ventura
            County. There are eleven residential facilities and two residential detoxification
            facilities in the county.
            Domestic Violence
            Ten percent of those surveyed by Ventura County’s 2006 Shelter Survey
            reported that domestic violence let to their becoming homeless.13 The Ventura
            County Housing and Homeless Coalition identifies a need for additional shelters
            for battered women and runaway youth. These individuals also require
            counseling and assistance to become self-sufficient or return to their families.
            Victims of household violence can become homeless as a result of escaping
            abusive living environments. They also suffer physical and psychological
            trauma as a result of the abuse. Many of these persons (almost exclusively
            women) are ill equipped to fend for themselves and their children. Without
            access to low-income housing, reliable transportation and supportive
            counseling they are at a greater disadvantage and create special homeless
            needs. Common issues faced by battered women are lack of jobs, lack of
            child care, lack of affordable housing, underemployment, codependent
            substance abuse, and a need for marketable skills.
            Mental Illness
            According to the Turning Point Foundation, persons who are homeless and
            mentally ill have special needs and are not being served well in traditional
            homeless shelters. Many are at risk in the community, frequently being
            victimized and often suffering from physical and mental illnesses due to lack of

            proper nourishment and shelter. Many of the homeless mentally ill do not avail
            themselves of services or cannot be served by traditional services due to their
            untreated psychiatric symptoms, active substance abuse, histories of abusive
            behaviors.
            The incidence of homelessness for the chronically mentally ill is expected to
            increase in Ventura County due to a shortage of affordable housing and the
            closing of single occupancy hotels and residential care facilities. National
            surveys indicate the mentally ill comprise approximately 20% of the homeless
            population (plus a portion of the 21% of the homeless who are both mentally ill
            and are suffering from drug and/or alcohol abuse). The 2006 Shelter Survey
            found that 30% of the shelter clients stated that they have a mental disability.
            Santa Paula, as part of the Ventura County service area, receives assistance
            with the homeless mentally ill from the Ventura County Behavioral Health
            Department.
Shelter and service needs of the homeless population are significantly different
depending on the population subgroup. The City’s and County’s Continuum of Care
approach to homelessness involves focusing new and existing tools and resources on the
following three sub-populations of homeless persons and those at risk of becoming
homeless14.
            Chronic Homeless Persons
            Chronic homeless persons, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and
            Urban Development (HUD), are individuals who are homeless for one year or
            more, or four times in three years, and have a disability which is often mental
            illness and/or substance abuse. They are often the most visible and the hardest
            to reach of all homeless persons. The Institute for Urban Research and
            Development estimates that about 38% or 500 of the approximately 1,300
            persons who are homeless in the county (excluding the City of Oxnard) on a
            given day are chronically homeless.
            Episodic Homeless Persons
            Episodic homeless persons are individuals or families who are homeless for a
            short period of time – days, weeks, or months – not a year or more. The Institute
            for Urban Research and Development estimates that 90% of persons who are
            homeless in the County on a given day are not homeless one year later.
            Persons At Risk of Becoming Homeless
            Persons at risk of becoming homeless have limited income and often have to
            choose between paying their rent or mortgage and other daily living costs
            which often put them at risk of becoming homeless. According to the U.S.
            Census, in 2000 there were approximately 42,000 households consisting of
            about 130,000 persons (nearly one of every five residents) in Ventura County
            who are members of a household whose annual income was less than $25,000.
            These households are at risk of becoming homeless.

            The Institute for Urban Research and Development estimates that a large
            majority of households at risk of becoming homeless and who eventually
            become homeless do not seek and/or receive resources until the days
            immediately before or after they become homeless. Once a household
            becomes homeless, it generally costs thousands of dollars to help these
            households gain housing once again.
Although there are currently no emergency shelters within the City of Santa Paula, there
are services for the homeless located within the city, and year-round shelters are located
in Ventura and Oxnard. In Santa Paula, there is one 15-bed recovery and sober living
facility (Joshua House) and one permanent supportive housing facility (Harvard Place).15
The Santa Paula Housing Authority also provides public housing assistance; however, the
Authority has 950 persons on their waiting list.16 Senate Bill (SB) 2 of 2007 amended
Government Code Secs. 65582, 65583 and 65589.5 to strengthen the planning
requirements for emergency shelters and transitional housing. Unless adequate capacity
is available to serve the existing emergency shelter need, SB 2 requires that shelters be
allowed “by-right” (i.e., without a conditional use permit or other discretionary approval)
in at least one zoning district. As an alternative, the requirements may be satisfied
through a multi-jurisdictional agreement. In accordance with SB 2, the Housing Action
Plan (Chapter V) includes Program 17 to process an amendment to the Municipal Code
within one year of Housing Element adoption.
F.      Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
This section identifies all residential projects in the city that are under an affordability
covenant, along with those housing projects that are at risk of losing their low-income
affordability restrictions within the ten-year period 2008–2018. This information is used in
establishing quantified objectives for units that can be conserved during this planning
period. The inventory of assisted units includes all units that have been assisted under any
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), state, local and/or other
program.
        1.     Inventory of Assisted Units
Table II-31 provides a list of developments within the City of Santa Paula that participate
in a federal, state or local program that provided some form of assistance, either through
financial subsidy or a control measure.
        2.     Units at Risk
According to SCAG, the California Housing Partnership Corporation, and City data there
are currently no units at risk of converting to market rate during the 2008-2018 time
period.

G.          Future Growth Needs
            1.          Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within
each jurisdiction for the 8½-year period from January 2006 to July 2014. Communities
then determine how they will address this need through the process of updating the
Housing Elements of their General Plans.
The current RHNA was adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) in July 2007. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the
forecasted growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by a
                                                                          34                                                          April 16, 2012

child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for
employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new
households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing
choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost
due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these
factors – household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the
construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four
income categories17 on the basis of the county’s income distribution, with adjustments to
avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.
        2.     2006-2014 Santa Paula Growth Needs
Through a delegation agreement with SCAG, the Ventura County Council of
Governments determined the RHNA growth needs for each of the county’s cities plus the
unincorporated area. The total housing growth need for the City of Santa Paula during
the 2006-2014 planning period is 2,241units. This total is distributed by income category as
shown in Table II-32.

        1.      Regional Growth Needs 2006 - 2014
In accordance with Government Code §65584, projected housing needs for each city
and county in the Southern California region are prepared by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) under a process known as the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA). In accordance with the Delegation Agreement
(“Agreement”) entered into between SCAG and the Ventura County Organization of
Governments (“VCOG”) in 2007, all Housing Element updates must be provided to HCD
by June 30, 2008. The RHNA covers the 8½-year planning period of January 1, 2006 to
June 30, 2014.
The RHNA process began with an update of the population, employment and household
forecasts for both the region as a whole and for each county. These forecasts were
largely derived from California Department of Finance (DOF) population and employ-
ment forecasts and modified by regional demographic and modeling efforts by SCAG.
SCAG then disaggregated the regional and county forecasts to each jurisdiction and
estimated the number of dwelling units needed to achieve a regional target vacancy
rates (2.3% owner-occupied and 5% rental) and to account for projected housing
demolitions. The total housing needed in each jurisdiction was then distributed by
income category (very low, low, moderate and upper income).
All new units built or preserved after January 1, 2006 are credited in the current RHNA
period. Table III-1 shows the net remaining growth need after crediting units built during
2006 and 2007. (A detailed breakdown of these new units by income category is
provided in Appendix B).

        2.      Inventory of Sites for Housing Development
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
“inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
                                                                   37                                          April 16, 2012

having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed analysis of vacant land and
potential redevelopment opportunities is provided in Appendix B. The results of this
analysis are summarized in Table III-2, below. The table shows that the city’s land
inventory, including projects approved and the potential development of vacant and
underutilized parcels, exceeds the net remaining RHNA in the lower- and above-
moderate income categories but there is a small shortfall in the moderate category for
this planning period. However, the surplus of lower-income sites exceeds the moderate-
income shortfall, therefore the intent of the RHNA is satisfied. The Housing Action Plan
(Chapter V) contains Program 16 to facilitate the annexation of properties in the Sphere
of Influence to provide a portion of the sites needed for the planning period. It is
important to note that the RHNA methodology, which was adopted by VCOG and
SCAG and approved by HCD, assumed annexation and development of the Sphere of
Influence during the current planning period.

A discussion of public facilities and infrastructure needed to serve future development is
contained in Section IV.B, Non-Governmental Constraints. There are currently no known
service limitations that would preclude the level of development described in the RHNA,
although developers will be required to pay fees or construct public improvements prior
to or concurrent with development.

programs is available through the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). Santa Paula is a participating jurisdiction under the Ventura Urban County
Entitlement Area for the CDBG program. The CDBG program is very flexible in that the
                                                                 38                                           April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                           III. Resources
funds can be used for a wide range of activities. The eligible activities include, but are
not limited to, acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities
and improvements, relocation, rehabilitation and construction (under certain limitations)
of housing, homeownership assistance, and clearance activities. The City expects to
receive approximately $350,000 in CDBG funds annually, translating to $3 million during
the 8.5-year Housing Element planning period. Approximately one-third of the funds will
be used to fund the housing code enforcement and rehabilitation programs. For
example, during the Fiscal Year 2007-08 funding cycle, the City received a CDBG
allocation of $100,000 for code enforcement activities. The remainder of the funds have
historically been used for public services, such as senior programs, and public
improvement projects in parks and community facilities, but could potentially be
directed in part to support housing activities.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program
was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide an alternate method of funding
low-and moderate-income housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based upon
population, toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The tax credits are
then used to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the Tax Credit
programs include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-
restricted, based upon median income.
Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC) – This program provides a federal tax credit for
income-qualified homebuyers equivalent to 15% of the annual mortgage interest.
Generally, the tax savings are calculated as income to help buyers qualify to purchase a
home. Using an MCC, first-time buyers can save $700 to $2,500 a year on their annual
federal income tax bill. The City contracts with Affordable Housing Applications for
administration of this program.
Other State and Federal Resources - City has also utilized other state and federal funding
sources as appropriate. For example the City was successful in securing $500,000 in State
CalHome grant funds to fund its housing rehabilitation program. Multifamily Housing
Revenue Bonds and mortgage revenue bond financing has also been used by the City
when financing terms and conditions were appropriate. These funding sources are
typically used on a project-by-project basis and are not secure, annual funding sources
such as CDBG and Redevelopment housing set-aside funds. However, they do represent
the City’s commitment to work with non-profit and for profit developers in applying for all
available funding resources that could be used to ensure an affordable housing project.
        2.     Local Resources
Santa Paula Redevelopment Agency - Activated in 1989, the Santa Paula Redevelop-
ment Agency has been involved variety of housing activities, including assisting in the
provision of new affordable housing and providing rehabilitation assistance to improve
existing housing. Through its Housing Preservation Program, the Agency has also
rehabilitated deteriorating single-family homes since 1998. State law requires the
Redevelopment Agency to set-aside no less than 20% of all tax increment revenue
generated from redevelopment projects for affordable housing. The Agency’s 20-
                                              39                                 April 16, 2012

percent set-aside funds must be used for activities that increase, improve, or preserve the
supply of affordable housing in the City. Per the Redevelopment Agency’s Fiscal Year
2007-08 budget, the Agency is anticipated to have $250,000 available in its housing set-
aside fund for housing activities. Approximately one-fourth of this amount is encumbered
as bond debt. Redevelopment set-aside funds have historically been directed in support
of the Remove and Replace Program, and more recently the Housing Preservation
Program. The Housing Element also identifies set-aside funds as a local funding source for
leveraging of outside funds in support of workforce and senior housing development.
Santa Paula Housing Authority – The Santa Paula Housing Authority provides Section 8
rental subsidies to lower income families and seniors. The Housing Authority received
$5,212,152 in Section 8 funds in Fiscal Year 2008-08 to support 577 participant families. The
Section 8 vouchers assist lower-income households by paying the difference between
30% of an eligible household's income and the actual cost of renting a unit. The Housing
Authority also owns 72 low-income housing units at four locations.
Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation (CEDC): The Cabrillo Economic Develop-
ment Corporation (CEDC) is an active affordable housing developer in Ventura and
Santa Barbara counties. CEDC also has construction, property management, home-
ownership, counseling, and community building divisions. CEDC developed two projects
in Santa Paula: The Santa Paulan, a 151-unit senior apartment complex, Casa Garcia, a
14-unit affordable townhouse development for large families and a 24 unit affordable
apartment complex on West Santa Ana Street (Vista Hermosa). CEDC has recently
assumed development of a mixed-use project to include 35 affordable units.
Mercy Charities Housing California (MCHC): Mercy Charities is a statewide non-profit
housing development corporation whose mission is to support and strengthen
communities through the provision of quality, affordable, services-enriched housing for
lower income individuals and families. MCHC has been active in nearby Oxnard, and has
completed construction of three affordable housing projects.
Habitat for Humanity of Ventura County: Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit, Christian
organization dedicated to building affordable housing and rehabilitating damaged
homes for lower income families. Habitat builds and repairs homes for families with the
help of volunteers and homeowner/partner families. Habitat homes are sold to partner
families at no profit with affordable, no-interest loans. Volunteers, churches, businesses,
and other groups provide most of the labor for the homes. Habitat is currently developing
a 2-unit project at 145 S. Ojai Street and received $200,000 from the RDA to purchase the
site.
Many Mansions, Inc.: Many Mansions is a non-profit housing and community
development organization founded in 1979 to promote and provide safe, well-managed
housing to limited income residents of the Conejo Valley and surrounding communities in
Ventura County. Many Mansions develops, owns, and self-manages special needs and
permanent affordable housing. The organization also provides resident services, housing
counseling, a food bank and homeownership counseling.
Peoples’ Self-Help Housing Corporation (PSHHC): PSHHC is a housing and community
development corporation serving San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties.
PSHHC provides design, implementation, technical assistance, and property manage-

ment of low-income homeownership and rental housing. PSHHC is known to have
produced attractive single-family homes at affordable prices in Santa Barbara. PSHHC
developed 62 homes in Moorpark and 47 homes in Piru.
Corporation for Better Housing: Corporation for Better Housing is a non-profit
development organization that developed and manages a 41-unit apartment complex
for farm worker families.
Partners in Housing: Built and manages a 40 unit apartment complex for very low and
extremely low-income persons and received $150,000 in funds from the RDA. The
development provides onsite supportative services for its residents with disabilities.
C.      Energy Conservation Opportunities
State law requires all new construction to comply with "energy budget" standards that
establish maximum allowable energy use from non-renewable resources (Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code). These requirements apply to such design components
as structural insulation, air infiltration and leakage control, setback features on
thermostats, water heating system insulation (tanks and pipes) and swimming pool
covers if a pool is equipped with a fossil fuel or electric heater. State law also requires
that a tentative tract map provide for future passive or natural heating or cooling
opportunities in the subdivision, including designing the lot sizes and configurations to
permit orienting structures to take advantage of a southern exposure, shade or prevailing
breezes.
Southern California Edison (SCE) and the Southern California Gas Company offer energy
conservation programs to residents of Santa Paula including audits of home energy use
to reduce electricity consumption, refrigerator rebates, appliance repair and
weatherization assistance to qualified low income households, buyer’s guides for
appliances and incentives, by the Gas Company, to switch from electric to gas
appliances. Direct assistance to low income households is provided by the Gas
Company through the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program and by SCE
through its Energy Management Assistance Program.
Both companies have programs to encourage energy conservation in new construction.
SCE’s energy rebate program applies to residential developers as well as individual
customers. SCE also offers an Energy STAR new home program, and Sustainable
Communities Program offering design assistance and financial incentives for sustainable
housing development projects. The Gas Company’s Energy Advanced Home Program is
offered to residential developers who install energy-efficient gas appliances that exceed
California energy standards by at least 15%.
The City of Santa Paula is a member of the Ventura County Regional Energy Alliance
(VCREA), a regional public agency whose mission is to establish Ventura County, its
communities, and neighboring regions as leaders in developing and implementing
durable, sustainable energy initiatives that support sensible growth, a healthy
environment and economy, an enhanced quality of life, and greater self-reliance for the
region, by (1) reducing energy demand and increasing energy efficiency, and (2)
advancing the use of clean, efficient and renewable local resources. VCREA works to

IV. CONSTRAINTS
In planning for the provision of housing, constraints to the development, maintenance
and improvement of housing must be recognized, and jurisdictions must take
appropriate steps to mitigate them where feasible. Local government cannot control
many of these constraints, such as those related to general economic and market
conditions, but others can be addressed. Potential constraints to housing are discussed
below, and include governmental constraints and non-governmental constraints.
A.      Governmental Constraints
Governmental regulations, while intentionally controlling the quality of development in
the community can also, unintentionally, increase the cost of development and thus the
cost of housing. These governmental constraints include land use controls, building codes
and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of
developers, and local development processing and permit procedures.
Land use controls may limit the amount or density of development, thus increasing the
cost per unit. On-site and off-site improvements such as roads, traffic signals on adjacent
streets, or sewer systems may increase an individual project’s costs of development.
Processing and permit requirements may delay construction, increasing financing and/or
overhead costs of a development. The following describes potential governmental
constraints, which may affect the supply and cost of housing in Santa Paula.
        1.       Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.      General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The land use element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the City’s zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
Based on land uses depicted in the General Plan, the estimated holding capacity of the
Santa Paula Planning Area, which includes potential growth within the newly expanded
sphere of influence, is about 12,248 residential units. However, the City’s Growth
Management Ordinance limits the rate of growth to 124 residential units per year. The
Land Use Element provides for seven residential land use designations and one flexible
mixed-use designation, as shown in Table IV-1. If only vacant lands within the existing city
limits are developed, growth would be limited to an additional 207 dwelling units.18

b.         Growth Management Ordinance
The City adopted a Growth Management regulation in 1985 (Ordinance No. 832, Santa
Paula Municipal Code Chapter 16.106). These regulations generally limit the number of
residential units that can be built within the City. Ordinarily, SPMC Chapter 16.106 allows
annual construction of 124 total residential dwelling units. However, in the event that the
allocated number of units per year is not utilized, they are accumulated (i.e., rolled over)
and combined with the City’s overall total. As of January 1, 2008, the total available
residential units (i.e., unallocated) within the City is 1,909.19 An additional accumulation
of 774 units is anticipated during the current Housing Element cycle ending January 2014.
The combined anticipated accumulation of 2,653 units is more than sufficient to meet
the City’s net remaining RHNA requirement of 2,052 units. The Growth Management
regulations also exempt second units. Due to the accumulation of growth management
allocations, no competitive review is presently required, nor is it anticipated in the near
future. Presently, residentially zoned parcels each contain one growth management
allocation. Should a project applicant of a residentially zoned parcel desire additional
residential units (which are not otherwise exempt from the regulations), an application is
submitted to staff for review.
c.         Measure “I” - Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources (SOAR)
Approved by Santa Paula voters in 2000, Measure “I” establishes a City Urban Restriction
Boundary (CURB) inside the City’s Sphere of Influence. The CURB creates an additional
approval step in the process beyond staff review and approval by the Planning
Commission and City Council for developers wishing to develop land located outside the
CURB line. Developers who desire to develop such property must voter approval. The

CURB line may also be amended in annual 20-acre increments to comply with state law
regarding the provision of housing for all economic segments of the community. There
are a few situation-specific exceptions to the CURB requirement, including public park
lands and public schools. The passage of Measure “I” resulted in an amendment to the
City’s General Plan. Until the CURB expires in 2020, projects located outside of the CURB
line would require an amendment to the General Plan to alter the CURB line.
d.      Measure L6-Citizens Advocating Responsible Expansion
Adopted in 2006, the Citizens Advocating Responsible Expansion Initiative, aka the “81-
Acre Initiative” generally requires voter approval for large-scale developments proposed
on 81 or more acres of property. In 2008, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 1188,
which added Chapter 16.237 to the Santa Paula Municipal Code to implement the 81-
Acre Initiative. As noted in SPMC Sec. 16.237, developments that amend the Land Use
Element of the General Pan to increase the density or land intensity on property located
within the City’s planning areas, which includes its Sphere of Influence, generally require
voter approval. Other than the voter-approved East Area 1 project, no projects have
been submitted that would trigger Ordinance No. 1188. If a project were submitted that
required voter approval, the applicant would be responsible for the cost of conducting
the required election. Projects with affordable units are not exempt from the initiative,
although elections would be “piggy-backed” with other ballot measures that may be
required for the project (e.g., SOAR) thereby reducing administrative costs.
e.      Greenbelt Agreements
In Ventura County, greenbelts are created by agreements between neighboring public
agencies. They represent an agreement between two or more jurisdictions concerning
urban form, the protection of farmland and open space land, the future extension of
urban services/facilities, and annexations. These greenbelts are intended to operate as
buffers and participating public entities agree not to extend municipal services into
greenbelts or to annex greenbelt lands. Santa Paula currently participates in two
Greenbelt Agreements that affect lands contiguous to the city on the east and the west:
           The Santa Paula and San Buenaventura (Ventura) Greenbelt Agreement:
            Adopted in 1967, between the County of Ventura and cities of Santa Paula
            and Ventura, this agreement covers approximately 8,350 acres from the
            Adams Barranca westward to the Franklin Barranca, with no clearly defined
            southern or northern boundaries. The agreement was intended to cover the
            flat prime agricultural lands south of Foothill Road.
           The Santa Paula and Fillmore Greenbelt Agreement: Established in 1980
            between the County of Ventura and cities of Fillmore and Santa Paula, was
            amended in 2000 and 2009, this agreement covers 34,200 acres and
            represents the largest greenbelt in Ventura County covering Sespe Creek
            adjacent to Fillmore and the western boundary is coterminous with the City
            CURB. The southern boundary is the South Mountain ridgeline and Oak Ridge,
            while the northern boundary lies at the Los Padres National Forest boundary.

f.            Zoning Designations and Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
through the Municipal Code. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan
and are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents. The Municipal Code also helps to preserve the character and integrity of
existing neighborhoods. The Municipal Code sets forth residential development standards
for each zone district.
Residential Zones
The nine zones that allow residential development are as follows:
              HR-PD1                     Hillside Residential – Planned Development
                                         (0-1 du/ac)

              R-A                        Rural Residential
              R-1                        Single Family Residential
              R-1a                       Small Lot Single Family Residential
              R-2                        Medium Density Residential
              R-3                        Medium High Density Residential

              MHP                        Mobile Home Park
A summary of the development standards for the nine residential zones is provided in
Table IV-2. These development standards continue to be viewed as necessary to protect
the public health, safety and welfare and maintain the quality of life, and are not
considered constraints on the development of housing.

state law, density bonuses would permit up to 35% more units than permitted by the
underlying zone. It should be noted that residential development (primarily individual
single-family homes on existing rural lots) is also a permitted use in the Agricultural zones
at very low densities (i.e., 20-acre minimum lot size). For a project located within the City’s
Planned Development (PD) overlay zone, minimum lot sizes and development standards
can be flexible if it is part of an approved comprehensive planned development permit
application.
In the past two years, several multi-family projects have been built in the R-2 (15 du/ac
max.) and R-3 (21 du/ac max.) zones, some of which achieved the maximum allowable
densities (see Appendix A, Tables A-5i and A-5j). The height limits for these zones (35 feet
and 45 feet respectively) are greater than some other Ventura County cities and do not
act as a constraint to development. The height limit for the R-4, which has a maximum
density of 29 du/ac, is also comparable to other cities.
Commercial Zones Allowing Residential or Mixed-Use Development
In addition to the residential zones listed above, five commercial/industrial zones permit
varying levels of mixed-use and multiple-family residential development as a
conditionally permitted use. Emergency Shelters, Migrant Farmworker Group Quarters,
Live/Work Studios and Caretaker residences are also conditionally permitted uses within
the Commercial/Light Industrial and Light Industrial zones.

        LI                Light Industrial
The CBD (Central Business District), C-O (Commercial Office), and C-G (General
Commercial) zones allow multi-family residential units within mixed-use developments
subject to a conditional use permit. Retail/commercial uses must occupy of minimum of
30% of the ground floor area including the entire building frontage of the primary street.
Residential dwelling units are allowed on the second and third floors, and behind the
ground floor retail/commercial use. Separate entrances are required for residential and
non-residential uses. All residential development in commercial zones must meet the
development standards of the R-4 zone with the exception of the front yard setback for
for second and third story residential above commercial development, and the
requirement to provide private usable open space. The maximum density for residential
development the the CBD, C-O, and C-G zones is 29 dwelling units per acre, however,
density bonuses are available to all mixed-use developments. The maximum height in the
CBD and C-G zones is 3 stories or 45 feet. A height increase to 4 stories or 50 feet may be
granted in the C-G zone through the conditional use permit process.
A CUP is required to address potential commercial/residential conflicts and to ensure
proper location of the residential units above the ground floor. Other residential
requirements address entrance locations, parking, lighting, refuse storage, usable
outdoor area, and recreation area. The parking requirements for residential mixed-use
units are the same as for other multi-family units but may be reduced through a
                                                 47                                April 16, 2012

modification request. The fact that many mixed-use projects have been successfully
developed in recent years indicates that CUP requirements are reasonable and do not
constrain the development of residential units.
Several mixed-use and residential projects have been built or approved in the C-G zone
during the prevous planning period as shown in Table IV-3. The average density of these
projects is 29.4 units/acre. As discussed in Appendix B, these mixed-use projects have all
been affordable to lower-income persons.

Given the history of successful mixed-use residential development in Santa Paula, several
vacant and underutilized commercial sites (Appendix B, Tables B-5 and B-6) are included
in the Residential Land Inventory in fulfillment of the City’s RHNA requirements.
Specific Plans
The largest area with potential for residential development is the East Area 1 Specific
Plan. The specific plan and development agreement were adopted by the City Council
in 2008, and annexation was conditionally approved by LAFCO in 2011.
The East Area 1 Specific Plan encompases approximately 501 acres and allows a total of
1,500 residential units distributed among five planning areas (see Appendix B, Figure B-
1a). Chapter 5 of the plan describes development standards for a range of housing
types including single-family, multi-family and live/work mixed-use projects in a “form-
based code” system. This system does not limit maximum densities, and regulates
development based on building configuration and physical layout on the site. The plan
allows all types of residential uses by-right, except senior housing in the CV (Civic
Institutional) and RD (Railroad District) zones.

Height limits are expressed as maximum eave height (rather than ridge) and range from
20 to 30 feet. These standards can accommodate 2- and 3-story buildings, which are
sufficient to achieve densities in the range of 20-30 units/acre. Based on state law, this
density is appropriate to facilitate lower-income housing in Santa Paula. Please refer to
Appendix B for a discussion of the amount of high-density housing permitted in East Area
1.
Provision of Housing for Lower-Income Households
Low-income housing can be accommodated in all zones permitting residential use in
Santa Paula, provided they meet site development standards. These may include multi-
family units in residential or commercial zones, or second residential units that are
permitted within all of the single-family residential zones. Please refer to Appendix B for a
more detailed discussion of affordability characteristics of housing in Santa Paula.

g.      Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter or transitional living
arrangements, and single room occupancy units. Many of these groups also fall under
the category of extremely low-income households. The City’s provisions for these housing
types are discussed below.
            Extremely-Low-Income Households - Many of the persons and households
             discussed in this section under the topic of special needs fall within the
             Extremely-low-income category, which is defined as 30% or less of area
             median income, or up to $26,250 per year for a 4-person household in Ventura
             County (2009). As discussed in Chapter II, the 2000 Census reported that 48%
             of renters and 61% owners in this income range were overpaying for housing.
             A variety of City policies and programs described in Chapter V address the
             needs of extremely-low-income households, including those in need of
             residential care facilities, and persons with disabilities. However, it must be
             recognized that the development of new housing for the lowest income
             groups typically requires significant public subsidies, and the level of need is
             greater than can be met due to funding limitations, especially during these
             times of declining public revenues.
            Residential Care Facilities – Residential care facilities refer to any family home,
             group home, or rehabilitation facility that provide non-medical care to
             persons in need of personal services, protection, supervision, assistance,
             guidance, or training essential for daily living. Residential care facilities that
             serve six or fewer persons are permitted by-right in all residential zones and the
             Agricultural (A-1) zone. Facilities serving more than six persons are conditionally
             permitted in the R-2 through R-4 Zones and the C-O, CBD and C-G Zones with
             Convalescent Homes conditionally permitted in all of the Commercial Zones.
             These requirements do not pose a significant constraint on the establishment
             of such facilities.
            Housing for Persons with Disabilities – Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the
             California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on
             local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications
             or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
             accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal
             opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The Building Codes adopted by the
             City of Santa Paula incorporate accessibility standards contained in Title 24 of
             the California Administrative Code. For example, apartment complexes of
             three or more units and condominium complexes of four or more units must be
             designed to accessibility standards.
             Definition of “family”. The Santa Paula Municipal Code defines family as:
             “One or more persons, related or unrelated, living together as a single
             housekeeping unit.” This definition complies with state Fair Housing Law.
                                                  51                                   April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                             IV. Constraints
            Maximum concentration, site planning constraints and parking. The Santa
            Paula Municipal Code (Chapter 16.64) prohibits an “over-concentration” of
            community care facilities (residential care facilities) where over-concentration
            is defined as “the presence of one or more community care facilities, or similar
            uses, located within three hundred (300) feet of a proposed community care
            facility site. “Community care facility is defined as having the same meaning
            as set forth in Health and Safety Code Section 1502 where 6 or more persons
            live together. The development standards for licensed residential care facilities
            of 6 or fewer persons are no different than for other residential uses in the same
            zone. A conditional use permit is required for licensed residential care facilities
            and group homes of 6 or more persons.
            In order to facilitate the review and approval of requests to reduce
            architectural obstacles for persons with disabilities, Program 21 to process a
            Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance amendment is included in the
            Housing Action Plan (Chapter V).
            Compliance with accessibility standards contained in the Building Code may
            increase the cost of housing production and can also impact the viability of
            rehabilitation of older properties required to be brought up to current code
            standards. However, these regulations provide minimum standards that must
            be complied with in order to ensure the development of safe and accessible
            housing. In addition to providing disabled access in new construction projects,
            Santa Paula also provides funding for retrofitting existing rental and owner-
            occupied housing for ADA access under the City’s Owner-Occupied and
            Rental Housing Rehabilitation Programs.
           Farm Worker Housing –Housing for agricultural employees occurs in two types
            of settings: housing accommodations located on farmland that is exclusively
            for farmworkers; or traditional housing that is intended for lower-income
            households but is not restricted to farmworkers.
            The 2000 Census reported that about 1,300 farmworkers (12% of all
            farmworkers in Ventura County) lived in Santa Paula (see Table II-28). Since the
            city’s population represents only about 4% of the county total, it is clear that
            Santa Paula currently provides a disproportionate share of the county’s
            farmworker housing.
            The majority of farm laborers in the Santa Paula area are permanent non-
            migrant and seasonal workers. As such, the housing needs of farmworkers are
            primarily addressed through the provision of permanent affordable housing,
            such as apartments, lower-cost single-family homes, and mobile homes.
            Nevertheless, to provide additional sites for farmworker housing, especially for
            migrant farm workers, the City permits migrant farm labor camps/housing in
            the R-4 and C/LI and LI zones, subject to a CUP. Such farm labor housing is
            typified by (but not exclusively) dormitory style structures, and not individual
            dwelling units, designed for temporary occupancy by migrant workers.
            Housing for migrant families and single male farmworkers is accommodated
            through this process. The Development Code establishes standards for farm
            labor housing to ensure livability and compatibility with surrounding uses tied to
                                                52                                  April 16, 2012

               the use and not the user, and is not a constraint to development. A use permit
               is an appropriate mechanism due to the unique nature of farm labor housing
               within an Industrial zone. A public hearing is conducted before the Planning
               Commission, which typically takes approximately one and a half months to
               schedule after a project has been deemed complete.
               The City has approximately 22 acres of agriculturally-zoned land consisting of
               three contiguous properties on the far west side of the city. The A-1 zone allows
               one single-family residence per minimum 20-acre parcel. The General Plan
               Land Use Plan shows some agricultural land in the areas west of Peck Road
               and north of Telegraph Road, and north of South Mounatin Road in the South
               Mountain Expansion Area. This area is within the City’s sphere of influence. All
               of the agricultural land surrounding the City lies in unincorporated areas of the
               county.
              The state Employee Housing Act20 regulates farmworker housing and generally
              requires that facilities with no more than 36 beds or 12 units be treated as an
              agricultural land use that is not subject to any conditional use permit that is not
              required of other agricultural uses in the same zone. In accordance with state
              law, Program 17 of the Housing Plan (Chapter V) includes a commitment to
              process an amendment to the Municipal Code with respect to agricultural
              employee housing in an agricultural zone.
              Under current zoning regulations, farm worker housing is a conditionally
              permitted use within the High Density Residential (R-4) zone and in the
              Commercial/Light Industrial (C/LI) and Light Industrial (LI) zones. In addition,
              separate workers' quarters or guest rooms are conditionally permitted within
              the Agricultural zone on properties where a primary dwelling unit exists. For
              these conditionally permitted uses a public hearing is held before the Planning
              Commission, which typically takes place within two to three months after the
              project has been deemed complete. The required findings for a conditional
              use permit are: 1) the proposed use at the particular location is necessary or
              desirable to provide a service or facility that will contribute to the general
              convenience or welfare of the neighborhood or community; 2) the
              characteristics of the proposed use are not unreasonably incompatible with
              the types of uses permitted in the surrounding areas; 3) the proposed use is
              consistent with the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs of the
              Santa Paula General Plan; and 4) the proposed use will not, under the
              circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, and
              general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity or injurious to
              property or improvements in the vicinity. These findings are typical of other
              cities in Ventura County and California. Additional findings are required for
              specified uses but they do not include farmworker housing or any type of
              residential uses.

            individuals on a limited short-term basis. Emergency shelters are conditionally
            permitted in the C-O, C-G, C-H, C/LI, and LI zoning districts. Transitional housing
            is temporary (often six months to two years) housing for a homeless individual
            or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. Transitional housing often
            includes a supportive services component (e.g. job skills training, rehabilitation
            counseling, etc.) to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of
            independent living. Transitional and supportive housing is a conditionally
            permitted use within the Medium High Density Residential (R-3) and High
            Density Residential (R-4) zones.
            SB 2 of 2008 changed the requirements for local government regulations
            regarding emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. Unless a
            city has sufficient existing shelter facilities to accommodate its need, land use
            regulations must identify at least one zoning district where shelters are a
            permitted use (i.e., do not require a conditional use permit or other
            discretionary review). The Commercial/Light Industrial (C/LI) zone has been
            tentatively identified for this purpose. The C/LI zoning district is intended to
            provide for a mix of commercial and industrial operations that do not produce
            emissions of odor, dust, gas, fumes, smoke, glare, liquids, waste, noise,
            vibrations, disturbances or other similar impacts to surrounding properties. All
            operations are to be conducted entirely within enclosed buildings. This zone
            encompasses over 100 parcels with a total of approximately 135 acres, has
            vacant and underutilized parcels that could accommodate at least one
            shelter, and provides access to transit and other services. A majority of parcels
            range in size from 4,000 square feet to 9 acres, with an average parcel size of
            1.6 acres. Four parcels are vacant. Development standards in the C/LI district
            are as follows:
                              C/LI District Development Standards
                            Minimum lot size                6,000 sq. ft.
                            Minimum lot width               60 ft.
                            Minimum lot depth               80 ft.
                            Maximum building height         35 ft.
                            Maximu lot coverage             80%
            As part of the Code amendment process the City will also identify appropriate
            development standards that encourage and facilitate emergency shelters in
            conformance with SB 2.
            Additionally SB 2 requires that transitional and supportive housing be treated
            as a residential use subject to only those requirements that apply to other
            residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The Housing Action Plan
            (Chapter V) contains Program 17 to process an amendment to the SPMC to
            comply with SB 2 no later than one year after Housing Element adoption.
           Single Room Occupancy – The SPMC defines Single Room Occupancy as:
                       “A type of group quarters generally intended or designed to be
                       used, rented, or occupied for sleeping or living purposes by guests,

                       which is also the primary residence of those guests. This type of use
                       commonly contains five or more guestrooms or efficiency units.
                       Generally, each single room occupancy (SRO) unit contains a living
                       area, kitchen sink, cooking appliances and refrigeration facilities and
                       a separate bathroom. A SRO hotel with more than 12 units generally
                       contains an on-site manager's office.”
            SRO facilities are often occupied by extremely-low-income persons. This use is
            conditionally permitted within the High Density Residential (R-4) and the
            General        Commercial        (G-C)      zones        (under       the         term
            “Boardinghouse/Roominghouse”). Development standards for SRO facilities
            are no more restrictive than for other residential uses in that zone.
            There are no minimum unit size requirements in the SPMC that would pose a
            constraint to SRO housing. SRO applications are processed in the same
            manner as other conditional uses in the R-4 zone. Required findings are as
            follows:
                    1. The proposed use at the particular location is necessary or desirable
                       to provide a service or facility that will contribute to the general
                       convenience or welfare of the neighborhood or the community;
                    2. The characteristics of the proposed use are not unreasonably
                       incompatible with the types of use permitted in the surrounding
                       areas;
                    3. The proposed use is consistent with the objectives, policies, general
                       land uses, and programs of the Santa Paula General Plan; and
                    4. The proposed use will not, under the circumstances of the particular
                       case, be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of
                       persons residing or working in the vicinity or injurious to property or
                       improvements in the vicinity.
            These existing regulations encourage and facilitate development of this type
            of housing by designating SROs as a conditionally permitted use in the R-4 and
            C-G zones. Requirements and procedures are no more restrictive than for
            other comparable types of projects, Although SROs would be permitted under
            the requirements described above, no applications have been received for
            this type of housing during the previous planning period.
h.      Off-Street Parking Requirements
The City’s parking requirements for residential zones vary by residential type, number of
bedrooms, and parking needs. A two-car garage is required for a single-family
residence. For larger single-family residences (five or more bedrooms), a three-car
garage is required. Multi-family and second unit parking requirements are based on the
number of bedrooms. Efficiency and one-bedroom units require 1.5 parking spaces,
increasing up to 2.5 spaces for a 5 or more bedroom unit. Senior citizen studio/bachelor

i.       Second Units
Second units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for
living, sleeping, cooking and sanitation, located on the same lot as the primary structure.
The City permits the development of second units in all single-family residential zones,
subject to a Second Unit Permit. Recognizing that second units often represent
affordable housing for lower-income or fixed-income households, including serving as a
resource for senior households, the City offers relatively flexible development standards
for second units. For instance, a second unit can range in area from 640 to 1,200 square
feet, depending upon whether the unit is attached or detached and the size of the lot
on which it is located. Second units are also permitted on lots of less than 6,000 square
feet. In addition, the construction of second units is exempt from the requirements of the
City’s Growth Management regulations.
j.       Density Bonus
In 1992, the City adopted local Density Bonus regulations to encourage the construction
of housing affordable to lower- and moderate-income households. These regulations
were amended in 2007 in accordance with Government Code §65915. The affordable
units provided for low- and very-low-income households under these regulations must be
price-restricted for 30 years if the project receives a density bonus. Projects with units
reserved for moderate-income households must be reserved for occupancy by these
households for a minimum of 10 years.
The City will grant if requested a density bonus for residential projects of five or more
dwelling units which may include: 1) a density increase of 20% above the maximum
                                                                  56                                                 April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                          IV. Constraints
allowable density if one the following is included: at least 5% of the total dwelling units
are restricted to very-low-income households; or at least 10% of the total dwelling units
are restricted to low-income households; or senor housing developments of 35 units or
more in which 100% of the units are provided to qualifying residents, 2) a density bonus of
5% granted to a condominium project or planned unit development that provides at
least 10% of the total units to households of moderate income, 3) regulatory concessions
based upon the number and affordability mix of residential units.
Pursuant to state law (Government Code Sec. 65915 et seq.), cities and counties must
provide a density increase up to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential
density under the SPMC and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of
equivalent financial value) when builders agree to construct housing developments with
units affordable to low- or moderate-income households. Program 19 in the Housing
Action Plan (Chapter V) includes a commitment to review the Municipal Code and
process an amendment in conformance with state density bonus law.
k.      Inclusionary Housing
In 2005, the City adopted inclusionary housing regulations in accordance with Ordinance
No. 1142, (Chapter 16.13.400 SPMC). These regulations establish minimum affordability
requirements for new residential development of ten units or more. Generally, developers
must provide one of the following, or a hybrid combination of the following, as a
condition for project approval:
           Reserve at least 15% of all dwelling units in a project for low-income
            households; or
           Reserve at least 10% of all dwelling units in a project for very-low-income
            households; or
           Construct off-site inclusionary housing for low-income households equivalent to
            17% of all dwelling units in a project; or
           Construct off-site inclusionary housing for very-low-income         households
            equivalent to 12% of all dwelling units in a project; or
           Pay an in-lieu fee as established by City Council resolution. In-lieu fees are
            determined on the basis of the affordability gap between the market price or
            rent and the affordable price or rent, and therefore will vary from project to
            project. No residential projects have been completed since adoption of the
            IHO in 2006.
           As an alternative to the inclusionary housing ordinance, developers may seek
            approval of an Affordable Housing Plan that utilizes a combination of
            affordable housing production and in-lieu fees.
Within the Redevelopment Project Area, 15% of all new units must be restricted for
occupancy by very-low-, low- or moderate-income households pursuant to state law.
Inclusionary units are exempt from the Growth Management Fee. Payment of in-lieu fees
is not allowed within the Project Area.
                                                57                               April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                            IV. Constraints
While the inclusionary ordinance could increase development costs due to subsidies
necessary to facilitate construction of lower-income housing, these costs are offset by
significant increases in land value that accrue from the development entitlements
granted by the City. However, in order to mitigate any such potential impacts, the City
provides incentives and concessions such as density bonus and modifications to
development standards in compliance with state law. Additionally, inclusionary
requirements in Santa Paula are unlikely to act as a constraint on overall housing supply
because in most cases the affordability restriction will be very close to the market rate for
identical unrestricted units. This finding has been documented by rental surveys of market
rate units in Santa Paula (see Appendix B).
l.       Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than on
site, thereby reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the
installation of mobile homes on permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also
declares a mobile home park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and
zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a new mobile
home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code.
Santa Paula contains 771 units within six mobile home/trailer parks. Larger mobile home
parks include Rancho Santa Paula (149 spaces), the Santa Paula West (195 spaces), The
400 Mobile Estates (165 spaces), the Oaks Mobile Home Estates (92 spaces), and the
Anacapa Mobile Home Park (80 spaces). The majority of mobile home park residents are
seniors and lower-income families. All six existing mobile home parks are located within a
Mobile Home Park Zone. To ensure the affordability of the mobile home stock, the City
has implemented the Mobile Home Rent Review Ordinance to regulate the amount of
space rent increases. Manufactured homes are permitted in all residential zones, subject
to design review.
m.       Condominium Conversions
In order to reduce the impacts of condominium conversions on residents of rental
housing and to maintain a supply of rental housing for low- and moderate-income
persons, the City's SPMC provides for the following:
       1.   Tenants must be provided a 180-day notice of tenancy termination, and shall
            have the exclusive right to purchase the unit on at least as favorable terms
            and conditions as such units are offered to the general public. Any tenant over
            the age of 62, handicapped, or with minor dependent children, shall be given
            an additional 60 days to relocate.
       2.   The applicant must provide relocation assistance equal to three months rent at
            the time the notice of tenancy termination is given. Relocation assistance must
            also include provision of a complete and current list of available rental units
            within a three-mile radius of the building being converted. If the conversion
            project consists of 25 or more dwelling units, the developer must provide a
            relocation specialist to assist the tenants.
                                                 58                                April 16, 2012
City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                           IV. Constraints
In order to maintain a supply of rental housing for low- and moderate-income persons,
the SPMC requires that from the date of application for conversion, no tenant can be
unjustly evicted, and places limitation on rent increases. In addition, conversions are only
permitted if the current vacancy for rental units not less than 2.45%, or mitigating
circumstances exist which justify approval of the conversion.
As a result of these requirements, the potential impact of condominium conversions is not
a significant constraint on the preservation of affordable rental housing.
n.      Building Codes
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such charges to the
Department of Housing and Community Development and file an expressed finding that
the change is needed.
The City's building codes are based upon the California Building, Plumbing, Fire,
Mechanical, Electrical, Housing, Building Conservation and Energy Codes, and the
International Property Maintenance Code. These are considered the minimum necessary
to protect the public's health, safety and welfare. Although minor amendments have
been incorporated to address local conditions, no additional regulations have been
imposed by the city that would unnecessarily add to housing costs.
        2.     Residential Development Processing Procedures
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential
development. Within the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its
development review process in order to minimize the time required to obtain permits
while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
The City’s development review process and approval periods are streamlined to the
maximum extent possible. The City employs various strategies, in addition to being a
“one-stop shop,” in order to streamline the permitting process. Planning staff functions as
a permit coordinator to assist the applicant with the process and to monitor the day-to-
day status of the project. Also, Economic Development staff is available to advise
applicants of financial assistance, which may be available in certain cases.
The City’s land use entitlement process consists of various stages, including the initial filing
of application, staff review, environmental review, and public hearings before the
Planning Commission and/or City Council.
           Pre-application – At the applicant’s discretion, the application process may
            begin with a meeting with representatives from the Planning Department and
            other departments requested by the applicant, including Building and Safety,
            Public Works, Fire, and Economic Development. Staff recommends that the
            applicant take advantage of pre-application meetings to clarify the submittal
            requirements and review potential problems before the applicant begins
            significant planning or preparation work on a project. When the applicant is

            ready to proceed, s/he submits all application materials to planning staff for
            review.
           Staff Review of Applications – After submittal, completed development
            application is distributed to various departments for a review typically lasting 7
            to 14 days. Staff can usually respond so efficiently, compared to the 30 days
            allowed under the Permit Streamlining Act, because the City offers a “one-
            stop shop,” whereby the Planning, Building and Safety, Fire, and Public Works
            departments, are all within close proximity to one another, with several of the
            departments located in the same building. This ensures close cooperation and
            expedited project review. Design review takes place during this stage of the
            process.
            Project review is a semi-formal process intended to be helpful to applicants by
            providing them with constructive staff comments on projects. The Project
            Review Committee consists of the Planning Director, Public Works Director/City
            Engineer, Building and Safety Director and representatives of other
            departments that have an interest in the project, such as the Fire and Police
            departments. The Committee reviews all projects requiring building permits
            except for single-family homes on existing lots, additions to single-family homes,
            accessory structures other than carports on single-family lots and interior
            modifications. The review focuses primarily on the functionality of the project,
            applicability of City codes and other laws, and secondarily on the aesthetic
            quality of the project. The Project Review Committee has final review on
            matters that do not go to Planning Commission or City Council. On Planning
            Commission and City Council items, the decision of the Committee is advisory
            only.
            At the end of this review period, Planning staff informs the applicant of any
            corrections or changes needed to make the project conform to various City
            codes and requirements.
           CEQA Review – Once the application has been deemed complete by the
            Planning Department, staff may have to perform environmental review (initial
            study) to determine whether the project will result in negative environmental
            impacts. In general, the larger the project, the more likely a review will be
            necessary. Environmental reviews may last as short as 30 days if no significant
            impacts are unresolved, or up to a year or longer if a comprehensive
            Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required. Given the relatively small size of
            projects in Santa Paula, and the fact that most are infill, EIRs are rarely
            deemed necessary, with mitigated negative declarations (MND) more
            typically prepared. Preparation of an MND generally adds approximately 3 to
            6 months to the process prior to the application being deemed ready for
            public hearing, including the 30-day public review period a 10-day public
            comment period. CEQA exempts certain projects from this review, including
            lower income housing projects with 45 or fewer units, and housing for
            agricultural workers (Public Resources Code Sections 15279, 15280).
           Public Hearings – Staff schedules the project for a hearing to discuss the
            discretionary approval once the environmental review is completed. Some
                                               60                                    April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                              IV. Constraints
             permits require Planning Director approval (Administrative Hearings) while
             others must be reviewed by the Planning Commission, while some may also
             require City Council review. For simpler projects, requiring only Planning
             Director approval processing time averages 1 to 3 months. On average, a
             minimum of 2½ months is needed to schedule a simple project for a hearing
             before the Planning Commission and 3½ months to bring it to the City Council.
             More complex projects requiring legislative review, such as those requiring a
             General Plan Amendment (GPA) or zone change, generally take an
             additional three to six months. The City also offers “fast track” case processing
             at a cost of double the original application fee.
            As described above, Santa Paula’s development review process is streamlined
            and not overly burdensome. The City’s processing procedures are designed to
            cut development costs by eliminating unnecessary delays to developers and
            do not unduly constrain the development of housing in the City. These
            procedures help to ensure that the development review process meets all
            legal requirements without causing a significant unwarranted constraint to
            housing development.
        3.      Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are
charged by the City and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit
applications and providing services and facilities such as schools, parks and
infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata share system,
based on the magnitude of the project's impact or on the extent of the benefit that will
be derived.
Public agencies that levy fees in Santa Paula, either directly or indirectly through the City,
include:
            City of Santa Paula, Building & Safety Department
            City of Santa Paula, Planning Department
            City of Santa Paula, Public Works Department
            The Santa Paula Elementary School District
            The Santa Paula High School District
            The Briggs School District
            The Mupu School District
            The County of Ventura Flood Acreage Assessment Fee
            The County of Ventura Traffic Impact Mitigation Fee
            The State of California SMIP (strong motion instrumentation program) Fee.
Planning and building fees charged by the City are comparable to those levied in
surrounding cities and thus not considered to be a constraint. In addition, the fees are
evaluated by the City Council annually to ensure that they are reasonable and do not
unduly constrain development.

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                              IV. Constraints
Many California cities assess development or impact fees to finance the costs of
providing additional public infrastructure, facilities and needed services for new
residential development. The impact fees currently levied by the City of Santa Paula
include fees for law enforcement, fire protection, general government, library expansion,
public meeting, parkland, storm drain facilities, water distribution facilities, sewer
collection facilities, and traffic impact mitigation. The impact fee for single-family
residential units is $18,895. The fee for attached residential units is $17,819 and for mobile
home the fee is $13,812. In addition, through a reciprocal agreement with the City, the
County levies a traffic impact fee within Santa Paula of approximately $529 per single-
family unit, $371 per multi-family unit, and $159 per senior housing unit.
Table IV-7 shows the development fees associated with 120-unit, market-rate apartment
project. The development fees assume that the project is consistent with the General
Plan and zoning, and that only two discretionary permits are required: a conditional use
permit and tentative tract map.

The total development fees identified in Table IV-7 represent the minimum fees to
process and build a 120-unit apartment project. Because many of the fees are “deposit
to cost,” the precise cost of development fees cannot be tabulated. However, the cost
per unit and per square foot is useful as a “general rule of thumb” for estimating minimum
development fees. The City periodically evaluates the actual cost of processing the
development permits when revising its fee schedule. The development permit fee
schedule was most recently evaluated and revised in August 2006.
City road improvement standards vary by roadway designation as provided in Table IV-6.

A local residential street requires a 56- to 68-foot right-of-way, with two 18-foot travel
lanes and 10- to 16- foot side/parkway areas. Residential estate streets require a 60-foot
right-of-way with two 16-foot travel lanes with 4-foot gravel shoulders and 10-foot
parkway areas without sidewalks. The City’s road standards are typical for cities in
Ventura County and do not act as a constraint to housing development.
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’ property tax
revenues, cities and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services
and facilities to serve their residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has
been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from general tax revenues to development
impact fees and improvement requirements on land developers. The City requires
developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects.
Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the
project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-
way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision
Map Act.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improve-
ments including streets, bridges, overpasses and other public works projects to facilitate
the continued build-out of the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that
construction of public improvements is coordinated with private development.
                                                                        64                                    April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                              IV. Constraints
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of
housing, cities have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations
on property taxes and other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.
B.       Non-Governmental Constraints
         1.     Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA
floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and the
state Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). The City’s land use plans have been
designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and to protect public safety by
avoiding development in hazardous areas. While these policies constrain residential
development to some extent, they are necessary to support other public policies.
         2.     Infrastructure Constraints
Infrastructure and public facilities are important in evaluating the potential of developing
additional residential units. While Santa Paula has the major infrastructure components in
place (e.g., wastewater treatment plant, water system), the significant issue is the
continued maintenance of these facilities. The City has utilized a “pay as you go” system
in which land developers must pay connection fees that cover utility line extensions and
a pro-rata share of the cost of expansion of system capacities necessitated by new
development.
Both the City’s water and sewage treatment systems are adequate to serve current and
future needs. A new water recycling facility commenced operations in 2010. The new
facility will be adequate to provide water treatment services through General Plan build-
out (2025). The City obtains 100% of its water supply from a large groundwater basin, from
which the City has pumping rights for 5,412 acre-feet annually and indirect pumping
rights for an additional 500 acre-feet. The City is close to its limit on groundwater pumping
rights, and will need to purchase additional pumping rights in order to serve General Plan
build-out. Water resource in-lieu fees collected from new development will ensure that
additional water pumping rights can be purchased by the City.
Gas, electricity, and telephone services are provided by Southern California Gas
Company, Southern California Edison, and Verizon Communications (telephone and DSL
internet) respectively. Cable television and internet services are also provided by Time
Warner Cable. All systems are adequate and are upgraded as demand increases.
Supplies of natural resources, such as water and gas, appear adequate.
Due to the City’s long history of flooding, and continuing risks of new flooding events,
proper drainage is a core component of the City’s flood management strategy. Locally,
storm water runoff is handled by a flood control collection system maintained by the
City’s Public Works Department. The local storm water collection system feeds into a
regional system owned and maintained by the Ventura County Watershed Protection
District. Surface drainage utilizes streets and gutters until it reaches catch basins.

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                           IV. Constraints
Individual development projects extend local storm drains or participate in
reimbursement districts to defray installation costs for trunk lines. A new Storm Water
Master Plan is being prepared, with completion scheduled for 2008. The new Master Plan
will address areas within the city that currently have no storm drain systems or have
systems in need of upgrading.
The five school districts charge school fees to help pay for buildings and facilities. Parks
are developed and maintained by the City using fees or land dedication required as
part of development approvals in compliance with the Quimby Act. Using a ratio of 5
acres of park land per 1,000 residents, the City of Santa Paula should provide
approximately 146 acres of local parks. The City currently provides 1.23 acres of local
parkland per 1,000 residents, resulting in a shortfall of approximately 110 acres of park
land. This shortfall is lessened somewhat by regional parks located adjacent to Santa
Paula, the many school sites with active sports fields, and the proximity of the Los Padres
National Forest.
To the extent possible, the City requires developers to dedicate land and improve
internal streets and bordering streets as part of the subdivision process. Regional traffic
improvements are funded in part by the current traffic impact fee of approximately $529
per new single-family unit, $371 per new multi-family unit, and $159 per new senior
housing unit.
A review of the City's on- and off-site improvement requirements indicates that current
requirements are similar to those of surrounding communities. Required improvements
such as street widths, covered parking, park dedication and circulation improvements
are within the typical range of improvements required by surrounding communities.
        3.     Land and Construction Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Changes in land prices reflect the cyclical nature of the residential real estate market.
The housing market is now in a downturn similar to previous cycles in the early 1980s and
early 1990s, and it is expected that recovery will occur and land prices will again rise,
although the timing cannot be predicted with certainty.
Per-unit land cost is directly affected by density – higher density allows the cost to be
spread across more units, reducing the total price. The City has approved residential
projects at densities up to 55 units per acre, which has facilitated the production of
affordable housing.
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards
and general market conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs,
and the building codes and development standards in Santa Paula are not substantially
different from most other cities in Ventura County.
According to a recent survey conducted by the County of Ventura21, development costs
range from $53 to $200 per square foot (excluding land) and from $100 to $350 per
square foot when land cost is included.

Program 18 in the Housing Action Plan (Workforce and Senior Housing Development)
responds to high land and construction costs directly through the granting of land write-
downs, regulatory incentives, and direct financial assistance to private developers to
provide both ownership and rental housing to lower- and moderate-income households.
The program also assists non-profit developers in acquiring and assembling properties
and in subsidizing on-site and off-site requirements. The program allows for the City to use
a combination of CDBG and redevelopment set-aside funds to write down the cost of
land to facilitate affordable housing development.
        4.     Cost and Availability of Financing
Santa Paula is similar to most other communities with regard to private sector home
financing programs. The City’s Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program provides a
federal tax credit for income-qualified homebuyers equivalent to 15% of the annual
mortgage interest. In addition, the City has assisted in financing affordable housing
projects through HOME grant funds, mortgage revenue bonds and low income housing
tax credits. The City also leverages its Redevelopment Agency’s housing set-aside funds
to support workforce and senior housing projects.
The recent crisis in the mortgage industry will affect the availability and cost of real estate
loans, although the long-term effects are unpredictable.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in
the area (“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing homes,
and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that redlining is practiced in any area of
the city.
C.      Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. The City of Santa
Paula’s residents are provided free fair housing services through the Southern California
Housing Rights Center (HRC). The HRC offers counseling and investigative services for
instances of housing discrimination and responds to answer questions about
tenant/landlord rights.

B.        Housing Programs
This section describes the City’s housing programs for the 2008–201422 planning period.
Housing programs define the specific actions the City will undertake to achieve the goals
and policies listed above. The Program Summary (Table V-1) specifies for each program
the following: program goal, six-year objective(s), time frame, funding source(s), and
agency responsible for implementation of the program. The Redevelopment Agency’s
policy is to allocate housing set-aside resources among the following program activities:
             Housing production                        50%
             Housing preservation                      25%
             Homeownership assistance                  25%
Housing Conservation and Maintenance
Conserving and improving the housing stock is very important for the City. A significant
portion of the housing stock is more than 30 years old, the age when most homes start to
have rehabilitation needs. Previous housing conditions surveys have identified a
significant number of single-family homes and duplexes, particularly in the southeastern
portion of the city, that are in need of rehabilitation. To address these problems and
facilitate neighborhood upgrading, the City will continue to offer housing rehabilitation
assistance to residents and carry out code enforcement activities.
Programs
       1.     Owner-Occupied Housing Rehabilitation Program
              The Owner-Occupied Housing Rehabilitation Program aims to upgrade the
              housing stock by facilitating the correction of substandard conditions in owner-
              occupied homes. Through this CDBG-funded program, the City offers low-
   For new construction, the timeframe is 2006–2014 to coincide with the RHNA period.

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                      V. Housing Action Plan
            interest loans to lower-income (80% of Median Family Income or lower)
            homeowners to assist them in making necessary home repairs they otherwise
            cannot afford. Upon elimination of code violations, homeowners may use
            remaining funds to make room additions, which helps to alleviate
            overcrowding. The maximum loan amount is $50,000, which can typically
            provide for the addition of one bedroom and a bathroom.
            Six-Year Objective: The City’s objective is to assist 16 owner-households
            between 2008 and 2014, including 6 very low, 10 low-income households.
      2.    Rental Housing Rehabilitation Program
            To help improve the quality of the rental housing stock, the City offers the
            Rental Housing Rehabilitation Program. This CDBG-funded program provides
            low-interest improvement loans for rental property owners to address
            substandard conditions. Due to the limited availability of funds and State
            contracting requirements, eligible projects are limited to rental properties
            consisting of four or fewer units with a minimum of 51% of the units occupied by
            lower-income (80% of Median Family Income) renters.
            Six-Year Objective: Between 2008 and 2014, the City will provide loans to 3
            rental housing developments for low-income tenants.
      3.    Housing Code Enforcement Program
            The City has adopted and enforces the Uniform Housing Code which
            establishes minimum habitability requirements. Potential code violations are
            identified on a complaint basis. Once a potential violation is identified, Code
            Enforcement staff performs a property inspection and if necessary, code
            citations are issued to the property owner. The owner is informed of
            rehabilitation assistance programs available through the City, and is given a
            reasonable amount of time to correct the code violation(s). City staff may also
            meet with property owners to assist in resolving the violations.
            Six-Year Objective: The City will continue to implement the Code Enforcement
            program to bring substandard housing units into compliance with the Uniform
            Housing Code. The City’s objective is to maintain a staffing level of 1 full-time
            person to continue implementing the Code Enforcement Program. City
            sponsoring of a neighborhood workshop to inform residents of assistance
            programs will be conducted.
      4.    Housing Preservation Program
            The Redevelopment Agency’s Housing Preservation Program was established
            to facilitate the preservation and improvement of existing owner-occupied
            homes in Santa Paula. The program is financed through redevelopment
            housing set-aside funds and can be linked with the City’s Housing
            Rehabilitation Loan Program. Homeowners may receive assistance for the
            following home rehabilitation or improvement activities: alleviating health and
            safety hazards; performing repairs that extend the life of the structure and
            provide improved living conditions; and modifying housing units to provide
                                                73                                  April 16, 2012

            disabled access. Housing rehabilitation costs may not exceed the allowed
            maximum grant amount of $15,000.
            To the greatest extent possible, the Agency will leverage funds from the
            Owner-Occupied Housing Rehabilitation Program and other private and
            governmental sources to increase the effectiveness of the program.
            Six-Year Objective: The Redevelopment Agency’s five-year objective is to
            assist 2 low- and 2 moderate-income homeowners through the Housing
            Preservation Program.
      5.    Section 8 Rental Assistance Program
            The Section 8 Rental Assistance Program extends rental subsidies to very-low-
            income households (50% or less of Median Family Income) who spend more
            than 30% of their gross income on housing. Rental assistance not only
            addresses housing affordability, but also overcrowding by allowing families that
            may be “doubling up” to afford their own housing. As of late 2007, 577
            households received Section 8 rental assistance through the Santa Paula
            Housing Authority, with another 900+ households on the waiting list. The
            approximate waiting period is three and a half years. In addition to tenant
            based Section 8 assistance, the Housing Authority owns the 22-unit El Dorado
            Apartments restricted for occupancy by very low-income households.
            Six-Year Objective: The City’s objective is to maintain current levels of Section
            8 rental assistance, and encourage property owners to list available rentals
            with the Housing Authority.
      6.    Mobile Home Park Tenant Protections
            The City is committed to the preservation of mobile home parks as affordable
            housing for Santa Paula’s working families and seniors. As part of the Land Use
            Element update in 1998, the City established the Mobile Home Park residential
            land use designation for the long-term preservation of mobile home parks. With
            this designation in place, a park owner seeking closure would have to first
            justify a zone change to the Planning Commission and City Council, and
            comply with state regulations governing mobile home closures. Six existing
            mobile home parks currently have the Mobile Home Park land use designation,
            including the Anacapa Mobile Home Park (80 mobile home spaces), Rancho
            Santa Paula (149 spaces), the Santa Paula West Mobile Home Park (195
            spaces, The 400 Mobile Estate (165 spaces), The Oaks Mobile Home Estates (92
            spaces), the Peppertree (44 spaces) and the Mountain View Mobile Home
            Park (46 spaces).
            For parks not deemed economically viable, most of which are travel trailer
            parks, the Land Use Element update process defined appropriate long-term
            use for the sites on which these parks are located. These parks may maintain
            their current use. However, at such time as a park owner chooses to convert a
            facility, the City will enforce State established mobile home park closure
            requirements (Government Code §65863.7), including the preparation of a
            relocation impact report (RIR) to assess the impact of park closure on park
                                              74                                  April 16, 2012

            residents. The RIR must address the availability of adequate replacement
            housing in mobilehome parks and relocation costs. Copies of the RIR must be
            provided to park residents at least 15 days before a hearing on the report to
            be conducted by the City Council.
            Six-Year Objective: The City’s objective is to preserve the existing viable mobile
            home stock as affordable housing for lower- and moderate-income residents,
            seniors, and persons on fixed income. Where parks are proposed for closure,
            the City will ensure adherence to State closure requirements and local
            relocation requirements to provide appropriate tenant protections.
      7.    Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Program
            Recognizing that mobile homes are often owned by seniors, persons on fixed
            incomes, and low- and moderate-income persons, the City maintains the
            Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Program to protect residents of mobile home
            parks from excessive rent increases. The program regulates the amount of an
            allowable space rent increase upon vacation, either by sale or when a
            resident leaves a mobile home space in a park, while at the same time
            providing a just and reasonable return to park owners. A three-member Mobile
            Home Rent Review Commission was established to review and determine rent
            adjustment applications, to adjust maximum rents either upward or downward
            or maintain rents. The maximum permitted rent is the rent in effect on
            December 31, 1991, plus adjustments made since then. Under the program,
            annual rent adjustments based on the consumer price index (CPI) are
            permitted. In February of each year, the rent may be increased to an amount
            equal to the rent in effect on January 31st of the prior year adjusted by 75% of
            the increase in the CPI. Rent adjustments may also be made based on capital
            improvements, upon vacancy, on discontinuance or reduction of a service or
            amenity, or by appeal.
            Six-Year Objective: The City will continue to implement the Mobile Home Rent
            Stabilization Program to maintain the affordability of mobile home spaces.
      8.    Mobile Home Park Resident Ownership Program
            The State Department of Housing and Community Development offers the
            Mobile Home Park Resident Ownership Program (MPROP) to assist resident
            organizations, non-profit housing providers, or local public agencies to acquire
            and own mobile home parks. This program offers both short-term and long-
            term loans, which may be used for the purchase (conversion), rehabilitation, or
            relocation of a mobile home park. The loans available include: short-term
            conversion loans at 3% simple annual interest for up to 3 years and long- term
            blanket loans at 3% simple annual interest for up to 30 years. In addition, long-
            term individual loans are offered at 3% simple annual interest to low-income
            residents of a mobile home park that has been converted, to ensure housing
            affordability when the resident buys a space in the park.
                                               75                                   April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                      V. Housing Action Plan
            Six-Year Objective: The City will provide information on the MPROP program to
            interested mobile home park tenants. Where parks are deemed economically
            viable, the City will support tenant applications for funding through MPROP.
Assisting in the Provision of Housing
To enable more households to attain homeownership in Santa Paula, the City
participates in and promotes two mortgage assistance programs: the Downpayment
Assistance Program and the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program. These
programs assist low- and moderate-income renters in purchasing a home, thereby
helping to address the problems of overpayment and overcrowding facing renter
households. In addition, the Redevelopment Agency works with both non-profit and for-
profit developers to facilitate the production of affordable for-sale and rental housing,
both through new construction and acquisition/rehabilitation. Finally, achievement of
the City’s housing production goals will require leveraging local resources with outside
sources of funding.
Programs
      9.    Downpayment and Mortgage Assistance Programs
            The Redevelopment Agency currently participates in the Downpayment
            Assistance Program offered through the Ventura Cities Mortgage Finance
            Authority. This program aims to make homeownership a reality for families who
            have adequate income to make mortgage payments but have not been able
            to set aside enough money for downpayment, closing costs, and escrow. The
            downpayment assistance is up to 4% of the loan amount and is a grant
            secured by an interest-free second mortgage. Because the assistance is a
            grant and the second loan is forgiven over a period of time, it is subject to a
            recapture provision if the home is sold and the loan is paid off during the first 10
            years. The program uses underwriting criteria that may preclude some
            interested households from qualifying.
            Six-Year Objective: The Redevelopment Agency will continue to participate in
            and promote the Downpayment Assistance Program. The Agency will
            advertise the availability of this program through program brochures at the
            public counter and posting on the City’s website. The City will provide
            information regarding lending programs offered by area financial institutions
            via its website and newsletter. The City will further encourage local realtors to
            inform prospective homebuyers about the available programs.
      10.   Mortgage Credit Certificate
            The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program is a federal program that
            allows qualified first-time homebuyers to take an annual credit against federal
            income taxes of up to 15% of the annual interest paid on the applicant’s
            mortgage. This enables homebuyers to have more income available to qualify
            for a mortgage loan and make the monthly mortgage payments. The value of
            the MCC must be taken into consideration by the mortgage lender in
            underwriting the loan and may be used to adjust the borrower’s federal
                                               76                                   April 16, 2012

            income tax withholding. The MCC program has covenant restrictions to ensure
            the affordability of the participating homes for a period of 15 years. The City of
            Santa Paula participates in the MCC program through the County of Ventura.
            Six-Year Objective: Through the County, the Redevelopment Agency will
            continue to provide MCCs to qualified first-time homebuyers. The objective is
            to provide a minimum of eight MCCs over the six-year planning period, subject
            to availability through the County. The Redevelopment Agency will advertise
            the availability of this program through program brochures at the public
            counter and posting on the City’s website.
      11.   Workforce and Senior Housing Development
            A significant share of Santa Paula households are lower-income. Most of these
            are working families with wage earners in low-paying occupations, including
            farm laborers, factory workers, and service workers. Because of their limited
            income, many of the families are forced to live in overcrowded and/or
            substandard conditions, as evidenced by the high levels of overcrowding and
            overpayment for large families. Seniors also have significant housing needs.
            Non-profit housing developers have played a key role in providing affordable
            housing for working families and seniors in Santa Paula. The City can grant land
            write-downs, regulatory incentives, and direct financial assistance to private
            developers to provide both ownership and rental housing to lower- and
            moderate-income households, including working families and seniors. In recent
            years, the City worked with non-profit housing providers to develop the 40 unit
            Harvard Place apartments for very-low- and extremely-low-income persons, a
            41-unit apartment complex for farm worker families and a 24-unit apartment
            complex for very low income families.
            The City will work with non-profit developers of self-help housing organizations
            to provide additional rental and ownership housing opportunities for very-low-
            income households, such as non-migrant agricultural workers. The City may
            assist developers in acquiring and assembling properties and in subsidizing on-
            and off-site improvements. The City will also use a combination of Affordable
            Housing Trust Fund, CDBG and redevelopment set-aside funds to write down
            the cost of land to facilitate affordable housing development. The large
            inventory of underutilized multi-family parcels (see Appendix B, Table B-5)
            combined with the current soft real estate market provides opportunities for
            small affordable housing projects in existing neighborhoods. Such projects can
            not only provide quality housing to needy residents, but also help to stabilize
            and improve older neighborhoods where the average age of housing units is
            over 70 years.
            The City may provide financial assistance to local non-profit housing
            development organizations with the capacity to acquire, construct and
            manage small affordable housing projects on underutilized lots. State HCD also
            offers a variety of programs that provide grants to governmental agencies,
            non-profits, and cooperatives for self-help housing construction. In partnership
                                                77                                April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                        V. Housing Action Plan
            with non-profits, the City will make efforts to qualify a portion of the funds
            available for self-help housing.
            Six-Year Objective: Provide financial and regulatory incentives to private
            developers to increase the supply of affordable housing in Santa Paula,
            including small infill projects in underutilized multi-family-zoned neighborhoods.
            The City will focus a portion of Agency assistance towards rental and
            ownership projects meeting the needs of extremely-low-, very-low- and low-
            income renters, including large families and non-migrant agricultural workers.
            The City will continue to conduct annual workshops with the development
            community to discuss potential opportunities in Santa Paula, the availability of
            funding sources and regulatory incentives, and other related issues.
      12.   Multi-Family Housing Acquisition and Rehabilitation
            The acquisition and rehabilitation of existing duplexes and apartment
            complexes can assist in stemming neighborhood deterioration and in providing
            decent affordable housing to lower-income households. Under this program,
            the City provides funds from such programs as CDBG, HOME, Redevelopment
            Agency set-aside funds, or Rural Housing and Economic Development funds to
            a developer (typically a non-profit organization) to purchase a deteriorated
            multi-family rental property. Typically, City or Agency staff would work with a
            developer to assist in securing grant funds from these entities. City involvement
            could include review of pro forma analyses, provision of available
            demographic or other background data necessary to complete applications,
            letters of support, City Council actions in support of the application, and
            willingness to monitor compliance with provisions of the grant within the
            limitations of existing workload. Many “third-party” grants will require some form
            of local financial commitment. In such cases, the Agency would review the
            financial terms of the transaction and, within legal limits that may apply, would
            work to provide such financial commitment.
            At such time as the financing is completed, the property is then rehabilitated
            and the units are made available to lower-income households for a minimum
            period of time. Successful implementation of this program depends upon the
            availability of outside funding sources, City staff resources, the interest of local
            non-profits, and a developer to secure such funding. The 56-unit Santa Paula
            Village provides an example of a deteriorated project that was acquired by a
            non-profit, rehabilitated and made available at affordable rents.
            Six-Year Objective: The City will identify deteriorated apartment complexes,
            and will cooperate with non-profit housing corporations to acquire and
            rehabilitate the units with long-term affordability controls.
      13.   Affordable Housing Funding Sources
            To effectively implement Housing Element programs that create affordable
            housing depends on a variety of county, state, federal, and local funding
            sources. The various funding programs available to Santa Paula are outlined in
            Chapter IV, Resources and Opportunities. The City will assume the same role in
                                                 78                                   April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                     V. Housing Action Plan
            applying and securing these grants or loans as described previously under
            Program 13 (Multi-family Acquisition and Rehabilitation). The City or
            Redevelopment Agency would typically work with a developer to assist it in
            securing funds. As described earlier, City involvement could include review of
            pro forma analyses, provision of available background data necessary to
            complete applications, review and comment upon draft applications, letters
            of support, City Council actions in support of the application, and willingness to
            monitor compliance with provisions of the grant within the limitations of existing
            work load.
            Six-Year Objective: The City will actively pursue state, federal and private
            funding sources as a means of leveraging local funds and maximizing
            assistance, with a goal of securing three new funding sources. The City will
            provide information on available funds to affordable housing developers
            through an annual developers’ workshop. The City will support housing grant
            applications both through regulatory relief offered through the Density Bonus
            Ordinance, and through City Council endorsement/support of funding
            applications.
      14.   Inclusionary Housing
            In 2005 the City adopted inclusionary housing regulations which require
            developers constructing ten or more dwelling units to provide one of the
            following or a hybrid combination of the following as a condition of approval:
            1) Reserve at least 15% of all dwelling units in a project for low-income
            households; or, 2) Reserve at least 10% of all dwelling units in a project for very-
            low-income households; or, 3) Construct off-site inclusionary housing for low-
            income households equivalent to 17% of all dwelling units in a project; or,
            4) Construct off-site inclusionary housing for very-low-income households
            equivalent to 12% of all dwelling units in a project; or, 5) Pay an in-lieu fee as
            established by City Council resolution.
            In the large tracts of land remaining to be developed in the City’s Sphere of
            Influence, the inclusionary housing regulations will ensure that a portion of this
            new development is made affordable to lower- and moderate-income
            households.
            Six-Year Objective: Continue to implement the inclusionary housing regulations
            and annually monitor both affordable units produced and the potential
            adverse impacts on the cost and supply of market-rate housing. If monitoring
            reveals that the cost and supply of market-rate housing is being impacted, this
            program will be expanded to process an amendment to the inclusionary
            housing regulations in a timely manner.
Providing Adequate Housing Sites
A major component in meeting the housing needs of all segments of the community is
the provision of adequate sites of all types, sizes and prices of housing. The City’s General
                                               79                                   April 16, 2012

      15.   Adequate Sites for Housing Development
            As part of the 2008-2014 Housing Element update, the City’s parcel-specific
            Vacant and Underutilized Sites Inventory was prepared to reflect new
            development activity within the City between 1998 and 2007. The inventory of
            sites includes lots that can realistically be developed or redeveloped based on
            current General Plan and zoning designations.
            The sites analysis indicates that Santa Paula has adequate capacity to
            accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income categories.
            Lower-income units can be developed on vacant or underutilized lots with
            residential zoning and in residential or mixed-use projects on sites with
            commercial zoning.
            Annexation of Sphere of Influence areas will help to accommodate the City’s
            RHNA objectives and was assumed in the City’s RHNA allocation; however the
            timing of annexation and development is dependent on other agencies,
            primarily the Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO).
            Program 16 below will help to facilitate this objective.
            In addition, the City will continue to encourage consolidation of small parcels
            by offering incentives such as reduced processing fees, density bonus and
            modified development standards to enhance the feasibility of multi-family and
            mixed-use development.
            In order to provide additional sites for affordable housing development, the
            City has initiated the establishment of a Housing Opportunities Overlay Zone in
            the Commercial/Light Industrial (C/LI) district. This district encompasses more
            than 100 parcels totally approximately 135 acres. The overlay zone will allow
            affordable multi-family housing by-right, subject to approval of an
            administrative site development permit. Allowable density will be equivalent to
            the R-3 district (i.e., 21 units/acre excluding density bonus).
            Six-Year Objective: To address its share of regional housing needs, the City will
            continue to facilitate residential development and annexation of Sphere areas
            to meet the City’s RHNA objectives for new housing. The City will encourage lot
            consolidation by granting incentives throughout the planning period.
            Additionally, within 90 days after HCD certifies the Santa Paula Housing
            Element, the city will file an application with the Santa Paula Planning
            Department to amend the Santa Paula Municipal Code (“SPMC”) to create a
            Housing Overlay Zone In the C/LI district to provide additional sites for
            affordable multi-family housing and site development permit to implement
            such overlay zone (SPMC Sections 16.35 and 16.238). The Santa Paula Planning
            Department will recommend approval of appropriate amendments to SPMC.

      16.   Phased Annexation of Sphere of Influence
            To accommodate additional residential growth, the City will pursue the
            phased annexation of areas in its Sphere of Influence. The annexation of these
            areas will increase the City’s capacity to accommodate future housing
            growth. The Sphere of Influence includes opportunities for the development of
            both workforce and “move-up” or higher-end housing, thereby allowing Santa
            Paula to move towards the goal of a more economically balanced
            community. It is important to note that the RHNA allocations assigned to the
            City of Santa Paula by the Ventura County Association of Governments
            (through its delegation agreement with SCAG) were based on the full
            development capacity of the Santa Paula Sphere of Influence during this
            planning period.
            The General Plan identifies five “Expansion Areas.” The first expansion area to
            move forward is East Area 1 (501 acres, 1,500 units). The City Council approved
            annexation in February 2008. Following an election in June 2008, voters
            approved (among other things) an amendment to the City’s Urban Restriction
            Boundary (CURB) to allow annexation. In March 2011 the Ventura County
            Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) conditionally approved the
            annexation of East Area 1. East Area 1 is the least constrained of the three
            annexation areas and has the greatest potential for the provision of affordable
            housing. East Area 1 envisions five planning areas with a variety of dwelling
            types in each of the neighborhoods including 607 single-family detached, 266
            single-family attached (townhomes, duplexes and triplexes), 557 multi-family
            units and 70 live/work units. According to the Development Agreement for this
            project, the developer will provide 100 residential units at a cost affordable to
            “Qualified Public Benefit Participants” whose gross income does not exceed
            200% of the Ventura County median household income. Additionally, the
            developer will contribute $6.5 million to the City’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund
            for use by the City in constructing affordable housing.
            Two additional Expansion Areas are Fagan Canyon (2,173 acres, 450 units) and
            Adams Canyon (5,413 acres, 495 single-family units). The annexation of these
            areas will be initiated by developers and may occur in any order. The
            remaining Expansion Areas are unsuitable for residential development. The
            General Plan designates West Area 2, South Mountain, and East Area 2 for
            industrial, recreational or commercial uses.
            One smaller residential project is anticipated to be annexed during the 2008-
            2014 planning period, comprised of 74 single-family dwellings. An application is
            currently being processed for this project, which is located to the west and
            north of the current City limits.
            Areas annexed by the City in the future will be subject to the Inclusionary
            Housing regulations. Under these regulations, all new developments over 10
            units in size are generally required to deed-restrict a certain percentage of
            units as affordable. In those circumstances where on-site provision of
            affordable units is deemed economically infeasible, provisions will be made for
            development of units off-site or payment of an in-lieu housing fee. Thus future
                                                81                                 April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                        V. Housing Action Plan
            development of newly annexed areas will assist the City in addressing its low-
            and moderate-income housing needs either through direct development of
            affordable units or contribution of funds in support of affordable development.
            Six-Year Objective: The City will pursue the phased annexation of the Sphere
            of Influence surrounding Santa Paula and integrate affordable units within
            market rate development. The annexation and development schedule will be
            dependent on the landowners’ business plans and the real estate market. The
            City may provide assistance to the developer through expedited processing of
            additional approvals or other incentives needed prior to construction such as
            subdivision maps to encourage the creation of building sites at apprioriate
            sizes (e.g., 1 to 10 acres) to facilitate housing for lower-income households and
            infrastructure improvement plans. The City will report annually to HCD
            regarding progress in making annexation area development sites available
            commensurate with RHNA allocations for the current planning period.
Removing Governmental Constraints
Programs
      17.   Zoning for Transitional and Supportive Housing, Emergency Shelters and
            Migrant Farmworker Housing
            Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive Housing
            An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to homeless families
            and/or individuals on a limited short-term basis (generally up to 6 months).
            Transitional housing is temporary (often six months to two years) housing for a
            homeless individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing or for
            youth that are moving out of the foster care system. Supportive housing
            includes a services component (e.g. job skills training, rehabilitation counseling,
            etc.) to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent
            living.
            Emergency shelters are allowed in the C-O, G-C, C-H, C/LI and LI
            (Commercial/Light Industrial and Light Industrial) zones, subject to a
            conditional use permit (CUP). Transitional housing is allowed in the R-3 and R-4
            (Multiple-Family) zones subject to a CUP. The CUP sets forth conditions aimed
            at enhancing the compatibility of emergency shelters and transitional housing
            with the surrounding neighborhood, and ensuring property management and
            licensing of the facility.
            SB 2 generally requires land use regulations to identify at least one zoning
            district where shelters are a permitted use (i.e., do not require a CUP or other
            discretionary review). The Commercial/Light Industrial (C/LI) zone has been
            tentatively identified for this purpose. The City will process an amendment to
            the SPMC within one year of Housing Element adoption to establish land use
            regulations that encourage and facilitate emergency shelters consistent with
            state law. As part of the Code amendment process appropriate development
            standards for emergency shelters will be identified that are the same as other
                                                  82                                  April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                                     V. Housing Action Plan
            uses in the zone in conformance with SB 2. The SPMC amendment will also
            provide that transitional and supportive housing is considered a residential use
            that is only subject to those requirements and procedures that apply to other
            residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
            Farm Worker Housing
            The majority of farm laborers in the greater Santa Paula area are permanent
            non-migrant and seasonal laborers. As such, the housing needs of farmworkers
            are primarily addressed through the provision of permanent affordable
            housing, such as apartments, lower-cost single-family homes, and mobile
            homes. Nevertheless, to provide additional sites for farmworker housing,
            especially for migrant farm workers, the City permits migrant farm labor
            camps/housing in the R-4 and C/LI and LI zones, subject to a CUP. Such farm
            labor housing is typified by (but not exclusively) dormitory style structures, and
            not individual dwelling units, designed for temporary occupancy by migrant
            workers. Housing for migrant families and single male farmworkers is
            accommodated through this process. The SPMC establishes standards for farm
            labor housing to ensure livability and compatibility with surrounding uses tied to
            the use and not the user, and is not a constraint to development. In
            compliance with the Employee Housing Act (Health and Safety Code Sections
            17021.5 and 17021.6), the City will process an amendment to the SPMC to
            allow farmworker housing for up to 12 units or 36 persons by-right (i.e., without a
            CUP or other discretionary approval) in zones allowing agricultural uses and to
            be permitted by right, without a conditional use permit, in single-family zones
            for less than six persons.
            Six-Year Objectives:
            Process an amendment to the SPMC in compliance with SB 2 related to
            Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive housing within one year of
            Housing Element adoption.
            Process an amendment to the SPMC regarding farmworker housing in
            compliance with the Employee Housing Act within one year of Housing
            Element adoption.
      18.   Measure L6 and Growth Management Ordinance
            The City will annually monitor the effects of Measure L6 and the Growth
            Management Ordinance (GMO) on housing development. Should these
            ordinances be triggered, the Housing Element will be amended to include an
            analysis of the impacts and address potential constraints to housing
            production.
            Six-Year Objective: Monitor the effects of Measure L6 and the GMO on an
            annual basis.
      19.   Density Bonus Ordinance
            Within 90 days after HCD certifies the Santa Paula Housing Element, the City will
            file an application with the Santa Paula Planning Department to amend the
                                                83                                 April 16, 2012

            Santa Paula Municipal Code ("SPMC") density bonus regulations (SPMC
            Sections 16.13.310, et seq.) to conform with revisions in the California density
            bonus law (Government Code Section 65915). The Santa Paula Planning
            Department will recommend approval of appropriate amendments to the
            SPMC.
            Six-Year Objective: Code amendment application within 90 days of Housing
            Element certification.
Promoting Equal Housing Opportunity
To adequately meet the housing needs of all segments of the community, the Housing
Plan must include programs that promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless
of race, religion, gender, family size, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, age,
or physical disability.
Programs
      20.   Fair Housing Program
            As a participating jurisdiction in the Ventura Urban County CDBG program, the
            City is provided fair housing services through a contract with the Fair Housing
            Council of San Gabriel Valley. The Fair Housing Council offers a variety of
            services promoting fair housing, including counseling and investigative services
            for instances of housing discrimination, public education and outreach sessions
            for community groups, and housing discrimination prevention program.
            Jurisdictions are generally required to analyze constraints to the development
            of housing for persons with disabilities and take measures to remove the
            constraints. Santa Paula has conducted an initial review of zoning code and
            building code requirements and has not identified any barriers to the provision
            of accessible housing. In addition, the City will process an amendment to the
            SPMC regarding procedures to ensure reasonable accommodation for
            persons with disabilities (see Program 21 below).
            Six-Year Objective: The City will continue to promote fair housing practices,
            and provide educational information on fair housing to the public through its
            newsletter, website, and distribution of fair housing brochures in both English
            and Spanish at the public counter, library, post office, and other community
            locations. The City will refer fair housing complaints to the Fair Housing Council
            of San Gabriel Valley. In addition, the City will continue to fund the activities of
            the Fair Housing Council.
      21.   Reasonable Accomodation Ordinance
            The federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing
            Act require reasonable accommodation (i.e. modifications or exceptions) for
            disabled persons within land use regulations when such accommodations may
            be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and
            enjoy a dwelling. Specifically, the federal Fair Housing Act prohibits “a refusal
            to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services,
                                                 84                                 April 16, 2012

               3604(f)(3)(B). The Building Codes adopted by the City of Santa Paula
               incorporate accessibility standards contained in Title 24 of the California
               Administrative Code. To ensure full compliance with the requirements of the
               Fair Housing Act, the City will process a Reasonable Accommodation
               amendment to the SPMC to establish procedures for the review and approval
               of requests to modify standards in order to improve accessibility for persons
               with disabilities.
               Six-Year Objective: Within one year of Housing Element adoption, the City will
               process an amendment to the Municipal Code to establish procedures for
               reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities consistent with state
               and federal law.

        the RHNA for lower- and moderate-income categories will be met through rehab/conversion of existing units; however, the strict
        alternate sitesrequirements of AB 438 do not apply because the land inventory identifies adequate sites.
        ** As discussed in Chapter II, there are no assisted units at risk during this planning period.

                            Evaluation of the 2003 Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review the housing goals, policies, and programs of the
previous housing element and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period, 2001 through 200823. This analysis
also includes an assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The
findings from this evaluation have been instrumental in determining the City’s 2008
Housing Implementation Program.
A.        Program Evaluation
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
with the source of funding, program objectives, accomplishments, and implications for
future policies and actions.
B.        Appropriateness of Goals and Policies
Table A-2 evaluates the appropriateness of previous goals and policies, and identifies
any changes that are called for in response to the City’s experience during the past
planning period.
C.        Progress in Meeting Quantified Objectives
Table A-3 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the
previous Housing Element.
Table A-4 contains a tabulation of units built during the 1998–2007 period by income
category. Table A-5 provides a detailed listing of these projects along with noteworthy
project characteristics including the income category of units. The income categories for
new units listed in these tables are based on either deed restrictions imposed in
connection with assistance programs, or market conditions (see discussion in Section II.
D.4 (Housing Costs). Most noteworthy is that all new rental units are assumed to meet
Low-income standards based on the Ventura County affordability categories (Table II-
19). The maximum affordable rental rate (based on a family of four) for Low-income units
is $1,714 per month, and all surveyed rental units fell below this level. With regard to for-
sale units (both single-family detached and condo), all new units were assumed to be
Above-moderate unless otherwise required through deed restrictions.

    The original planning period for the previous Housing Element was 2001-2005, however the deadline for 2005 updates in
    the SCAG region was extended by the state legislature to June 30, 2008. Evaluation data is provided through the end
    of 2007 since that was the latest data available prior to preparation of this 2008 Housing Element.

 Notes:
 Very Low – All units categorized as very low are deed restricted units.
 Low – All rental units (not condominiums) in the R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones were categorized as Low Income Units.
 Moderate Units shown are only those that have been deed restricted to the moderate category.
Income Assumptions. Units built during 2006-07 are credited toward the RHNA for the
new planning period. Tables A-5i and A-5j identify new units built by income category
during 2006 and 2007, respectively. Of the 128 units listed in the VL and Low categories,
107 (84%) have deed restrictions. The remaining 21 units were multi-family projects
without affordability restrictions. These 21 market-rate units were assigned to the Low-
income category on the basis of actual rents charged for the units, or reasonable
assumptions based on the rental market survey that found that all surveyed units rented
in the Lower-income categories (i.e., less than $1,750/month). The survey included 3- and
4-bedroom units. The highest rent found in the survey was $1,650/month.

The detailed assumptions and methodology for the residential land inventory are
provided below and summarized in Tables B-1 through B-7.
1.      Affordable Units Built 2006-2007
Table A-4 (Appendix A) summarized residential projects completed during 2006 and
2007. According to the RHNA methodology, units built after January 1, 2006 are credited
toward the total RHNA allocation for this planning period. The City’s remaining net RHNA
is summarized as follows:
                                                                                   Income Category

2.      Units Approved but Not Yet Built
Projects that are approved but not yet completed are shown in Table B-1. These projects
include 168 Lower-income units, no Moderate units, and 87 Above-moderate units. The
income categories for new units listed in Table B-1 are based either on deed restrictions
imposed in connection with assistance programs, or market conditions (see discussion in
Section D.4 of Chapter II on housing costs). Most noteworthy is that all new rental units
are assumed to meet Low-income standards based on local market conditions and the
Ventura County affordability categories (Table II-19). This assumption is based on the 2009
maximum affordable rental rate (based on a family of 4) for Low-income units of $1,750
per month and a market survey of rental units, which found that all surveyed units were
offered at less than the low-income rent limit. With regard to for-sale units, all new single-
family detached units are assumed to be above-moderate unless otherwise required
through deed restrictions, while condos are conservatively assumed to fall within the
Moderate-income category even though recent sales were priced at the Low-income
level (see Chapter II, Table II-21).
3.      Vacant Land
Tables B-2 and B-3 and Figure B-1 summarize vacant parcels designated for residential
development. Table B-2 shows parcels currently within the City boundaries and Table B-3
shows parcels within the City’s Sphere of Influence. Development of the Sphere of
Influence during the current planning period was assumed in the Ventura County
                                                                   B-1                                        April 16, 2012

Regional Housing Needs Assessment, which was adopted by SCAG and approved by
HCD.
Income Assumptions
State law24 identifies “default” densities that are assumed to be appropriate to facilitate
the development of lower-income housing. For Santa Paula, and most other jurisdictions
in Ventura County, the default density is 20 units/acre. However, state law provides that
sites allowing development at lower than the default density may also be appropriate for
lower-income housing based on an analysis of local conditions. In Santa Paula, the R-3
(maximum 21 units/acre) and R-4 (maximum 29 units/acre) zones are higher than the
default density, and therefore are assumed to be suitable for lower-income housing. The
R-2 zone allows multi-family development at up to 15 units/acre (excluding density
bonus), which is lower than the default density. However, based on local market
conditions, all multi-family rental units in Santa Paula are affordable to lower-income
households (including newly-built units). As noted in the Housing Needs Assessment
(Chapter II) and Appendix A (Tables A-5i and A-5j), all surveyed rental units were
affordable in the VL or low categories (i.e., less than $1,750/month). The survey included
3- and 4-bedroom units. The highest rent found in the survey was $1,650/month. This
survey demonstrates that it is reasonable to assume that multi-family rental housing
affordable to lower-income households is feasible in all zones, including R-2 where the
maximum density is lower than the default density.
Units built after January 1, 2006 are credited toward the RHNA for the new planning
period. Tables A-5i and A-5j identify new units built by income category during 2006 and
2007, respectively. Of the 128 units listed in the Very Low and Low categories, 107 (84%)
have deed restrictions. The remaining 21 units were multi-family projects without
affordability restrictions. These 21 market-rate units were assigned to the low-income
category on the basis of a focused rental
survey of the listed units and the rental
market survey noted above. Attempts
were made to contact every owner of
new market-rate multi-family units built
since January 1, 2006. While rental
information could not be obtained for
every unit, the City was able to collect
data on 8 of the 16 targeted projects. All
units within the focused survey sample
were verified to be renting in the VL/L
categories. The focused survey of
recently-built units is consistent with the
rental market survey of other units, which                 Citrus Court Apartments
found all units renting in the VL/L
categories. On this basis, it is reasonable to assume that the remaining new units are also
affordable at the low-income level. The assumption of market rate affordability was
further supported by information provided by the rental agent for the Citrus Court
   California Government Code Sec. 65583.2.c.3.B

apartments, a recent mixed-use project with 28 deed-restricted rental units. According to
the agent, current market rates of $900-$950 for 1-bedroom units and $1,295 for 2-
bedroom units are at or below the affordability restrictions for the project.
All single-family detached sites were assigned to the above-moderate category.
Realistic Development Capacity
In order to estimate the realistic development capacity of vacant sites, a review of
recent projects was conducted and is summarized below. This analysis is based on the
development trends reflected in Tables A-5a through A-5j in Appendix A.
       Single-Family Residential (R-1, R2-PD, HR2-PD) – Sites zoned for single-family
        development assume one unit per parcel.
       Medium Density Residential (R-2) – Maximum density is 15 units/acre in the R-2
        zone, however a conservative capacity of 12 units/acre has been assumed based
        on recent development trends. During the previous planning period, the densities
        of R-2 projects with 3 or more units ranged from 13 to 23 units/acre.
       Medium High Density Residential (R-3) – Maximum density is 21 units/acre in the R-3
        zone, however a capacity of 18 units/acre has been assumed based on an
        average density of 18 units/acre for recent projects with more than 2 units.
       High Density Residential (R-4) – since there are currently no vacant R-4 parcels, no
        assumptions have been made for this zoning district.
       Mixed-Use – Recently approved and built mixed-use projects ranged from14 to 55
        units/acre, with an average of 30 units/acre (see Table IV-3). A conservative
        capacity of 25 units/acre has been assumed for future development of vacant
        sites, however. Commercial development must occupy a minimum of 30% of the
        ground floor including the entire building frontage of the primary street. Currently,
        Santa Paula has a high commercial vacancy rate. The recent Citrus Court mixed-
        use development discussed above has 10 commercial units of which only one is
        occupied. Under current market conditions the capacity for residential
        development is unlikely to be diminished by competing non-residential uses.
Development Capacity of Small Sites
The vast majority (92%) of potential lower-income units in the vacant land inventory is
attributed to sites over ½ acre in size. Five of the vacant residential sites (Table B-2) and
five of the vacant commercial/mixed-use (Table B-5) are ½-acre or less in size. A review
of the residential development by income category between 1998 and 2007 (Tables 5a-
5j) demonstrates the feasibility of producing lower-income units on small parcels. As
noted in Chapter II and Appendix A, market rents in Santa Paula are affordable to low-
income households, therefore small infill projects help to serve this need.
Additionally, smaller sites and inclusionary housing requirements serve to further the
geographic balance of affordable housing. This approach helps to counterbalance
concentrations of lower-income housing that may be created as a result of funding
program requirements.

Annexation Area Development Potential
To accommodate additional residential growth, the City is pursuing the phased
annexation of properties in its Sphere of Influence. Annexation of these areas will
increase the City’s capacity to accommodate future housing growth, including
opportunities for both workforce and move-up housing, thereby allowing Santa Paula to
move towards the goal of a more economically balanced community. It is important to
note that the RHNA allocations assigned to the City of Santa Paula by the Ventura
County Association of Governments (through its delegation agreement with SCAG) were
based on the full development capacity of the Santa Paula Sphere of Influence during
the 2008-2014 planning period.
The General Plan identifies five “Expansion Areas.” The first expansion area to move
forward is East Area 1 (501 acres, 1,500 housing units). This property is the least
constrained of the annexation areas and has the greatest potential for higher-density
housing. East Area 1 encompasses five planning areas with a variety of dwelling types in
each of the neighborhoods including 607 single-family detached, 266 single-family
attached (townhomes, duplexes and triplexes), 557 multi-family units and 70 live/work
units (see Table B-4). The Development Agreement for this project requires the developer
to provide 100 residential units at a cost affordable to “Qualified Public Benefit
Participants” whose gross income does not exceed 200% of the Ventura County median
household income. Additionally, the developer must contribute $6.5 million to the City’s
Affordable Housing Trust Fund to be used for affordable housing development.
The City approved annexation and a Specific Plan for the property in February 2008, and
in June 2008 voters aproved an amendment to the City Urban Restriction Boundary
(CURB) limit to allow development within this area. An amendment to the Santa
Paula/Fillmore/County Greenbelt was also approved consistent with the Specific Plan. In
March 2011 LAFCO conditionally approved the annexation of East Area 1. Remaining
actions needed before construction include approval of vesting tentative maps and
installation of infrastructure.
An inventory of existing parcels within the East Area 1 project area is shown in Figure B-1e.
The property is currently within unincorporated Ventura County; therefore the City
approved Specific Plan and development regulations will become effective upon
completion of the annexation process. Since no individual development projects have
been submitted to the City for review, affordability assumptions are based on the
provisions of AB 2348 (Government Code Sec. 65583.2.c.3.B) which identifies 20
units/acre as suitable for lower-income housing in Santa Paula. Based on an analysis of
residential development standards, the Specific Plan has the potential for at least 627
units at densities of 20+ units/acre. This represents approximately 40 percent of the 1,500
total housing units in East Area 1. As shown in Figure B-1c, the Specific Plan permits multi-
family residential development in the NC-1, NC-2, NC-3, NG and RD zones with
development standards that facilitate by-right development at 20 units/acre or more.
Program 16 in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) describes actions the City will take to
facilitate subdivision of the property into development sites. It should also be noted that
the entitlements for East Area 1 require the developer to contribute $6.5 million to the
City’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund for use by the City in facilitating the construction of
affordable housing. The new Housing Opportunities Overlay Zone (see Program 15) will
                                               B-4                                 April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                   Appendix B – Residential Land Inventory
provide additional sites where affordable multi-family housing may be constructed with
financial assistance from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
Two additional Expansion Areas are Fagan Canyon (2,173 acres, 450 units) and Adams
Canyon (5,413 acres, 495 single-family units). The annexation of these areas will be
initiated by developers and may occur in any order. The remaining Expansion Areas are
unsuitable for residential development. The General Plan designates West Area 2, and
South Mountain for industrial or recreational uses.
East Area 2 is a “planning area” currently outside of the city limits and is designated for
commercial uses which may include retail and or a business park. There are currently 73
existing residential units in East Area 2. However, no new residential development is
planned for this area. The City is currently processing an annexation application for East
Area 2.
One smaller residential project is anticipated to be annexed during the 2008-2014
planning period, which is comprised of 74 single-family dwellings. An application is
currently being processed for this project, located to the west and north of the current
City limits.
Areas annexed by the City in the future will be subject to the Inclusionary Housing
regulations. Under these regulations, all new developments of over 10 units are generally
required to deed-restrict a certain percentage of units as affordable. In those
circumstances where on-site provision of affordable units is deemed economically
infeasible, provisions will be made for development of units off-site or payment of an in-
lieu housing fee. Thus future development of newly annexed areas will assist the City in
addressing its lower- and moderate-income housing needs either through direct
development of affordable units or contribution of funds in support of affordable
development.
4.      Underutilized Residential Sites/Redevelopment Potential
The developed residential parcels summarized in Table B-5 (Underutilized Residential
Sites) are considered to have additional development potential. Based on the
conservative assumptions described below, these parcels could accommodate 361
additional lower-income units. The locations of these sites are shown in Figure B-2.
Realistic Development Capacity – The parcels listed in Table B-5 were selected based on
Geographic Information System (GIS) data, site inspections, and analysis of development
trends. Residential parcels were considered “underutilized” with a realistic development
potential for the 2008-2014 planning period when the current number of units was less
than half the maximum permitted under the General Plan and zoning. As shown in Table
B-5 the vast majority of the sites (96%) contain only one unit. The average age of the
existing structures is 70 years and the median age is 73 years. The summary of recent
development shown in Tables A-5a through A-5j clearly indicates the feasibility of
developing additional units on such sites. In some cases additional units were added
behind the existing single-family units and in other cases the entire site was redeveloped.
The estimated capacity for new units shown in Table B-5 assumes that all existing units will
remain, and therefore only “net” new units have been counted. However, when a site is
cleared and existing units are removed, the RHNA methodology is based on “gross” new
                                              B-5                                 April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                      Appendix B – Residential Land Inventory
units, therefore this “net” calculation underestimates the true capacity for RHNA
purposes. These two assumptions – at least a 100% potential increase in units and only
counting “net” new units – significantly underestimates the actual capacity of these sites.
Affordability Assumptions – More than 75% of the potential development capacity of the
underutilized sites shown in Table B-5 is represented by parcels zoned R3 and R4. The
allowable densities in these zones are 21 and 29 units/acre respectively. The maximum
density in the R2 zone is 15 units/acre. As noted previously, all multi-family units surveyed
in Santa Paula, including new market-rate units built since 2006, were renting at low- and
very-low-income rates. The following analysis is intended to demonstrate the financial
feasibility of developing new lower-income units on even the lower-density R2
underutilized parcels listed in Table B-5.
The typical R2 parcel listed in Table B-5 is approximately one-quarter acre with an existing
single-family home. Based on the allowable density, one or two additional units are
permitted on these parcels (larger parcels can accommodate more than two additional
units). A typical scenario would be for a property owner to build a rental unit(s) on the
rear of the lot. Assuming a size of 1,000 square feet for a 2-bedroom unit and a typical
construction cost of $125 - $160/square foot, the cost of building an additional rental unit
would be approximately $125,000 to $160,000. The monthly mortgage cost of a $160,000
30-year loan at 5.5% interest is approximately $900 and the additional property tax would
be $130/month. The monthly payment for a 15-year fully amortized loan at 5.5% would
be approximately $1,300/month. Since the affordable rental rate for a lower-income 2-
bedroom apartment in Ventura County is $1,750/month, it is clear that construction of
additional units on these R2 properties is financially feasible.
In addition, conversations with non-profit housing developers indicated that if sufficient
financial assistance is available, small infill housing developments would be feasible on
underutilized R2, R3 or R4 parcels. In the current soft real estate market, numerous existing
underutilized properties can be purchased for $100,000 – 150,000. A quarter-acre parcel
in the R3 zone can accommodate a 5- to 7-unit project depending on site conditions
and density bonus. City in-lieu funds can be used to assist a non-profit developer with
acquisition or construction, and could also leverage other funding sources. Lot
consolidation could create opportunities for larger projects (see Program 11).
To compensate for the additional complexities inherent in development of underutilized
sites, half of the capacity has been allocated to the Moderate-income category.
5.      Residential or Mixed-Use Development Potential in Non-Residential
        Zones
Vacant and underutilized non-residential parcels having the potential for mixed-use
development are listed in Tables B-6 and B-7, respectively. A total of 101 lower-income
units could be accommodated on vacant parcels while 94 lower-income units could be
accommodated on underutilized parcels.
Realistic Development Capacity – The capacity of vacant commercial parcels listed in
Table B-6 is based on a density of 25 units/acre. The parcels listed in Table B-7 were
selected based on Geographic Information System (GIS) data, site inspections, existing
conditions data and analysis of development trends. The table provides a description of
                                                B-6                                  April 16, 2012

City of Santa Paula Housing Element                     Appendix B – Residential Land Inventory
existing uses, structure age, and redevelopment potential of underutilized commercial
sites. In determining the potential for mixed-use development, all commercial parcels not
meeting the following criteria were excluded from the analysis:
        Existing structures occupy less than 50% of the site
        Existing structures over 35 years old
        Potential for lot consolidation with adjacent vacant or underutilized parcels
        Located in an area suitable for mixed-use development (i.e., adjacent to or near
         a recent mixed-use project)
Please refer to Chapter IV Section A.1.f for a discussion of the regulations that apply to
mixed-use development and the City’s recent experience with such projects.
Housing Opportunities Overlay Zone - In addition to the vacant and underutilized sites in
commercial zones that currently allow residential uses, the City has committed to
establishing the Housing Opportunities Overlay Zone in the Commercial/Light Industrial
(C/LI) Zone. The C/LI zone does not currently allow residential use, although some non-
conforming residential structures exist. The new overlay regulations will allow affordable
multi-family development by-right at a density of up to 21 units/acre, excluding density
bonus (see Housing Action Plan, Program 15). This overlay zone will encompass over 100
parcels totaling approximately 135 acres (see Table B-8 and Figure B-4). While the overlay
zone represents a significant addition to the City’s inventory of sites suitable for
affordable housing, no estimate of potential units has been prepared since the
adequacy of other sites is sufficient to accommodate the RHNA allocation.
6.       Second Residential Units
The Santa Paula Municipal Code allows 2nd units in single-family residential districts,
pursuant to state law. A total of 14 permits for 2nd units were issued from 2001 to 2007, or
an average of about 2 units per year. It is anticipated that 2nd unit development will
continue at a similar pace during the 2008-2014 planning period, which would result in 14
additional units. Based on affordability categories (see Chapter II) these units are
expected to rent in the very-low- and low-income range.

          Notes:
          1. Anticipated Parcel Size – The anticipated parcel size for non-single-family detached residential types equals the square feet of
               parcel area per unit. For example, the “parcel size” for a Quadplex on a 6,000 sf parcel is 1,500 sf.
          2. Single-family Detached (SFD) – These dwelling units consist of free-standing residential buildings generally built on land
               larger than the building and containing yards.
          3. Single-family Attached (SFA) - These dwelling units consist of attached residential buildings generally built on land larger than
               the building and containing yards. These residences generally include town homes, duplexes and triplexes.
          4. Multi-Family (MF) - These dwelling units consist of attached residential buildings generally built on land larger than the
               building and containing yards. These residences generally include apartment buildings (four or more units).
          5. Work/Live Units (LWU) – These include a structure designed primarily for nonresidential uses with secondary residential uses
               above. Work/Live buildings have a separation of occupancy between the nonresidential and residential floors.

                                Public Participation Summary
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Santa Paula, and this
update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous
opportunities for involvement. Public notices of all workshops and hearings were published in
the local newspaper in advance of each meeting, as well as posting the notices on the
Channel 10 Community Access Bulletin Board and on the City’s website. The revised draft
Housing Element was made available for review at City Hall and the Balnchard Community
Library and posted on the City’s website. The document was also circulated to housing
advocates and nonprofit organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons and
special needs groups (see Table C-1 containing a list of organizations notified of opportunities
for participation). After receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the State
Housing and Community Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element was
prepared and made available for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this Housing
Element update. Public meetings were televised on Channel 10, the local public access
channel.

                              I. PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
This element of the Santa Paula General Plan addresses conservation and open space issues as
required by California state law. Government Code Section 65302(d), requires that a
Conservation Element be prepared as part of a city’s General Plan, as follows:
        “..for the conservation, development and utilization of natural resources, including water and its
        hydraulic force, forest, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and
        other natural resources.”
The Conservation Element may also address:
        “(1) the reclamation of land and waters; (2) prevention and control of the pollution of streams
        and other waters; (3) regulation of the use of land in stream channels and other areas required for
        the accomplishment of the conservation plan; (4) prevention, control and correction of the erosion
        of soils, beaches and shores; (5) protection of watersheds; (6) the location, quantity and quality of
        the rock, sand and gravel resources; and (7) flood control.”
California State law defines open space land as:
        “Any parcel or area of land or water which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open
        space use...”
Section 65560 of the California Government Code describes the requirements for the Open
Space Element as follows:
        (1) for the preservation of natural resources, including but not limited to, areas required for the
        preservation of plant and animal life...; areas required for ecologic and other scientific study
        purposes; rivers, streams, bays and estuaries; coastal beaches, lakeshores, banks of rivers, and
        streams and watershed lands;
        (2) open space used of the managed production of resources, including but not limited to forest
        lands, rangeland, agricultural lands, and areas of economic importance for the production of food
        and fiber; areas required for recharge of groundwater basins; bays, estuaries, marshes, rivers, and
        streams which are important for the management of commercial fisheries; and areas containing
        major mineral deposits, including those in short supply;
        (3) open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas of outstanding scenic,
        historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, including
        access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas which serve as links between
        major recreation and open space reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and
        streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors;
        (4) open space for public health and safety, including areas which require special management or
        regulation because of hazardous or special conditions such as earth quake zones, unstable soil
        areas, flood plains, water sheds, areas presenting high fire risks, areas required for the protection
                                                    CO-1

         of water quality and water reservoirs, and areas required for the protection and enhancement of
         air quality.
The Santa Paula General Plan Conservation and Open Space Element contains descriptive
information related to natural resources and open space that is relevant and of concern to Santa
Paula. Specific goals, policy statements, and implementation measures that carry out the goals
are also presented. Conservation, open space, and parks/recreation issues are closely related
and can be combined into one document to establish a comprehensive policy and action plan.
Since topics covered in the conservation element can overlap those of an open space element,
the discussions and policies can be linked.
The purpose of the Conservation and Open Space Element is to maintain the overall quality of
life for Santa Paula residents through the management and protection of natural resources and
open space lands. The goals, objectives, policies, and implementation measures in this element
provide guidelines and mandates for community actions.
The discussions and policies in this document address both City lands and those lands that are
in the City’s planning area and outside the City boundaries but have an important relationship
to the City. Many of the discussions refer to the planning area, which is the same as the Area of
Interest. The proposed updated 1998 Sphere of Influence includes the incorporated City lands
as well as the expansion areas subject to the CURB called for in the Land Use Element, which
include the following: Adams Canyon, Fagan Canyon, East Area 1, East Area 2, West Area 2,
and South Mountain. These expansion areas are depicted in Figure LU-5; the CURB is depicted
in LU-4a, Exhibit “A”.
                                                  CO-2

                     II. EXISTING CONDITIONS AND ISSUES
This Conservation and Open Space Element identifies and plans for the open space and natural
resources that are available in the Santa Paula planning area and it addresses the legal
mandates and requirements in planning for natural resources. These resources include:
        •   Open Space
        •   Agricultural and Soil Resources
        •   Air Quality
        •   Biological Resources
        •   Cultural and Historical Resources
        •   Energy Conservation
        •   Mineral Resources
        •   Water Resources - Watershed/Rivers, Water Supply, Flood Plains
        •   Scenic Resources
        •   Parks and Recreation
The City can adopt policies relevant to these resources in its General Plan. These policies will
plan for preserving and adding additional conservation and open space opportunities. Policies
are presented to protect natural resources and to utilize the renewable resources, such as water
and air, in ways that do not deplete or degrade them. Nonrenewable resources, such as oil,
agricultural soils, and gravel, will be managed in a way that is not wasteful and leaves the earth
unscarred. These policies are established to coordinate with other agencies, particularly the
County.
The following discussions outline the existing natural resources in the Santa Paula planning
area, as well as the conservation, open space, and recreation conditions and issues.
A. Open Space
As defined in this element, open space land is any parcel of land that is undeveloped for urban
uses. Within the City, open space can be found in parks, along river and creek floodways, on
steep hillside slopes, in public gathering spaces, and on agricultural parcels. According to
California law, the General Plan must address open space for the following uses:
        •   Open space for the preservation of natural resources, such as watersheds, habitat, and
            archaeological sites.
        •   Open space for the managed production of resources, such as agricultural lands and mineral
            resources.
        •   Open space for outdoor recreation and trails including active uses, passive uses and trails.
        •   Open space for public health and safety including fuel breaks, flood ways, and steep slopes.
        •   Open space for aesthetics and urban form including areas of outstanding scenic value, buffers
            and separations, and scenic roadways.
This element is directed toward improving the character and quality of the City’s existing open
                                                 CO-3

spaces and adding to its future inventory. The focus is on reinforcing the social, environmental,
safety, and recreational role of open space within the City. The preservation of open space is
also an important consideration as lands develop within the City’s identified expansion areas.
Provisions for future open space areas are mandated for future development outside the current
City boundaries.
Because a variety of open space functions overlap, a particular open space area may serve
several purposes. An example is the Santa Clara River floodway that provides biological
habitat, a major scenic resource, an area for maintenance of mineral resources, and a flood
hazard area.
The purposes and relevance of open space areas also overlap with many issues covered in other
elements of the Santa Paula General Plan. The Land Use Element designates certain open space
lands in the City and provides policies for the preservation and enhancement of these lands.
The Safety Element contains discussions relevant to the open space issues in the hazards
associated with geology and fire. This Conservation and Open Space Element contains
discussions of biological resources, water resources, agricultural resources, mineral resources,
scenic resources, and parks/recreational resources. This section of the element will provide an
inventory of important open space resources in the planning area while detailed discussion of
each specific resources are covered in subsequent sections. Policies for the protection and
enchantment of open space are provided at the end of this document.
There are several assumptions that underlie the City’s goals for open space:
        •   Open space is a necessary complement to urban land uses and contributes to a desirable
            urban form.
        •   Open space is a method of conserving and protecting resources.
        •   Open space is a method of managing hazardous conditions.
        •   Open space can mean lands that will remain uncommitted to future land uses and
            development.
Table CO-1 summarizes the open space resources within the planning area and categorizes their
function. Most open space areas are listed as a resource in more than one category.
The City’s General Plan Land Use Map establishes an “Open Space” land use designation.
Lands currently designated for open space include: parks, creeks, barrancas and river
floodways. The plan also applies the designation to mineral resource production areas and
other areas where hazards are present.
B. Agricultural and Soil Resources
Agriculture has historically been important to the economy of Santa Paula and this importance
continues today. As the area urbanizes, commercial agriculture is very slowly being replaced
by other land uses. The presence of prime agricultural soils in the planning area is a natural
resource that must be conserved to provide opportunities for ongoing and expanded
agricultural operations.

Future land use decisions which affect agricultural operations and prime soils must recognize
the irreplaceable nature of these resources. The value of these resources are to be given equal
weight to other factors being considered in the decision making process. Goals, policies, and
implementing measures for protection of agricultural and soil resources are provided at the end
of this element. The following text describes the context of the City’s agriculture and soil
resources.
         Agriculture. In terms of productivity per acre, Ventura County is one of the leading
agricultural areas in the nation. The combination of fertile soil and mild climate allow high
value crops to be planted year round. Lemons, strawberries, and celery were the three leading
crops grown in the county in 1992, with a combined value of nearly $350 million dollars. In all,
                                              CO-5

gross revenue sales of agriculture in the county was approximately $725 million. This was
somewhat lower than in previous years, due to late season rains which damaged the strawberry
crop. While strawberries and celery are not significant crops in the Santa Paula area, lemons are
one of the staples of the local economy.
In Ventura County, the U.S. Soil Conservation Service Important Farmlands Inventory (IFI)
system is used to inventory lands considered to have agricultural value. This system classifies
land based upon the productive capabilities of the land, rather than the mere presence of ideal
soil conditions. Land is divided into several categories of diminishing agricultural importance.
Figure CO-1 shows the distribution of Important Farmlands within the Area of Interest, based
on 1996 IFI maps currently used by Ventura County.
The areas considered to have the highest agricultural potential are classified as Prime or of
Statewide Importance. Prime farmland includes areas with irrigated soils (Class I and II) at
least 40 inches deep, a water holding capacity of at least 4 inches, and with the capability of
producing sustainable high yield crops. Farmland of Statewide Importance is land other than
Prime that have a good combination of physical and chemical characteristics, but without
minimum soil depth and water holding capacity requirements. About 18% of the City’s Area of
Interest (8,727 acres) are classified as Prime or of Statewide Importance.
Other productive farmlands are classified as Unique, or of Local Importance. Unique farmland
is land other than prime or statewide importance that supports high value food and fiber crops.
Farmland of Local Importance includes dry farming and other non-irrigated lands.
Lands that have lesser agricultural potential are classified as "Grazing", "Urban" or "Other." The
latter classification includes areas that are generally unsuitable for agriculture because of
geographic or regulatory constraints.
Nine of Ventura County’s ten cities, the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), and
the County have adopted greenbelt agreements between jurisdictions to further the objectives
of the County's Guidelines for Orderly Development by preserving agriculture and open space
between urban areas. The underlying purpose of a greenbelt is to establish a mutual agreement
between cities regarding the limit of urban growth for each city. Annexation is discouraged
within greenbelt. Any change to those boundaries would require mutual consent between the
cities and LAFCO.
Santa Paula has a greenbelt agreement with the neighboring Santa Clara River Valley cities of
Ventura and Fillmore. Figure CO-1 illustrates the boundaries of the two greenbelt areas within
the Area of Interest. The Santa Paula-Ventura Greenbelt, the first greenbelt in Ventura County,
was adopted in 1967 to maintain the land generally between the Franklin Barranca and Adams
Barranca in agricultural production. However, no northern or southern boundaries were
established under this agreement.
                                                CO-6

Figure CO-1 Greenbelts and Important Farmlands
                                        CO-7
The Santa Paula-Fillmore greenbelt is more precisely defined. The 1980 agreement recognized
the shortcomings of the Santa Paula-Ventura greenbelt by establishing boundaries on all sides.
The western boundary is generally coterminous with Santa Paula Creek and the existing 1990
Conservation and Open Space Line (roughly the 1978 Sphere of Influence), as well as a
southeasterly extension of Twelfth Street. The northern extent of the greenbelt agreement is the
Los Padres National Forest boundary, while the southern border of the greenbelt is the South
Mountain/Oak Ridge ridgeline.
An important tool used to preserve farmlands in California is the California Land Conservation
Act (LCA) or Williamson Act contract program. Under the Act, landowners may voluntarily
enter into a long-term contract (10-year minimum) to maintain their property in agriculture or
open space in exchange for reduced property tax assessment. The term of an LCA contract is
generally 10 years and automatically renews itself annually for another 10 year period unless a
Notice of Non-Renewal is filed. Since its inception in 1962, the program has provided the
backbone for agricultural preservation efforts statewide.
Within the Area of Interest, 196 parcels totaling 13,570 acres are under LCA contract. This is
about 40 percent of all the agricultural acreage in the planning area. Almost all of this area is
outside the City's 1978 Sphere of Influence. No land within the existing City limits is under LCA
contract, and only 94 acres within the City’s 1978 Sphere of Influence are under contract. Within
the proposed expansion areas, most of East Area 1 is currently under LCA contract, particularly the
large avocado orchards; however, LCA contracts within East Area 1 will expire as of 1998. Portions
of West Area 2 are also under contract, mostly citrus groves near the Santa Clara River. The large
avocado and lemon orchards in lower Fagan Canyon are currently under contract as well.
However, none of the existing agricultural land in Adams Canyon is presently under LCA contract.
Agriculture plays a central role in Santa Paula's economy. Approximately 33,719 acres within
the Area of Interest are devoted to agriculture, which is about 78 percent of the total area. Over
half (57 percent) of this acreage is used as grazing and pasture land. The remaining 43 percent
of the area is generally used for growing crops, including avocados, lemons, oranges, other
orchard crops and row crops. Figure CO-2 shows the distribution of agriculture throughout the
City's Area of Interest. The most important crops to the local economy are avocados, oranges,
and lemons, a fact reflected in the official seal of the City of Santa Paula. All three crops have an
extremely high value per ton. Avocados in particular stand out, as they had the highest value
per acre ($4,053/acre) of any crop grown in the county in 1996, except strawberries
($27,852/acre). Approximately 2,972 acres within the planning area are devoted to avocados,
about 21 percent of the 14,409 acres given to crop production. Lemons comprise 2,062 acres, or
about 14 percent of all planning area crop acreage. Approximately 37 percent of all the land
devoted to avocados, lemons, and oranges is under LCA contract.
Most of the land surrounding the current City limits has a long history of agricultural use. Its
continued agricultural use is critical to the local economy. As evidence, agriculture is the single
largest industry in the City, employing over 15 percent of all job-holding citizens. Since there
are few undisturbed agricultural areas remaining in southern California, it is doubtful that the
Santa Clara River Valley's agricultural productivity could be replaced elsewhere if it were
developed with urban uses. If the existing greenbelt agreement with Fillmore is to be redefined

to accommodate future Sphere of Influence amendments, additional lands not now under the
greenbelt should be added as a tradeoff. A suggested addition to the greenbelt is the Santa
Paula Canyon area.
         Soils. The suitability of soils for agricultural use depends on many factors, including
fertility, slope, texture, drainage, depth, and salt content. A variety of classification systems
have been devised to categorize soil capabilities. The two systems which have been most
widely used are the Capability Classification System and the Storie Index. The first system
classifies soils from Class I to Class VIII based on their ability to support agriculture. The Storie
Index takes into account other factors such as slope and texture to arrive at a rating.
Based on either system, most soils in the Santa Paula area are highly suitable for agriculture,
due to their high mineral content, good drainage, and loamy quality. The State of California's
Important Farmland Inventory (IFI), which is based in part on the two classification systems
described above. According to the IFI (1996), much of the planning area is considered to have
prime farmland potential. Soil within the northern portion of the planning area are of the
Mocho-Sorrento-Garretson association. These soils are generally located on level to moderate
slopes, are very deep, poorly drained loams to silty loams (Soil Conservation Service, 1970).
Within the City of Santa Paula soils are of the Pico-Metz-Anacapa association. Soils of this
association are located on level to moderate slopes, are very deep, well-drained sandy loam,
and very deep, somewhat excessively drained loamy sands (Soil Conservation Service, 1970).
Along the Santa Clara River soils are of the Riverwash-Sandy alluvial land-Coastal beaches
association which tend to be located on level to gentle slopes. These soils are excessively
drained to poorly drained, with material consisting of stratified sand, gravel, and cobbles (Soil
Conservation Service, 1970). Soils on South Mountain are of the Calleguas-Arnold association.
These soils are located on strongly to very steep slopes, are well-drained shaley loams that are
shallow over shale or sandstone, and somewhat excessively drained sands that are very deep
over sandstones (Soil Conservation Service, 1970).
C. Air Quality
Santa Paula is a small part of the Oxnard Air Basin, which has a limited capacity to absorb and
eliminate air contamination. When this capacity is exceeded, air quality deteriorates.
The air quality in Ventura County has improved appreciably since controls were established
and enforced over the past 10-12 years. Although easy cleanup measures have been employed
to meet the federal and state standards, measures have not been implemented that would affect
more people and necessitate lifestyle changes.
The City of Santa Paula has adopted an ordinance to control pollution by transportation control
measures that save vehicle miles driven through alternative modes of transportation which will
aide in reducing pollution. This ordinance requires employers of 40 or more people to provide
information on alternative transportation to work instead of the single occupant vehicle used by
most people. An employer of 50-100 workers will have to provide the aforementioned
                                                 CO-10
information plus other more substantial measures, such as reserved vanpool spaces, bike
lockers, and showers, etc.
The ordinance further requires residential development projects with 100 or more dwellings to
provide improved accessibility for pedestrians and bicyclists. Projects with 500 or more
dwellings must provide these features plus they must incorporate, to the greatest extent
possible, commercial services such as dry cleaners, child care facilities, markets, etc., to reduce
the distance people drive to obtain the services and to allow pedestrians and bicyclists to get to
these services.
D. Biological Resources
The natural biological environment of the City has been highly modified, although some parts
of the City still retain significant biological resource value. Much of the area available for
expansion surrounding the City has not been disturbed by urban development and still
supports a diversity of plant and animal life. The canyons and hillsides provide habitats that
are distinct from those found in the river valley. The creeks and barrancas that traverse the City
lands contribute small partially natural spaces to urbanized neighborhoods.
The greatest threats to the various biological communities are urbanization and other forms of
human intrusion. Problems such as pollution, night lighting, noise, fire danger and the
introduction of exotic species are the result of urban development. Also, habitats become
smaller and less able to support a balanced ecosystem.
Future land use decisions that affect the community’s natural environment must recognize the
irreplaceable nature of biological resources. The value of these resources is to be given equal
weight to other factors being considered in the decision-making process. Goals, policies and
implementing measures for protection of biological resources are provided at the end of this
element.
The following is a description of the biological communities and species within the City of
Santa Paula Area of Interest which are considered sensitive by recognized monitoring agencies
such as the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS).
        Habitats. The vegetation within the planning area can be characterized as agriculture
(primarily citrus and avocado), riparian (Santa Clara River, Santa Paula Creek and other large
drainages), sage scrub (South Mountain and within canyon areas), oak woodland (scattered
patches mostly on north-facing slopes at lower elevations) and grassland (primarily grazed
lands). Figure CO-3 shows the distribution of vegetation throughout the Area of Interest.
Sensitive habitats which have been reported or have the potential to occur within the planning
area are discussed below. These habitats are considered to be sensitive by the CDFG Natural
Diversity Data Base due to their limited extent and potential for loss:
        •   Southern willow scrub;
        •   Coast live oak riparian forest;
                                                 CO-11

Figure CO-3 Vegetation Types (GIS Map 6)
                                         CO-12
Cottonwood-willow riparian forest; and
         • Southern walnut woodland.
Southern willow scrub occurs within most intermittent streams and larger drainages such as
Santa Paula Creek and the Santa Clara River in locations which are frequently scoured by flood
flows. Coast live oak riparian forest occurs in patches along drainages with deep soils and
dependable groundwater. Cottonwood-willow riparian forest occurs within Santa Paula Creek
and the Santa Clara River (and possibly other larger drainages) in areas of dependable
groundwater and less frequent flood scouring. Southern walnut woodland is limited in the
planning area to the north-facing slopes along State Route 150 (SR 150) near Sulfur Springs.
         Wildlife. The following summary information is intended to indicate the generalized
habitat preferences of sensitive species that are likely to occur in the Santa Paula vicinity, where
suitable habitat is present. The potential for a species occurrence in the project area was based
on discussions with knowledgeable biologists and the California’s Wildlife series published by
the CDFG as part of the California Statewide Wildlife Habitat Relationships System. Specific,
focused surveys for sensitive species would be required to verify the presence or absence of
these species.

Southern steelhead, a federally endangered species, are known to migrate up the Santa Clara
River to spawn in Sespe Creek, north of the planning area. Santa Paula Creek historically
supported a run of southern steelhead, but the channelization of lower Santa Paula Creek and
loss of the fish ladder at the Santa Paula diversion site has resulted in the loss of this run.
However, about 10 miles of good spawning and rearing habitat is reported to still exist
upstream of the diversion dam that could potentially still be used (McEwan and Jackson,
February 1996).
Other sensitive fishes found in the Santa Clara River include the arroyo chub, which is present
throughout the Santa Clara River system, and the Santa Ana sucker, which is limited to the
portion of the River upstream of Santa Paula. Both of these species are considered to have been
introduced to the Santa Clara River system.

Several sensitive amphibian species have the potential to occur in the Santa Paula area
including the western spadefoot toad, arroyo southwestern toad (a federally endangered
species), and the California red-legged frog. The California red-legged frog was recently listed
as threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife Service due to loss of habitat and the introduction of
competitors and predators. Suitable red-legged frog habitat is generally limited to those
portions of the Santa Clara River and Santa Paula Creek with dense, shrubby or emergent
riparian vegetation closely associated with deep still or slow-moving water. Adult frogs
become inactive during the summer (estivate) when stream flows halt or the creeks dry up.
Estivation habitat includes any landscape feature that provides cover and moisture during the
dry season within 300 feet of the riparian habitat, including natural riparian corridors, boulders,
rocks, downed trees, thick leaf litter, and agricultural features, such as drains, watering troughs,
and spring boxes.
The southwestern pond turtle is an aquatic reptile that is expected to occur in vegetated,
shallow pools within the Santa Clara River and possibly Santa Paula Creek. Other sensitive
reptiles include the coast horned lizard, which may be found in open areas with sandy, loose
soil and abundant ant prey. Horned lizards are typically found most commonly along
drainages and washes. The silvery legless lizard is generally found in areas with loose organic
soils or sand, especially where there is abundant leaf litter, such as under oak trees (Zeiner et.
al. 1988).
Many birds-of-prey (raptors) have experienced population declines because of the loss of
suitable nesting habitat (large trees) that are undisturbed by human activity. Because of the loss
of such habitat and notable decreases in population levels, many hawks are listed as sensitive
species by the California Department of Fish and Game. The sharp-shinned hawk and northern
harrier may forage within the planning area during the winter and during migration, but are
not known to nest in Ventura County.
The loggerhead shrike is a small, predatory bird that prefers open habitats with scattered
shrubs, trees and fences for use as perches (Zeiner et. al. 1990a). This species primarily feeds
on large insects generally found in grasslands such as grasshoppers. Loss of grasslands and
natural perches have resulted in the concentration of loggerhead shrikes along fencelines.
Sixteen of 27 pairs of loggerhead shrikes banded, nested within 10 meters of a fenceline (Yosef
1994). This species is expected to be found in the planning area in grasslands and open scrub in
the vicinity of fencelines.
The loss of riparian habitats due to channelization for flood control, diversion of water, and
conversion to other uses has caused significant declines in the populations of small perching
birds that are dependent on this type of habitat for breeding and foraging. The yellow warbler
and yellow-breasted chat generally breed in riparian thickets such as southern willow scrub and
cottonwood-willow riparian forest. These species have been reported breeding along the Santa
Clara River upstream of Santa Paula. These species may also breed within Santa Paula Creek,
upper Orcutt Canyon and other larger drainages.
Least Bell's vireo breeds on the Santa Clara River, maintaining about 15 to 20 breeding pairs.
Recent trapping of Least Bell's vireo brood parasites (brown-headed cowbirds) has resulted in
an increase in local population levels. This species occurs in three populations within the
                                                CO-15
planning area: the vicinities of Saticoy, Briggs Road, and Timber Canyon Road (Sweetwater
Environmental Biologists, Inc. 1992). However, Least Bell’s vireo could be found anywhere
along the larger rivers and streams of the Santa Paula Area of Interest.
The conversion of open grasslands throughout southern California has led to a decrease in the
population of the animals closely associated with this habitat. The San Diego black-tailed
jackrabbit prefers open shrub and tree habitats with abundant grasses and forbs (Zeiner et. al.
1990b). This species is expected to occur within the planning area in dense grassy and brushy
areas in the vicinity of South Mountain and north of Santa Paula.
E. Cultural and Historical Resources
Lands throughout the City and the surrounding Area of Interest contain a wide variety of
resources which are significant in the area’s local history, regional architecture, archaeology,
and culture. The resources considered significant usually meet the following criteria:
        •    The resource is associated with events that made a significant contribution to the broad
             patterns of our history; or
        •    The resources are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
        •    The resources embody the distinct characteristics of a type, period or method of construction,
             or represent the work of a master, or possess high artistic values, or represent a significant
             distinguishable entity; or
        •    The resources have yielded or may likely yield information on history or prehistory.
Future land use decisions which affect the community’s heritage must recognize the
irreplaceable nature of cultural resources. The value of these resources are to be given equal
weight to other factors being considered in the decision-making process. Goals, policies and
implementing measures for protection of cultural resources are provided at the end of this
element. The following text describes the context of the City’s history and some of the known
cultural resources in the Santa Paula area. A detailed discussion of the City’s history, historic
resources, and prehistoric/archaeologic resources are found in Appendix A.
        History. This section describes the existing historic resources in the City of Santa Paula's
Area of Interest. This information is based on a report prepared during July and August 1994,
by San Buenaventura Research Associates. Maps illustrating potentially significant groupings
of historic properties and representing potential historic districts within the City limits are
illustrated in Figure CO-4.
The land on which the City of Santa Paula is located was originally a portion of the 17,773-acre
Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy, granted to Manuel Jimeno Casarin in 1843. The ranch was
purchased during the 1850’s and utilized to raise sheep and cattle until the disastrous droughts
of the late 1850’s. In 1861, approximately 15,000 acres of the ranch was purchased and a 160-
acre orchard was planted. The ranch was subdivided into 150 acre parcels in 1867 and these
parcels were sold primarily to emigrating farmers. In 1872, approximately 2,700 acres of
Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy was purchased by Blanchard and Bradley, and three years later
the townsite of Santa Paula was recorded on a portion of it. Blanchard was generally

Figure CO-4. Potential historic districts (GIS Map 19).
                                              CO-17
considered the founder of Santa Paula. The Santa Paula townsite was surveyed in 1873 and
recorded by Blanchard and Bradley in 1875. Blanchard planted seedling orange trees in 1874,
and during the late 1880’s, constructed the first packing house, located adjacent to the railroad.
In addition to the development of agriculture, oil exploration was occurring in portions of the
Santa Clara Valley as early as the 1860’s. Some of the first oil explorations in the Santa Paula
area occurred in Adams Canyon and Sulphur Mountain. Representatives of the Pennsylvania
Railroad arrived in Ventura in 1867 with the intent of purchasing land for this purpose. By the
early 1880’s, Santa Paula had become the base of operations for Pennsylvania oil developers
Wallace L. Hardison and Lyman Stewart who established the Hardison and Stewart Oil
Company offices in 1886. In 1890 several small oil companies owned by Hardison, Stewart and
Bard joined forces to become the Union Oil Company.
In 1887, the Southern Pacific railroad arrived in the Santa Clara Valley, and soon after citrus
cooperatives, packing houses and warehouses were established within the City. Rapid growth
of the community followed the establishment of viable oil and agriculture industries,
culminating in the incorporation of the city in 1902. The growing profitability of these
industries produced Santa Paula's third building wave, the expansive era of the 1920’s in which
numerous new buildings and residential tracts were built or remodeled.
The Great Depression of the 1930’s curtailed economic growth nationwide, resulting in
substantially reduced levels of development in Santa Paula, however, the region's robust
agricultural industries drew large numbers of immigrants. During the 1950’s and 1960’s, a new
surge of residential development occurred. The construction of the Santa Paula Freeway during
the early 1960’s linked the city to the west county, bringing its relative isolation to an end.
        Historic Resources Located Within the 1998 City Corporate Boundary. These resources
include farmsteads and historic commercial and residential land uses in the original urban
subdivisions. All of these subdivisions were platted in the typical frontier gridiron plan, with
the rectangular blocks divided into standard lots, and the blocks bisected by alleyways. The
specific historic resources are listed in Appendix B.
The development of Santa Paula's historic downtown followed the traditional, pre-World War
II pattern, with narrow lots, rear alleyways and one- and two-story buildings with three-part
facades constructed adjacent to the front property lines. Although the original developments
have been somewhat modified, buildings retain important scale elements and provide visual
clues to the original building materials and architectural intent. The Downtown Commercial
area contains historic resources including commercial buildings, churches, fraternal halls,
clubhouses, railroad and industrial buildings. The Downtown Residential area of historic
resources sensitivity represents the best preserved sections of residential development. Historic
resources include the lot pattern, period residences, sheds/garages on alleys, street furniture,
parkways, streetlights, stone curbs, sidewalks and mature landscape features, such as street
trees. A small portion of the Downtown Residential area has been designated as the City’s only
historic district.
Of particular historic importance are the residential areas known as the McKevett Heights tract
and the Oaks subdivision. The McKevett Heights tract of the 1920’s is distinguished from the
                                               CO-18

Downtown Residential area by virtue of its elevation, curvilinear street pattern, and
architectural character. The architectural styles represented here are primarily late California
Bungalows and Period Revivals. The residential subdivision known as The Oaks, developed
during the mid-1920’s, is characterized by narrow, irregular streets, mature oak trees, river rock
walls and generously sized lots.
        Historic Resources Outside the 1998 City Corporate Boundary. Numerous historic
resources related to settlement and growth exist on the lands outside the City’s 1998 corporate
boundaries. These resources are briefly discussed by geographic area below and are listed in
Appendix B. The historic resources presently known to exist within each geographic area
should be regarded as only a representative sample. A significant number of additional
resources representing historical themes related to early water development, homesteading,
agriculture, and, in some cases, oil exploration would probably be discovered in site-specific
surveys.
        Santa Paula Canyon. Portions of Santa Paula Canyon were originally used as
agricultural outpost for the Mission during the late 1700’s and early 1800’s as two nearby
Chumash villages provided the labor supply for dry grain farming and stock raising. During
the 1860’s a growing interest in Sulphur Mountain oil brought the first petroleum prospectors
into the canyon who purchased the portions of the land. The completion of the Public Lands
Survey opened government-owned land along the east side of the canyon for homesteading.
Ferndale Ranch, located on the east side of Santa Paula Creek near the northern end of the
canyon, was acquired by a Los Angeles oil industrialist who had a house constructed there
during the 1920’s. The ranch was donated to the Catholic Church, and it is now the location of
the Thomas Aquinas College campus. Likely oil-related resources existing in the area include
residences, utility buildings, tunnels, bridges, tanks and oil producing equipment.
        Santa Clara River Valley-East Area 1 and 2. Located between Rancho Santa Paula y
Saticoy on the west and Rancho Sespe on the east, this area, sometimes referred to as the Santa
Clara District, was opened for homesteading, with the first settlers arriving in the late 1860’s.
The earliest crops were corn and wheat, followed by fruit trees and watermelons. Beekeeping
and sheep raising were also practiced during this period. This area is dominated primarily by
the 326-acre Teague-McKevett citrus and avocado ranch located primarily on the north side of
State Route 126 (SR 126). The ranch contains numerous buildings including residences, barns,
sheds and a packing house. The ranch’s significance is tied to its associations with C.C. Teague
who has been referred to as the "father of co-operative marketing" of citrus products.
        Santa Clara River Valley-West Area 2. This historically agricultural area was first settled
in 1867. Some of the Santa Clara Valley’s most significant farmhouses in terms of age,
architectural styles and historical importance are located along Telegraph Road. In addition,
these farmhouses have also maintained their historic agricultural setting. Buildings that remain
include ranch residences, barns, foreman residences, worker housing, and other agriculture-
related buildings.
        Adams Canyon. Historically part of Rancho Ex-Mission San Buenaventura, Adams
Canyon was primarily developed by the oil industry. The first oil tunnels were drilled into the
hillsides in the early 1860’s, with later tunnels dug by Union Oil Company during the early
                                                CO-19

1890’s. Many of these tunnels exist today and are significant for their distinctive method of oil
extraction (Pederson, 1990: 9-11). In addition, a number of other oil-related structures such as
sheds, derricks, tanks, worker residences and other structures and objects may also remain. The
canyon has also been home to ranchers and farmers co-existing with the oil interests.
         Fagan Canyon. Historically this canyon was part of Rancho Ex-Mission San
Buenaventura. Agriculture has been the principal historic use of the canyon. A small number
of residences, barns, and sheds related to the historic agricultural uses of the canyon are known
to exist, but could not be inventoried due to lack of access.
         Prehistoric/Archaeological Resources. The City of Santa Paula lies within the historic
territory of the Native American group known as the Chumash. The Ventureno were the
southernmost Chumash group, occupying most of the area of present day Ventura County,
including the Santa Paula area and the southwest corner of Los Angeles County. In the Santa
Paula region areas of high archaeological sensitivity include the terrace areas abutting the Santa
Clara River and lands adjacent to drainage areas. Nearly all the inhabited or inhabitable areas
near the City are highly sensitive, indicating that cultural resources are likely to be found.
However, site-specific surveys would be required to determine the presence of such resources.
Twenty-one surveys and/or excavations have been conducted in the City's Area of Interest.
Several prehistoric sites have been identified by these surveys, most of which are located near
one of the many water resources in the area. However, the specific locations of these sites are
not included in this report in order to protect these resources. Qualified archaeologists and
historians may view the site records, which are on file with the City of Santa Paula.
F. Energy Conservation
Traditional sources of energy, electric and natural gas, are imported to the City of Santa Paula.
Coal deposits, refineries, and processing facilities are not available in this area of Ventura
County. Southern California Gas (SCG) provides natural gas services to the City of Santa Paula.
Electrical energy is provided to Santa Paula by Southern California Edison (SCE).
Local energy resources are not available in Santa Paula, with the exception of six petroleum
resource areas within the Santa Paula Area of Interest. Local petroleum production has reduced
steadily in recent years. The oil produced in Santa Paula is classified as a “dirty oil” (thick,
with a high sulphur content) which is expensive to refine and transport. Since no refining
facilities operate locally, this type of oil must be transported to Los Angeles, Bakersfield, or
Texas for refining activities.
G. Mineral Resources
The City’s policies for mineral resources are designed to ensure that adequate extraction sites
are available while not adversely affecting other land uses. Maintenance and wise use of
mineral resources is an integral part of the land use planning and conservation efforts
supported by the General Plan and considered in future decision making processes. The Santa
Paula area contains significant aggregate and oil resources. This section describes these
resources.
                                                 CO-20

         Sand and Gravel. Most of the aggregate (sand and gravel) is extracted from Santa Paula
Creek and the Santa Clara River. The rock is transported from the mountains down the streams
by the hydraulic force of storm water runoff. This resource is in demand because much of the
rock meets the criteria for Caltrans highway standards. These minerals are used for highways,
bridges, parking lots and concrete buildings. Because of its bulk, aggregate material cannot be
transported long distances cost-effectively. Consequently, most of the locally-mined aggregate
is used in the general Ventura County area.
Mining the river for rock is also important to flood control efforts. The Ventura County Flood
Control District controls the amount removed to keep the Santa Clara River bottom at the
optimum gradient. Figure CO-5 shows the distribution of mineral resources in the planning
area. Rock from Santa Paula Creek will be available in the future from flood control
maintenance after improvements are complete.
         Petroleum. The Santa Paula area supports one of the oldest oil fields in California. The
Union Oil Company (now Unocal), which was founded in Santa Paula in 1890, combined
several of the earliest oil operations in the state. Locally, oil is found in certain geologic strata
common to the area. The hills and mountains surrounding the planning area support
significant oil resources. Sulphur Mountain and South Mountain have been historically
important sites for oil extraction. The hills, mountains and some valleys are dotted by oil wells,
many of which can be seen from the air. The south face of Sulphur Mountain has soils that ooze
oil. There is also a sulphur spring near SR 150 at the confluence of Santa Paula and Sisar
Creeks.
Local petroleum production has declined steadily in recent years. Part of the reason is that
locally produced oil is very thick with a high sulfur content. In the industry, it is called "dirty
oil" and is costly to transport and refine. Air pollution restrictions make it too costly to refine
locally so oil is transported to Los Angeles, Bakersfield or even Texas for refining. Nevertheless,
the oil industry still plays an important role in the local economy. This role could increase if, for
instance, foreign supplies were cut, as they were on several occasions within the last 25 years.
The City has received copies of the 1993 Update of Mineral Land Classification of Portland
Cement Concrete Aggregate in Ventura County. Included in this report are the Designated
Aggregated Resource Sectors. The Santa Clara River south of the City is shown on Sector E and
other Mineral Resource Zones (MRZs) are shown on a Generalized Land Classification Map.
Land uses considered to be compatible with mining may include very low density residential,
geographically extensive but low impact industrial, recreational, agriculture, grazing, and open
space. Land uses inherently incompatible with mining may include high density residential,
low density residential with high unit value, public facilities, intensive industrial, and general
commercial uses.
This element recommends the use of a special purpose overlay zone, Mineral Resources, to
identify the presence of known mineral deposits and restrict the encroachment of incompatible
land uses in those areas that are to be conserved.

H. Water Resources - Watershed/Rivers, Water Supply, Flood Plains
The mountains surrounding Santa Paula and the Santa Clara River provide a large watershed
area that contributes water for urban and agricultural uses, as well as habitat and scenic
qualities. In addition to the river that runs along the southern City boundary, several major and
minor drainages run out of the hills and through the urbanized City lands. The City depends
on this watershed for a dependable supply of potable water for household, business and fire-
fighting purposes. The watershed is a naturally defined planning area, and is part of an
adjudicated basin.
Significant flood hazards are posed by the drainages that pass by and through the urbanized
City lands. Major flooding results from high intensity rainfall that produces heavy run-off in a
short period of time. Often flood waters collect channel debris which clog the streams and
obstruct the flood flows. The potential for flooding affects both developed properties in the
City and undeveloped lands in the City’s expansion areas. Capital improvement projects and
flood proofing have been done but more projects need to be undertaken to protect existing
development. Undeveloped lands that are flood prone must be addressed with appropriate
land uses and the requirement for adequate protection and drainage facilities.
Future land use decisions that affect the community’s water-related resources must recognize
the unreliable nature of water resources. The value of these resources is to be given equal
weight to other factors being considered in the decision making process. Goals, policies and
implementing measures for water resource protection are provided at the end of this element.
The following text describes the context of the water-related resources in the Santa Paula area.
        Watershed/Rivers. The Santa Clara River is 100 miles long and its watershed is vast.
The City of Santa Paula’s planning area lies entirely within the Santa Clara River watershed,
whose main channel passes through the City on its southern flank. Local tributary drainages
include Santa Paula Creek, Haun Creek, Timber Creek, Adams Barranca, Fagan Barranca, Todd
Barranca, and Haines Barranca.
        Water Supply. The Santa Paula Groundwater Basin is a major natural resource. The
basin lies north of the Oak Ridge Fault which is just to the south of the city. The Basin contains
a huge amount of water. However, in some areas the groundwater is some distance below the
surface and can be costly to reach. The quality of the water in the basin is a matter of concern
because of its high mineral content. The Santa Paula Basin is one of a series of interconnected
ground water basins underlying the Santa Clara River Valley. Although the basin is estimated
to hold 15 million acre-feet of water (1 acre-foot = 325,850 gallons), the users of this basin are
collectively contributing to its potential overdraft. Figure CO-6 shows the extent of the water
distribution system within the planning area.
The City of Santa Paula, provides water for residential and businesses in the City and the
surrounding area. Several water tanks are located at various elevations on the hills above the
City. Water is piped into the tanks from wells and then supplied to the public by gravity flow
out of the tanks. During warm periods, water is used from the tanks faster than it can be
replenished. During prolonged heat waves, the potential for temporary shortages exists With
                                               CO-23

Figure CO-6 Water system (GIS Map 7)
                                     CO-24
no water pressure, the risk of introducing contaminants into the system increases, and fire-
fighting becomes difficult or impossible.
It is currently estimated that storage capacity does not fully meet the City's current needs.
Additional capacity will soon be added in the form of new tanks or more wells. The City is
working on developing the new capacity by drilling wells to replace wells that were lost due to
age or poor water quality. The last well drilled in 1992, which is in the Lemonwood Industrial
Park (Well 12) and near the river, did not meet State water quality standards and could be used
for drinking water only after a plant for the removal of manganese was constructed. Since then,
Wells 13 and 14 have been drilled near Fagan Barranca, and will also require manganese
removal. A central plant will be built in 1998.
Although no short-term supply shortages are anticipated to meet current demand, there are
significant problems associated with over-drafting the basin. Over-draft, or "mining" occurs
when water is being extracted faster than it can be replenished. In the long term, this condition
would result in the draining of the aquifer. However, other serious problems could occur in the
interim. Sea water intrusion is already occurring in the Oxnard area, as dropping ground water
levels allow the ocean water to flow inland underground. Ground subsidence may occur as the
porous ground structure collapses due to the lack of support that the water had provided. This
does not preclude reasonable development and growth in the City. Projects that include water
conservation measures and, in some cases, use reclaimed water will allow Santa Paula to grow
into the foreseeable future. Drought-tolerant landscaping and low-flow toilets are only two
examples of how new development can minimize future water consumption. Finally, in some
cases, urban development uses less water than the agriculture it replaces.
Some existing wells are very old; thus, new wells will be needed in the future to replace other
failed wells and to service additional growth. Engineers have studied the question of the best
location geologically to locate a new well that will produce the best quality water. A well field
near Fagan Barranca is being developed. Manganese is the only mineral present that does not
meet drinking water standards.
The City calculated that approximately 8,600 acre feet per year (AFY) of water will be needed to
serve future growth within the current City boundaries and in the expansion areas
recommended in the Land Use Element. Local water resources are presently in place or can be
implemented with minimal regulatory risk or legal barriers. These future water supply
resources include the following:
Existing Adjudicated Ground Water Rights                                                6,085 AFY
Santa Paula Creek Surface Rights Transfer (potential)                                     500 AFY
Water Rights Transfer after Agricultural Land Converted to Urban Use (potential) 3,000 AFY
State Water (potential)                                                                  2,000 AFY
TOTAL                                                                                  11,585 AFY
There is also an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 AFY of reclaimed wastewater, which could be used for
irrigating parks, golf courses, and other open lands.
                                               CO-25
This element provides policies for locating new water wells, requiring adequate water quality
for existing City residents and businesses, and for water conservation. Policies also address the
provision of adequate water supply for new development consistent with the Land Use
Element.
         Flood Plains. Santa Paula is very susceptible to flood hazards because it is located at the
confluence of two uncontrolled waterways. Approximately half of the City is located in the 100-
year floodplain of Santa Paula Creek.. This floodplain will be drastically reduced with the
implementation of improvements to Santa Paula Creek. Other areas are in the floodplain of the
Santa Clara River, Fagan Barranca and Adams Barranca. The Safety Element illustrates the
floodplain areas.
The "100-year flood" means that in any given year, there is a 1 percent chance that a flood of
that magnitude may occur. A storm event may result in a "100-year flood" at certain areas
within the identified floodplain but not in others. High-intensity short-duration storms will
have the tendencies to overburden local storm drains, while low-intensity storms that last
longer are more likely to induce flooding on creeks and rivers. The flood map simply identifies
all the areas that are susceptible to 100-year flood events of all types.
Several areas have been identified that are in need of flood control improvements in and near
the City. These include the length of Santa Paula Creek, as well as significant portions of
Adams Barranca, Fagan Barranca, Todd Lane, and Peck Road Drain. Bank protection is also
required along portions of the Santa Clara River. The Adams Barranca and Todd Lane drainage
needs could be affected by future development in Adams Canyon and the industrial area of the
City. If an appropriate flood retention basin is constructed in Adams Canyon, the need for
improvements on Adams Barranca below Telegraph Road may be reduced. Development in
Fagan Canyon may have a similar affect on the Fagan Barranca project needs.
Although, the floodplain on Santa Paula Creek and the barrancas may be significantly altered
through flood control improvements, this is not likely on the Santa Clara River. Thus, future
development south of the river should be viewed with this in mind.
The City of Santa Paula does not have a master plan of storm drains. Instead, a number of
regional studies have been done to develop solutions to known problems. Several localized
areas of recurring flood problems are found in Santa Paula, including Harvard Boulevard at
Warren Avenue, and Twelfth Street above the railroad tracks. The City has planned projects to
improve these deficiencies.
Santa Paula has the highest number of properties on the federal flood insurance program in the
county. Approximately 1,500 properties are paying $400 or more each year for flood insurance.
 Most of the area is classified as shallow flooding where the risks are fairly low, but the
insurance burden in a major concern. A project on Santa Paula Creek will save a million dollars
or more each year in flood insurance premiums alone.
The portions of town that are already developed or partially developed in the floodplain are not
prohibited from expanding further. The City has an ordinance regulating building in the flood
areas. It requires that various flood protection measures be taken during construction. The
                                                CO-26
most significant is the requirement to build structures at elevations above the flood level. In
most cases, this is just a foot or two above ground. Many projects have proceeded under these
regulations in the past 13 years.
Land development projects can have a major affect on flood problems, either positive or
negative. Properly designed projects can solve existing problems to the benefit of the general
public. Poorly designed projects, on the other hand, can cause new problems where there were
none. Some flood control projects can be constructed in conjunction with land development to
the benefit of the general public.
The floodplains of the Adams Barranca, Fagan Barranca, and even Santa Paula Creek may
someday be eliminated. Thus, in the long run these streams may not have an impact on the
selection of land uses to be allowed along their banks. The floodplain of the Santa Clara River,
on the other hand, is likely to be with us always; therefore, land uses below the freeway must be
addressed with ongoing flooding concerns in mind. Open space designations for floodway
areas along the river side of the flood protection and levy area would provide a transition out of
the riverbed into the urban area. A multi-agency study is now under way to create a
management and enhancement plan for the river. In all likelihood, the results of the study will
determine how the riverbank and fringe areas may be developed.
Flooding from a dam failure is also a possibility in Santa Paula. Santa Paula suffered one of the
country's greatest manmade disasters when the Saint Francis Dam collapsed in March 1928.
The City suffered the most damage of any community in the Santa Clara River Valley, with
structures damaged or destroyed and lives lost as far northward as Santa Paula High School.
Today, there are four large dams upstream of Santa Paula, some larger than the Saint Francis.
Should one of the large dams fail suddenly, the City would have less than two hours warning in
which time two-thirds to three-quarters of the population must be evacuated. The high water
mark would extend up Santa Paula Canyon into the Oaks area. It would then pass around the
base of the hill above the intersection of Tenth Street and Virginia Terrace and extend
westward, passing through the high school campus. Figure S-4 in the Safety Element shows the
extent of inundation if any of these dams were to fail. The likelihood of such a failure is
extremely low.
I. Scenic Resources
The aesthetic qualities of the City of Santa Paula vary as widely as the topography and the built
environment. The proximity of the distinct land forms from the mountains to the river valley,
the lush agricultural fields that border the City and the historic downtown buildings provide an
exceptional scenic environment.
It is important to conserve both natural and developed land areas and that are high in scenic
value. This element serves not only to identify these resources, but also to recommend policies
that will conserve and enhance the resources for future generations.

J. Parks and Recreational Resources
Due to the city’s concern of providing sufficient parkland for residents and the open space role
that parks play within the community, parks are considered an important resource to be
conserved, enhanced and expanded. It is the City’s goal to provide a variety of park
experiences including those for intense recreational activity, community activities and passive
open space enjoyment. This element serves not only to identify park and recreation resources,
but also to recommend policies that will conserve and enhance the resources for future
generations.
        City Sponsored Resources. The City's recreational system is composed of an array of
parks, special recreation facilities, and community-wide activities. In addition to a Community
Center and a Boys and Girls Club, there are nine public parks in the City (see Figure CO-7).
George Harding Park is the largest at 13 acres, and includes picnic tables, playground
equipment, and lighted fields. Most of the other parks range in size between 1 and 6 acres, and
would be considered neighborhood or community facilities.
The local schools also serve as recreational facilities. Santa Paula High School has lighted tennis
courts, a swimming pool, lighted soccer and softball fields, and indoor basketball courts. Most
of the schools in the City have outdoor basketball courts and playing fields.
In addition, through City programs there are structured leagues for various youth and adult
sports throughout the year. The Santa Paula Community Center is used for instructional classes
and other activities. The facility is also available to local civic groups and residents on a rental
basis to hold planned meetings, dinners and receptions. Additionally, the Boys and Girls Club
                                                  CO-28

is used for recreational programs and community meetings.
CO-7 City Parks (GIS Map 18)
                                          CO-29
Linear Recreation Systems. A number of natural and man-made corridors in the Santa Paula
planning area serve as linear recreation systems. These systems will link together parks and
open space areas as part of an overall network. Such systems include:
        •    Bicycle Routes
        •    Trails
        •    Santa Paula Creek
        •    Fagan Barranca
        •    Santa Clara River
        •    Railroad Right of Way
        Parkland Acquisition and Development Standards. The Quimby Act allows the City
to require new development to provide for park and recreation needs. These needs can be
addressed through the dedication of land or imposition of fees or a combination of both. The
City’s capital improvement program establishes standards and schedules for the acquisition
and development of new parkland or rehabilitation of existing facilities.
National standards for the desirable amount of parkland have been established by the National
Recreation and Park Association. These define acceptable ratios of park space per capita based
on national averages. The standard for local parks is 5 to 8 acres of total parkland per 1,000
residents. The standard for neighborhood parks is 1 to 2 acres per 1,000 residents.
Using a ratio of 5 acres of park land per capita, the City of Santa Paula should provide 132.5
acres for its estimated population of 26,500. The City currently provides 1.33 acres of local
parks per 1,000 residents. This is a shortfall of 96 acres for local parks. This shortfall is lessened
somewhat by the fact that there are some regional parks adjacent to Santa Paula and many
school sites provide recreational activities and open space. This plan recommends the
development of a Quimby Ordinance and the preparation of a five-year Capital Improvement
Plan for park and recreation facilities. Also, the presence of the Los Padres National Forest just
north of Santa Paula provides year-round active and passive recreational opportunities.

             III. IMPLICATIONS OF GENERAL PLAN BUILD-OUT
A. Opportunities and Constraints within the Planning Area
As development proceeds within the newly updated 1998 Sphere of Influence (existing City
corporate boundary plus the expansion areas), there will be issues and constraints that must be
addressed to avoid certain hazards. There will also be many opportunities for conservation of
resources that still exist within the urban environment. The general constraints and
conservation opportunities for development within the City are addressed below. Constraints
and opportunities in the expansion areas are further described in Section B, Opportunities and
Constraints within the Expansion Areas.
        Constraints.
        Airport Operations. Most of the area south of the freeway is in the traffic pattern zone
of the Santa Paula Airport. Under the Airports Comprehensive Land Use Plan Update for Ventura
County (1991), land uses are restricted in this area for safety reasons, and are primarily limited
to activities which minimize human exposure to aviation hazards. For example, residential
development would be limited to lower densities, subject to Airport Land Use Commission
approval. Industrial and commercial development would be similarly restricted. Within the
inner and outer safety zones at either end of the runway, land uses are further restricted;
residential development is not allowed. Public gathering places (schools, churches, hospitals)
would not be allowed anywhere in the general traffic pattern area. The City is pursuing
strategies to eliminate residential uses from these hazard areas. This plan endorses continuing
to implement all safety recommendations in the Airports Land Use Plan.
        Flooding. Flood hazards are a major constraint to development in the City. About half
the City is located in the 100-year flood zone of Santa Paula Creek. As of 1994, about 3,200
parcels in the City are located in the flood plain (as defined by FEMA), including over 2,300
residential properties. Other areas are in the flood plains of Fagan Barranca, Adams Barranca,
and the Santa Clara River. Several projects to remove portions of the City from the flood zone
are currently under consideration. None is more important, or would have as important an
economic impact, than the Santa Paula Creek improvement project, a project endorsed by this
plan. A second flood control project relates to the Santa Clara River Enhancement and
Management Plan, which has defined a Public Levy and Bank Protection Line. This line is
endorsed in this plan as the extent of City-sponsored flood control improvements for the Santa
Clara River.
Portions of the expansion areas are also subject to flood hazards. The area adjacent to Adams
Barranca is of particular concern, as floodwaters sometimes back up north of the freeway. The
constraints would be largely eliminated with the construction of new flood control facilities
upstream, possibly in Adams Canyon as part of new development.
The other area of concern is east of Santa Paula Creek, along the freeway. Most of this area is in
the 100-year flood zone of Santa Paula Creek, and localized flooding is a common occurrence
                                               CO-31
after a significant rainfall. Development in the areas east of Santa Paula Creek would be
contingent on the implementation of the flood control project on the creek.
         Geologic Hazards. Several seismic hazards affect City lands. The Oak Ridge Fault,
which parallels the Santa Clara River, may be the source of a significant earthquake in the
future. The groundshaking effects from an earthquake would likely be similar throughout the
City. However, the southern portion of the City, up to about Main Street, has a high
liquefaction potential due the high ground water table in this area. Consequently, seismic
events would be more likely to cause structural damage here than in other areas with a lower
ground water table. The liquefaction potential increases on lands that are closer to the Santa
Clara River. This plan, through its Safety Element, includes numerous geologic hazard
protection policies.
         Conservation Opportunities.
         Historic Buildings and Districts. Santa Paula has one of the best collection of historic
structures of any community in Southern California. Numerous historic resources related to the
founding of the City and its growth and development between 1873 and 1945 are located within
the present City limits. Included are commercial and residential land uses in the urban
subdivisions of the original Santa Paula townsite, as well as many other areas. Many
agricultural buildings which were at one time located outside the City, still remain even as the
City grows around them.
The development of the City's historic downtown followed the traditional, pre-World War II
pattern, with narrow lots, rear alleyways, and one- and two-story buildings with facades
constructed adjacent to front property lines. While the first generation of wood frame
commercial buildings are gone, the majority of their brick replacements remain, with a large
degree of architectural integrity intact. These resources should be maintained and protected.
Historic districts should be established, and strict architectural guidelines should apply to
development in such areas. The preservation of this resource is critical to the local visitor and
tourist economy, which depends in part on its unique historic character.
         Santa Paula Wastewater Treatment Plant. The wastewater treatment plant can produce
more than 2,000,000 gallons of reclaimed wastewater each day which could be used for a variety
of purposes such as the construction of a golf course or the establishment of wetland preserves.
There is a growing demand for wetlands mitigation banking, where a wetland is established at
one location as mitigation for losses at another site. Reclaimed wastewater may also be used for
various industrial uses or for groundwater basin recharge.
         Habitat. Small pockets of native habitats still exist along creeks and barrancas as well as
the large expanses along the Santa Clara River. When considering new development or flood
control projects, these areas should be maintained and protected.
The Santa Clara River flows south of the City, and is probably the most important natural
resource in the Santa Paula area. The river presents opportunities to conserve important
riparian/wetland habitat. A few parcels at the east end of the City south of the freeway are
adjacent to the river. Future planning efforts in these areas should emphasize conservation of
                                              CO-32
this crucial resource. Open space buffers should be included between future development and
the river. These buffers could include agriculture, natural open space, parks, or continued
aggregate operations, if compatible with proposed development.
        Urban Forest. The many existing native trees that grow on private property are a
resource for the urban environment that should be protected through ordinance standards for
tree removal as well as project specific restrictions. The urban forest should be promoted
through a city sponsored street tree planting program as well as requirements for new
development.
        Aggregate Resources. The Santa Clara River is an important source of high quality
aggregate (sand and gravel) resources. Much of the area east of Santa Paula Creek supported
mining operation at one time. Today, most of this area has been converted to industrial or
commercial uses. Only a small portion of the aggregate mining operation still exists. There is a
small potential of maintaining this resource within the planning area. A greater potential exists
for excavation of materials for flood control purposes.
        Agriculture. A little over 200 acres, or about half of the land within the 1978 Sphere of
Influence is in agricultural production. Most of the larger unincorporated parcels in the
planning area are in agriculture, typically avocados, lemons, or oranges. None of these parcels
are located in a greenbelt area, and most are not under Land Conservation Act (LCA) contract.
The only agricultural parcels still under LCA contract are in the large parcels north of Steckel
Drive (north of Foothill Road and Anacapa Terrace). Much of the agriculture in the planning
area is cultivated on prime farmland, including nearly all the area on the west side of town
north and south of the freeway. This plan will endorse planning techniques to address
compatibility between developed areas and agricultural areas.
        Scenic Resources. The unincorporated areas located at either end of the City are
adjacent to SR 126, which is an eligible state scenic highway. Development in these areas
should be sensitive to the fact that they are at the gateway of the City, and should complement
the existing character of the City. For example, there are good opportunities for commercial or
industrial development at either end of the City. Special architectural standards should be
addressed for development at the gateway of the City, with attention to building design,
materials, and signage that reflect the area's heritage.
        Ventura County Transportation Commission Santa Paula Branch Line Right-of-Way. In
1996, the Ventura County Transportation Commission purchased the entire 32-mile Santa Paula
branch line extending from near U.S. Highway 101 in Ventura to about three miles east of Piru.
A hiking and bicycle trail is proposed along with continued rail use, future commuter rail use
and other possibilities. The trail could become the backbone of a significant system of non-
motorized transportation.
The rail line traverses unincorporated areas at the City's eastern and western boundaries. If
these areas are annexed, the corridor could provide recreational and transportation
opportunities. At the east end of town, a multi-purpose trail along this right-of-way could link
with a similar trail along Santa Paula Creek, which should be included as part of the proposed
flood control improvements along the creek.
                                               CO-33
        Santa Paula Creek Flood Protection Improvement Project. The U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers is actively studying flood control options for Santa Paula Creek. A new project
approach is being undertaken using a natural-bottom channel with sloping sides, alleviating the
need for a massive dam structure. This project, anticipated to be completed in 1999, would
improve development potential on the east bank of the creek. In addition, passive recreation
uses could be allowed in the areas adjacent to the Creek once improvements to the channel have
been made.
B. Opportunities and Constraints within the Expansion Areas
The following discussion highlights constraints and conservation opportunities affecting the
expansion areas. These expansion areas are proposed to be added to the City’s 1978 Sphere of
Influence and eventually annexed in a phased process. Each of these issues will need to be
addressed in project specific studies as build-out occurs.
East Area 1 and 2
        Constraints.
        Flood Hazard. The area is located within the 100-year flood plain of both Santa Paula
Creek and Orcutt Creek. Santa Paula Creek in particular poses a significant constraint to
development, as the flood zone extends about a mile eastward of the creek into the neighboring
farmlands. The proposed flood control improvements to this creek would significantly reduce
this constraint. However, improvements to Orcutt Creek would probably be necessary to allow
more extensive development near Orcutt Road.
        Geologic Hazards. The area is located 1-2 miles north of the Oak Ridge Fault, a major
fault which may be the source of a significant earthquake in the future. In addition, a small
unnamed fault traverses the area west of Orcutt Road. The groundshaking effects from an
earthquake would likely be similar here as elsewhere in the City. However, the southern
portion of the area, up to a half-mile north of the freeway, has a high liquefaction potential due
the high ground water table in this area. Consequently, seismic events would be more likely to
cause structural damage here than in other areas with a lower ground water table. As a rule,
liquefaction potential increases as one moves closer to the Santa Clara River.
        Conservation Opportunities.
        Santa Paula Creek Flood Protection Improvement Project. A comprehensive flood
control project on Santa Paula Creek would offer conservation opportunities, including habitat
enhancement and protection of existing agricultural and urban development. The U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers is actively studying flood control options for Santa Paula Creek. A new
project approach is being undertaken using a natural-bottom channel with sloping sides,
alleviating the need for a massive dam structure. This project, anticipated to be completed by
1999l would be necessary before development could occur in the areas east of the creek. In
addition, passive recreation uses could be allowed in the areas adjacent to the Creek once
improvements to the channel have been made.
                                              CO-34

         Historic Buildings. The area east of Santa Paula Creek has a rich agricultural heritage.
The area is associated with Charles C. Teague, who was an influential figure in both local and
statewide agricultural industry. Many ranch buildings and residences located in this area date
from the early 20th century, and are historically significant because of their association with
Santa Paula's economic heritage. This area offers opportunities to preserve these structures as
an important reminder of the City's agricultural history.
         Agriculture. All of the area east of Santa Paula Creek and north and south of SR 126 is
located in an established greenbelt that the City of Santa Paula shares with Fillmore. The area
includes significant agricultural cultivation, primarily avocados and other orchard crops on
parcels near the creek. Most of the area (nearly 700 acres) is under productive crop cultivation,
however, the property owners have indicated that some of this land is marginal for economic
agricultural production. All of the avocado orchards north of SR 126 are under Land
Conservation Act (LCA) contract. This includes most of the developable land north of the
freeway. LCA contracts are used by the State of California to preserve and maintain the
viability of agriculture by providing tax incentives for property owners who enter into such
agreements. In exchange, these lands cannot be converted to urban uses until the contract
expires, which can only occur once the property owner files a Notice of Non-Renewal. At this
time, none of the property owners have filed for non-renewal. Much of the productive
agricultural land in the Santa Clara River Valley east of the current City limit is either
considered prime or unique farmland. Most of the avocado orchards are on prime farmland.
Based on the State's Important Farmlands Inventory system, such prime farmland has the
highest potential for continued agricultural use. These lands should be preserved as long as
possible and buffered from urban development.
         Habitat. Santa Paula Creek flows along the western boundary of the area. The creek
presents limited opportunities to conserve riparian habitat. Habitat potential in this area would
be higher, except for the existing urban uses and channelization of the creek at the lower
reaches of the waterway. The Santa Clara River presents opportunities to conserve important
riparian/wetland habitat. Southern willow scrub and cottonwood-willow riparian forest are
identified as sensitive habitats found along the Santa Clara River. The yellow warbler and
yellow-breasted chat generally breed in riparian thickets, and have been reported breeding in
the river upstream of Santa Paula. Least Bell's vireo (listed by both the state and federal
government as endangered) also breeds in the river. To the extent possible, the habitat value of
this critical resource should be maintained. A comprehensive river study is currently being
prepared that addresses the ultimate use of the Santa Clara River corridor.
         Scenic Resources. All of the Santa Clara River Valley may be considered a scenic
resource. SR 126 and SR 150 are eligible state scenic highways. East of Santa Paula, excellent
views of the surrounding mountains as well as the agriculture contribute to the scenic quality of
the area. These resources should be maintained through as these areas develop.
         Linear Parkway. Santa Paula Creek is an identified scenic corridor. In conjunction with
the Circulation Element, this corridor is endorsed as a linear park system, including a multi-
purpose trail which links Telegraph Road to Ojai Road. Such a park would provide a buffer
between any more intensive urban development to the east and the sensitive habitat near the
creek. This park should include interpretive signage to educate the public about local flora and
                                                CO-35
fauna found near the creek.
The flood control improvements along Santa Paula Creek may afford limited recreation
opportunities. A multi-purpose trail along the creek would support the use of alternative
modes of transportation while increasing public awareness of the value of the creek as a natural
resource. The Santa Paula Creek flood control project may present important conservation and
limited recreation opportunities. The flood control project should also be viewed as a
prerequisite to any development in this area.
West Area 2
         Constraints.
         Flood Hazard. Adams Barranca runs along the western boundary of this area. After
heavy rainfall, the portion of Adams Barranca immediately north of SR 126 is subject to
flooding, as runoff backs up against the freeway. This hazard is not shown on the Federal
Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) 100-Year flood map. Flood control measures would
be required prior to development of the land in this general area. There are two possible
solutions to this problem. Downstream improvements which allow for better flow under the
freeway could be constructed in conjunction with development in the area. Alternatively,
development in Adams Canyon could provide flood control measures (retention basins, for
example) which regulates downstream flow. Either approach could work, but the provision of
appropriate retention basins in Adams Canyon would reduce or eliminate the need for
downstream improvements. Consequently, the planned development (or conservation) of the
entire Adams Barranca/Canyon watershed should be coordinated from the outset.
         Geologic Hazards. The area is located 1-2 miles north of the Oak Ridge Fault, a major
fault which may be the source of a significant earthquake in the future. The groundshaking
effects from an earthquake would likely be similar here as elsewhere in the City. However, the
southern portion of the area, up to about Telegraph Road, has a high liquefaction potential due
the high ground water table in this area. Consequently, seismic events would be more likely to
cause structural damage here than in other areas with a lower ground water table. As a rule,
liquefaction potential increases closer to the Santa Clara River.
         Conservation Opportunities.
         Historic Buildings. The area west of the current City limits has a rich historic
agricultural heritage. The area is associated with George G. Briggs, who originally subdivided
the area for agricultural purposes in 1867. Some of the valley's most significant farmhouses in
terms of age, architectural styles, and historical importance are located along Telegraph Road,
including a large number of Victorian-era farmhouses dating from the 1870’s through the
1890’s. In addition, these farmhouses have maintained their historic agricultural setting from
that time, a fact which enhances their significance.
         Agriculture (Greenbelt). All of the area west of the City in the Santa Clara River Valley
has high agricultural potential. Most of this area supports a mixture of orchards, including
lemons, avocados and oranges. The Calavo and Limoneira plants are located nearby, and are
                                               CO-36

the largest area agricultural businesses growing avocados and lemons, respectively. The
agricultural industry has been entrenched in the areas just west of the City for well over 100
years, and is one of the most important facets of the local economy. Surprisingly, none of the
area east of Adams Barranca is located in the Ventura-Santa Paula greenbelt. However, many
Santa Paulans believe that it is, and the City of Santa Paula has historically not pursued urban
expansion into this area largely for that reason. The Land Use Element calls for no urban
expansion beyond Adams Barranca to maintain these areas in agriculture and to maintain the
physical buffer between Santa Paula and the neighboring City of Ventura. Most of the parcels
west of the City and east of Adams Barranca are not under LCA contract. One large parcel in
lemon production (located south of the freeway) is under contract. Consequently, LCA
contracts do not present a significant constraint to future planning efforts affecting this area.
Much of the productive agricultural land in the Santa Clara River Valley west of the current
City limit is either considered prime farmland or farmland of statewide importance. Most of
the area is prime farmland, including nearly all of the area south of the freeway and east of
Adams Barranca. Based on the State's Important Farmlands Inventory system, such prime
farmland has the highest potential for continued agricultural use.
        Scenic Resources. All of the Santa Clara River Valley may be considered a scenic
resource. SR 126 and SR 150 are eligible state scenic highways. West of Santa Paula, excellent
views of the surrounding mountains as well as the agriculture contribute to the scenic quality of
the area. Good views of the Santa Clara River may also be obtained from the freeway. This
resource should be maintained through Conservation Element policies.
Adams Canyon
        Constraints.
        Topography. Adams Canyon is topographically diverse, from the more level areas near
the Creek, to the steep hillsides which surround the area. Any development which occurs in the
canyon would be subject to topographic constraints, and would be generally be limited to the
areas with a gentler slope. It is estimated that about 2,000 acres in the canyon support low to
moderate slopes ranging between 0% and 25%.
        High Fire Hazard. All of Adams Canyon is within a high fire hazard risk area.
Historically, Adams Canyon has experienced many wildland fires, most recently a 1993 blaze
which blackened thousands of acres in the mountains northwest of Santa Paula. The 1985
Ferndale fire also burned through Adams Canyon. The steep slopes and thick brush in the
canyon contribute to the spread of fires into other areas. New development in this area would
be at high risk. If development occurs, a secondary access to the canyon would be necessary,
primarily to accommodate emergency vehicles and provide an evacuation route in the event
such as a wildfire. It may be possible to construct a secondary road that provides access to
Santa Paula Canyon from SR 150 in the vicinity of Steckel Park. This road could follow the
basic alignment of an existing service road connecting the two canyons. Much of Adams
Canyon is beyond the acceptable response time radius from existing fire stations. As a
mountainous area with a high fire risk, fast emergency response is critical. It may be necessary
to construct a substation either in the canyon or near the canyon in the event that development
occurs.
                                               CO-37
         Geologic Hazards. Adams Canyon has relatively few geologic hazards in comparison
with other portions of the Santa Paula area. A portion of the Steckel Fault underlies the upper
reaches of the canyon, and the mouth of the canyon is about two miles north of the Oak Ridge
Fault, often cited as the most likely source of a significant earthquake centered in the area. In
the event of a major earthquake, ground shaking in the canyon would be similar to that
experienced elsewhere near Santa Paula, no matter which fault the quake would be centered on.
The steep canyon walls are subject to landslides in the event of an earthquake. Mudslides can
occur following heavy rains. Landslides can also occur in steeply sloped areas. Liquefaction
and subsidence potential are low.
         Flood Control. Adams Canyon, like other canyons, is inherently subject to localized
flooding, particularly after significant rainfall. Potential residential development in Adams
Canyon would require flood retention basin facilities to mitigate flooding and drainage impacts.
 A secondary benefit of this would be to minimize downstream flooding impacts along Adams
Barranca. Flood control facilities constructed in Adams Canyon may reduce or eliminate the
need for downstream facilities in the event development occurs on the valley floor vicinity of
Adams Barranca.
         Conservation Opportunities.
         Habitat. Adams Canyon supports significant wildlife habitat, including oak woodland,
grassland and coastal sage scrub habitat. Deer, bobcat, and coyote are among the larger
mammals that have been observed in the canyon, as have a variety of birds and reptiles. Oaks
and sycamores are among the native vegetation found in the canyon. Impacts to these
resources could be significant, depending on the extent of proposed development. The
preservation of native vegetation, such as oaks and sycamores, is a policy of this Conservation
Element and are endorsed in this plan.
         Agriculture. The City's greenbelt agreement with Ventura includes lands located west
of Adams Barranca, but this greenbelt does not include a northern or southern boundary. It is
unclear if the mountainous areas, including Adams Canyon, are subject to the greenbelt
agreement. However, the intent of the agreement is to preserve agriculture, and to provide an
open space buffer between the urban areas of Ventura and Santa Paula. Development in
Adams Canyon affords an opportunity to properly define the Santa Paula-Ventura greenbelt
agreement in conjunction with the General Plan update process. Most of the agricultural
activity in the canyon is limited to grazing. However, there are a few parcels that support
orchards, including one large property at the mouth of the canyon in lemon production. None
of these parcels are under Land Conservation (LCA) contracts. Small portions of the canyon
floor, particularly near the creek, are considered prime farmland based on the Important
Farmlands Inventory criteria. However, most of Adams Canyon is not considered prime
farmland.
         Petroleum Resources. The upper reaches of Adams Canyon have long been used for
petroleum extraction. This area is located on a historically important oil field. Although the
value and utility of oil extraction in the area has declined over the last decades, such activities
can still be productive on a limited basis. Setbacks and buffers will be needed between any new
                                                CO-38
residential and commercial development in the canyon and these petroleum resources.
        Scenic Resources. Adams Canyon is a scenic resource that currently is largely
inaccessible to the general public. Currently, no public roadway serves the canyon. However,
Adams Canyon is one of several canyons in the area which contribute to the scenic beauty of the
Santa Paula area. The canyon's scenic qualities include excellent views of the surrounding
hillsides, rock formations, and native oaks, in a pastoral setting. The basic character of the area
would be changed in the event of urban development. However, most of this development
would not be visible from the valley floor, or scenic roadways serving the area, such as Foothill
Road or SR 126. The canyon's aesthetic qualities should be maintained in future development
proposals. As development occurs, it should be sensitive to the natural amenities of the canyon,
and should preserve views of the surrounding hillsides and natural vegetation. Clustering
techniques, as described in the Land Use Element, can help in preserving scenic canyon areas.
Fagan Canyon
        Constraints.
        Topography. Like all the rugged areas north of the City, Fagan Canyon is
topographically diverse, from the more level areas near the canyon floor, to the steep hillsides
which surround the area. Any development which occurs in the canyon would be subject to
topographic constraints, and would be limited to the areas with a gentler slope. About 1,000
acres within the canyon support low to moderately-sloping terrain ranging from 0% to 25%.
        High Fire Hazard. All of Fagan Canyon is within a high fire hazard risk area. Like all
the rugged areas north of the City, Fagan Canyon has experienced or been threatened by many
wildland fires, including the 1993 Steckel Park blaze. The steep slopes and thick brush in the
canyon contribute to the spread of fires into other areas. New development in this area would
be at high risk. In addition to improving general traffic flow, a secondary access to the canyon
would be necessary to accommodate emergency vehicles and provide an evacuation route in
the event such as a wildfire. It may be possible to construct a secondary road that provides
access to Santa Paula Canyon from SR 150 in the vicinity of Mupu School. This road could
follow the basic alignment of an existing service road connecting the two canyons. An Adams-
Fagan Canyon roadway connection would serve a similar purpose.
        Geologic Hazards. Fagan Canyon has relatively few geologic hazards in comparison
with other portions of the Santa Paula area. The mouth of the canyon is about two miles north
of the Oak Ridge Fault, often cited as the most likely source of a significant earthquake centered
in the area. In the event of a major earthquake, ground shaking in the canyon would be similar
to that experienced elsewhere near Santa Paula, no matter which fault the quake would be
centered on. The steep canyon walls are subject to landslides in the event of an earthquake.
Mudslides can occur following heavy rains. Landslides are an issue in steeply sloping areas.
Liquefaction and subsidence potential are low.
        Flood Control. Depending on its intensity, new development may require significant
flood control infrastructure, including a retention basin. Downstream flood impacts in the City
would be minimal.
                                              CO-39
        Conservation Opportunities.
        Habitat. Fagan Canyon supports significant wildlife habitat, including grassland and
coastal sage scrub habitat. There is also a limited amount of oak woodland habitat in the
canyon. The preservation of native vegetation, including oaks, is a goal of the current general
plan. In addition, a variety of wildlife, including deer, coyote, and birds inhabit the area.
Impacts to these resources could be significant, depending on the extent of proposed
development.
        Agriculture. The lower part of Fagan Canyon supports a variety of orchard crops.
Avocados are grown on one large parcel in the lower part of Fagan Canyon adjacent to the City,
while another nearby parcel is used for lemon production. The less accessible parts of Fagan
Canyon are used primarily for ranching activities. Fagan Canyon is not located in an
established greenbelt. The only parcels under LCA contract are in the lower part of the canyon.
 These parcels support avocado and lemon groves. The remaining parcels in Fagan Canyon are
not under LCA contract. Most of Fagan Canyon is not prime farmland. Only the area
immediately adjacent to Fagan Barranca (in the lower part of the canyon) qualifies as prime
farmland under the state's Important Farmlands Inventory system.
        Petroleum Resources. Like Adams Canyon, the upper reaches of Fagan Canyon have
long been used for petroleum extraction. Although the value and utility of oil extraction in the
area has declined over the last decades, such activities can still be productive on limited basis.
Setbacks and buffers will be needed between any new residential and commercial development
in the canyon and these petroleum resources.
        Scenic Resources. Fagan Canyon is a scenic resource that it is largely inaccessible to the
general public. No public roadway serves the canyon. However, Fagan Canyon is one of
several nearby canyons which contribute to the scenic beauty of the Santa Paula area. The
canyon's scenic qualities include excellent views of the surrounding hillsides and the native
vegetation. Like Adams Canyon, the basic character of the area would be changed in the event
of urban development. However, most of this development would not be visible from the
currently developed portions of the City. The canyon's aesthetic qualities should be maintained
through the general plan process. As development occurs, it should be sensitive to the natural
amenities of the canyon, and should preserve views of the surrounding hillsides and natural
vegetation. Clustered development is one technique that can assist in preserving views and is
endorsed in this plan.
South Mountain
        Constraints.
        Access. Access to the South Mountain area is limited. Currently, only the Twelfth Street
bridge at the east end of the City provides access across the river. This bridge connects to South
Mountain Road, the only public roadway serving development on the south side of the river.
Periodic landslides on South Mountain Road illustrate the problems of poor access, as the area can
be temporarily cut off from destinations on the south side of the river east of the City.
                                               CO-40
In addition, there is currently no direct freeway access to the South Mountain area. If
substantial new development were envisioned, another bridge linking the area to the City
should be considered, possibly at Palm Avenue. This would not only provide direct freeway
access, but would establish another access route to the portions of the City north of the river.
         Sewer Infrastructure. Although sewer service could be easily provided to the area, a new
pumping station would be required to pump sewage through a pipeline in the proposed Palm
Avenue bridge or through a pipeline buried in the river bed. Other utilities would be relatively
easy to provide in this area.
         Geologic Hazards. The area is located near the Oak Ridge Fault, a major fault that may be
the source of a significant earthquake in the future. In addition, the several smaller faults also
parallel the Santa Clara River in the vicinity of South Mountain. The groundshaking effects from an
earthquake would likely be similar here as elsewhere in the City. However, the areas between
South Mountain Road and the river have a high liquefaction potential due the high ground water
table. Consequently, seismic events would be more likely to cause structural damage here than in
other areas with a lower ground water table. As a rule, liquefaction potential increases as one
moves closer to the Santa Clara River.
         Flood Hazard. The area is located adjacent to the Santa Clara River. However, most of the
area is not located within the river's 100-year flood zone. There are large, relatively flat areas
currently in agriculture that are outside the flood zone. Most of these areas are located between
roughly Twelfth Street and Steckel Drive. Nevertheless, parcels adjacent to the river are still subject
to river erosion and other flood-related impacts.
         Airport Operations. Most of the area at the base of South Mountain is in the traffic pattern
zone of the Santa Paula Airport. Under the Airports Comprehensive Land Use Plan Update For
Ventura County, land uses are restricted in this area for safety reasons, and are primarily limited to
activities which minimize human exposure to aviation hazards. For example, residential
development would be limited to lower densities, subject to Airport Land Use Commission
approval. Industrial and commercial development would be similarly restricted. Within the safety
zones at either end of the runway, land uses are further restricted; residential development is not
allowed. Public gathering places (schools, churches, hospitals) would not be allowed anywhere in
the general traffic pattern area.
         Conservation Opportunities.
         Wildlife Habitat. The Santa Clara River flows through the South Mountain area, and is
probably the most important natural resource in the Santa Paula area. The river presents
opportunities to conserve important riparian/wetland habitat. Southern willow scrub and
cottonwood-willow riparian forest are identified as sensitive habitats found along the Santa Clara
River. The yellow warbler and yellow-breasted chat generally breed in riparian thickets, and have
been reported breeding in the river upstream of Santa Paula. Least Bell's vireo (listed by both the
state and federal government as endangered) also breeds in the river. To the extent possible, the
habitat value of this critical resource should be maintained.
                                                 CO-41
A comprehensive river study is currently being prepared that addresses the ultimate use of the
Santa Clara River corridor. The City of Santa Paula is represented on the steering committee. The
City's representative should be responsible for coordinating this regional planning effort with the
City's general plan update.
         Petroleum Resources. South Mountain has historically been an important site for oil
extraction. Much of the area underlying South Mountain, as well as much of the more level land
south of the airport is identified as an important petroleum resource area. This resource area
extends along the face of South Mountain, roughly paralleling the Santa Clara River. Development
should be limited in this area to preserve the petroleum extraction potential for the future.
         Aggregate Resources. The Santa Clara River is an important source of high quality
aggregate (sand and gravel) resources. Aggregate mining is a lucrative and economically
important industry in the Santa Paula area. However, aggregate mining must be balanced with the
goal of preserving the river's wildlife value.
         Agriculture. Much of the low-lying area at the base of South Mountain supports
agricultural uses, including mixed orchards and oranges. In all, about 200 acres are in
cultivation. Although not considered as important a resource as the fields east and west of the
City, it is nevertheless a productive and viable agricultural area.
Nearly all of the non-urbanized low-lying areas south of the river is considered prime farmland
based on the state's Important Farmland Inventory system. This is due to the rich alluvial soil,
which produces excellent orchard crops. The portion of the area generally east of South
Mountain Road is within the Santa Paula-Fillmore Greenbelt. However, none of the parcels in
the area are under Land Conservation Act (LCA) contract.

                      IV. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
According to the State General Plan Guidelines, the General Plan is a “collection of
development policies.” These policies guide growth within the city limits and the city’s Sphere
of Influence. The development that is allowed by the Land Use Element is to be directed by the
goals, objectives, and policies in this section of the Conservation and Open Space Element, and
implemented through the related implementation measures contained in the following section.
In this element, GOALS are statements that provide direction and state the desired end
condition. The OBJECTIVES state a specific step toward goal achievement. POLICIES are
specific statements that guide decision-making. They indicate a clear commitment by the city
and generally serve as mandatory criteria. The IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES outlined in
the following section of this element support the goals, objectives, and policies by providing
specific programs and standards to carry out the Conservation and Open Space Plan.
The goals, objectives, and polices that follow are organized according to topics. These topics
were selected with input from the Santa Paula City Council and the General Plan Advisory
Committee as important topics for the General Plan. Many of the goals and objectives were
endorsed by the City Council for use in the General Plan Update process. Following each
policy statement are the number(s) of implementing strategy(s) that carry out the policy
direction.

This section of the Conservation and Open Space Element indicates the actions and programs
that shall be carried out by the City of Santa Paula to implement the conservation and open
space goals, objectives, and polices. These implementation measures, together with the polices,
establish and guide the City’s annual budget process and day-to-day decision-making so there
is continuing process toward attainment of the goals. Some policies and implementing
measures may need to be re-examined and revised during the plan’s time frame (2020). The
implementation measures presented below are categorized by the same topics as the goals,
objectives, and polices in the preceding section. Implementation measures with a letter
following the measure number (i.e., 29a) have been added during revision, update, or
amendment processes. This number/letter system is intended so that the numbering system is
not affected by any subsequent additions or revisions to implementation measures.

        culvert unless daylight is visible).
29g.    Project scheduling shall consider the sensitive reproductive periods of wildlife and
        avoid disturbance to natural habitats during critical breeding, nesting/denning or
        fledging periods.
29h.    Recreation planning shall consider the location of sensitive biological resources and shall
        avoid direct and indirect disturbance of these areas.

        For example, horses should be excluded from entry into wetland and riparian areas.
29k.    Natural migration corridors shall be protected and preserved, with planning for the safe
        passage of wildlife under busy roadways. Adams Barranca, which presently offers
        nearly unrestricted movement opportunities from the foothills to the Santa Clara River
        drainage, shall be maintained in a condition to promote wildlife movement.
29l.    New passages intended for use as wildlife movement corridors (i.e., under roadways)
        must be designed to direct or ‘funnel’ large animals toward the passageway. This may
        be achieved through a combination of fencing and dense barrier plantings, as well as the
        placement of drinking water and vegetative screening for cover.
29m.    Homebuyers of property in the Adams Canyon and Fagan Canyon shall be issued
        educational literature describing the types of wildlife habitat in which they live, and the
        appropriate methods of interacting with such animals, including coyotes, deer,
        mountain lions and various smaller mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians.
        Appropriate methods of reducing disturbance to such animals, including lighting,
        landscaping and fencing methods, shall be addressed. Such literature shall be
        developed at the expense of the developers of these areas. This measure must be

                                   I. PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
A. Role and Purpose of the General Plan
The General Plan is the fundamental policy document of the City of Santa Paula. It defines the
framework by which the City’s physical and economic resources are to be managed and used in
the future. This General Plan’s planning horizon is the year 2020. The Santa Paula General Plan
Update project has been named Vision 2020, to reflect this. This plan was developed with input
from the General Plan Advisory Committee, who came together at six workshops from January to
July 1997 to provide direction and input. A total of 31 meetings were held from 1993 to April
1998 regarding the General Plan Update. City decision-makers will use the plan as a blueprint
for:
                   Choices about the use of land;
                   Conservation and development of new housing;
                   Provision of supporting infrastructure and public and human services;
                   Protection of environmental resources;
                   Protection of people and property from natural and man-made hazards;
                   Allocation of fiscal resources;
                   Population growth; and
                   Expansion of City boundaries.
The General Plan clarifies and articulates the City’s intentions with respect to the rights and
expectations of the community, including residents, property owners, and businesses. Through
the Plan, the City informs these groups of its goals, policies, and standards, thereby
communicating expectations of the public and private sectors for meeting community objectives.
B. State Requirements
California State Law, Government Code Section 65302(a), requires that a Land Use Element be
prepared as part of a city’s General Plan, as follows:
           A land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and general location
           and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including
           agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public
           buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of
           public and private uses of land. The land use element shall include a statement of the
           standard of population density and building intensity recommended for the various
           districts and other territory covered by the plan. The land use element shall identify areas
           covered by the plan which are subject to flooding and shall be reviewed annually with
           respect to those areas.
In response to this mandate, the Santa Paula General Plan Land Use Element contains a written
description of each allowed land use as well as a map indicating the location and extent of each
type of land use. Population density and building intensity for each land use type is defined.
Specific information on mineral resources and flooding that are of concern to Santa Paula is
included. Finally, policy statements and implementation measures that carry out identified goals
are also presented.

              II. EXISTING CONDITIONS AND COMMUNITY ISSUES
A. Community Character
           Overview. The City of Santa Paula is located 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles and 14
miles east of Ventura. It is the geographical center of Ventura County and is situated in the rich
agricultural Santa Clara Valley. The City is surrounded by rolling hills and rugged mountain
peaks, in addition to orange, lemon, and avocado groves. Santa Paula is referred to as the “Citrus
Capital of the World.” It is a major distribution point for citrus fruits in the United States. The
region is noted for major avocado producing and processing. Figure LU-1 shows the regional
location of Santa Paula.
In 1997, the population of Santa Paula is approximately 26,500, inhabiting 4.5 square miles within
the City limits. Santa Paula prides itself in being a bicultural community where citizens work
together for the betterment of the City. Approximately 59% of the people have Hispanic origins.
The community was part of a Spanish land grant to Rancho Santa Paula and Saticoy in 1840. In
the 1860's, it was subdivided into small farms. Some of these farms were further subdivided as
the town began to take shape. After important oil discoveries in the late 19 th Century, the Union
Oil Company was founded in Santa Paula in 1890. This industry, along with agriculture, became
the economic mainstay of the community. The City was incorporated in 1902. Today, Santa
Paula is still noted as a center for Ventura County’s agricultural industry. Limoneira is the
County’s largest and oldest agricultural business, and is based in Santa Paula’s planning area.
Although the oil industry has diminished in size and importance, tourism and film production
have grown. Santa Paula’s picturesque streets and scenic setting in the Santa Clara River Valley
have made it a favorite location for entertainment industry filming.
           Small Town Charm. Santa Paula has developed physically in a traditional style, with a
grid-pattern street system, prominent buildings of architectural interest, an identifiable
downtown, and tightly-knit surrounding residential neighborhoods. The community maintains a
small town image, ideal climate, and reasonably-priced housing, all of which make it a desirable
place to live. It has a dense development pattern compared to more sprawling suburban cities.
Most buildings are 1-2 stories tall with a small number of 3-story buildings. Many old oak trees
in town have been preserved, especially in the northeastern part of the City. The City has an
ordinance to protect native oaks, sycamores and other trees of historic or cultural significance.
These characteristics define the “urban form,” which is the physical and aesthetic characteristic of
the city.
Santa Paula is a relatively compact town. Policies to promote infill have been successful in
minimizing sprawl, and are to be continued. Higher densities are allowed in certain areas and
mixed-use should be encouraged (such as allowing new residences above shops). This land use
pattern will help preserve the agricultural land surrounding the city. In higher density zones,
smaller lots are allowed since this follows the historic development pattern and provides lower
land costs for development, thereby encouraging affordable housing.
The Land Use Element supports Santa Paula in preserving the urban form of a small town. Santa
Paula is beautiful, it functions well, and it can serve to attract both tourists and industry.

rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821    LU-4
The community has expressed a desire that older architectural styles of buildings in the
downtown be preserved as the city develops. New commercial areas should be designed with a
small-town image. Specific goals and policies that address urban form are included in this Land
Use Element.
           Natural Features. Santa Paula is nestled between the foothills of the Santa Paula
Mountains and the Santa Clara River. Citrus and avocado orchards and fields of row crops
border the City. Creeks and barrancas slice through the urban lands. Views of these resources
are available from many locations throughout the city and they should be maintained. It is a goal
of this Plan to enhance these natural features for the enjoyment of future generations.
           Historic Preservation. Santa Paula is one of the oldest cities in the county. A large
percentage of the buildings in town are more than 50 years old. There are a large number of
national, state and locally-designated historic structures in town, as well as a historic residential
district centered on the 600-900 block of Santa Paula Street. Certain districts of town, as well as
individual buildings, have been identified as having historic significance, and the community has
expressed sentiment that these resources should be preserved. The Land Use Element
incorporates policies and strategies to promote the preservation of Santa Paula’s past.
           Land Use Incompatibilities. There are some land use incompatibilities in Santa Paula.
Residences and other structures are located in areas near the airport. The Ventura County
Airport Land Use Plan specifies that these areas should be devoid of structures due to the risk of
accidents. Other concerns involve land uses near the railroad right-of-way bisecting the City that
may result in the exposure of people to noise and safety hazards. Finally, the City has received
numerous complaints from residents of the Hillview Estates community about the noise
generated by the Calavo plant to the east and by noise from trucks parked nearby. The Land Use
Element addresses the issue of incompatible uses with new policies and implementing strategies.
B. Existing Land Uses, Population, and Development Potential
           Existing Land Uses. The existing distribution of land uses in the City reflects over 100
years of building, much of which was developed before the advent of zoning controls. This
circumstance has led to the charm of the physical town as it appears today. On the other hand, it
has also led to some incompatible land uses near each other. There are also areas were the actual
land use and the General Plan land use designations are significantly different. This planning
process and the follow-up zoning studies address these inconsistencies.
In Santa Paula, the basic land uses that are needed to maintain the community are all located
within a compact, 4.5 square-mile area. This compact area, plus the grid-pattern street system
and mixed residential and commercial development, encourage walking and bicycling and
generally lend a human-scale to the community. Figure LU-2 illustrates the location and extent of
existing land uses in Santa Paula. The outward expansion of the City of Santa Paula has been
gradual but continuous since the community’s founding. The growth has been slow and steady,
and the City has not experienced the booms that have propelled the populations of the larger
cities past that of Santa Paula. Santa Paula’s growth has mostly been internally generated and
supported by local agriculture and the oil industry. The direction of growth has been controlled
by the geography of the area. Hills to the north, Santa Paula Creek to the east, and the Santa
Clara River to the south have directed most of the growth to the west onto former agricultural
lands.

rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821         LU-6
 Residential development is the single largest land use, encompassing over 37% of City lands
(Fugro West, 1994). Of the residential development, 80% is single-family homes. Commercial
development comprises less than 5% of the City’s area and industrial uses comprise about 6%.

As the table illustrates, little vacant land is left within the city limits, and what is available for
development is constrained by various environmental factors. Along the north edge of the city,
and into Santa Paula Canyon, a number of hillside parcels remain that are suitable only for
higher-cost single-family housing. West of town, mostly south of Telegraph Road, are a number
of parcels designated and zoned for industry, but the flood threat from Adams Barranca and the
cost of providing engineered flood control inhibits further development. A number of vacant
parcels exist between the freeway and the Santa Clara River. Again, development is difficult due
to the cost of building infrastructure to safeguard against flood threats. Finally, there is some
vacant land between the railroad tracks and the freeway, east of Santa Paula Creek. Flood threats
hinder major development in this area. In town, a few sites are available in and near the Santa
Paula Shopping Center -- one large parcel near the Santa Paula Shopping Center – one large
parcel near the Weyerhaeuser plant on Santa Barbara Street and a few other scattered properties.
The City of Santa Paula has been repeatedly advised by prospective industries that the lack of
contiguous vacant parcels is an impediment to locating businesses within the City. In general,
few vacant sites are available for all land use categories.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                     LU-7

Santa Paula has now built-out the majority of vacant land within the city limits except for the
difficult or constrained lands. This is due primarily to long-standing policies to encourage infill
development within the City before considering major outward expansion. Vacant land is
different than “open space.” Vacant land refers to undeveloped areas slated for more intensive
use under the General Plan. Open space refers to lands that are planned to remain undeveloped.
 The amount of existing vacant land within the City is estimated to be 285 acres; however, 81 of
these acres are within the flood zone of the Santa Clara River (Rincon, 1997; County Assessor,
1994). Therefore, only 204 acres of existing vacant land within the City are potentially
developable. Table LU-2 indicates the amount of vacant land in each land use category and the
resulting build-out potential.
                     Table LU-2. Existing Build-Out Potential on Vacant City Lands

           Build-out potential is taken from calculations in the Final Long-Range Land Use Absorption Study,
           1994 to 2020, Hausrath Economic Group, January 1997 and from the City of Santa Paula Planning
           Department estimates.
           Growth Management. The City’s Growth Management Ordinance was adopted in 1985
and provides for build-out of 124 residential units each year. For the next 23 years, the planning
period of the General Plan Update, the total number of units that would be allowed under the
current growth management principles would be 2,852 units as of 1997. There is also currently an
accumulation of 944 units (City of Santa Paula, Staff Report to the City Council, April 1997) that
have not been used in the past years. This brings a grand total of 3,796 units that would be
allowed (as of 1997) by the year 2020 in accordance with the Growth Management Ordinance.
           Population. The issue of population growth and how to accommodate that growth is a
key issue in planning for the future of the City. It affects all other issues in one way or another,
especially social and economic concerns. Although there is no state mandate relating to
population growth, the City is required to make adequate provision for the existing and projected
housing needs for all economic segments of the community. This Land Use Element addresses
the question of where growth should occur and how it should be regulated.
The current General Plan assumes a 1.5% population growth rate. Since the 1980 census, growth
has averaged about 1.4% per year. The Growth Management Ordinance limits residential growth
to approximately 124 dwelling units per year. Overcrowding is experienced within the City and
indicates that although the City can attempt to control development, there is no effective way to
control population.
The 1990 census showed a population figure of 25,062 for Santa Paula. This population was
comprised of 12,773 (49%) males and 13,289 (51%) females. Santa Paula’s census figures show the
following make-up of the City’s population:
           White                                59.3%               Immigration Population:

           black, American Indian, Asian or other race.
In 1997, the State of California estimates Santa Paula’s population to be 26,500. Over the next 23
years approximately 3,796 dwelling units could be built according to the Growth Management
Ordinance. If population growth were to be controlled exclusively by growth management, the
new residential development could result in a population increase of 11,388. Full buildout of the
Plan would result in a similar population increase, with the addition of 3,807 dwelling units and
11,420 persons. Added to today’s population of 26,500 this could result in a population of
approximately 37,920 by the year 2020. This is similar to an independent estimate of 38,300
projected by a 1997 study (Hausrath Economic Group, Final Long Range Land Use Absorption
Study). In addition to the above numbers, there are a range of future population projections for
Santa Paula. Population forecasts by several different sources are provided in Table LU-3 below.

C. Economic Development
The City’s economic health and well-being has been identified as a central goal of the General
Plan. A major reason the City has undertaken this General Plan Update is to address issues
affecting the City’s economic health and in order to provide land for development. A strong
economy is essential to Santa Paula’s future. Diverse businesses are needed to provide goods and
services to residents and other businesses so that retail spending does not “leak” from the City.
Retail activity is one of the most important revenue sources for local governments because it
generates sales tax. A robust retail sector provides more revenue for public services and facilities.
 Also, economic development creates jobs and incomes for residents. This is particularly
important in Santa Paula, where many residents presently earn incomes significantly below the
regional median.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                     LU-9

Several issues currently face Santa Paula’s economy. The first is the income of the City’s
residents. Many of Santa Paula’s residents are employed in agriculture and retail industries.
These sectors tend to be lower paying than services and manufacturing. According to the 1990
U.S. Census, median family income is $35,788, ranking last within the County, as shown in Table
LU-4.

                               Source: U.S. Census, 1990
Another economic issue is employment opportunities. Approximately 1/3 of the employed
persons living in Santa Paula work in the City. Over 7,000 residents commute to another place to
work. This pattern contributes to the sales tax leakage problem. Due to the lack of diversity of
goods and non-competitive prices offered by Santa Paula retailers compared to others within the
Ventura Market Area, many Santa Paula residents shop outside the community. This means a
loss of sales tax revenue to the City and less funding for the public services.
Much of the City’s housing stock has a low property tax assessed value due to its condition or as
a result of the Proposition 13 limitations on assessments. This limits the property tax revenues
received by the City’s primary land use type.
The City of Santa Paula is relatively compact. There are very few undeveloped areas within the
City. The City’s Sphere of Influence, which was adopted in 1978 and represents the probable
ultimate boundaries of the City, accommodates very little additional land area and cannot
accommodate the housing needs of the population projections. Therefore, the community has
identified the need to expand the 1978 Sphere of Influence boundary to allow for the City’s
expansion further into its Area of Interest.
The Land Use Element can assist the City’s economy by addressing the supply and type of
developable land. The land use supply, combined with other strategies, can assist in addressing
the lack of vacant/developable land, provision of land use designations of a size and location that
can assist in attracting job-generating development and retail uses that could address sales tax
leakage. New uses would also lead to reassessed property valuations, in providing increased
property tax revenue. The following issues are addressed in this Element:
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                    LU-10

               Reduce the amount of retail sales leakage by introducing competitive goods and services into the
                City that residents are now purchasing out of town.
               Encourage tourist attractions as a means of importing money to provide increased retail sales,
                employment opportunities and fiscal benefits.
               Increase household purchasing power by attracting more local jobs and higher paying jobs.
               Increase the City’s inventory of land available to provide for development of additional
                commercial and industrial sites.
               Increase the City’s inventory of land available for all economic segments of the population:
                including very low-, low-, moderate-, and high-income housing to help fund the services needed
                by the present citizens of Santa Paula and meet our projected housing needs.
               Provide land to accommodate housing opportunities as specified by the Regional Housing Needs
                Assessment.
In 1997, the City commissioned a study by Hausrath and Associates to determine the City’s
potential to capture future development. The Hausrath Land Absorption Study states that:
           “Should the City seek higher levels of growth, the strength of projected job growth within the
           Ventura Market Area indicates the potential for the City to seek redistribution of some of those jobs
           to its jurisdiction with an aggressive and effective economic development strategy. The City may
           become more successful than projected in attracting new businesses to the Ventura Market Area
           that would not have otherwise located in the area.”
Based on this theory, the Land Use Element presents aggressive commercial and industrial
development plans based on amending the Sphere of Influence and annexing new lands. The
Land Use Element also contains policies for Santa Paula to work ambitiously to capture more of
the area’s demand for these land uses. If successful, the strategy could lead to development that
would result in increased employment opportunities and the development and private or assisted
redevelopment of vacant and underdeveloped lands, which would increase the land value and
tax base. In the growth scenario projected in the Land Use Element, the City will need to capture
26% more of the Ventura Market Area demand for industrial uses than would be expected (five
times more than is projected in the Hausrath study), and 3% more than the projected commercial
space (nearly double that projected in the Hausrath study).
In the residential category, the 1997 Hausrath Land Absorption Study indicated that Santa Paula
can plan for as much residential growth as it may desire to achieve its goals and policies.
Therefore, the Land Use Element recommends large land additions through Sphere of Influence
amendments. This is to provide a mix of new housing types, with an emphasis on higher-cost
housing that would be an alternative to the existing housing stock and would provide a net
positive fiscal contributor to the City. Santa Paula is a desirable place to live with its small town
character, ideal climate, and reasonably priced housing. The Land Use Element capitalizes on
these assets and provides for aggressive residential growth.
D. Infrastructure/Public Service Issues
           Water Supply. In 1996, the City completed the purchase of the water company that serves
most City residents. The City’s water comes from the Santa Paula ground water basin, an
adjudicated basin. Water is pumped from wells to treatment facilities and then to tanks on the
hillside. Gravity flow feeds the City mains. Current water delivery capacity is considered
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                     LU-11

sufficient to meet the City’s current needs. However, additional capacity will be needed in the
form of additional wells, treatment facilities, and new tanks to support growth in the expansion
and planning areas. Although no short-term supply shortages are anticipated, significant long-
term issues may arise if the basin is over-drafted.
           Waste Water Treatment Capacity. Santa Paula owns and operates over 50 miles of sewer
lines and the City constructed a new Water Recycling Facility (WRF) for the treatment of sewage
generated by the City The new WRF began operations in May of 2010. The new facility has a
normal operating capacity of 3.15 MGD with a final build-out capacity of 4.2 MGD, and a peak
operating capacity of 7.0 MGD. This plant has the capacity to serve the population allowed by the
General Plan. The new WRF is a Membrane Bio-Reactor (MBR) and reduces energy costs by
more than 35%. The facility has a footprint of only 1.5 acres, and is completely enclosed for
maximum odor and noise control. The sewer lines are generally in good condition. . Sewer
repair and rehabilitation is an ongoing process, as sewers will continue to deteriorate and fail
over time. The City has been vigilant in their efforts to maintain the system. In continuing the
effort, the 2011 Sanitary Sewer Management Program was adopted, which contains system
procedures for daily maintenance activities. Review of videotapes has made it apparent that the
central or older portion of the City has more problem areas than other areas within the collection
system. The City's two lift stations were inspected and both lift stations are in the process of being
upgraded.
           Solid Waste Facility. The City provides refuse collection and disposal through direct
service and through contracts with private haulers. About 10,000 tons of refuse are collected
annually by the City and an additional 10,000 tons are collected by private haulers. The refuse is
disposed of at the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, located along State Route 126 (SR 126) in Los
Angeles County. The Toland Landfill, which lies between Santa Paula and Fillmore, has the
capacity to handle City demand for between 20 and 30 years. As of May 1997, the City was not
using the Toland facility. However, it is available for City use during the planning period.
           Areas Subject to Flooding. Santa Paula has historically been susceptible to flood hazards
because of the City is located at the confluence of two uncontrolled waterways, Santa Paula Creek
and the Santa Clara River. Approximately half of the City is located in the 100-year floodplain of
Santa Paula Creek. This floodplain will be reduced in size with the completion of improvements
to Santa Paula Creek. Several floods have occurred along these waterways in the past.
           The Santa Paula Creek Flood Control Project was constructed by the US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), Los Angeles District, in Santa Paula Creek between the confluence with the
Santa Clara River and Stewart’s Crossing. Construction occurred in three phases between 1997
and 2002. This Project was designed by the USACE to provide flood protection from a 28,000
cubic feet per second (cfs) design year storm. After these improvements were constructed,
subsequent hydrology studies completed by Ventura County Watershed Protection District and
the USACE determined the 100-year storm would result in 39,400 cfs in Santa Paula Creek, which
would result in flooding in the southern portion of the City as the Santa Paula Creek Flood
Control Project provides flood control protection for East Area 1 and most of the City located
north of Santa Paula Street. The City is coordinating with the Watershed Protection District and
the USACE to identify additional improvements to provide protection from flooding from Santa
Paula Creek.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821              LU-12

           Other areas are in the flood plains of Fagan Barranca, Adams Barranca, and the Santa
Clara River. The areas subject to flooding are illustrated in the Safety Element (Figure S-4). The
portions of town that are already developed or partially developed in the floodplain are not
prohibited from further growth, because the City has an ordinance regulating building in the
flood areas. It requires that various flood protection measures be taken. The most significant is
the requirement to build structures at elevations above the flood level. In most cases, this is just a
foot or two above ground elevation.
A flood-related topic is that of flooding from a dam failure. Santa Paula suffered one of the
greatest manmade disasters in the nation’s history when the Saint Francis Dam failed in 1928,
sending a wall of water through town. Today, four dams are upstream of Santa Paula. Should
one of the large dams fail suddenly, the City would have less than two hours warning, in which
time 2/3 to 3/4 of the population would need to be evacuated. The high water mark would
extend up Santa Paula Canyon into the Oaks area. It would then pass around the base of the hill
above the intersection of Tenth Street and Virginia Terrace and extend westward, passing
through the high school campus. However the likelihood of such a failure is extremely low. The
Land Use Element addresses flooding as follows:
            Requiring reasonable flood protection measures in all new land development projects.
            Outlining programs to reduce the flood threat from Santa Paula Creek, Fagan Barranca, and
               Adams Barranca.
            Restricting development adjacent to the Santa Clara River and Santa Paula Creek.
           Police and Fire Protection. The City provides police protection to the residents and
businesses within the City. Currently the City maintains a force of approximately 29 sworn police
officers, 20 reserve officers, nine full-time civilian employees, and eleven part-time civilian
employees. While the crime rate in Santa Paula is relatively high compared to other cities in
Ventura County, the rates are lower than other areas of the state. Crime rates have risen
moderately in the City over the past five years, but remain well below the state-wide average.
Santa Paula currently has an allocated level of service of slightly over one officer per 1,000
residents. The City would like to increase this service level to 1.25 officers per 1,000 residents.
Due to funding constraints, fewer officers are authorized and fewer services are provided.
Additional General Fund income from sales and property taxes would assist in the providing
funds for providing higher levels of police service.
The Santa Paula Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical response to the
City from two stations, one located at 114 South 10 th Street near City Hall and the other near the
corner of Steckel Drive and Main Street. The Department has a full-time Fire Chief and Assistant
Fire Chief/Fire Prevention Officer, and six full-time firefighters. There are 27 part-time/paid call
firefighters. On the average, the Department responds to 1,450 calls per year; approximately 70%
are medical calls 20% are fires and 10% are miscellaneous. Additional development in areas more
distant from the City core may require new fire facilities and full-time personnel.
           Schools. A majority of the Santa Paula planning area is served by five school districts:
Santa Paula Elementary School District, Santa Clara School District, Briggs School District, Mupu
School District, and Santa Paula Union High School District. Existing school service levels are as
follows:
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                 LU-13

              Current enrollment exceeds capacity at the Santa Paula Elementary School District so portable
               classrooms are used. The District maintains a standard of one classroom per 30 students. This
               standard has not been exceeded but there is some overcrowding.
              The Santa Clara School District’s one room elementary school is at capacity but District
               officials indicate there is room for expansion.
              The two schools in the Briggs School District have not reached capacity and overcrowding is
               not an issue.
              The one elementary school in the Mupu District has sufficient space to handle 1997 enrollment.
                However, the District desires to keep enrollment below 120 students. There is no room for
               expansion on the school grounds.
              The Santa Paula Union High School has a capacity of 1,600 students. It is currently serving
               1,386 students. There is little room for expansion on-site.
The State mandated standard of 20 students per classroom has affected the school districts’
abilities to provide adequate facilities to accommodate students. New development allowed
under the Land Use Plan will need to address school service issues to ensure that schools have
sufficient capacity and that they maintain acceptable student-to-teacher ratios.
E. Mineral Resources
The Santa Paula area contains significant aggregate (sand and gravel) mineral resources. Most of
the aggregate produced is extracted from Santa Paula Creek and the Santa Clara River. There are
also important petroleum resources in the Santa Paula area, particularly in the hills and
mountains surrounding the City. Local petroleum production has declined steadily in recent
years as the remaining oil has a very high sulfur content and because there are no refining
facilities operating locally. Mining of mineral resources is allowed in the Mineral Overlay Zone.
 F. The Santa Paula Airport
The Santa Paula Airport is a privately-held facility which serves primarily recreational aviation
users. The airport was constructed in 1930. It is subject to special planning under State Law. The
Ventura County Airports Comprehensive Land Use Plan is currently being updated under the
direction of the Ventura County Transportation Commission. The City has received special State
grants to assist in removing incompatible properties from the Airport’s clear zone to enhance
safety features. Because of physical constraints related to access and proximity to the Santa Clara
River channel, expansion of the airport is somewhat constrained. Noise and safety continue to be
an issue for land uses developing in close proximity to the airport. Nevertheless, it remains a
source of jobs, tax revenues, and a source of community pride. A number of antique airplanes are
displayed in hangars at the airport for public viewing.
G. Special Study Areas
This section of the Land Use Element addresses several City areas that have distinct planning
issues, constraints, and opportunities. These areas were identified though a series of public
workshops on the General Plan Update. Focused planning studies have addressed some of these
areas, as indicated in the text below. This General Plan incorporates these plans by reference and
supports them through the General Plan framework.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                      LU-14

           The Downtown Design Development Report/Improvement Plan Area. The Downtown
Design Development Report/Improvement Plan was approved in 1996. This plan provides
vision and guidelines for revitalization of the central core of Santa Paula. The goals include
preservation and enhancement of Santa Paula's historic buildings, uses, and setting. The railroad
depot and its role as a receiving location for visitors from tourist rail connection to Fillmore is
emphasized. Public streetscape improvements as well as improvements on several private
development sites are currently being implemented. Land use changes are recommended for
some areas to implement the Downtown Design Development Report/Improvement Plan.
           The Harvard Boulevard Improvement Area. The Harvard Boulevard planning effort was
initiated by the City in 1995. Though on hold as of July 1997, the City intends to reactivate the
planning effort. This plan will provide physical planning recommendations for the revitalization
of the Harvard Boulevard corridor. Public streetscape improvements will be addressed.
Development standards are recommended in this element to promote the improvement of the
Harvard Boulevard area.
The Railroad Corridor. The rail line that bisects Santa Paula originally traversed the length of the
Santa Clara River Valley. The railroad was used for passenger service, shipment of produce and
distribution of inbound freight. In 1978, storm damage severed the rail line and service was
abandoned on the line east of Piru. Since that time, the Newhall Land and Farming Company has
removed the tracks between that point and the mainline connection in the City of Santa Clarita.
In 1995, the Ventura County Transportation Commission (VCTC) purchased the Santa Paula
Branch Line and associated holdings of Southern Pacific Transportation Company. Today, there
is limited freight activity on the line from Montalvo to Santa Paula. In addition, a tourist train
operating out of the City of Fillmore uses the segment between Santa Paula and Fillmore. VCTC
has completed a Master Plan for the Santa Paula Branch Line that calls for the restoration of the
rail connection to Santa Clarita and initiation of commuter rail service between Ventura and Santa
Clarita. In the interim, VCTC is investigating the use of local commuter rail service from Piru to
Ventura. Finally, VCTC has begun a recreational trail planning process that will allow agencies
along the line, including Santa Paula, to develop multi-purpose trail facilities for the length of the
corridor.
In general, the railroad corridor is 100 feet wide, with 50 feet on each side of the center line of the
track. This area is smaller on the west side of Santa Paula and approximately 200 feet wide
adjacent to Santa Paula Depot.
           The South East Neighborhood. The residential area southeast of 10 th Street and Main
Street is primarily residential, but is interspersed with light industrial, retail, and institutional
uses. The 1978 General Plan called for light industrial uses as the primary designation in this area
in an effort to alter the character of the land use pattern to a district for business and commerce.
However, this area remains predominately residential, with a mix of densities. In addition, the
neighborhood is supported by numerous corner stores, home-based businesses, and other
neighborhood-style mixed uses. This General Plan includes policies to enhance and improve the
vital mix of uses in the southeast neighborhood.
           City Entrances/Gateways. To promote visitor and general business access to Santa Paula,
the City’s entrances need to be defined and enhanced. The important local gateways are the
eastern entrance at the Telegraph Road/Harvard Blvd intersection, the western entrance at the
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821               LU-15

Telegraph/Peck/West Main Street intersection, the northern entrance at the State Route 150 (SR
150)/Santa Paula Street intersection, and the southern entrance at 12th Street and the Santa Clara
River. Gateways of regional significance include the highway on/off ramps at Peck, Palm, 10 th
Street and Hallock Drive. Special planning studies for land uses, design standards and
monumentation are required for these areas.
H. Regional Issues
           The Heritage Valley. The “Heritage Valley” is a concept for a physical connection
between Santa Paula, Fillmore, Piru, and Rancho Camulos, with a sub-regional economic
development strategy. The Heritage Valley establishes a sequential journey from an urban
environment to the rural ranch environment as one travels eastward. This transportation route
may one day link the small towns of the Santa Clara River Valley to the coastal City of Ventura
and the inland City of Santa Clarita. The Heritage Valley is also a marketing strategy for the
towns along the railroad tracks to encourage tourism.
           Ventura County Transportation Commission/Branch Line Master Plan. In 1995 the
VCTC acquired all of Southern Pacific’s Santa Paula Branch line properties and right-of-way. The
VCTC executed agreements with the cities of Fillmore, Ventura, and Santa Paula as well as the
County of Ventura regarding the future operations and management of the rail corridor.
Pursuant to these agreements, a Master Plan has been completed. The purpose of the Master Plan
is to establish a framework of policies, procedures, and standards that will guide the management
and operation of the Santa Paula Branch Line rail corridor. This study examines issues associated
with commuter rail, excursion rail, and freight rail. Design standards for rail line development
and an associated recreational trail are addressed in this Land Use Element. Input from this
Master Plan is addressed in the Land Use Plan, including a policy calling for the depot’s
preservation and its future use as an operating railroad depot.
           Business Clusters. In 1995, the County of Ventura prepared the “Business Cluster
Analysis” report. This report identified business clusters that are operating and emerging in the
County. Business clusters are networks of firms and institutions that produce a set of related
goods and services. Usually, these goods and services are exported outside the region or attract
money into the region. This flow of revenues is one of the vital components of the regional
economy. These business clusters have three key features: they are located in a relatively
concentrated geographic area, the constituents of the cluster have mutual interests in technologies
and the market they serve, and they involve private/public partnerships.
Emerging and growing clusters were identified in the following areas:                   agriculture,
communications, machinery, biomedical sciences, plastics, environmental tourism, business
services, health care, and education/training. A second group of emerging or possible clusters
includes: electrical equipment, apparel, paper, sporting goods, cosmetics, and publishing.
According to the report, Santa Paula has employment in all the emerging clusters, as well as the
potential cluster businesses. The Land Use Plan supports the development and strengthening of
clusters with specific policies.
           Area Planning Studies. Several planning studies are currently being developed or
implemented in the Santa Clara River Valley area. These parallel efforts represent an opportunity
to exchange ideas, build on themes, development opportunities, and to fill in "gaps" that are
identified. Pertinent planning studies include the following:
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821              LU-16

           City of Fillmore Downtown Specific Plan. This plan is designed to retain and strengthen
Fillmore's small town character. The railroad and citrus industry heritage, the traditional Central
Park, its pedestrian oriented shopping areas, and historic 1920-1930's building styles are the core
of the plan.
           Lake Piru Recreation Master Plan. The United Water Conservation District, which owns
and operates the Lake Piru, is currently updating the Recreation Master Plan for the lake. The ten
year plan will address the expansion of overnight recreational vehicle and tent camping
opportunities as well as increasing the day use and off-season use of lake facilities.
           Piru Enhancement Plan. A plan for the renovation and revitalization of Piru has recently
been completed and adopted by the County Board of Supervisors. This plan provides for
reconstruction and rehabilitation of the town center as well as new land uses centered around a
railroad related and small town theme.
           Rancho Camulos Museum Master Plan. Rancho Camulos is located 1.5 miles east of Piru
and has seven historical buildings, including an 1850's adobe home. Estimates have been
developed that indicate a museum could draw between 20,000 - 60,000 visitors per year,
depending on the development and marketing as well as the improvement of other attractions in
the area.

                          III. GROWTH SCENARIO FOR YEAR 2020
A. City Boundaries, Sphere of Influence, Area of Interest and City Urban Restriction
Boundary
The City of Santa Paula embarked on an update of the General Plan to address growth and
economic issues. Beginning in 1993, city staff and citizens began studying conditions,
opportunities, and constraints. Several expansion areas were developed to test and determine the
direction Santa Paula should plan to grow for the year 2020. In 1997, these expansion areas were
modified and grouped into three land use scenarios. A preferred growth scenario was selected
by the City Council, and that scenario forms the basis of this General Plan. That scenario has been
modified as a result of a citizens’ initiative known as the Save Open-Space and Agricultural
Resources (SOAR) Santa Paula City Urban Restriction Boundary Initiative, as subsequently
amended by the voters. The CURB, which modifies the preferred buildout scenario to require
public involvement is set forth in Figure LU-4a. The Land Use Element of the General Plan in
particular, carries out the preferred scenario by calling for expansion outside the existing City
limits and recommending several land use and policy changes for the existing City lands.
The Ventura County Guidelines for Orderly Development allow the City to consider expansion
into its Area of Interest when developing long-range plans. The Area of Interest is the City’s
planning area. This area encompasses 74 square miles bounded on the south by the ridgeline of
South Mountain and on the north by the ridge line of Sulphur Mountain between Santa Paula and
the Upper Ojai area. These ridgelines dominate the viewsheds from the City to the south and
north. On the west, the boundary is between Wheeler Canyon and Aliso Canyons. To the east,
the boundary is Hall Road near the sycamore tree monument. Figure LU-3 illustrates the Area of
Interest boundary. The Land Use Element addresses lands that are closest to the existing urban
area of Santa Paula, where the delivery of community services can be carried out efficiently and
effectively as envisioned by the guidelines.
The Sphere of Influence that is established by the Ventura Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) designates the probable ultimate urban boundaries for the City for the foreseeable
future. If the City intends to expand its corporate boundaries into this area, it must first process
annexation applications through LAFCO. The City’s 1978 Sphere of Influence is almost
contiguous with the City limit line, as illustrated in Figure LU-3. The sphere currently contains
about 460 acres.

The LAFCO is made up of seven commissioners (two county representatives, two city
representatives, two special district representatives and one member from the general public).
This commission will review and approve any amendments to the City of Santa Paula’s 1978
Sphere of Influence and subsequent land annexations to expand the City’s boundaries. Relevant
Ventura LAFCO policies for annexations to the City include:
General Standards for Annexations to Cities and Districts
      (a) The proposal would eliminate islands, corridors, or other distortion of existing
           boundaries.
      (b) The affected territory is urban in character or urban development is imminent,
           requiring municipal or urban-type uses.
      (c) The affected territory can be provided all urban services by the city or district as
           show by the city’s or district’s service plans and the proposal would enhance the
           efficient provision of urban services.
      (d) The proposal is consistent with state law, adopted spheres of influences, applicable
           general and specific plans, and these policies.
      (e) The proposal is for the annexation of city or district owned property, used or to be
           used for public purposes.
      General Boundary Criteria
      (a) Create logical boundaries that coincide with existing and planned service areas and,
           where possible, eliminate previously existing islands.
      (b) Follow natural and man-made features, such as ridge lines drainage areas,
           watercourses, and edges of right-of-way, provided they coincide with lines of
           assessment or ownership, or are described by metes and bounds legal descriptions
           which can easily be used for mapping lines of assessment or ownership.
      (c) Include adjacent urbanized areas which are receiving or which may require urban
           services such as public water and/or sewer services.
Refer to the Ventura LAFCO Commissioner’s Handbook (adopted October 17, 2007 with updated
through September 2012 for additional LAFCO policies.
B. Expansion and Planning Areas: Sphere of Influence Amendments and Potential
Land Uses
This General Plan envisions an amendment to the City of Santa Paula’s 1978 Sphere of Influence
to include expansion and planning areas with a variety of land uses. These uses and buildout
limits were developed by the City and consultant team with input from the General Plan
Advisory Committee in a series of workshops in January, February, and March 1997. The
ultimate buildout of residential units will be in accordance with the City’s existing Growth
Management Ordinance, and subject to the CURB, as amended. As of 1997, the ordinance limits
the number of new dwelling units allowed to be built by the year 2020 to 3,796 (includes 2,852
units that would be allowed under current growth management principles and 944 accumulated
units that have not been used as of April 1997).
Four expansion areas and one planning area, are illustrated in Figure LU-4. The areas are Adams
Canyon, Fagan Canyon, East Area 2, West Area 2, and South Mountain. These are planned for
urbanization and development. However, development in the South Mountain expansion area
would be limited to open space and recreational uses. All urbanized uses planned outside of the
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821               LU-20

amended CURB are subject to the SOAR initiative, and may only be developed if the CURB is
amended pursuant to Section III.G. of the Land Use Element. In that regard, a 32.5-acre parcel
located on the northwest corner of Peck Road and Foothill Road (commonly known as the “32.5
Acre Peck/Foothill Road Parcel”) is included with the CURB pursuant to a vote of the people as
provided in Section III G. of the Land Use Element (see Figure LU-4a).
For the expansion areas that will accommodate substantial new urban development, Specific
Plans will be required to be developed in accordance with Government Code sections 65450 et.
seq. The Specific Plan(s) will reflect the land use buildout and other development policies as
described in this General Plan. Details of siting, design, infrastructure, provision of open space,
and financing will be established through the Specific Plan(s). In addition, the City will require a
market and fiscal analysis to determine the feasibility of the Specific Plan developments that are
under consideration at the time of application. Although not required, unless otherwise
requested for substantial new development proposals, Specific Plan(s) are encouraged to address
comprehensive buildout of the planning areas.

Annexation of expansion areas would occur on a case-by-case basis after the completion of a
corresponding Specific Plan and the market and fiscal evaluation. Annexation of planning areas
would occur on a case-by-case basis when sufficient evidence and interest supports the need for
annexation, and appropriate planning documents completed as may be requested by the City.
Relatively minor areas of annexation that may facilitate the orderly development and extension of
the City boundary, such as small island annexations or individual properties or groups of
properties that are substantially developed and contiguous to the established City limit, whether
within an expansion area or planning area, may be exempt on a case-by-case basis as determined
by the City, from the need for a Specific Plan or similar comprehensive planning process.
Environmental review in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
would be required for each annexation action.
The following is a description of the expansion and planning areas:
           Adams Canyon. Approximately 5,413 acres of land are located northwest of Santa Paula
within this canyon. Most of the land is north of a relatively narrow canyon mouth. Some
additional hillside land to the east of the canyon mouth overlooks the west end of Santa Paula.
Primary access would be taken from Foothill Road, with an orientation to Peck Road and on to SR
126. Segments of Peck Road would require widening. Upper Peck Road and Foothill Road may
require widening, depending upon the scope of development. A secondary access road may be
required out to SR 150/Ojai Road. Extension of sewer service and other utilities would be
required. The impact on agriculture would be relatively low due to the predominantly low- value
grazing use of the canyon. The impacts on wildlife could be significant due to the amount of
habitat involved, depending upon the extent of the future development proposals. The site is not
considered to be within an established greenbelt. Drainage would follow Adams Barranca to the
Santa Clara River. Major flood retention facilities would be required within the canyon. With the
retention facility, flood threats in the areas west of town adjacent to SR 126 would be reduced,
and the water would be used for irrigation and fire protection.
           Fagan Canyon. Approximately 2,173 acres of land are located directly north of Santa
Paula, within this canyon. Primary access would be taken from Santa Paula Street via a widened
Cemetery Road. Additional access would be from existing and future hillside roads on either
side of the canyon mouth, along with a possible connection east over the hill to SR 150/Ojai Road.
 Low-density development would have minimal traffic impacts, but higher densities in the
canyon could impact Santa Paula Street. Extension of sewer service into the canyon would be
moderately difficult due to the lack of a trunk line in the immediate area. Other utilities would be
relatively easy to provide. The impact on hillside orchard crop agriculture could be moderate,
depending on the areas developed. The impacts on wildlife could be significant depending on
the amount of habitat involved. The site is not within an established greenbelt. Drainage would
be to the Santa Clara River via Fagan Barranca. Depending on the amount of development, a
flood retention facility would be needed. With the installation of on-site improvements, there
should be no flood impacts on the City.
           East Area 1. See Section IV. (J) Land Use Plan Map and Land Use Categories for
description of East Area 1 Specific Plan (SP-3). Upon adoption of the East Area 1 Specific Plan,
East Area 1 was removed as an expansion area.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821              LU-24
           East Area 2. East Area 2 is a Planning Area, most of which falls within the City’s existing
Sphere of Influence. This area involves the addition of approximately 26 acres to be added to the
City’s 1978 Sphere of Influence in the southeast portion of the City. It is located south of the
Ventura County Transportation Commission railroad right-of-way and east of the current City
limits, surrounding the incorporated Hallock Drive area, but excluding the triangular area north
of Hallock Drive. The southern boundary of this planning area is the public levy and bank
protection line of the Santa Clara River. Primary access to East Area 2 would be taken from the SR
126. Extension of sewer service to this site would be difficult due to its distant location from the
treatment plant and trunk lines. Other utilities, however, would be easier to provide. There
could be some impacts on agriculture depending on the quality of land involved. The impact on
wildlife would be low because of the already existing impacts or urban land uses in the area.
Portions of this area are within the Santa Paula-Fillmore greenbelt. Drainage would be to the
Santa Clara River without significant impact. The site is in the Santa Clara River flood plain.
           West Area 2. Approximately 125 acres of land located between Adams Barranca and Peck
Road are to be added to existing lands within the 1978 Sphere of Influence (68 acres). The
southern boundary of this expansion area is the public levy and bank protection line of the Santa
Clara River. Primary access would be Peck Road from SR 126 and Telegraph Road. Widening of
Peck Road to four lanes would be required. Sewer service and other utilities would be relatively
easy to provide. Though not in an established greenbelt, urban expansion into West Area 2
would result in the conversion of some agricultural land. The impacts on wildlife would be
relatively low. Drainage would be to the Santa Clara River without significantly affecting the
City. Existing flood problems north of the freeway would be required to be resolved prior to
development of this area.
           South Mountain. The majority of the 1,292-acre South Mountain area would retain its
current land use pattern, which consists of a mixture of residential, agricultural, and open space
uses. The purpose of including this area is to provide the City with the opportunity to develop
limited recreational and open space uses. The City would develop six soccer fields, requiring
about 15 acres. There is also the opportunity to enhance the entrance to Willard Canyon, a scenic
area on the north side of South Mountain. About 100 acres near the mouth of the canyon would
be set aside for passive open space uses, serving as a staging area for hiking trails into Willard
Canyon.
Table LU-5 illustrates the land uses types, amounts, and build-out planned for the expansion
scenario.

C. Greenbelt Agreements
In Ventura County, greenbelts are agreements between public agencies with land use control.
They represent a form of mutual regulatory control between two or more jurisdictions concerning
urban form, the protection of farmland and open space land, the future extension of urban
services/facilities, and annexations. These greenbelts are intended to operate as “community
separators” or “buffers” and participating cities agree not to extend municipal services into the
greenbelts or annex greenbelt lands. The following list includes features typical of greenbelt
agreements.
              The duration of greenbelt agreements is usually for an indefinite time period.
              Generally, the lands within a greenbelt area are designated “Agricultural” or “Open Space.”
              Greenbelts have no binding legal authority to regulate land uses. That authority is found in the
               jurisdiction’s general plans and zoning regulations. Greenbelts, together with other planning
               and regulatory tools have functioned as a deterrent to the premature development of farmland
               and open space lands. Greenbelts, however, do not provide for permanent conservation or
               preservation.
              Any party to a greenbelt agreement may elect to terminate their participation in the policy
               agreement at any time.
              Establishing a greenbelt does not require the consent of the affected property owners.
              Greenbelt lands are not public open space, the lands are privately owned.
              Because the lands within a city’s sphere of influence are intended for eventual annexation to a
               city, greenbelt agreements usually involve lands outside a city’s sphere of influence.
Santa Paula is a partner in two Greenbelt Agreements that affect lands contiguous to the City on
the east and the west:
           1. The Santa Paula and City of San Buenaventura Greenbelt Agreement was adopted
               in 1967. This agreement covers approximately 8,349 acres from the Adams Barranca
               eastward to the Franklin Barranca. There are no defined southern or northern
               boundaries. A map prepared by Ventura County Resource Management Agency
               shows the western greenbelt line extending from the Santa Clara River northward to
               the canyon lands above Foothill Road. Some interpretations indicate that the
               agreement was intended to cover the flat prime agricultural lands south of Foothill
               Road and not the northern canyon lands as they contain little or no prime agricultural
               lands.
           2. The Santa Paula and Fillmore Greenbelt Agreement was first established in 1980.
               This agreement covers approximately 34,200 acres and is the largest greenbelt in
               Ventura County. The eastern boundary lies at Sespe Creek adjacent to Fillmore and
               the western boundary runs down along Santa Paula Creek, around the City’s eastern
               1978 Sphere of Influence line to an extension of 12 th Street. The southern boundary is
               the South Mountain ridgeline and Oak Ridge. The northern boundary lies at the Los
               Padres National Forest boundary. The Greenbelt Agreement was amended and
               adopted by ordinance in 2009.

D. Land Use Changes within the Present City Limits
In addition to expansion areas around the edges of the city, issues affecting infill development
must be considered. With recommendations from the Santa Paula Planning Department and
input from the community through the General Plan Advisory Committee facilitated in a series of
workshops, several land use issues have been identified. These issues are addressed in the
policies and implementation measures in the Land Use Element. These changes are as follows:
           1. Land use changes, development projects and public improvements identified in the
               Downtown Improvement Plan should be implemented.
           2. Commercial uses on the 10th Street corridor between SR 126 and Santa Paula Street
               should be encouraged.
           3. Heritage Valley/tourist uses should be encouraged along the railroad corridor.
           4. A bicycle/hiking trail should be encouraged along the railroad corridor.
           5. Landscaping and a linear park should be encouraged along the railroad right-of-way.
           6. Airport area land uses must be compatible with airport operations.
           7. There is a need to locate soccer/ball fields within the City.
           8. A Civic, Park or Open Space designation, should be put on all public lands and
               facilities.
           9. Designate the southerly half of New Street between Ojai and Oak Streets as Medium
               High Density Residential.
           10. Reconcile the latest flood map with the designation of “River,” “Open Space,” and
               “Special Study Areas” as appropriate.
           11. Designate all mobile home parks with a Mobile Home Park designation.
           12. Provide for the annexation of all existing County “pockets” in and adjacent to the
               current City lands.
           13. Remove the “Reserve” and “Phased Reserve” designations.
           14. Adopt a Historic Overlay Zone for portions of the downtown and surrounding
               historic neighborhoods.
           15. Develop a Mixed Use land use designation and apply it in certain areas.
           16. Expand auto sales and other regional retail uses in the Hallock Drive area.
           17. Re-designate certain industrial parcels on the westside of town to multi-family
               residential use and encourage the development of senior housing.
           18. Re-designate certain portions east of 10 th Street and south of Main Street from
               industrial to residential and neighborhood commercial to reflect the existing land use
               patterns.
           19. Accommodate a transition from industrial to mixed industrial and commercial uses in
               the area east of 10th Street, south of Santa Paula Street, and north of Main Street.
           20. Accommodate a grocery store to serve the east side of town.
           21. Accommodate a teen center, skating rink, or other use in the City.
The Land Use Element addresses the issues listed above through policies and implementing
measures. In response to a number of the objectives listed above, the Land Use Map that
accompanies this General Plan Update has been revised. Many of the revisions simply reflect
existing land use patterns and do not represent actual changes to land uses. These revisions also
reflect the City’s desire to allow a mix of land uses consistent with policies. Additionally, the
Land Use Map has been updated to reflect changes in zoning and land use designations which
have occurred in past years.

E. Development/Build-Out Potential and Population Growth Under the Land Use
      Element
The Land Use Plan allows for build-out of existing City lands as well as phased annexations.
Table LU-6 illustrates the theoretical new development potential of both existing City lands and
the expansion and planning areas, and summarizes the potential development upon full buildout
of the General Plan. The type and amount of development that actually occurs will depend on
market forces and an aggressive marketing plan by the City. The City realizes that total
industrial, commercial, and residential build-out may not occur within the 2020 horizon of the
General Plan. However, making the land available will eliminate one obstacle and provide an
incentive for growth to occur.

F. Santa Paula CITY URBAN RESTRICTION BOUNDARY to Accommodate
      Reasonable Growth and Expansion
Introduction
The voters of the City of Santa Paula have, through the electoral process, established and adopted
an urban growth boundary line denominated the Santa Paula City Urban Restriction Boundary
(CURB), as amended. Its purpose, principles, and implementation procedures are set forth in this
subsection of the Santa Paula Land Use Element. The methodologies for amendment are set forth
in Section H.
           1. PURPOSE
           The City of Santa Paula and surrounding area, often referred to as part of the Heritage
           Valley, with its unique combination of soils, micro-climate, and hydrology, has become
           one of the finest growing regions in the world. Agricultural production from the County
           of Ventura and in particular production from the solids and silt from the Santa Clara River
           provides beneficial food and fiber to local inhabitants and to the world at large and has
           achieved international acclaim, enhancing the City’s economy and reputation.
           The purpose of this CURB, as amended is to provide for the reasonable urban growth of
           the City of Santa Paula and ensure that the development policies, and underlying goals,
           objectives, principles and policies set forth in the Santa Paula General Plan relating to
           Land Use are inviolable against transitory short-term political decisions and that
           agricultural, watershed, and open space lands are not prematurely or unnecessarily
           converted to other non-agricultural or non-open space uses without public debate and
           vote of the people.
           It is not the purpose of this initiative measure to constrain the prerogative of the City
           Council with respect to any property within the City inside the CURB, as amended or to
           constrain any other agency in fulfilling its statutory duties.
           2. PRINCIPLES
           Large scale urban encroachment into agricultural and watershed areas will impair
           agriculture and threaten the public health, safety, and welfare by causing increased traffic
           congestion, associated air pollution, and potentially serious water problems, such as
           pollution, depletion, and sedimentation of available water resources. Such urban
           encroachment would eventually result in both the unnecessary, expensive extension of
           public services and facilities and inevitable conflicts between urban and open
           space/agricultural uses.
           The unique character of the City of Santa Paula, its economy, and quality of life of City
           residents depend on the protection of a substantial amount of open space, natural
           resource, and agricultural lands. The protection of such lands not only ensures the
           continued viability of agriculture, but also contributes to flood control and the protection
           of wildlife, environmentally sensitive areas, and irreplaceable natural resources. As
           importantly, adopting a CURB, and its subsequent amendments, will promote the
           formation and continuation of a cohesive community by defining the boundaries and by
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                 LU-30

           helping to prevent urban sprawl. Such a CURB, and its subsequent amendments, will
           promote efficient municipal services and facilities by confining urban development to
           defined development areas, and will involve the public in the decision making process
           when development is to be extended beyond those defined development areas.
           3. IMPLEMENTATION
               a) The City of Santa Paula establishes and adopts a City Urban Restriction Boundary
                   (CURB). The CURB established coterminous with and in the same location as the
                   Sphere of Influence line contingently established by the Local Agency Formation
                   Commission on February 2, 2000, which may be amended from time to time,
                   except that the CURB shall include all legal parcels in the expansion area known as
                   “Adams Canyon”, including those presently split by the Sphere of Influence. In
                   those areas where the Sphere line divides or bisects legal parcels, the CURB shall
                   be extended to surround the entire parcel or parcels.
               b) Until December 31, 2020, the City of Santa Paula shall restrict urban services
                   (except temporary mutual assistance with other jurisdictions) and urbanized uses
                   of land to within the amended CURB, except as provided herein. Other than for
                   the exceptions provided herein, upon the effective date of this General Plan
                   amendment, the City and its departments, boards, commissions, officers, and
                   employees shall not grant, or by inaction allow to be approved by operation of
                   law, any general plan amendment, rezoning, specific plan, subdivision map,
                   special use permit, building permit, or any other ministerial or discretionary
                   entitlement which is inconsistent with the purposes of this General Plan
                   amendment.
               c) “Urbanized uses of land” shall mean any development which would require the
                   establishment of new city sewer systems or the significant expansion of existing
                   city sewer infrastructure; or would create residential lots less than 10 acres in area
                   per primary residence; or would result in the establishment of commercial or
                   industrial uses which are neither exclusively related to the production of mineral
                   resources. Urbanized uses of land shall also mean gold course or driving range
                   construction. Urbanized uses of land shall not mean traditional municipal or
                   regional parks with team sports or other recreational facilities.
               d) Until December 31, 2020, those land designated East Area 1;, West Area 2; and
                   South Mountain, denominated “Expansion Areas” in the Santa Paula General Plan,
                   adopted April 13, 1998, may continue to be denominated “Expansion Areas
                   outside the CURB” subject to the requirement of said area(s) being brought within
                   the CURB as set forth in Section III G, infra, prior to approval of contemplated
                   urbanizing development.
G.         Restrictions on Developments of 81 or more acres (added by Measure L6 on
           November 7, 2006; the “Citizens Advocating Responsible Expansion Initiative”).
           [For purposes of reference and ease of use, the relevant verbatim text of Measure L6 is set
           forth below. Except for numeration, minor clerical editing is indicated with brackets.]
           1. Findings and Objectives
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                 LU-31

               A. Public participation in community altering developments has proven to be a
                   useful approach to development, both from the perspective of ensuring the
                   public's participation in its own future, but as well ensuring that the
                   development interests embarking on large community altering developments
                   take into consideration appropriate public amenities.
               B.   In particular, the City of Santa Paula has before it, and is anticipated to have
                   before it, large projects with the potential to alter the fabric of the community
                   in ways that have yet to be publicly aired and which would likely be improved
                   by the knowledge that the public was to be involved in the approval process
                   through an election.
               C.   Accordingly, it is the objective of this [Section III(G)] to ensure that large
                   projects, defined herein as projects in excess of 81 acres, gross, in total size,
                   including all roads and public amenities such as schools and parks, be
                   submitted to the voters prior to final approval.
           2. Implementation to Achieve Objective
               A. This [I]nitiative hereby Amends the General Plan Land Use Element adopted
                   on or about April 13, 1998, and as amended thereafter, to require any future
                   amendment to the general plan land use element involving a development,
                   proposed development, or land use designation, which would have the effect of
                   increasing the density as currently reflected in the land use element on a gross
                   of 81 or more acres, to be approved by a majority of the voters at a general or
                   special election.
               B. Until December 31, 2025, the City of Santa Paula shall not, absent approval of a
                   majority of the voters voting at a duly scheduled election, increase the
                   residential or commercial density or intensity of use beyond that presently
                   described in the above-referenced Land Use Element, as amended.
                   Amendments on any project comprising a gross of 81 acres or greater shall be
                   subject to this measure:
                   To enforce the underlying intent of this initiative, and to preclude the
                   "piecemealing" of projects, "81 acres, gross," shall be defined as including
                   contiguous real property, any part of which has been redesignated in such a
                   fashion to increase its density within the 5 calendar years predating the action
                   under scrutiny. That is, by way of example, and without limitation, should the
                   City Council sequentially redesignate 20 acres in each of 4 consecutive
                   calendar years, said cumulative acreage being contiguous in any fas hion, then
                   in the 5th year any parcel of 1 acre or more, contiguous with the previous 80
                   acres of redesignated property would require a public vote. However, by way
                   of contrast, 80 acres redesignated in year one would have no effect under this
                   amendment on an application to redesignate an additional, contiguous, 80
                   acres in year 6.
           3. Amendment Procedure
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                LU-32
               A. Except as set forth in the following Paragraph "B," Amendments to the General
                   Plan Land Use Element, as previously amended, which would have the effe ct
                   of increasing the density as currently reflected in said land use element on a
                   gross of 81 acres, or more, may only be accomplished by a vote of the duly
                   registered electorate of the City of Santa Paula. Approval by a vote of the
                   people is accomplished when a General Plan Amendment is placed on the
                   ballot through any procedure provided for in the Election Code, and a majority
                   of the voters then voting approve of the change. Whenever the City Council
                   adopts an amendment requiring approval by a vote of the people pursuant to
                   the provisions of this subsection, the City Council's action shall be preceded by
                   an Environmental Impact Report meeting the standards imposed by the
                   California Environmental Quality Act, and shall have no effect until after such
                   a vote is held and a majority of the voters vote in favor of it. The City Council
                   shall follow the provisions of the Elections Code in all matter pertaining to
                   such an election.
               B. Amendment of the General Plan may be accomplished absent a public vote if,
                   and by the City Council:
                   (i) The City Council makes a finding supported by substantial evidence that
                        the application of the provisions of Section [III(G)(3)(A)] would constitute
                        an unconstitutional taking of the landowners' property; or
                   (ii) The City Council makes a finding supported by substantial evidence that
                        the application of the provisions of Section [III(G)(3)(A)] would conflict
                        with the Department of Housing and [Community] Development's
                        previous approval of the City's Housing Element; and
                   (iii) In permitting the redesignation, the City Council allows additional land
                        uses only to the extent necessary to avoid said unconstitutional taking of
                        the landowner's property, or the minimum necessary to avoid conflict with
                        the Housing Element.
           4. Exemptions for Certain Projects
           This initiative shall not apply to or affect any property owner whose property has
           acquired any of the following prior to its effective date:
               A. A vested right pursuant to state law;
               B.   A validly approved and fully executed development agreement with City; or
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                 LU-33
               C. Approval of a vesting tentative map.
               D. The provisions of this initiative do not address, and are not intended to in any
                   way inhibit the exercise of school or other state or local prerogatives, other
                   than as applied to the City of Santa Paula. By way of example, and without
                   limitation, the provisions of this initiative may be disregarded as necessary to
                   accommodate the exercise of legitimate State granted authority such as that set
                   forth in Government Code [§] 53094.
           5. Insertion Date
               A. Upon the effective date of this initiative, the initiative shall be deemed inserted
                   in the Santa Paula 2020 General Plan as an amendment thereof; except, that if
                   the four amendments of the mandatory elements of the general plan permitted
                   by state law for any given calendar year have already been utilized in 2005,
                   prior to the effective date of this initiative, this General Plan amendment shall
                   be deemed inserted in the City's General Plan on January 1, 2006.
           6. [Supersession over previous revisions]
               The provisions of this initiative shall prevail over any revisions to the City of
               Santa Paula's 2020 General Plan as amended through the insertion date or to the
               City of Santa Paula's 2020 Land Use Map as amended through January 1, 2005,
               which conflict with this initiative. Except as provided in Section [III(G)(3)] above,
               upon the insertion date all General Plan amendments, rezonings, specific plans,
               tentative or final subdivision maps, parcel maps, conditional use permits, building
               permits or other ministerial or discretionary entitlements for use not yet approved
               or issued shall not be approved or issued unless consistent with the policies and
               provisions of this initiative.
           7. [Implementation Ordinance. In order to help implement this Section III(G), the
               City Council adopted Ordinance No. 1188 on February 19, 2008 which, among other
               things, adds Chapter 16.237 to the Santa Paula Municipal Code entitled "81 Acre
               Initiative Implementation."]"
H. AMENDMENT PROCEDURES1
Until December 31, 2020, the forgoing Purpose, Principles, and Implementation provisions may
be amended only by a vote of the people commenced pursuant to the initiative process, or
pursuant to the procedures set forth below:
           1.   The City Council, following at least one public hearing for presentations by an
               applicant and the public, and after compliance with the California Environmental
               Quality Act, may further amend the CURB to comply with state law regarding the
               provision of housing for all economic segments of the community. For that purpose
               the City Council may further amend the Urban Restriction Boundary as described
               herein in order to include lands to be designated for residential uses, provided that no
1 Subsection H. is part of subsection F. regarding CURB (corrected 4/12/11)
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                      LU-34

               more than 20 acres of land may be brought within the amended CURB for this
               purpose in any calendar year. Such amendment may be adopted only if the City
               Council makes each of the following findings:
               a) The land is immediately adjacent to existing compatibly developed areas and the
                   applicant for the inclusion of land within the amended CURB has provided to the
                   City evidence that the Fire Department, Police Department, Department of Public
                   Works, the Community Services Department, applicable water and sewer districts,
                   and the school districts with jurisdiction over such land have or will provide
                   adequate capacity to accommodate the proposed development and provide it with
                   adequate public services;
               b) That the proposed development will address the highest priority need identified in
                   the analysis by which the City has determined it is not in compliance with state
                   law, such as low and very low income housing;
               c) That there is no existing residentially designated land available within the
                   amended CURB to accommodate the proposed development; and
               d) That it is not reasonably feasible to accommodate the proposed development by
                   redesignating land within the amended CURB.
           2)   The City Council, following at least one public hearing for presentations by an
               applicant and the public, and after compliance with the California Environmental
               Quality Act, may further amend the CURB, if the City Council makes each of the
               following findings:
               a)   The land proposed for inclusion within the amended CURB is immediately
                   adjacent to areas developed in a manner comparable to the proposed use;
               b) Adequate public services and facilities are available and have the capacity and
                   capability to accommodate the proposed use;
               c) The proposed use will not have direct, indirect, or cumulative adverse significant
                   impacts on the area’s agricultural viability, habitat, scenic resources, or watershed;
               d) The proposed use will not adversely affect the stability of land use patterns in the
                   area (i.e., the land affected will not introduce or facilitate a use that is incompatible
                   with adjoining or nearby uses);
               e) The land proposed for inclusion within the amended CURB has not been used for
                   agricultural purposes in the immediately preceding two years and is unusable for
                   agriculture due to its topography, drainage, flooding, adverse soil conditions,
                   inaccessibility to appropriate water, or other physical reason; and
               f) The land proposed for inclusion within the amended CURB does not exceed 20
                   acres for any one landowner in any calendar year, and one landowner’s property
                   may not similarly be removed from the restrictions contemplated by this General

                   Plan amendment more often than every other year. Landowners with any unity of
                   interest are considered one landowner for purposes of this limitation.
               g) Including the land within the amended CURB will not result in more than 40 acres
                   being added to the amended CURB in any calendar year.
            3. The City Council, following at least one public hearing for presentations by an
               applicant and the public, and after compliance with the California Environmental
               Quality Act, may further amend the CURB if the City Council makes each of the
               following findings:
               a) Application of the provisions of subsections 1, 2, or 3 of these amendment
                   procedures are unworkable as applied to a specified parcel and failure to further
                   amend the CURB would constitute an unconstitutional taking of a landowner’s
                   property for which compensation would be required; and
               b) The amendment and associated land use designations will allow new land uses
                   only to the minimum extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional taking of the
                   landowner’s property.
           4. The City Council, following at least one public hearing for presentations by an
               applicant and the public, and after compliance with the California Environmental
               Quality Act, may place any additional amendment to the CURB or the provisions of
               this initiative on the ballot in the manner provided by state law.
           5. The City Council may further amend the CURB to include land contemplated for
               construction of public water facilities, public schools, public parks, or other
               government facilities, or to include an development project that has obtained as of the
               effective date of the initiative a vested right pursuant to state or local law, all uses
               exempted from the provisions of this General Plan Amendment, but only to the
               minimum amount of land reasonably necessary to accommodate said uses.
           6. The City Council may reorganized, reorder, and renumber General Plan provisions,
               including the provisions of this General Plan Amendment.

           IV. LAND USE PLAN MAP AND LAND USE CATEGORIES
A. Land Uses: Location, Development Intensities, and Population Densities
The purpose of the Land Use Plan Map and the Land Use Categories is to provide designations to
guide the general distribution, location, and extent of the various types of land uses in the City.
The categories also describe density and intensity criteria for physical development.
           Land Use Plan Map. The Land Use Plan Map, shown in Figure LU-5, illustrates the
location of each land use category. Land use designations for the expansion areas are not
assigned precise locations, as these will be determined by Specific Plans. Land use designations
for the planning areas, when provided, are representative of the intended uses unless a Specific
Plan or similar master plan document is prepared to determine precise land uses. In any case
where uncertainty exists regarding the location of boundaries of any land use category,
circulation alignment, or other symbol or line found on the Land Use Plan Map, the following
procedures will be used to resolve such uncertainty:
              Boundaries shown as approximately following lot lines shall be construed as following such lot
               lines.
              Where a land use category applied to a parcel is not mapped to include an adjacent street or
               alley, the category shall be considered to extend to the centerline of the right-of-way.
              Boundaries shown or approximately following the limits of any municipal corporation shall be
               construed as following such limits.
              Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to
               lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines.
              Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerlines of creeks, rivers, or
               other continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as following the channel centerline
               of such water courses taken at mean low water and, in the event of a natural change in the
               location of such water courses, the zone boundary shall be construed as moving with the
               channel centerline.
              Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any of the
               features listed above shall be construed to be parallel to such features and at such distances
               therefrom as are shown on the map.
           Land Use Categories. The following descriptions of the Land Use Categories are
identified as illustrated on the Land Use Map; combined, these form the foundation of the Land
Use Element. In cases where interpretation is necessary, the Planning Director will make an
interpretation. This interpretation is subject to appeal to the Planning Commission and City
Council. Table LU-7 summarizes each land use category, its location within the City, and the
associated development density or intensity. A detailed description of each land use category
follows.

B. Open Space: Parks and Recreation/Golf Courses/Passive Open Space
Open space has several important functions within Santa Paula. It provides physical and visual
relief to the urban environment. It is a resource for water recharge, water drainage, and biological
habitat. Open space also provides accessible land for outdoor recreational pursuits.
This land use includes neighborhood parks, undeveloped parkland, creeks, and barrancas. The
City has one Community Center, a Boys and Girls Club, and nine public parks that provide
approximately 36.5 acres of developed parkland. In accordance with National Park and
Recreation Association standards, the City should provide 5 acres of parkland per thousand
people.
Open Space designations in the Land Use Element include: Santa Clara River, Santa Paula Creek,
undevelopable and set-aside areas of Adams Barranca, Fagan Barranca and the City/regional
parks. Open Space designations should be applied to linear parks and corridors as well,
including multi-purpose trail corridors. For expansion areas that involve canyons or existing
greenbelt area, a minimum of 10% of the land area will be dedicated to passive open space or golf
courses. This will yield a total of about 1,200 acres of open space in addition to formal park and
recreation uses.
C. Agricultural Uses
An agricultural land use category has been developed to retain existing agricultural land uses and
ensure that continued agricultural uses are consistent with the General Plan.
Agricultural land use designations in the Land Use Element include the areas west of Peck Road
and north of Telegraph Road, and north of South Mountain Road (Lemon Road) within the South
Mountain expansion area. These lands are intended for crops, limited livestock production,
limited agriculture, incidental and supportive agricultural uses, structures, and storage on parcels
of no less than 20 acres in size.
D. Residential Uses
Several residential land use categories have been developed to provide for a continuous range in
residential densities from 10 acres per dwelling unit to a maximum of 29 dwelling units per gross
acre. Site area requirements extend from 10 acres to about 1,500 square feet of land area for each
dwelling unit.
The Hillside Estate Residential category provides a rural residential land use for the Adams and
Fagan Canyon expansion areas. The intent of this land use category is to provide for low density
development in sensitive hillside and canyon bottom areas.
The Hillside and Single-Family categories provide stable single-family residential areas with a
neighborhood orientation prohibiting incompatible land uses or densities, and providing an
inward orientation by limiting through vehicular traffic by the use of discontinuous collectors and
siting of residences with back up design on main thoroughfares when possible. In such cases,
pedestrian and bicycle access should be provided to encourage these travel modes for local trips.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821              LU-46
The Medium-Density Residential category provides a residential buffering land use between Single-
Family Exclusive and Medium High or High Density Residential. This land use category will
allow for attached housing, such as townhouse developments. The Medium-High Residential and
High Density Residential categories provide for higher residential densities to be dispersed and/or
located within neighborhoods in such a manner that there is easy access to arterial and collector
streets, thereby maintaining or reducing the vehicular traffic load on local/interior neighborhood
residential service streets. Incidental residential uses are also allowed in the open space and
agriculture land use categories on a conditional basis for large lots.
Residential uses are encouraged in the commercial office neighborhoods that have been
designated for “Mixed Use” and they are conditionally acceptable in other commercial zones. This
is acceptable because of the mixed land use character of the City where large portions of
commercially zoned land are presently utilized for residential purposes. New residential
development in commercial land use categories should be vigorously controlled and developed
so that it does not jeopardize future supportive commercial development within the City.
Mobile homes are no longer viewed as a transitional land use but as an alternative housing type.
Single mobile homes are allowed in most residential land use districts. This Land Use Plan
establishes a Mobile Home Park residential land use designation for mobile home parks.
           Hillside Estate Residential. This category provides a rural residential land use for the
Adams and Fagan Canyon expansion areas. The intent of this land use category is to provide for
low density development in sensitive hillside and canyon bottom areas in order to preserve
natural features and habitat areas. Development is not allowed on ridgelines. This land use
category provides for a density of 0 to 1 dwellings per gross acre. Clustering of units is
encouraged. A slope density formula may be developed as part of a Specific Plan to determine
the appropriate density.
           Hillside Residential. The purpose of this residential land use category is to protect those
areas of the City’s hillside with a slope of 10% or more from haphazard development in an
environmentally fragile area. Because of the geologic and topographic constraints in the hillsides,
the density range proposed in the hillsides would be from 0 to 3 dwellings per gross acre. Land
area per dwelling would range from 1 dwelling per 10 acres to one dwelling per 14,500 square
feet. A slope-density formula may be developed to guide development to less slope-impacted
areas and to minimize grading and topographical modification.
This land use category would be developed to preserve the hillsides in their natural state to the
extent feasible. Development would be prohibited on ridgelines and extreme slopes -- defined as
those of 30% or more -- and within existing arroyos and barrancas. This will be analyzed and
may be modified as part of a Specific Plan if approved by the City Council. These barrancas
would provide buffer zones between residential areas and potential linear connectors of open
spaces for hiking and other recreational uses. Traditional single-family housing would
predominate. However, planned developments providing clustered single-family housing will be
allowed in accordance with a slope-density program that would minimize grading, preserve open
space, and blend new development with the topography.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821               LU-47

           Single Family. The purpose of this designation is to provide a residential area where
traditional single-family residences can be located. The density range proposed in these areas
would be from 4 to 7 dwellings per gross acre. Land area per dwelling would range between one
dwelling per ten acres to one dwelling per 6,000 square feet. This designation includes existing
single family subdivisions and undeveloped or underdeveloped land west of Santa Paula Creek.
This land use category insures continued stability of exclusively single-family residential
neighborhoods through prohibition of incompatible land uses, or more intense residential uses.
Through traffic would also be discouraged.             Traditional single-family housing would
predominate. However, well-designed planned residential developments providing cluster
housing that blends with the single-family character of the area will be allowed if adequate
compensating open space is provided and the proposed density does not exceed that established
by the zoning district in which the planned development was requested. Second units are
allowed if all zoning requirements are fulfilled.
           Medium Density Residential. The purpose of this designation is to provide a residential
area where a range of residential land uses from low-density single-family to medium-density
multi-family housing is compatibly arranged in an appropriate neighborhood setting. The
density range proposed in these areas would be from 8 to 15 dwellings per gross acre. Land area
per dwelling would be a minimum of 3,000 square feet.
The type of units developed in this category could range from single-family detached units to
smaller multi-unit structures. An appropriate combination or mix of the small lot single-family
(detached and duplex) to the more luxurious garden apartment or townhouse would be
desirable. These residential areas would still have a predominately single-family character.
           Medium-High Density Residential. The purpose of the medium-high density residential
land use category is to provide a wide range of residential housing from single-family to
medium-high density multi-family housing in a compatible manner. The density range proposed
in these areas would be from 16 to 21 dwellings per gross acre. Land area per dwelling would be
a minimum of 2,000 square feet. This zone includes east and west Palm Avenue and various
areas in the City.
The type of units developed in this category could include single-family detached, duplexes,
townhouses and larger multifamily units within a broad economic range.
           High-Density Residential. The purpose of this category is to provide high density
residential housing in the downtown and other appropriate areas within the City. The density
range proposed in these areas would be from 22 to 29 dwellings per gross acre. Land area per
dwelling would be a minimum of 1,500 square feet. This zone includes properties in the central
and west side of town, mostly north of the railroad corridor.
This land use category provides high density residential uses with convenient access to the
downtown shopping area and other City services. Such developments should be located adjacent
to arterial or collector streets for good access.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                LU-48
           Mobile Home Park. Mobile homes have become increasingly popular as an alternative to
conventional housing. The City has six mobile home parks. The majority of the residents are
elderly. The Mobile Home Park category applies to all currently developed Mobile Home Parks
and will be applied to all proposed Mobile Home Parks. The density standard is for 0 - 10 units
per gross acre. Proposed mobile home parks shall be established as a condominium development
(individual ownership.)
General Planning Standards for Mobile Home Parks include:
           1.  Ten-acre minimum site.
           2.  Six-foot masonry walls to buffer noise.
           3.  Adequate on-site developed recreational areas.
           4.  Use of extensive landscaped open spaces and site design to mitigate environmental
               impacts and promote mobile homes as an alternative to traditional housing.
           5. Adequate storage for residents.
           Mixed Use: Residential/Office and Commercial/Light Industrial.             A mixed-use
designation would apply to areas where housing and commercial or industrial uses currently co-
exist or are encouraged to be developed in an integrated fashion. Examples of mixed use include
older retail developments along Main Street, where apartments are housed above retail and office
uses. Another example is in industrial areas where photographers, sculptors, or designers set up
studio space along with their residence. Such uses are considered beneficial to urban
neighborhoods, and the General Plan seeks to endorse those benefits. The General Plan intends
to both acknowledge existing mixed-use areas such as in the southeast neighborhood and the
downtown, and encourage new mixed use development in East Area 1.
The mixed residential/office use would be allowed in the Downtown area and as designated on
the Land Use Plan Map. Housing would be allowed on upper floors, and offices would be
allowed on the ground floor. Residential densities could not exceed the City’s Medium High
Density category of 21 units per gross acre.
The mixed use Commercial/Light Industrial land use would be allowed in the east part of
downtown Santa Paula in areas north and south of Main Street and to the north and south of SR
126 in both the east and west sides of town. This use would allow for heavy commercial uses –
such as farm implement sales – and associated storage, warehousing, and manufacturing. The
use is designed to acknowledge and encourage a work/sale use and to support the agricultural
industry. Also, artist live-work spaces are encouraged in this area.
E. Commercial Land Uses
A healthy business community can provide choice and convenience for the consumer, along with
profits for the developer and business person. The plan provides for three hierarchical categories
of shopping centers: Central Business District, Community Shopping Center, and Neighborhood
Shopping Centers. Three land use categories are also proposed: Commercial, Commercial Office,
and Neighborhood Commercial. Only one new major commercial area is proposed in East 2, but
neighborhood serving commercial is proposed in each of the residential expansion areas.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                LU-49

           Commercial. The purpose of this land use category is to designate areas that will provide
services for the entire community and will accommodate specialized uses which serve the City at
large, such as auto sales. The classification is applied to the “downtown” area of the City as well
as expansion in the East Area 2. The “downtown” area is the traditional commercial center of the
City, and its well being is essential to the community’s identity and the sustenance of commercial
activity in the City’s core. This land use provides a range of goods and services at a concentrated
scale. This classification is also applied to all other commercial uses in the City including areas
zoned C-1 and C-2, along Harvard Boulevard, but not neighborhood commercial areas or
commercial office areas.
           Commercial Office. The purpose of this land use category is to set aside certain areas
within the City for the exclusive use of low profile professional and limited commercial office
development. Such developments shall maintain high standards relating to: open space, the
concentration of buildings, parking facilities, landscaping, pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
Commercial offices are encouraged to concentrate in the Central Business District and in select
locations in or abutting community shopping centers. Limited amounts of such professional
offices should be permitted in community shopping centers or in low-density professional centers
abutting shopping centers.
This land use category provides for the grouping of the medical and dental professions, lawyers,
engineers, architects and other similar services. Medical clinics, banks, savings and loans, real
estate, insurance, utility offices and facilities for other administrative functions related to the
operation of both private and public corporations are also included in this classification.
           Neighborhood Commercial. The purpose of the Neighborhood Commercial category is
to provide an area of convenience shopping and personal services, which is supportive of, and
compatible with the neighborhood where it is located. Neighborhood shopping centers would
range in size from existing small lots (neighborhood corner stores) to new village center sites in
the expansion or planning areas that would measure up to ten acres. Under normal conditions,
all shopping facilities in the neighborhood should be combined in one location for the
convenience of the shopper. Such centers, unlike scattered stores, can effectively provide buffer
strips, adequate parking and protection from future uncontrolled spread of commerce. Site
design and landscaping should be provided in a harmonious manner to protect nearby residential
structures from noise, traffic hazards, and glare.
The types of goods sold in the neighborhood commercial developments are those that are
important to daily family life. The following facilities may be included in the neighborhood
shopping center: food market, drug store, barber shop, beauty parlor, dry cleaner, video rental,
restaurant, laundromat, automobile service station, and doctor/dentist offices.
F. Industrial Land Uses
Three industrial land use categories have been developed to encourage the continued viability of
existing industrial development while providing encouragement for new industry to locate in the
City. The Land Use Plan provides area for light, clean industry within the heart of the City, land
for more intense industrial development needing rail or freeway access, and land for future
industrial parks. Residential uses, except for studios and caretaker facilities, are discouraged in
industrial areas due to compatibility concerns.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821               LU-50

The industrial use categories proposed for the City include Industrial Park, Light Industrial, and
Industrial.
           Industrial Park. The purpose of the Industrial Park category is to provide locations
within the planning area where mixed production and administrative functions can be sited
within a full-service campus setting. This land use category would contain development
standards for landscaping, screening, and site design, and would be subject to a planned
development review process. Both small industrial and compatible commercial uses are
encouraged. The category offers a location for major corporate campus and research and
development uses. Though individual uses could be smaller than ten acres, the industrial park
designation will not be applied to land areas smaller than ten acres in size.
           Light Industrial. The purpose of the Industrial category is to provide for a wide range of
industrial uses. Development and performance standards are required to mitigate objectionable
characteristics. Light manufacturing activities include manufacturing typically having few if any
nuisance characteristics, including manufacture, compounding, assembling or treatment of
articles or merchandise from previously prepared materials, manufacturing of food, clothing,
cosmetics, electrical instruments, furniture, tools, and other related types of activities.
General manufacturing includes any kind of manufacture, processing or treatment of products
other than those that produce, cause or omit any fumes, odor, dust, smoke, gas, noise or
vibrations that are or may be detrimental to properties in the neighborhood.
Commercial uses of a supporting nature to light and general manufacturing activities may be
permitted. These uses should serve the area’s businesses and employees (food establishments,
office supplies, tool sales, and storage). Examples of typical light industrial uses include
recreation vehicle storage, moderate scale enterprises where goods and commodities are both
manufactured and sold on the same or separate premises.
The Light Industrial land use also provides a location where mixed manufacturing and
administrative office uses can be sited. Any light industrial activity that could successfully
mitigate objectionable characteristics would be acceptable within this category. This land use
category contains above average site development standards for landscaping, screening, and site
design, through a planned development review process.
Industrial parcels ranging from less than one acre to forty acres or more would be allowed. This
would encourage both small industrial and compatible commercial uses along with areas for
major industrial development.
           Industrial. The purpose of the Industrial category is to provide for all types of industry,
including custom industry, light manufacturing, general and heavy manufacturing activities.
Industrial activities that have objectionable characteristics should be allowed only in heavy
industrial zoning districts.
Heavy industrial uses shall be required to mitigate objectionable characteristics through the
application of site design standards, environmental standards, and by review under a
Conditional Use Permit process.

G. Airport Land Uses
Santa Paula Airport is a privately-owned and operated aviation facility that serves the needs of
City citizens and fliers throughout the world. The airport property itself is owned by the Santa
Paula Airport Association, while various adjacent parcels are under separate ownership. The
proximity of the airport to populated areas of the City presents certain land use problems that are
being addressed by the City in an ongoing manner. The General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance
provide the means of assuring compatibility between the various land uses in the vicinity of the
airport.
The General Plan proposes two categories of airport land use: Airport Operational, which
permits actual runway, hanger, terminal buildings and like uses; Airport-Related, which permits
airplane sales and other limited commercial facilities and aircraft manufacturing and services as
well as normal light manufacturing uses. Residential uses are not allowed. The Ventura County
Airports Comprehensive Land Use Plan, a document that governs all aviation facilities in the
County, has established inner and outer safety zones applicable to Santa Paula Airport. These
zones guide certain land use standards, including use and height of structures. The inner safety
zone prohibits storage of chemicals or petroleum products, permanent residents, and allows only
limited occupancy. The Safety Element of this General Plan provides more information on this
point.
           Airport Operational. The purpose of the Airport Operational land use is to provide an
area to facilitate the actual operations of the airport. The uses permitted include: runways and
like facilities, communication facilities, terminal buildings, sale of aviation fuel and products,
airplane rentals, charters, delivery services, flying schools, aircraft storage, hangers and tie-
downs.
The Airport Operational land use is limited to large parcels and should not be established on
parcels to allow the expansion of the runway and hanger facilities. The length of runway and the
height of the buildings within the approach and take-off zones should continue to be regulated.
           Airport-Related Use. The purpose of the Airport-Related land use category is to supply
commercial and industrial uses that complement and enhance the airport, but not necessarily the
community as a whole. Uses in the Airport Related area should be limited to airplane and related
equipment sales, service stations, business offices, car rental agencies, restaurants, taxi stands, air
photography, survey and mapping services. Uses could include airplane repair and painting,
parts manufacturing, and outdoor storage. Portions of this area may also be affected by the
airport safety zones that limit structures and land uses.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821              LU-52
H. Institutional and Civic Uses
Institutional and civic uses would include:
              Park and recreational facilities such as parks, public and private golf courses, arenas, trails and
               linear parks, and open space; flood control facilities;
              Public facilities such as treatment plants and utility staging areas;
              Schools;
              Utility and service facilities such as transformer stations and staging facilities; and
              Civic buildings such as city hall, community centers, and fire stations.
I. Overlays and Special Study Areas
The following overlays/special study areas have not been outlined on the Land Use Map Plan;
however, this General Plan includes specific goals, policies, and implementation measures related
to these areas. Each will require specific studies which will determine the location of these areas.
           Downtown Improvement Overlay. The Downtown Improvement Overlay applies to the
downtown area established in the Downtown Design Development/Improvement Plan. This
plan was adopted in 1996, and its policies and programs are supported in this General Plan. The
overlay will have the effect of requiring special development and design review for projects
proposed within an the overlay district to support and revitalize the downtown area.
           Historical Overlay. The Historic Overlay will initially be applied to areas identified as the
downtown historic district in the Downtown Improvement Plan. The overlay will have the effect
of requiring special development and design review for projects proposed within an identified
historic district. Other potential historic districts may be identified in future studies and this
overlay should be added to these areas.
           Mining Resource Overlay. The Mining Resource Overlay is applied to those areas
defined by the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology as mineral
resources having statewide importance. In Santa Paula, this overlay applies to aggregate
resources associated with Santa Paula Creek and the Santa Clara River. The overlay will be
further defined in the Santa Clara River Enhancement and Management Plan.
           Special Study Areas. Special Study Areas are those areas within the City General Plan
area that require special policy consideration and standards. This Land Use Element presents
some specific policies for these Special Study Areas. Further study and recommendations in these
areas may be developed within the 2020 planning horizon. The areas include the Downtown
Design Development/Improvement Plan Area, the Harvard Boulevard Corridor, the Railroad
Corridor, the South East Neighborhood, and City Entrances/Gateways.
J. Specific Plan Areas
The Land Use Element requires Specific Plans for all expansion areas, except for annexations of
minor acreage within expansion areas that are already substantially developed . These plans
must be completed before the City considers annexation proposals. Each Specific Plan must
address locations for land uses identified by this Land Use Element. Mitigation of environmental
impacts and design standards for new development must also be addressed.
rev. 1/22/13, CC Reso No. 6821                      LU-53

The following Specific Plan Areas are approved by the City of Santa Paula:
East Area 1 Specific Plan (SP-3). Approximately 501 acres located east of Santa Paula Creek,
west of Haun/Orcutt Creeks, south of the Topatopa Mountains and north of Telegraph Road.
Hallock and Santa Paula Creek Drives will provide the primary north-south vehicular access,
while Teague-McKevett Boulevard and Santa Paula Street will provide primary east-west access.
In addition, a bridge across Santa Paula Creek (via Santa Paula Street) connect to the east end of
the City. The infrastructure plan includes both on- and off-site improvements including,
domestic water conveyance and storage systems, five new water wells, recycled water facilities,
sewer conveyance including force main and sewer lift station and storm water conveyance and
detention. Water would be supplied via existing groundwater resources and are adequate to
supply the proposed land uses. Water supplies would be transferred to the City, per Section
52.021 of the Santa Paula Municipal Code. Utility and service systems would also be provided
(including standard utilities) and include a police substation, fire station, elementary school, high
school and post-secondary institution/community college.
East Gateway Specific Plan (SP-4). Approximately 36.5 acres located east of S. Hallock Drive,
south of Telegraph Road and SR 126, west of Haun Creek and north of the Santa Clara River.
Primary access vehicular access will be provided from S. Hallock Drive, with secondary access,
restricted to right turns in and out only, provided from SR 126. Basic utilities, including, water,
sewer, and other utilities exist in locations adjacent to the Specific Plan area and the City of Santa
Paula Wastewater and Water Master Plans, updated in June 2012, provide for service to this area.
The City’s 2010 Urban Water Management Plan anticipated development of this area and
determined the City’s available water supplies are adequate to serve this area. Drainage will be
provided by a new storm drain system within the Specific Plan area that meets City and County
standards and discharges at the southeast corner of the Specific Plan area into an existing
drainage that runs parallel to, and outlets into, Haun Creek.

           V. LAND USE PLAN- GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
According to the State General Plan Guidelines, the General Plan is a “collection of development
policies.” These policies guide growth within the City limits and the City’s Sphere of Influence.
The development that is allowed by the Land Use Element is to be directed by the goals,
objectives, and policies in this section of the Element, and implemented through the related
implementation measures contained in the following section.
In this element, GOALS are statements that provide direction and state the desired end condition.
 The OBJECTIVES state a specific step toward goal achievement. POLICIES are specific
statements that guide decision-making. They indicate a clear commitment by the City and
generally serve as mandatory criteria. The IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES outlined in the
following section of this element support the goals, objectives, and policies by providing specific
programs and standards to carry out the Land Use Element.
The goals, objectives, and policies that follow are organized according to topics. These topics
were selected with input from the Santa Paula City Council and the General Plan Advisory
Committee as the basis for the Land Use Element. The goals and objectives were endorsed by the
City Council for use in the General Plan Update process. The policies and implementation
measures have been written to support the Council’s goal statements. Each policy statement is
followed by a number or set of numbers that indicate the implementation measure(s) that relate
directly to that policy.

As a comprehensive strategy for the management of Santa Paula’s diverse physical, economic,
and social resources, there is a high level of interrelationship among the topics and elements of
the General Plan. The Land Use Element provides for the types, density/intensity, design, and
distribution of development. The Housing Element provides for the manner in which existing
housing will be conserved and new housing will be produced, in the context of the locations
permitted for residential development by the Land Use Element. The Circulation Element
identifies the types of systems that will efficiently facilitate the movement of people and goods
through Santa Paula to and from the existing and planned land uses. The Conservation and
Open Space Element defines policies for resource protection and enhancement of designated
sensitive areas, and policies for energy and sustainability efforts for existing and planned land
uses. The Safety Element provides for the protection of people and structures from the adverse
effects of natural and man-caused hazards. The Noise Element provides for protection from and
mitigation of noise as it relates to sensitive land uses included in this Land Use Element.

state law. Government Code Section 65302(f), requires that a Noise Element be prepared as part
of a city’s General Plan to identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The
Government Code includes the following requirements for noise elements:
         The noise element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the
         State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify to the extent practicable , as
         determined by the legislative body, current and projected noise levels for all of the following
         sources:
             A. Highways and freeways.
             B. Primary arterials and major local streets.
             C. Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems.
             D. Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operations, aircraft
                  overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance
                  functions related to airport operation.
             E. Local industrial plants, including but not limited to, railroad classification yards.
             F. Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the
                  community noise environment.
         Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of community noise
         equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn). The noise contours shall be prepared
         on the basis of noise monitoring or following generally accepted noise modeling techniques for the
         various sources identified in paragraphs (1) to (6) inclusive.
         The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use
         element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise.
         The noise element shall include implementation measures and possible solutions that address
         existing and foreseeable noise problems, if any. The adopted noise element shall serve as a
         guideline for compliance with the state’s noise insulation standards.
This Noise Element contains descriptive information related to noise sources that are of concern
to Santa Paula. Specific goals, policy statements, and implementation measures that carry out
the goals are also presented.
The purpose of the Noise Element is to maintain the quality of life for Santa Paula residents
through control of excessive or disruptive sources of noise. The goals, objectives, policies, and
implementation measures in this element provide guidelines and mandates for community
actions to prevent future noise exposure and control of the existing noise environment.

                     II. EXISTING CONDITIONS AND ISSUES
This section of the Noise Element describes how noise is measured, identifies current noise
sources in the Santa Paula planning area, and addresses the legal mandates and requirements in
addressing noise issues.
A. Quantification of Noise
Noise level (or volume) is generally measured in decibels (dB) using the A-weighted sound
pressure level (dBA). The A-weighting scale is an adjustment to the actual sound power levels
to be consistent with that of human hearing response, which is most sensitive to frequencies
around 4,000 Hertz (about the highest note on a piano) and less sensitive to low frequencies
(below 100 Hertz). In addition to the actual instantaneous measurement of sound levels, the
duration of sound is important since sounds that occur over a long period of time are more
likely to be an annoyance or cause direct physical damage or environmental stress. One of the
most frequently used noise metrics that considers both duration and sound power level is the
equivalent noise level (Leq). The Leq is defined as the single steady A-weighted level that is
equivalent to the same amount of energy as that contained in the actual fluctuating levels over a
period of time. Typically, Leq is summed over a one hour period.
The sound pressure level is measured on a logarithmic scale with the 0 dB level based on the
lowest detectable sound pressure level that people can perceive (an audible sound that is not
zero sound pressure level). Decibels cannot be added arithmetically, but rather are added on a
logarithmic basis. Based on the logarithmic scale, a doubling of sound energy is equivalent to
an increase of 3 dB and a sound that is 10 dB less than the ambient sound level has no effect on
ambient noise. Because of the nature of the human ear, a sound must be about 10 dB greater
than the reference sound to be judged as twice as loud. In general, a 3 dB change in community
noise levels is noticeable, while 1-2 dB changes generally are not perceived. Quiet suburban
areas typically have noise levels in the range of 40-50 dBA, while those along arterial streets are
in the 50-60+ dBA range. Normal conversational levels are in the 60-65 dBA range, and ambient
noise levels greater than that can interrupt conversations.
Noise levels typically attenuate at a rate of 6 dBA per doubling of distance from point sources
such as industrial machinery. Noise from lightly traveled roads typically attenuates at a rate of
about 4.5 dBA per doubling of distance. Noise from heavily traveled roads typically attenuates
at about 3 dBA per doubling of distance.
The actual time period in which noise occurs is also important since noise that occurs at night
tends to be more disturbing than that which occurs during the daytime. The Community Noise
Equivalent Level (CNEL) recognizes this characteristic by weighting the hourly Leqs over a 24-
hour period. The weighting involves the addition of 5 dB to actual evening noise levels (7:00
pm to 10:00 pm) noise levels and 10 dBA to actual nighttime (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) noise levels
account
for the greater amount of disturbance associated with noise at these time periods.
Figure N-1 presents the California Department of Health, Office of Noise Control, noise
                                                 N-2
compatibility guidelines for various land uses. The compatibility table illustrates the ranges of
community noise exposure in terms of what is “normally acceptable,” “conditionally
acceptable,” “normally unacceptable,” and “clearly unacceptable.” For the most sensitive uses
such as single family residential, 60 dBA CNEL is the maximum normally acceptable level.
These guidelines are used to assess whether or not noise poses a conflict with land
development.
B. Existing Noise Sources
In general, noise is not a significant issue in Santa Paula. The primary noise sources affecting
sensitive receptors (homes, schools, hospitals) in the city are traffic on State Routes 126 (SR 126) and
150 (SR 150), as well as aircraft operations at the Santa Paula Airport. Some industrial, commercial,
and agricultural uses are also identified as noise contributors, although such sources have not
generally been identified as significant noise problems. Each potential noise source affecting
development in the City is described in more detail below. Estimated existing noise contours from
SR 126, SR 150, and Santa Paula Airport are shown on Figure N-2 and measured noise levels are
illustrated on Figure N-3, Measured Noise Levels. It should be noted that the contours presented
are outdoor noise levels and only account for attenuation due to distance, not from sound wall
structures or other noise barriers. The contours are intended to show generally where higher noise
levels may occur.
         Roadways. Table N-1 shows current noise levels along several of the most heavily traveled
roads in Santa Paula. SR 126, SR 150, Harvard Boulevard, and Peck Road (near the freeway) are the
only local roadways that currently carry enough traffic to produce significant noise levels. Current
noise conditions are described below.
SR 126. SR 126, the Santa Paula Freeway, is the primary east-west route crossing the City. Traffic is
relatively light for a freeway, ranging from 18,000 average daily traffic volume (ADT) just east of
the City to 34,000 ADT immediately west of town. In the vicinity of Tenth Street, the average
distance to the 60 dBACNEL noise contour from the freeway centerline in the absence of any
intervening barriers is about 230 feet. In general, current land uses adjacent to the freeway are not
noise sensitive. The exception is between Peck Road and Steckel Road, where residential
development on both sides of the freeway is within the 60 dBA CNEL noise contour. North of the
freeway, this residential development extends nearly to Palm Avenue. This level of noise exposure
would be considered “conditionally acceptable” using the Land Use Compatibility Matrix (see
Figure N-1).
SR 150. SR 150 is the primary access between SR 126 and Ojai, with traffic volumes of
approximately 12,000 ADT. It is a major north-south corridor linking downtown Santa Paula with
the residential areas at the northern end of the City. The 60 dBA noise contour produced by traffic
on this roadway is located approximately 80 feet from the roadway centerline. Thus, only
residential development directly adjacent to the road would experience noise levels above 60 dBA
CNEL. In general, the primary areas of noise concern are north of Saticoy Street, where traffic
speeds increase and residential development is more prevalent.

Harvard Boulevard. Harvard Boulevard is a primary east-west corridor that parallels SR 126, with
traffic volumes exceeding 14,000 ADT. This was the main highway through town before SR 126
was built. As a result, most of the development along this road is commercial or industrial in
nature, and thus not sensitive to noise impacts. However, there is scattered noise-sensitive
residential development between Peck Road and Steckel Drive. Homes that directly front on
Harvard Boulevard are within the 60 dBA contour, which extends approximately 100 feet from the
roadway centerline.
Peck Road. Peck Road carries significant traffic (11,400 ADT) between SR 126 and Harvard
Boulevard. Although the 60 dBA noise contour extends approximately 116 feet from the roadway
centerline, there is no noise-sensitive development along this portion of Peck Road. North of
Harvard Boulevard, traffic is much lighter (4,100 ADT), with noise levels commensurately less.
         Santa Paula Airport. Santa Paula Airport is an uncontrolled public-use airport
encompassing about 38 acres south of SR 126. Its single 2,650-foot runway generally supports
private propeller-driven aircraft. No commercial service has been extended to the airport. The
airport's 52,000 operations in 1990 were the lowest number of any airport in the County, and
accounted for about 12 percent of all the operations countywide. The Airport Land Use Plan
indicates that the number of operations is not expected to rise significantly by 2010, partly because
the airport is uncontrolled, and partly because the local geography (mountains, city) severely limits
its expansion potential.
Aircraft noise is generally not a problem in the City (noise levels for the airport are also illustrated
on Figure N-2, Existing Noise Contours). The general traffic pattern zone is south of the City, over
the Santa Clara River. Local ordinance requires that aircraft maintain an altitude of at least 1,500
feet above sea level when approaching or departing the City. The primary noise concern noted by
the public relating to the airport is aerobatics, which are periodically practiced east of the City.
The airport property is surrounded by industrial development on either end of the runway. The
                                                   N-7
Santa Paula Freeway provides a barrier to the north, while there is generally no development to the
south due to the presence of the Santa Clara River.
         Industrial Operations. Industrial development is located along Telegraph Road, Peck
Road, Main Street and south of the freeway adjacent to the airport. Noise generated by plant
operations and heavy equipment may impact nearby residential areas, parks, schools, and a mental
care facility. For example, some residents living near the Calavo plant on Main Street near Peck
Road have noted that there are periodic loud noises in the early morning hours due to truck
operations. These residents indicate that this is an annoyance, and have occasionally filed
complaints with the City. The Weyerhauser plant has also been noted as a noise source. However,
industrial operations have not been formally identified as a major issue since the Noise Element’s
adoption in 1974.
         Commercial Operations. Commercial operations located in the area of Laurie Lane, Steckel
Drive, Harvard and Palm Streets, Main and 7th Streets, and in the Downtown, may produce noise
that affects nearby sensitive land uses such as residential developments and schools. However,
these effects are generally minor. Noise due to commercial uses has not been a significant issue in
the community.
         Agricultural Operations. Noise from tractors and other agricultural equipment such as
frost control are the major sources of agricultural noise. Many of these noise sources lie outside the
City and are related to seasonal operations. Packing operations, including refrigeration trucks, and
movement of farm equipment are sources of noise that have the potential to affect the City, but are
not a constant source of noise. Farm equipment movement usually occurs on Santa Paula Street
and Harvard Boulevard during busy agricultural times of the year. While these sources may
periodically affect City residents they are usually outside the City’s jurisdiction to enforce noise
ordinances.
         Santa Paula Branch Line Railroad. Historically, there was significant rail traffic on the
Santa Paula Branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad Line that runs through the City. Passenger
trains used to connect Santa Paula with Ventura, Fillmore and the cities of northern Los Angeles
County. However, regular rail traffic has stopped, primarily because the railroad tracks have been
removed between Piru and Santa Clarita, and the corridor in that area is privately owned. Now the
tracks are used infrequently in Santa Paula. The Fillmore Western Rail Road operates three round
trip excursion trains (tourist oriented) during daytime hours on weekends between Fillmore and
Santa Paula. The railroad is also used by local agricultural operations in Santa Paula and
occasionally by Hollywood film productions that use the City as a backdrop. Current operations
on the rail line have not created a serious noise concern.
The Santa Paula Branch Line was purchased by the Ventura County Transportation Commission in
1995. It is uncertain what the ultimate use of the rail corridor will be. Part of the long-term strategy
being considered by both Ventura County and Los Angeles County is to revive the rail line for
commuter use. Expansion of the excursion trains from Fillmore and increased freight use are goals
of VCTC. A multi-purpose trail system may also be implemented within the right-of-way. Land
use plans for development near the corridor should consider the potential for railroad operations to
resume in the future.
         Nuisance Noise. Sources of nuisance noise identified by the community are loud music
                                                  N-8

from portable radios, car stereos, and barking dogs. These and other such nuisance noises are
common to cities and are addressed generally in the Enforcement section of the Noise Element.
        City Noise Ordinance. The City of Santa Paula Noise Ordinance (Chapter 93 of the
Santa Paula Municipal Code) regulates noise in the City. The ordinance regulates against loud
or unnecessary noise, and defines sources of such noise. Operation of machines, construction
work, loud voices, and other sources of noise are restricted by time of day and to the degree
that they annoy or disturb other people.
                                               N-9
                                    III. FUTURE CONDITIONS
This section discusses noise conditions anticipated to occur in the City at buildout of the
General Plan.
A. Traffic Noise
SR 126, SR 150, Harvard Boulevard, and Peck Road (near the freeway) are the only local roadways
that carry enough traffic to produce significant noise levels and are illustrated in Figure N-4, Future
Noise Contours. These noise levels were calculated to give a “worst case” scenario and do not
account for noise attenuation from buildings or other barriers. Future noise conditions are
described below for SR 126, SR 150, and other existing and planned major roads. Table N-2 shows
the estimated ADT for selected road segments and the estimated dBA CNEL at 100 feet from the
centerline of each roadway.

        SR 126. (the Santa Paula Freeway) is the primary east-west route crossing the City. The
projected future ADT for the freeway west of 10th Street is 70,000, with an average distance to the 60
CNEL noise contour line at about 1650 feet.
Noise sensitive residential developments between Peck Road and Steckel Drive, where residential
developments on both sides of the freeway are within the 60 dBA noise contour would be affected.
Residences along Harvard Boulevard north of the freeway would also be affected by noise from SR
126.

Figure N-4 future contours
                           N-11
         SR 150. SR 150 is the primary access between SR 126 and Ojai and would expect an increase
in ADT ranging from approximately 5,000 to 7,000. The 60 dBA noise contour produced by
buildout traffic ranges from approximately 78 feet in the downtown area to 147 feet in the area of
Say Road from the centerline of SR150. Residential development adjacent to the road would expect
levels in this range.
         Harvard Boulevard. Harvard Boulevard is a primary east-west corridor that parallels SR
126, with ADT anticipated to reach 19,200 between Peck Road and Steckel Drive where residential
uses are located. Homes that directly front Harvard Boulevard are within the 60 dBA contour,
which will extend approximately 189 feet from the roadway centerline.
         Peck Road. Peck Road carries significant traffic between SR 126 and Harvard Boulevard
and would be expected to reach an ADT of 13,000 between Santa Paula Road and Telegraph Road
at General Plan buildout. The future noise level within 100 feet of the centerline of Peck Road is
estimated at 63.9 dBA CNEL. This level of noise exceeds the normally acceptable level for
residences and Blanchard School located along this portion of Peck Road.
         Adams Canyon Road. Adams Canyon Road is located northwest of Santa Paula and has
been identified as an area of potential expansion in the Land Use Element. This primarily rural area
currently experiences daytime ambient noise levels of less than 50 dBA. If the area was full
developed, an ADT of approximately 22,000 could be expected with a dBA CNEL of 64.0 within 100
feet of the road centerline. Such levels would exceed normally acceptable levels for residential use.
B. Other Future Noise Sources
         Santa Paula Airport. Under the Airports Comprehensive Land Use Plan Update for
Ventura County, land uses are restricted in the airport vicinity for safety reasons, and are
primarily limited to activities that minimize human exposure to aviation hazards. Future use of
the airport is not expected to significantly increase over existing conditions, and, therefore,
would not be considered a major noise issue in the foreseeable future. Noise contours for
projected future (2010) airport operations are shown on Figure N-3. The Ventura County
Transportation Commission is currently updating its Airports Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
Although no significant increase in traffic at Santa Paula Airport is currently anticipated the
City will need to work with the VCTC in its planning effort to ensure that aircraft noise does not
become a major issue.
         Industrial Operations. Future industrial development in the City of Santa Paula would
generally be located away from existing and planned residential and other sensitive uses that
would be incompatible with industry. Therefore, noise associated with industrial activities would
be expected from sources such as truck traffic serving industrial operations. Future noise from
industrial activity is not anticipated to be a major issue and will be addressed on a case-by-case
basis.
         Commercial Operations. Generally, noise impacts from commercial operations are minor
and mostly related to traffic and machinery. This condition is not expected to worsen significantly
with buildout of the General Plan. Future commercial development would be located in a pattern
that would not significantly affect sensitive uses. Enforcement of the City’s Noise Ordinance and
                                                   N-12

implementation of policies of the Noise Element will assist to further reduce noise impacts related
to commercial operations.
         Agricultural Operations. Agricultural noise sources are not considered to be a major
source of noise existing in the City. Sporadic noise from farm operations is anticipated to continue
in and around the City Santa Paula. Packing operations and movement of farm equipment are
sources of noise likely to continue in the future, but are not expected to become major noise issues
for the community. Noise from outside of the City is not easily regulated by City ordinance or
plans.
         Santa Paula Branch Line Railroad. The line was purchased by the Ventura County
Transportation Commission in 1995. It is uncertain what the ultimate use of the rail corridor will
be. Part of the long-term strategy being considered by both Ventura County and Los Angeles
County is to revive the rail line for commuter use. A multi-purpose trail system may also be
implemented within the right-of-way. It is expected that the Fillmore Western Company may
increase excursion use along the corridor and that freight service will also increase. Depending
upon future development and demand for such services, the line could become more active. Noise
from the line would be intermittent, but could be a potentially significant source of future noise for
the sensitive uses in the vicinity of the corridor.
                                                    N-13
                    IV. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
In this element, GOALS are statements that provide direction and state the desired end
condition. The OBJECTIVES state a specific step toward goal achievement. POLICIES are
specific statements that guide decision-making. They indicate a clear commitment by the city
and generally serve as mandatory criteria. IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES support the goals,
objectives, and policies by providing specific programs and standards to carry out the Noise
Element policies.
The goals, objectives, and polices that follow include both general goals for limiting noise
exposure and measures to address specific noise sources in the City. These areas were selected
with input from the Santa Paula City Council and the community as important topics for the
Noise Element.
                                       GENERAL GOALS
1.1     Existing exposure of citizens to excessive noise sources should be reduced.
1.2     Development should mitigate undue generation of noise.
1.3     The City of Santa Paula should consider the noise environment as part of land use
        planning.
                                         TRAFFIC NOISE
Objective
1(a)    Minimize the adverse effect of traffic-generated noise on residential and other noise
        sensitive land uses from noise and highways.

                          V. IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
This section of the Noise Element indicates the actions and programs that shall be carried out by
the City of Santa Paula to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the Noise Element.
These implementation measures, together with the policies, establish and guide the City’s
annual budget process and day-to-day decision-making so there is continuing progress toward
attainment of the goals and objectives. Some policies and implementation measures may need
to be re-examined and revised during the plan’s time frame. Implementation measures with a
letter following the measure number (i.e., 3a) have been added during revision, update, or
amendment processes. This number/letter system was used to eliminate the need for
renumbering as subsequent additions or revisions to implementation measures are made.
The City of Santa Paula shall take the following actions to implement noise goals, objectives,
and policies.
                    ORDINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
1.       Amend the development code as necessary to account for the policies and programs
         contained in the Noise Element.
2.       Establish exterior land use noise compatibility standards in the Development Code for
         all new development based on the guidelines shown on Figure N-1 of this Noise
         Element.
3.       Incorporate in the development code requirements that limit maximum interior levels to
         45 dBA Ldn in all new residential construction.
3a.      For new development within the generalized 60 dBA CNEL noise contour as shown in
         Figure N-4 of this Noise Element, project applicants shall fund site-specific noise studies
         to mitigate project impacts. The determination of whether a project site is within the 65
         dBA contour is the responsibility of the Planning Department.
3b.      When development is subject to noise levels requiring mitigation, the following
         measures shall be considered and preference shall be given in the following order:
                 1. Site layout, including setbacks, open space separation and shielding of noise sensitive
                     uses with non-noise-sensitive uses.
                 2. Acoustical treatment of buildings.
                 3. Structural measures: construction of earthen berms or wood or concrete barriers.
4.       Incorporate into the development code standards and requirements that protect
         inhabitants from impacts of exterior noise, prevent the transference of interior noise to
         the outside, prevent transference of noise between residential units and individual
         businesses in multi-tenant buildings, and prevent transference of noise between
         commercial and residential uses in mixed structures. Standards for insulation,
         windows, building materials, walls and roofs shall be included.
                                                   N-19

5. Include in the development code standards and requirements for parking structures and
   lots to prevent noise effects on-site and on adjacent noise sensitive uses. These could
   include the use of buffers containing landscape and/or sound walls, use of sound
   absorbing materials to minimize sound amplification and transmission, enclosure of the
   façade of parking structures facing a residence, limitation of the hours of operation of
   surrounding surface parking lots, and other appropriate techniques.
6. Incorporate into the Development Code requirements that all residential, health care,
   convalescent homes, religious facilities, and other noise-sensitive uses be reviewed (by
   City staff) for their presence in high noise impact areas (of 60 dBA and greater, as
   depicted by the Existing and Future Noise Contour Maps show on Figures N-2 and N-4
   or as updated by supplemental study). When these uses are proposed within the 60
   dBA contour or within fifty (50) feet of this contour, the applicant shall:
            a. Conduct field measurements by a qualified environmental
                scientist/acoustical engineer to determine a more precise location of existing
                and projected future noise levels (based on traffic projections included in the
                Circulation Element or as accepted by the City); and
            b. Identify and commit to measures to mitigate noise impacts (by siting of
                structures outside of high noise levels, insulation, attenuation, walls or
                buffers, landscape, or other acceptable techniques) if within the 60 dBA
                contour.
7. Incorporate into the Development Code requirements that all industrial, commercial,
   and transportation uses be evaluated by City staff, for their potential to generate noise
   over 60 dBA at adjacent noise sensitive uses as part of the development and
   environmental review process. Where a determination that noise from a project may
   generate noise over 60 dBA has been made by City Staff, the developer shall:
            a. Have an analysis of potential noise impacts prepared by a qualified
                environmental scientist/acoustical engineer; and
            b. Identify and commit to measures to mitigate noise impacts (siting of
                use/operations, incorporation of noise walls, berms, or insulation, or other
                acceptable attenuation technique).
   Table N-3 provides examples of the amount of attenuation that would be expected with
   different types of construction. For sensitive noise receptors that may be developed in
   or adjacent to high noise areas, construction techniques, such as those described in Table
   N-3, can reduce noise to acceptable interior noise standards, usually 45 dBA CNEL or
   less. The Sound Transmission Class (STC) shows the transmission loss in dBA
                                            N-20

                    Cavity Walls 10cm to 20 cm, various        47 to 50
                    finishes
                              DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REVIEW
8.   The City shall review development proposals according to their potential noise impacts
     on abutting uses and impacts by abutting uses in accordance with the standards and
     requirements stipulated by this Plan and incorporated into the Development Code
8a.  The City shall consider the use of temporary noise barriers, limited hours of operation,
      limiting times of year for construction near schools to reduce construction-related noise.
9.   Development projects shall be reviewed in accordance with maximum anticipated, or
     “worst case” noise conditions as the basis for land use decisions and design controls to
     prevent future incompatibilities.
10.  The City shall review the street layout of proposed residential subdivisions with the
     objective of reducing traffic volumes and through trips as a means to reduce noise levels.
     The use of road dips, diagonal parking, one-way streets, speed humps, and other traffic
     controls shall be considered to reduce vehicular travel and speed, provided that
     engineering and safety standards are met. If determined to be feasible, rubberized
     asphalt paving material shall be required for all new roads.
10a. Speed limits are legally set in accordance with the prevailing speed of traffic based on
     engineering studies. However, when feasible, consistent and necessary, the reduction of
     speed limits on arterials should be used to decrease ambient noise levels.
11.  The City shall evaluate the noise impacts of truck deliveries on adjacent residential
     properties as a part of the development and environmental review process for all
     commercial and manufacturing uses. Where truck deliveries would have the potential
     to create noise exceeding 60 dBA CNEL at an adjacent noise sensitive use, the inclusion
     of noise mitigation techniques such as the use of sound wall or enclosure of delivery
     areas shall be required.
                                                N-21

11a. To reduce noise associated with truck traffic, the City should implement the following
     noise reduction strategies:
     •   The City, in cooperation with Caltrans, shall consider a truck noise reduction plan for
         Highway 150 and any other roads that experience truck traffic.
     •   The City and Caltrans shall consider limitations on hours of operation and other truck
         operations that could be limited to reduce noise impacts.
     •   The City should encourage the use of established designated truck routes in accordance with
         Figure CI-8 of the Circulation Element that avoid residential areas and confine truck traffic
         to major throughfares.
     •   The City should post designated areas and times to prohibit the use of jake brakes along
         established truck routes adjacent to sensitive uses. For postings along SR 150 and SR 126,
         the City should work with Caltrans to establish restrictions on the use of jake brakes.
     •   The City shall consider incorporating truck noise restrictions into the City Noise Ordinance.
                                        ENFORCEMENT
12.  The City shall aggressively pursue enforcement of its Noise Ordinance to respond and
     mitigate noise violations. Nuisance noise, such as barking dogs and loud music, shall
     also be an enforcement priority for the City.
13.  The City shall monitor and enforce implementation of noise mitigation requirements
     imposed as part of the project permitting process.
14.  The City shall work with the Santa Paula Airport to ensure that local ordinances and
     state and federal regulations regarding altitudes of departing and arriving aircraft are
     met.
15.  Enforce sections of the California Vehicle Code related to mufflers and modified exhaust
     systems.
                             EQUIPMENT IMPROVEMENTS
16.  Request noise level specifications from vendors when purchasing new public equipment
     or vehicles to ensure that noise levels are not excessive.
17.  Work with farmers in and around the City to address any identified noise problems
     relating to the use of farm equipment such as frost protection equipment and farm
     machinery routes on City streets.
                     INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION
18.  Work with public agencies and institutions who maintain facilities in the City to ensure
     that the noise generated by their activities does not spill over onto adjacent properties.
                                                N-22

19. Support the efforts of the California Department of Transportation and local
    transportation agencies in developing noise reduction measures for State Route 126 and
    State Route 150, including landscaping, sound barrier walls and elevating or depressing
    roads.
20. Work with the Ventura County Transportation Commission to coordinate noise control
    efforts planning for current and future railroad operations.
                                   ADMINISTRATIVE
21. Maintain a data file documenting existing and future noise conditions, using the contour
    maps contained in this Plan. As noise assessments are conducted for proposed projects
    or other noise studies are performed, the data base shall be updated. The noise data
    shall be updated entirely at least once every five years.
22. Review and update noise standards and criteria, as necessary, at least every five years
    to reflect actual noise conditions and available noise control techniques.
23. Work with railroad operators to determine when noise controls may be necessary due to
    the adjacency of railroad lines to residential uses.
24. The City shall consider a program to encourage the use of bicycles to reduce vehicular
    traffic and associated noise in Santa Paula as discussed in the Circulation Element. The
    City shall properly maintain existing bicycle routes, and accordingly, the proposed
    program shall: encourage the use of bicycle education programs; and initiate public
    awareness programs to promote and encourage the use of bicycles.
25. Implement Transportation Management Control programs to reduce vehicular travel
    and associated noise in the City in accordance with goals in the Circulation Element of
    the General Plan.

                               I. PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
The City of Santa Paula has prepared this revised Safety Element of the General Plan in
compliance with California State law. This document supersedes the Seismic Safety Element
prepared for the City in 1974 by the Ventura County Environmental Resources Agency,
Planning Division. It complements and is consistent with the goals and policies and other
elements that make up the City of Santa Paula General Plan.
The adoption or amendment of a general plan is a legislative act. The Safety Element, and all
elements of the General Plan, have equal legal status.
City staff determined that an updated Safety Element was necessary to expand and localize
safety issues specifically for Santa Paula. The updated Safety Element should assist the City in
planning for hazards and responding to disasters by serving the following functions:
            Providing an accurate and updated assessment of the natural and human-related hazards in
             the City, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, subsidence/settlement,
             expansive soils, liquefaction, seiche, dam inundation, fire, flood, and release of hazardous
             materials;
            Providing a framework by which safety considerations are introduced into the land use
             planning process;
            Recommending revisions in the development review process, by facilitating the identification
             and mitigation of hazards;
            Providing policies directed at identifying and reducing hazards; and
            Strengthening earthquake, inundation, fire, flood, and hazardous materials preparedness
             specific to Santa Paula.
The Safety Element became a mandatory part of the general plan in 1975 when the State
Legislature adopted SB 271 (Chapter 1104). The initial legislation focused on the adoption of
policies relating to fire safety, flooding, and geologic hazards. In 1984 the State revised the
Legislation (AB 2038; Chapter 1009) expanding the list of safety element issues and combining
the Safety Element and Seismic Safety Element into a single document. The focus of the Safety
Element is to adopt policies that will .. “reduce death, injuries, property damage, and the
economic and social dislocation resulting from natural hazards.” Although the emphasis is on
fire, flooding, geologic, and seismic hazards, other relevant safety issues include hazardous
materials, aircraft safety, police protection, crude oil operations within the planning area, and
critical and lifeline facilities.
Section 65302 (g) of the Government Code Section specifies that:
         The general plan shall include a safety element for the protection of the community from any
         unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground
         shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides
         and landslides; subsidence and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding;
         and wild land and urban fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic and
         other geologic hazards. It shall also address evacuation routes, peakload water supply
                                                      S-1

        requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate
        to identified fire and geologic hazards.
Other pertinent sections of the California code pertaining to geologic and seismic hazards
include (Government Code Section 65302.5 and Public Resources Code 2697, 2699 and 4102).
Sections pertaining to Fire include Public Resources Code 4125 and 4128.5. Copies of these
applicable Code sections are included as an Appendix to this document.
The Safety Element is consistent with the other elements of the General Plan, supporting and
complementing the Plan’s goals and policies and the related elements. The Land Use Element
establishes use and density designations, and controls zoning for all land Citywide. Therefore,
the Safety Element considers use and density based upon the degree of hazard that may be
present. Similarly, the Housing and Conservation and Open Space Elements address land that
may be set aside for certain specific purposes. Decisions regarding the location of multi-family
housing, for example, will be better informed when framed within data related to the City’s
safety hazards and emergency service provision. Open space designations are commonly
linked to areas of geologic or flood hazard. The Circulation Element emphasizes transportation
issues, which relates to the provision of emergency response in the event of a disaster.
This Safety Element is designed to provide the input necessary to assist the City of Santa Paula
in achieving balanced planning decisions. It recognizes the importance of the public safety,
and the need to integrate safety concerns with other local issues.

                    II. EXISTING CONDITIONS AND ISSUES
The City of Santa Paula is situated in the Santa Clara River Valley of central Ventura County.
The City boundaries cover about 4.5 square miles. The City’s planning area, which includes
adjacent unincorporated areas under the City’s general planning jurisdiction, covers about 74
square miles. The General Plan, including the Safety Element, applies to this larger planning
area which is also known as the City’s Area of Interest.
The Santa Clara River Valley lies within the Transverse Range Province which is evidenced by
east-west trending mountains bounding the valley on the north and south. The major
drainages to the Santa Clara River within the City’s planning area include: Adams Canyon;
Fagan Canyon; Santa Paula Creek; and Timber Canyon. The developed portions of the City are
located primarily on the Santa Clara Valley floor and on slopes of 0-20%, although a great
majority of the City is on slopes of 5% or less. Steeper slopes exist in the mountainous terrain to
the south toward South Mountain, and to the north toward Sulphur Mountain and Santa Paula
Ridge.
Access to the City is primarily via two major arterials. From the east and west, entrance to the
City is via State Route 126 (SR 126). Access from the north is via State Route 150/Ojai Road (SR
150). A privately owned airport exists within Santa Paula and can accommodate small single-
or double-engine aircraft during the daylight hours.
The City of Santa Paula Police Department provides police protection service to the community
within the corporate boundaries. The main police station is located at 214 South Tenth Street.
The City of Santa Paula also provides fire protection services within the corporate boundaries.
Two fire stations exist within the City: one in the downtown area and one in the west end of
the City. The City of Santa Paula Department of Public Works provides water delivery service
to the City. The water is piped into storage tanks from groundwater wells penetrating the
Santa Paula Groundwater Basin, and then supplied to the public by gravity flow.
The City is served by one area hospital: Santa Paula Memorial Hospital (60 bed facility). There
is also an urgent care facility, Rural Health Care, which is an extension of the Santa Paula
Memorial Hospital.
         Regional Stratigraphy. The Santa Paula planning area lies within the geologic
boundaries of the Ventura Basin. The Ventura Basin has a remarkably thick section of mostly
marine sedimentary rocks, which totals more than 58,000 feet. These deposits reflect perhaps
the thickest accumulation of Pliocene deposits in the world (Norris and Webb, 1990). The
lithologic stratigraphy beneath the Santa Paula area includes thick alluvial and unconsolidated
sediments accumulated beneath the Santa Clara River Valley, overlying Miocene- and Pliocene-
aged bedrock. The Miocene- and Pliocene-aged bedrock outcrops exist on South Mountain,
and south of Sulphur Mountain and Santa Paula Ridge. Eocene-aged bedrock outcrops exist on
Santa Paula Ridge and north of Sulphur Mountain, north of the Santa Clara River Valley.
With the exception of the Saugus Formation (exposed along the northern boundary of the Santa
Clara River in the planning area) and the Sespe Formation (exposed northeast of Santa Paula
                                                 S-3

Ridge and adjacent to the Santa Clara River Valley on the south), the claystone, shale, and
sandstone bedrock exposed in the mountainous regions are sedimentary, relatively soft, and of
marine origin. The marine Eocene rocks exposed in the mountains north of the Santa Clara
River Valley, and within the planning area, consist of the harder Coldwater Sandstone, Cozy
Dell Shale, and Matilija Sandstone. Locally, soil cover and landslides occur on the hillsides.
The location of sedimentary and alluvial sequences, and mapped landslide areas, within the
planning area, can be found on the geologic maps for the Santa Paula and Santa Paula Peak
quadrangles by Dibblee (1990 and 1992). See the Safety Element Appendix for the Dibblee
maps showing local faulting.
        Regional Structural Geology. The City of Santa Paula lies within the western
Transverse Ranges geologic province of southern California. This province is characterized by
east-west trending folds, faults, and mountain ranges -- which are transverse to the northwest
trend of most of the geologic features in California. Structural geology of the region has been
described in several reports including Norris and Webb (1990), Yerkes and Lee (1981), Yeats
and Huftile (1995), and Weber (1973).
Regional east to west trending folds and faults traverse the western Transverse Ranges, and
high rates of deformation have resulted from probable Holocene movement along east-west
trending reverse faults in the planning area. The most prominent of these faults is the San
Cayetano Fault, located in the northern end of the planning area. The San Cayetano Fault is a
north dipping reverse fault, which has thrust older Eocene rocks on top of younger Miocene,
Pliocene, and Pleistocene rocks. The maximum amount of displacement observed is about
9,000 meters at Sespe Creek, northeast of the City of Santa Paula and the planning area. The
San Cayetano Fault is considered an active fault.
The Oak Ridge Fault lies beneath the Santa Clara River and trends northeast-southwest through
the City of Santa Paula Planning Area. The Oak Ridge Fault is a south-dipping, reverse fault
which thrusts lower Miocene and upper Eocene strata over upper Pleistocene strata. South of
the City of Santa Paula, near the Saticoy area, the displacement of sediments by the Oak Ridge
Fault has caused a groundwater barrier. Evidence that the Oak Ridge Fault was active in the
Miocene can be seen in the Oakridge oil field, where the fault separates a thin Miocene
sequence on the south side from a thick Miocene sequence on the north side. The vertical
displacement of the Miocene Saugus Formation near Santa Paula (in the Oakridge oil field) is
approximately 2.3 kilometers.
More recently, the Oak Ridge Fault has been called a “continuation” of the Northridge blind
thrust fault that caused the Northridge earthquake of January 1994 (Yeats and Huftile, 1995).
However, no primary surface rupture seems to have accompanied the Northridge earthquake.
Although the Oak Ridge Fault is not considered active based on the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zoning Act definitions (no evidence supporting surface displacement in the Holocene -
the last 11,000 years), its association with the Northridge blind thrust fault and the Northridge
earthquake of 1994 indicates that the fault should be considered as active for land use purposes,
particularly in the South Mountain area. In addition, the Fault Activity Map of California and
Adjacent Areas compiled by Jennings for the Department of Conservation, California Division
of Mines and Geology (CDMG, 1994), indicates that evidence for Holocene activity on the Oak
Ridge Fault exists south of Fillmore, east of the City of Santa Paula planning area. Figure S-1
shows the location of the San Cayetano and Oak Ridge Fault zones.

A. Seismic and Geologic Hazards
          Seismic Hazards. The Santa Paula area is in a seismically active region. In the western
Transverse Ranges of Southern California, few large earthquakes have occurred historically but
geologic and geodetic data indicate high strain rates (CDMG, 1996). No surface-faulting event
has been recorded within at least the last 200 years in the Santa Paula planning area. Based on
the most recent CDMG study (1995), the average recurrence interval calculated for the Oak
Ridge Fault, of about 250 years, suggests that the City of Santa Paula may experience a
destructive earthquake along this fault within the next 200 years. Seismic hazards that pose the
greatest concern to the City of Santa Paula include seismically-induced ground shaking and
fault rupture.
          Seismically-Induced Ground Shaking. Table S-1 provides a listing of the closest and
most significant regional faults that are modeled herein to predict ground shaking that would
be produced within the planning area. Figure S-1 shows the locations of these faults with
respect to the current City boundaries.

      1-CDMG, Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment for the State of California (1996)
     2-Krinitzsky and Chang, December (1977)
     MMI = Modified Mercalli Intensity
  Note: MMIs were calculated for each fault using the relationship between Mmax magnitudes and distance from
  the epicenter (in this instance the distance from the City of Santa Paula limits and the nearest section of each
  fault) (Krinitzky and Chang, 1977). MMIs can be influenced by site specific features, such as the thickness of
  loosely consolidated alluvium and the depth to groundwater. These factors have not been included in the
  calculation of expected MMIs; thus, the actual intensities that are felt at a site could differ from the levels
  extrapolated here.
The data by CDMG (1997), indicates that the greatest ground acceleration that the City would
be subject to is a peak ground acceleration of 0.83g, which would result in a MMI of X-XI. Such
an event could be produced from a maximum magnitude earthquake of 6.9 occurring along the
Oak Ridge Fault. In areas of loosely consolidated alluvium or areas with a water table within
30 feet from ground surface, MMI levels may be greater. In addition, although lower ground
accelerations may occur in the planning area from an earthquake generated on the San Andreas
or Ventura Faults, a similar MMI (X-XI) is anticipated.
                                                          S-6
The most recent modeling efforts of seismic experts (probabilistic modeling) have attempted to
evaluate earthquake potential for a given area by factoring all available potential fault sources.
The CDMG (1996) have estimated that in the next 50 years, there is about a 10% chance of an
earthquake between magnitudes 6.5 and 7.0, and peak ground accelerations of about 0.83g (10%
in 50 years), within 0 to 5 km from the Santa Paula area. This corresponds to a MMI of VIII or
greater. Please refer to the safety Element Appendix for a detailed description of the
Probablistics Seismic Hazard Analysis performed for Santa Paula by the California Division of
Mines and Geology (CDMG).
Fault Rupture. One potentially active, and one active, fault have been mapped, and identified
through the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, within the City of Santa Paula
planning area: the Oak Ridge Fault; and the San Cayetano Fault, respectively. According to the
CDMG (Treiman, 1997), the San Cayetano Fault, located in the northern portion of the planning
area, is within an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone. The Oak Ridge Fault, though not
within an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone in the planning area, has a section zoned under
the Alquist-Priolo Act south of Fillmore. The Oak Ridge Fault has not been zoned under the
Alquist-Priolo Act within the planning area predominantly because the fault is concealed under
the Santa Clara River. According to the CDMG (Treiman, 1997), the Oak Ridge Fault should be
considered active, and no important facilities should be located in the vicinity of the fault
unless a detailed fault study is performed by a Certified Engineering Geologist.
As geologic studies are performed, there is the possibility that additional active faults may be
identified. Santa Paula should follow the guidelines of the Alquist-Priolo Act for proposed new
development within the City. A setback from the mapped potentially active Oak Ridge Fault
should be considered for critical facilities within the City, including schools, hospitals and
essential service buildings. These constraints should be considered prior to land use planning.
         Geologic Hazards. Geologic hazards that pose the greatest concern to the City of Santa
Paula include liquefaction from seismically-induced ground shaking, slope stability which
includes landslides, debris and mud flows, rock falls, and soil related hazards. All of these
hazards have affected the Santa Paula area to some extent since the mid-1950s, when rapid
development began. An awareness of these potential geohazards is needed with increased
population density and encroachment into the hills and mountains.
         Liquefaction. Based upon the Seismic Hazard Mapping Act criterion and the geologic
maps for the Santa Paula and Santa Paula Peak Quadrangles (Dibblee, 1990 and 1992), areas
within the City of Santa Paula and the surrounding planning area which fall into a high hazard
category for liquefaction due to seismically-induced ground shaking are shown on Figure S-2.
These areas were designated by the presence of unconsolidated alluvial sediments greater than
10 feet thick. Within this entire zone, it was assumed that depth to groundwater fluctuates but
likely rises to within 40 feet of the ground surface (the criteria for high liquefaction potential).
The geologic units (Qa and Qg) considered as potentially liquefiable sediments in this
evaluation, were mapped in the Santa Paula and Santa Paula Peak areas by Dibblee (1992 and
1990). Please refer to the Safety Element Appendix for the Dibblee reference map.
To more accurately determine the potential for liquefaction, site specific geologic studies are
required in accordance with Chapter 6 of CDMG Special Publication 117, Evaluation and
                                                 S-7
Mitigation of Seismic Hazards in California (1997). These studies should be performed prior to
new construction and for the retrofitting of vulnerable structures. The studies should include
site-specific depth to groundwater and the Standard Penetration Test, SPT N-blow counts.
Areas having liquefiable sediments should be identified, and structures should be properly
designed to withstand the conditions.
        Slope Stability (Landslides, Debris and Mud Flows, and Rock Falls). Numerous
landslides have been mapped within the hillsides of the City of Santa Paula (Dibblee, 1990 and
1992). The hillsides also are prone to debris and mud flows, and to rock falls. Land
development near or at the base of canyons, cliffs, or landslides should take these hazards into
consideration during the planning, construction and estimated life of the development.
Because many factors contribute to the instability of hill slopes (precipitation, soil and rock
lithology and induration, seismic ground shaking, steepness of slope, and manmade grading),
the Uniform Building Code (UBC, 1997) requires that site specific investigations be performed
for development on hill sides. These specific investigations require:
           Preliminary studies by a Registered Geotechnical Engineer or Certified Engineering
            Geologist;
           Developers to retain both engineering geologists and geotechnical engineers during
            construction;
           Certification as to the stability of the proposed building site, with relationship to adverse
            effects from rain and earthquakes, prior to the issuance of building permits;
           Coordination between the civil engineer and the project engineering geologist/geotechnical
            engineer during the construction grading;
           Mitigation of onsite hazards caused by grading that may affect adjacent properties,
            including erosion and slope instability; and
           Development within areas with a known high potential for landslides, debris flows, mud
            flows, and rock falls should follow the appropriate criteria (in Chapter 5 of CDMG Special
            Publication 117, and Chapter A-33 of the 1997 UBC) and site specific studies should be
            performed prior to development.
Based on the Seismic Hazard Mapping Act criteria, the geologic maps for the Santa Paula and
Santa Paula Peak Quadrangles (Dibblee, 1990, 1992), and the planning area Slope Map (City of
Santa Paula, 1995), areas within the City of Santa Paula and the surrounding planning area
which fall into a high hazard category for landslides due to seismically-induced ground
shaking are shown on Figure S-2. The areas which fall into a high hazard category for mud and
debris flows, and rock falls are also shown on Figure S-2.

                                          S-9

        Geotechnical Hazards. Geotechnical hazards include expansive soils, settlement,
subsidence, and hydrocompaction. This section focuses on areas within the City of Santa Paula
that have the potential for such failure.
        Expansive Soil. According to the Soil Survey for the Ventura Area (Edwards, et. al.,
1970), soil in portions of South Mountain, Orcutt Canyon, Mud Creek Canyon, Timber Canyon,
and Adams Canyon, within the planning area, have a high shrink-swell potential. The soils
within Santa Clara River Valley, Santa Paula Creek, and the eastern portion of Timber Canyon
generally have a low shrink-swell potential. The remainder of the planning area has a
moderate shrink-swell potential.
Figure S-3 shows the areas of potential highly expansive soil. The areas mapped generally
correspond with “Group D” of the hydrologic soil groups defined in the Soil Survey of Ventura
County. However, because of the apparent complexity of factors affecting soil expansiveness,
the mapped areas are estimates only. Detailed site specific investigations are required to fully
evaluate the shrink-swell characteristics of soils at a given site.
The potential for expansive soils exists in the City of Santa Paula planning area. The shrink-
swell characteristics of soils can vary widely within short distances, depending on the relative
amount and type of clay. Detailed geologic studies are required prior to development to
evaluate the potential for expansive soils. If a site is found to have expansive soils, this can
usually be mitigated through proper foundation design.
        Settlement. Natural soils that are potentially susceptible to settlement can be found in
the Santa Clara River Valley, the east side of Timber Canyon, along Santa Paula Creek, and in a
portion of the South Mountain area south of the Santa Clara River and across from Santa Paula
Creek. The areas with a high potential for settlement are shown on Figure S-3 (Ventura County
Soil Survey, 1970).
Large-scale settlement problems should not be an issue in the study area provided that
adequate soils and foundation studies are performed prior to construction and that UBC
guidelines are followed. Soil with a high potential for settlement exists within the planning
area. The potential for settlement should be addressed during geotechnical studies prior to any
new construction and appropriately minimized or corrected, as necessary, during construction.
        Subsidence. As yet, no recognized subsidence has occurred within the study area due to
either groundwater or oil extraction. Accordingly, the potential for subsidence in the study
area is considered to be minimal. If present, these hazards would be predominantly manifested
in areas of unconsolidated alluvium along the Santa Clara River Valley floor due to extraction
of groundwater from the Santa Paula Groundwater Basin during overdraft1 conditions within
the aquifer. Given that groundwater users comply with the Adjudicated Groundwater Basin
Agreement, the Santa Paula overdraft conditions would not be expected to occur with the
current water demand, nor with future development water demands. Therefore, subsidence
1 Overdraft is when groundwater is being extracted at a faster rate than it can be replenished from natural
supplies, such as rain.

Figure S-3 Geotechnical Hazards
                                S-11
due to groundwater extraction in overdraft conditions is not expected to occur currently, or
with the proposed expansion of the City of Santa Paula.
Large-scale regional subsidence has not occurred in the study area. Because of the limited
amount of groundwater currently being extracted from the basin, and the negligible amount of
oil extraction from the Santa Clara River Valley floor, the likelihood of significant subsidence
occurring in the study area is considered minimal.
         Hydrocompaction. Areas of hydrocompaction have not been identified within the City of
Santa Paula. Hydrocompaction could potentially occur in areas of unconsolidated soils,
particularly along the Santa Clara River Valley floor. If, during the preparation of a foundation
study, soils susceptible to hydrocompaction are encountered, the condition should be mitigated
prior to development. Mitigation measures should be designed by a civil or geotechnical
engineer.
B. Flood Hazards
Development within the City of Santa Paula is primarily on the Santa Clara River Valley floor
and on slopes less than 10% (Fugro West, Inc., 1994). The watershed is defined by the Topa
Topa Mountains to the north (which include Sulphur Mountain and Santa Paula Peak) and
South Mountain to the south. The Santa Clara River is the major drainage feature through the
City. This watercourse drains from the eastern limit of the planning area, westerly through the
Oxnard Plain and into the Pacific Ocean. Major tributaries of the Santa Clara River within the
planning area include Santa Paula Creek, Adams Barranca, Fagan Barranca, and Timber
Canyon.
         Flood Hazards. Flood hazard areas of the City of Santa Paula are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in destruction of property, loss of life, health and safety hazards,
and disruption of commerce and governmental services. Encroachment onto floodplains, such
as artificial fills and structures, reduces the capacity of the floodplain and increases the height
of flood water upstream of the obstructions. Floodplain management involves the balancing of
economic gain associated with land development within the floodplain against the increased
flood hazard.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) establishes base flood heights for 100-
year and 500-year flood zones. The 100-year flood zone is defined as the area that could be
inundated by the flood which has a one percent probability of occurring in any given year. The
500-year flood is defined as the flood which has a 0.2 percent probability of occurring in any
given year.
Figure S-4 illustrates areas of the City that could be inundated by the 100- and 500-year flood
(FEMA, 1997). The little watersheds, including Santa Paula Creek, are most affected by short,
high-intensity storms, while the larger watersheds, including the Santa Clara River, are affected
by longer, lower-intensity events (City of Santa Paula, 1994).

Figure S-4 Flood Hazards
                         S-13
The largest flood area is caused by Santa Paula Creek. Major development on the east bank of
the creek should not be considered without resolution of the flood problems. Future
development on the west side of Santa Paula Creek is regulated by a City ordinance which
requires that building structures be constructed at elevations above the anticipated flood level.
In 1994, the Corps of Engineers completed a study of Santa Paula Creek. The Corps of
Engineers has since authorized a project that will eliminate 100-year flooding from Santa Paula
Creek. The project will be completed in 1999.
The City of Santa Paula does not have a Master Plan of Storm Drains. According to the City,
problematic areas include: Santa Paula Creek; Fagan Barranca, Adams Barranca; Harvard
Boulevard at Warren Avenue; Twelfth Street above the railroad tracks; and Todd Lane (City of
Santa Paula, 1994). Future land development will affect drainage needs on Todd Lane, in
Adams and Fagan Barrancas, and in Santa Paula Creek.
Flood hazards associated with the Santa Clara River cannot be mitigated through drainage
design. In designating land uses south of SR 126, the flood hazard potential of that area should
be considered.
        Potential Inundation Due to Dam Failure. At least four dams northeast of the Santa
Paula area have the hypothetical potential to result in dam inundation to the City or
surrounding environs: Lake Pyramid Dam, Lake Castaic Dam, Bouquet Canyon Dam, and
Santa Felicia Dam (Lake Piru). General information for each of these dams is summarized in
Table S-2 below. The boundary of potential dam inundation within the planning area is
depicted on Figure S-4.

             Jurisdiction of the State of California.
Failure of any of the above referenced dams during a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake,
is considered possible but unlikely. According to the California Department of Water
Resources, Division of Safety of Dams (Mihyar, 1997), Lake Pyramid Dam, Lake Castaic Dam,
Bouquet Canyon Dam, and Santa Felicia Dam are large structures which should have been
designed to withstand at least a magnitude 6.0 earthquake. However, the exact seismic design
for each dam was not researched.
                                                        S-14
The Saint Francis Dam was located in San Francisquito Canyon, east of both Lake Piru and
Lake Castaic. The catastrophic failure of the Saint Francis Dam in 1928 caused the largest
historic flood on the Santa Clara River to date. The flood waters inundated the City of Santa
Paula north to East Santa Paula Street, by the high school. Some of the dams currently
upstream from Santa Paula are larger than the Saint Francis Dam. If one of the large dams
should fail suddenly, there could be significant damage to property and structure, and loss of
life.
Failure of any of the upstream dams could have significant and/or disastrous inundation
impact on the City of Santa Paula. Probably the best criteria for evaluating dam/reservoir
safety and inundation risk is compliance with State standards. Annual safety inspections are
conducted by the California Division of Safety of Dams. Operational and maintenance
recommendations must be adhered to by the dam owner in order to remain in compliance with
State safety standards. Emergency response actions associated with a dam failure and/or
flooding should be specified in an operations plan developed by the City of Santa Paula.
Although the dams in question have been certified for safety (Mihyar, 1997), the location of
critical and high risk facilities in potential inundation areas may pose an unacceptable risk,
regardless of the likelihood for dam failure.
Dam failure maps prepared pursuant to Government Code Section 8589.5 are available from
the Office of Emergency Services.
C. Fire Hazards
         Fire Prevention and Suppression. Fire prevention and suppression services are
provided by the City of Santa Paula Fire Department (SPFD). The SPFD was organized by local
businessmen in 1903. In 1989 the fire chief became a full time appointed City employee.
Currently there are eight full time employees: fire chief; assistant fire chief/fire prevention
officer; three captains; and three engineers. In addition, there are 27 part time, paid/call
firefighters. The SPFD is responsible for enforcing the following:
            All aspects of the 1994 Uniform Fire Code (or the most current edition of the Uniform Fire
             Code as adopted);
            Any City of Santa Paula ordinances and/or amendments pertaining to fire prevention and
             suppression;
            California Health and Safety Code, Division 12, Part 2.7 (Fire District Law) and Part 5
             (Abatement of Hazardous Weeds and Rubbish); and
            California Health and Safety Code, Sections 25501 through 25510 as they pertain to the
             administration of Hazardous Materials Business Plans.
         Peakload Water Requirements. Peak load water supply standards ensure that
sufficient water flow is available to fight fires. The minimum fire flow required is determined
by the type of building construction, proximity to other structures, fire walls, and fire
protection devices as specified by the 1994 Uniform Fire Code, Appendix III-A and adopted
Amendments. The required water supply for new developments is a fire flow of 1,000 gallons
per minute (gpm) for buildings less than 3,600 square feet, and of between 1,500 gpm and 8,000
                                                   S-15

gpm, and a duration capability of from 2 to 4 hours, for buildings over 3,600 square feet (City of
Santa Paula, 1994). Applicants for new development projects in the City must verify that the
water purveyor can provide the required volume at the project.
According to the Ventura County Department of Water Resources (Panaro, 1997) and the Santa
Paula Department of Public Works (Wilkinson, 1997), the Santa Paula Groundwater Basin has a
storage capacity and safe yield large enough to supply water, during peakload water
requirements, for the current population and new development. However, the Santa Paula
Groundwater Basin was recently adjudicated in 1996 in a near full condition. A seven year
study program is required to monitor the groundwater levels before pumping levels can be
increased or decreased. The current adjudication allows for the pumping of 30,500 acre-feet
from the basin.
The majority of the wells currently used for groundwater supply are located in the Santa Clara
River Valley floor, or on Santa Paula Creek. In addition, the groundwater from these wells is
pumped to water-supply pipelines and reservoir tanks utilizing electrically-operated pumps.
In the event of an emergency, the groundwater supply would not be an issue, but the amount
of water available in reservoir tanks, the condition of the main water lines leading to and from
the reservoir tanks, and the electrical supply available to pump the groundwater to the
reservoir tanks and/or booster pump stations would be critical. Currently, there is a lack of
pipelines to convey groundwater to many sections within the Santa Paula planning area. Only
municipal-supply wells are connected to pipelines to service communities within Santa Paula.
Additional back-up electrical-supply generators, additional pipelines, additional upgradient
water reservoirs and booster pump stations, and installation of additional groundwater wells,
must be considered prior to implementation of new development in the Santa Paula planning
area.
Prior to construction of new developments, applicants must submit plans to the SPFD for the
approval of the location of fire hydrants. The SPFD should be contacted in advance of
submitting these plans to evaluate hydrant locations and required fire flow for the specific
development. If a proposed structure is greater than 5,000 square feet in area, the structure
must be fitted with an automatic fire sprinkler system in accordance with Santa Paula City
Municipal Code Amendments to the 1994 Uniform Fire Code.
        Minimum Road Widths and Clearances Around Structures. Per City of Santa Paula
Municipal Code requirements, Public Improvements Section, roads shall be installed or
improved to the standards specified in the City of Santa Paula Municipal Code and
construction specifications in effect at the time of construction. The improvement shall not
begin until the City Engineer has approved the improvement plans or the proposed
construction. Currently the minimum street width in a residential area is 40 feet from curb to
curb. In hillside areas, the width of the road depends on whether the road is a collector or an
arterial road. The minimum width for a hillside road that is not a collector ranges from 30 to 32
feet from curb to curb.
The SPFD has established some standards pertaining to road widths and clearances for
development projects which include fire access roads and number and type of turnaround
areas and means of ingress and egress. The SPFD standards identified are as follows:
                                                 S-16
             Access roads shall be unobstructed and at a minimum width of 20 feet, with an unobstructed
              vertical clearance of 13 1/2 feet.
             Turnarounds will be at a width calculated to accommodate the turning radius of the largest
              fire engine in the City.
The SPFD should be consulted prior to new development, particularly in hillside areas where
access is critical to retarding and/or eliminating a wildland brush fire.
Wildland Brush Fires. Many homes in the Santa Paula area, predominantly those along SR
150, are located along the urban/wildland interface. Figure S-5 presents the fire hazard areas.
The level of hazard is based largely on the type of ground cover, the slope of the ground, and
the ability of fire crews and engines to access the area. Historical wildfire data and topographic
maps are available through the Ventura County Fire Protection District
(fire.countyofventura.org) and Cal fire (fire.ca.gov)
D. Hazardous Materials and Emergency Preparedness
          Emergency Operations Plan. The City of Santa Paula Police Department oversees
emergency operations within the City. The SPFD follows the Personnel Training and
Emergency Response Plan outlined in the California Code of Regulations Title 26, Divisions 19
and 19.1.
         Evacuation Routes. The SPFD is ultimately responsible for coordinating evacuation
necessitated by an emergency. If delayed during a large disaster, the SPFD Chief is responsible
for coordinating evacuation efforts on an interim basis. Figure S-6 shows the routes and streets
to be used in the event of a disaster requiring evacuation.
          Evacuation Centers. The American Red Cross is the lead agency involved in providing
disaster relief during peacetime disasters. Authority is mandated by Federal Law 36-USC-3
and reaffirmed in Public Law 930288 (Federal Disaster Relief Act of 1974). The Red Cross acts
cooperatively with State and local governments, including the California Office of Emergency
Services and the California Department of Social Services, and private relief organizations to
provide relief services.
Evacuation centers to be used in the event of disaster vary depending on the location and
nature of the disaster. The facilities most likely to be used are the local high schools (Rink,
1997). These facilities are ideal because they are public facilities and can accommodate lodging,
feeding and showering. Other options include junior and elementary schools, churches,
community centers, and even commercial lodging facilities.
          Hazardous Materials Spills. The seriousness of a hazardous material incident is
dependent on a number of factors including the type and quantity of material involved, the
proximity to populated areas, the time of day, weather conditions and physical state of material
(i.e., solid, liquid, vapor or gas). The greater the number of people exposed to the hazardous
material, the greater the potential for significant impact. Because of their dispersion
characteristics, vapors and gases tend to involve greater hazards. Under a worst case scenario,
                                                   S-17

an incident could result in mass fatalities and injuries, destruction of private and public
improvements, and contamination of the environment.
Although a hazardous materials release could occur anywhere within the City of Santa Paula,
certain areas are at greater risk. These include the following:
                                                S-18
Figure S-5 Fire Hazard Zones
                             S-19
Figure S-6 Evacuation Routes
                             S-20
        SR 126 and SR 150 are major transportation corridors through the Santa Paula area. A hazardous
        material spill involving transportation would most likely occur along one of these highways.
             Because of the high number of businesses that use or store hazardous materials on Main
                 Street or Harvard Boulevard, these major arterials and adjacent neighborhoods are probably
                 at greater risk than other arterials within the City.
             One facility with acutely hazardous materials is located on Quail Court, and poses a higher
                 risk than other facilities within the City.
E. Aircraft Hazards
The Santa Paula Airport is located within the south-central portion of the City of Santa Paula,
and is bounded by SR 126 on the north, Palm Avenue on the west, Ojai Street on the east, and
the Santa Clara River on the south (Figure S-7). The airport is a public-use airport which is
privately owned and operated by the Santa Paula Airport Association. The airport
encompasses a total of 38 acres and provides a single asphalt runway (Runway 4/22) which is
2,650 feet long by 40 feet wide2.
The runway is used by piston and propeller, single and twin, engine planes. No commercial
aircraft utilize this airport. The airport operates under visual flight rule (VFR) conditions only,
indicating that approaches to the runway are only made in weather conditions where the cloud
cover is greater than 1,000 feet in height and visibility is greater than 3 miles3. The airport is
currently not licensed to operate at night.
            Safety Zones. The State of California has defined air safety zones in the Airport Land
Use Planning Handbook. Santa Paula Airport has adopted the State of California air safety
zones which include: the Inner Safety Zone; the Outer Safety Zone; and the Traffic Pattern
Zone. A fourth air safety zone, the Extended Runway Centerline Zone, was not applied by the
Ventura County CLUP to the Santa Paula Airport due to the lack of a relationship with
historical aircraft accident data in Ventura County, and the lack of instrument approaches at the
airport.
The Inner Safety Zone is also referred to as the Runway Protection Zone and is that area below
the portion of the approach surface from the end of the primary surface to the point where the
approach surface is 50 feet above the runway end elevation. The Outer Safety Zone underlies a
portion of the approach surface which extends beyond the Inner Safety Zone. The total length
of the Inner and Outer Safety Zones reflect the type of aircraft currently using, or projected to
use, the airport as follows:
           Single engine general aviation aircraft: 2,000 feet
           Twin engine general aviation aircraft: 3,500 feet
The Traffic Pattern Zone is the area beneath the outer edge of the aircraft flight paths. Air Safety
and Height Restriction Zones for the Santa Paula Airport are shown on Figure S-7.

   (a) = Maximum structural coverage must be no more than 25 percent. “Structural coverage” is defined as the
         percent of building footprint area to total land area, including streets and greenbelts.
   (b) = The placing of structures or buildings in the Inner Safety Zone is unacceptable. Above ground utility lines
         and parking are allowed only if approved by the FAA as not constituting a hazard to air navigation.
   (c) = Maximum structural coverage must not exceed 50 percent. “Structural coverage” is defined as the percent
         of building footprint area to total land area, including streets and greenbelts. Where development is
         proposed immediately adjacent to the airport property, it is suggested that structures be located as far as
         practical from the runway.
   (d) = Clubhouse is unacceptable in this zone.
According to the Ventura County CLUP, the Santa Paula General Plan land use designations
are consistent with the recommended air safety criteria at the Airport, with the exception of
light manufacturing land uses proposed in the Inner Safety Zones at both ends of the runway.
The Ventura County CLUP recommends that the planned light manufacturing land uses in the
                                                             S-23

Inner Safety Zones at both ends of the runway be changed to agricultural or other conforming
land uses. In addition, proposed legislation, which would allow funding by the State for
purchase of the property in the Inner Safety Zone, should be passed and the property acquired
by the City of Santa Paula or other designated public entity.
F. Police Protection
        History of Law Enforcement in Santa Paula. Prior to 1923, law enforcement was
provided in Santa Paula by a Constable who was appointed, and later a Town Marshal who
was elected. In 1923, the Santa Paula Police Department was formed and the first Police Chief,
Lee Sheppard, took office. By 1964, the department had 24 sworn officers and 5 civilian
employees. A police reserve unit was authorized in 1961 to augment the strength of the regular
police department. The reserve officers allowed the department to field two-officer units on
some shifts (City of Santa Paula, 1993).
        Crime Rate versus Police Department Capabilities. From 1988 to 1992, the rate of
serious crime in Santa Paula increased by 43 percent. The department also experienced a 49
percent increase in the number of emergency calls for service in the same period. However, the
number of sworn police officers, reserve officers, and full-time civilian staff for the police
department either did not change during this five year period, or was slightly reduced (City of
Santa Paula, 1993).
According to the Santa Paula Police Department (Adair, 1997), overall crime rates in Santa
Paula decreased in 1995 compared to previous years, and the Part One (homicide, rape,
robbery, assault, burglary, theft, auto theft, and arson) crime rates in 1996 decreased by 1.8
percent compared to 1995. In addition, the number of Reserve Officers has been increased to
20, the number of full-time civilian staff has been increased to nine, a Citizens Patrol Unit
comprised of 25 volunteer members has been formed, and the department now has six full-time
dispatchers. The Citizens Patrol Unit performs various duties including evening patrols and
reporting (they do not perform any police action, only reporting of possible crimes), traffic
control during major events such as parades, and disaster aid. The current number of full-time
and part-time civilians and sworn law enforcement officers employed is:
           Sworn Officers             29

           Full-Time Civilian         9
           Part-Time Civilian         11
        Economic Base and Housing Density. The economic base and housing density within
the City of Santa Paula largely affects the crime rate and the City’s ability to pay for police
services. According to the Santa Paula Police Department (City of Santa Paula, 1993), Santa
Paula pays less than average for their police department when compared with other cities that
have their own department. In Ventura County, Santa Paula has the second highest crime rate
(60.2 crimes per 1,000 residents) but a lower than average number of employees and officers per
1,000 residents.
Much of the housing in Santa Paula was built before Proposition 13, and tends to be lower-
middle income and subsidized housing. High density housing uses more City services,
                                                 S-24

particularly police services, than low density housing. The infilling of vacant properties within
the City has created a number of low to moderate income dwelling units in the City. The
majority of the population within Santa Paula has a low income level, a high unemployment
rate, and a low educational level (City of Santa Paula, 1993). These demographic facts have
resulted in a City with a high crime rate, relative to other cities within Ventura County, and an
economic base unable to support sufficient police services to respond to the crime issues.
G. Other Public Safety Hazards
         Oil Wells and Oil Sumps. Oil production was one of the founding industries of Santa
Paula. Originally an oil “tunnel” was completed in 1866 on Sulphur Mountain, north of the
Santa Paula planning area. The tunnel was 80 feet long, and oil flowed by gravity to the
tunnel’s entrance. Tunnels were dug later that were as long as 1,600 feet and produced up to 60
barrels of oil a day. Oil seeps are still active in the South Mountain area (Norris and Webb,
1990) and many have been documented by the State of California Division of Oil and Gas
(CDOG) in their Publication No. TR26, “Onshore Oil & Gas Seeps in California”, dated 1987.
Four active oil fields exist within the City of Santa Paula planning area: the Saticoy Field; the
Santa Paula Field; the South Mountain Field; and the West Mountain Field. Union Oil has
numerous active, inactive, and abandoned oil wells, as well as oil collecting and staging
facilities, in the Santa Paula, South Mountain and West Mountain Field areas. The South
Mountain and West Mountain Fields lie south of the Santa Clara River in the South Mountains.
The Santa Paula Field lies in the Sulphur Mountain area, west of SR 150 and south of Ojai, in
the northern portion of the planning area. Sage-California and/or Whiting Petroleum
Corporation, has numerous active, inactive, and abandoned oil wells in the Saticoy Field. The
Saticoy Field lies essentially south of SR 126, extending from approximately Todd Lane to the
eastern boundary of the City of San Buenaventura. The location of the oil fields, the active,
inactive and abandoned oil wells, and oil facilities are shown on the State of California Division
of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources Maps for Saticoy (Map No. 205), Santa Paula (Map No.
203), and West Mountain and South Mountain (Map No. 206).
The State Fire Marshal are responsible for pipeline safety in the City of Santa Paula. Mr.
Charles L. MacDonald, Pipeline Safety Engineer for the State of California, Office of the State
Fire Marshall, provided the approximate locations of all crude oil and natural gas pipelines and
oil and gas facilities which traverse the City of Santa Paula planning area. The pipelines are
shown on Figure S-8.
         Radon. The California Department of Health Services participated in the United States
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) State Radon Survey in 1990. Out of the 2,858 homes
surveyed, the results for 1,885 homes were utilized for the survey. The EPA recommended
action level for radon is 4 pico curies per liter of air (pCi/l). For Santa Barbara and Ventura
Counties, referred to as Region 8 in the EPA survey, the results indicated that the arithmetic
mean for homes surveyed was 1.3 pCi/l, the median was 0.9 pCi/l, and the 90th percentile was
2.8 pCi/l. The results also indicated that 5.2 percent of the homes surveyed
                                                   S-25

Figure S-8 Oil and Natural Gas Pipelines
                                         S-26
in Region 8 had radon levels exceeding 4 pCi/L per liter (California Department of Health
Services, 1990).
Recent radon mapping performed by Churchill (1997) indicates that in general, Santa Paula is
within an area noted as having low potential for indoor radon exposure (less than 4 pCi/L per
liter). However, the mountainous areas both north and south of the City exhibit a high radon
exposure potential. South Mountain is classified as having a high potential for indoor
exposures greater than 4 pCi/L per liter. The mountains north of the City exhibit a moderate
potential for such exposure. The uppermost portion of Adams Canyon is within the moderate
exposure zone. Fagan canyon is just outside this area, within the low exposure zone.
According to the survey and the EPA, “no survey will be able to predict what the radon
exposure level measurement in an individual house might be. This is because radon
concentration, in homes and buildings, has been found to depend on many factors, including
which floor of the building the measurement was taken, the specific types of construction and
building materials used in the design and construction of the building, and whether windows
and doors in the building were opened or closed during the testing period. For these reasons,
the only way to determine the amount of radon present in a particular home or building is to
test that home or building for radon using a radon detector.” For a list of companies selling
radon detectors and information on radon, contact the State of California Department of Health
Services at (800) 745-7236.
        Critical Facilities. Critical facilities are generally defined as those structures whose
ongoing performance during an emergency is required or whose failure could threaten many
lives. Type of structures vary but may include hospitals, urgent care, and private ambulance
companies; fire stations; police and emergency services facilities; schools; utility facilities; and
communication facilities. A map of select critical facilities in the Santa Paula planning area is
included as Figure S-9.
Based on information provided in previous sections of this report, there are a number of
potential hazards that could affect existing critical structures in the City of Santa Paula. These
include flood and dam inundation, seismic and geohazards and fire hazards. The following
provides a summary of existing critical facilities located in potentially hazardous areas. No
specific reference is made to geologic hazards because all of the facilities may be affected by
such hazards - especially ground shaking caused by a large regional earthquake. Measures that
can be taken to reduce these hazards are addressed in previous sections of this document.
Hospitals and Emergency Care Facilities. The City of Santa Paula is served by one hospital,
Santa Paula Memorial Hospital, a 60 bed facility, and one urgent care facility, Rural Health
Care, an extension of Santa Paula Memorial Hospital. Santa Paula Memorial Hospital and
Rural Health Care are located just outside of the dam inundation hazard area. In the event of a
dam failure, major access roads to this hospital (10th Street/Ojai Road, East Santa Paula Street,
East Main Street, and Harvard Boulevard) could be impacted. In addition, the hospital is
located in an area of potentially high landslide, debris and mud flow, rock fall, and soil
settlement hazards.
Schools. Existing schools are potentially susceptible to a number of hazards including:
                                                   S-27

           Thelma Bedell School, Webster School, McKevett School, Grace Thille School, Isbell School,
            and Glen City School are located within or adjacent to the 100-year flood zone. It should be
            noted that with the completion of the Army Corps of Engineers flood control project in Santa
            Paula Creek, much of the City would be removed from the 100-year floodplain.
           All of the schools except Mupu School are located within the dam inundation hazard area
            that would be caused by a failure of Lake Castaic Dam, Lake Pyramid Dam or Santa Felicia
            Dam.
           Thelma Bedell School and Mupu School are located in areas of high fire hazard.
           Thelma Bedell School and Mupu School are located in areas of high landslide potential.
           All of the schools except Thelma Bedell and Mupu Schools are located in areas of high
            liquefaction potential in the event of an earthquake.
           Thelma Bedell School, Webster School, McKevett School, Grace Thille School, Mupu School,
            and Santa Clara School are all located in areas of high soil settlement potential.
The State of California has the responsibility for ensuring that public school buildings are
adequately constructed to meet seismic design standards established in the Garrison Act of
1969.
Fire Stations and Police Station. Santa Paula has two fire stations and one police station. The
location of these facilities is shown on Figure S-9. Some of these facilities are potentially
susceptible to various hazards including:
           As discussed in the technical report in the appendix of this document, Fire Station 1 was
            constructed in 1935, was seismically upgraded in 1987, and is currently being remodeled.
           Fire Station No. 1 is located within the 100-year flood zone, and Fire Station No. 2 is located
            adjacent to the 100-year flood zone.
           Fire Stations No. 1 and 2 are located within the boundary of dam inundation should a dam
            failure occur on Lake Castaic Dam, Lake Pyramid Dam, or Santa Felicia Dam.
           Fire Stations Nos. 1 and 2 are located in an area of high liquefaction potential in the event of
            an earthquake.
           Fire Station No. 1 is located in an area of high soil settlement potential.
Other Facilities. Various other critical facilities are potentially susceptible to hazards including
the following:
           City Hall is located within the 100-year flood zone, and a City Yard and the Wastewater
            Treatment Plant are located adjacent to the 100-year flood zone.
           City Hall, a City Yard, and the Wastewater Treatment Plant are all located within the
            boundaries of dam inundation, within an area of high liquefaction potential in the event of
            an earthquake, and within an area of high soil settlement potential.

Figure S-9 Critical Facilities
                               S-29
         Lifeline Facilities. Lifeline facilities are utility corridors and associated facilities that
may be damaged by catastrophic events such as earthquakes. These include: major gas lines,
major power lines, crude oil pipelines, major water lines, and water tanks. Figure S-8 shows the
oil and gas pipelines in the Santa Paula planning area. Figure S-10 shows other lifeline
facilities, such as water lines (City of Santa Paula), electrical lines (Southern California Edison),
and gas lines (Southern California Gas) in the Santa Paula planning area.
Buried Southern California Edison (SCE) electrical transmission lines may be susceptible to
liquefaction in the event of a ground failure triggered by an earthquake. Many of the
transmission lines are located in areas of older unconsolidated alluvium and may be susceptible
to liquefaction and other soil-related hazards. However, most, if not all, of SCE’s transmission
lines are overhead lines, not buried lines within the City of Santa Paula.
All of the Southern California Gas main distribution lines, except the one that is beneath Santa
Barbara Street, are within the 100-year floodplain area. All of the main distribution lines are
within the boundaries of dam inundation, and are in an area of high liquefaction potential in
the event of an earthquake. Damage to these lines during an earthquake could result in an
interruption of service or, in a worst case scenario, fires or explosions. Leaks would be
expected to occur mostly at piping connections and valves.
In general, the crude oil pipelines which lie in the Sulphur Mountain, Santa Paula Peak, South
Mountain, and West Mountain areas are located in high potential landslide, and debris and
mud flow zones. Those crude oil pipelines which lie beneath the Santa Clara River Valley floor
are located in a high potential liquefaction zone in the event of an earthquake, a high soil
settlement zone, and within the 100-year flood and dam inundation zones.
Water supply lines south of East Santa Paula Street are potentially susceptible to liquefaction.
Water Supply lines along SR 150 southward to the Santa Clara River, and within approximately
4,000 feet to the north and south of the Santa Clara River, are potentially susceptible to a 100-
year flood. All water supply lines located along SR 150 are also in areas of high landslide,
debris and mud flow, and fire hazards.

Policies
1.a.a. The City shall require, prior to approval of a project located in a seismic hazard zone, a
       geotechnical report defining and delineating any seismic hazard. If the City finds that
       no undue hazard of this kind exists, based on information resulting from studies
       conducted on sites in the immediate vicinity of the project and of similar soil
       composition to the project site, the geotechnical report may be waived. After the report
       has been approved or a waiver granted, subsequent geotechnical reports shall not be
       required, provided that new geological datum, or data, warranting further investigation
       is not recorded. The City shall submit one copy of each approved geotechnical report,
       including mitigation measures, if any, that are to be taken, to the State Geologist with 30
       days of its approval of the report. (State of California, Public Resources Code Section
       2697). (IM 2, 26)

       development, development intensity/density standards, and subdivision design
       policies for sites subject to seismically-induced landslides or liquefaction, or potential
       fault rupture areas for identified active and potentially active faults. (IM 12-26)
1.i.i. The City should encourage the seismic upgrade of unreinforced masonry buildings as
       required by the State of California, Uniform Code for Building Conservation, Appendix
       Chapter One. The City should strive to accomplish a seismic design standard for a peak
       acceleration based on the most current study available for upgrade of reinforced
       masonry buildings, but the ultimate design requirement for individual structures shall
       be evaluated on a case by case basis by a licensed structural engineer with final
       approval by the City’s building official. (IM 12-13)
1.j.j. If evidence of faulting is observed during any subsurface geologic or geotechnical
       investigation at a site, a special fault investigation shall be initiated following the
       guidelines in the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act. (IM 12, 13, 26a)

2.g.g. The civil engineer and project engineering geologist/geotechnical engineer should
       coordinate efforts during construction grading at a project site. (IM 5-10, 26i)
2.h.h. Hazards caused by project grading which may affect adjacent properties, such as
       erosion and slope instability, shall be mitigated before final approval of the project is
       given by the City. (IM 5-10, 26j)
                                                S-35
2.i.i. Areas identified to be in high expansive soil, or zones of soil settlement, and confirmed
       through site geotechnical investigations, shall have foundations designed by a structural
       engineer to withstand the existing conditions, or the site shall be graded under the
       supervision of a civil engineer. (IM 5-10, 26m)
2.j.j. Project sites located at the base of, or near the base of, hillside areas should be evaluated
       for potential exposure to landslides, mud or debris flows, or rock falls. (IM 26h)
2.k.k. If soil subsidence is observed in a portion of the Santa Clara River Valley within the
       Santa Paula planning area, the Santa Paula Department of Public Works should initiate
       an investigation to evaluate the cause for the subsidence, and to develop a program to
       halt or retard the subsidence.

       announced.
Policies
3.a.a. Develop standards and restrictions within identified floodplains or areas subject to
       inundation by a 100-year flood. These might include subdivision design, setback
       requirements, and development intensity/density standards. (IM 27, 27a, 27b)
3.b.b. Develop policies, standards, and requirements which reduce the risk of flood hazards
       relative to evacuation routes and minimum road widths. (IM 27, 28)
3.c.c. Develop policies to complete flood improvements on Santa Paula Creek, Adams
       Canyon, and Fagan Canyon prior to issuance of any new building permits, or in
       conjunction with new development design. (IM 27-32)

       the City limits and for the Todd Lane drainage which is under the County’s jurisdiction.
       (IM 32a)
3.i.i. The City should develop a long-range plan for improvements such as a Capital
       Improvements Plan. The plan should identify improvements, funding needs, and
       funding sources over a 7 year period for capital improvement projects, such as storm
       drain system upgrades, required to accommodate new development. (IM 32b)
3.j.j. Require new development in Fagan Canyon, East Area 1, and East Area 2 to be
       designed such than peak water discharge into the Santa Clara River does not exceed
       existing conditions. (IM 32c)

                            V. TECHNICAL APPENDICES
EXISTING CONDITIONS AND ISSUES
        Regional Stratigraphy. The stratigraphic and lithologic features of the major rock
sequences within the Santa Paula planning area (Norris and Webb, 1990 and Dibblee, 1990 and
1992) are described by age group as follows:
        Middle to Late Eocene, Matilija Sandstone (Tma, Tmaw, Tmasl, Tmash). Predominantly
north-dipping (including overturned beds) sequence of resistant marine, thick-bedded, tan
arkosic sandstone with thin partings of gray micaceous shale, and hard white sandstone and
thin shale interbeds in the Santa Paula Peak area. This bedrock crops out in the northeast
portion of the planning area.
        Late Eocene, Cozy Dell Shale (Tcd, Tcdss). Predominantly north-dipping, marine, dark
gray shale and light gray to tan arkosic sandstone. Outcrops exist at the northern tip of the
planning area, adjacent to Santa Paula Creek.
        Late Eocene, Coldwater Sandstone (Tcw, Tcwsh). Predominantly north-dipping and
overturned beds of marine hard and tan sandstone, and greenish-gray and fossiliferous
siltstone and shale. This bedrock crops out in the northern portion of the planning area,
adjacent to Santa Paula Creek.
        Oligocene, Sespe Formation (Tsp). Non-marine sandstone and conglomerate with
outcrops restricted to south of the City of Santa Paula and the Santa Clara River.
        Middle Miocene, Conejo Volcanics (Tcva). Volcanic rocks consisting of andesitic basalt.
These rocks crop out in a thin strip near the peak of South Mountain, in the southern portion of
the planning area.
        Middle Miocene, Topanga Formation (Tts). Southern-dipping, marine, semi-friable
sandstone that is time equivalent to the Conejo Volcanics. Crops out in a small area in the
southwestern portion of the planning area.
        Middle and Late Miocene, Monterey Formation (Tm). Described previously as the
Modelo Formation (Weber, 1984), this unit is described as marine, biogenic, thinly-bedded to
finely-laminated siliceous shales. This unit crops out in the northwestern portion of the
planning area adjacent to Santa Paula Creek, and in the southwest portion of the planning area
adjacent to Santa Clara River.
        Pliocene and Pleistocene, Pico Formation (QTpm, Tp). Predominantly southern-
dipping, marine, soft claystone or mudstone with some lenses or interbeds of semi-friable
sandstone. A thick, coherent white tuff bed exists in the South Mountain area. This unit crops
out over most of the planning area north of Santa Clara River, and in the southwest portion of
the planning area adjacent to the river valley.
                                                S-A1
        Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene, Las Posas Sand (QTlp, QTlc). Southern-dipping,
marine strata consisting of friable sandstone and sandy siltstone with some lenses of pebble-
cobble conglomerate. This unit crops out in a thin zone adjacent to the west of Santa Paula
Creek, in the northern section of the planning area.
        Pleistocene, Saugus Formation (Qts). Southern-dipping, nonmarine, weakly-
consolidated alluvial cobble-boulder conglomerate. This unit crops out along the northern
border of the Santa Clara River Valley, in the central portion of the planning area.
        Older Surficial Sediments (Qoa, Qog, Qof) . Dissected remnants of weakly-consolidated
alluvial gravel, sand and silt. These sediments crop out primarily between Santa Paula Creek
and Timber Canyon, north of the City of Santa Paula.
        Surficial Sediments (Qg, Qf, Qa). Unconsolidated and generally undissected stream
channel and alluvial deposits. These deposits lie within the boundaries of Santa Paula Creek,
Timber Canyon, and in the Santa Clara River Valley floor.
        Regional Seismicity and Earthquake History. Earthquakes occur along active faults.
One of the tools used in the evaluation of seismic risk is the historical earthquake record. These
records list when an earthquake occurred, its epicenter and depth below ground surface, and
strength (Modified Mercalli Intensity or Magnitude). Seismic records in southern California
date back about 200 years -- to the time of Spanish colonization. Earthquake recurrence along
an individual fault can be on the order of thousands of years, so the historical record alone is
not sufficient to fully determine the seismic risk that an area may experience. Despite these
limitations, a review of historical seismicity has value in evaluating the seismicity that an area
may undergo. The accuracy of the database increases with time; events before about 1940 are
based on colloquial data and are not instrumentally recorded. These events, therefore, may not
accurately locate the recorded event.
        Historical Seismicity of the Santa Paula Area. The lower Santa Clara Valley has not
had a large, damaging earthquake in 200 years of record keeping. According to the State of
California, Department of Conservation, Earthquake Epicenter Map of California (1978), no
earthquake epicenters, for earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.0 or greater, have been located
within the City of Santa Paula planning area between 1900 through 1974. In addition, no large
earthquakes are known to have occurred in the western Transverse Ranges during the
historical record of the past 200 years (CDMG, 1996).
Several historical earthquakes with epicenters outside of the Santa Paula area have affected the
Santa Clara Valley and the County of Ventura. An earthquake which occurred offshore,
possibly on a continuation of the Oak Ridge Fault, in December 21, 1812 created tsunami-like
waves along the Ventura coastline (Yeats, 1988). The great Fort Tejon earthquake of January 9,
1857, with its epicenter on the San Andreas Fault close to the northeast corner of Ventura
County, caused significant damage in the southern portion of the County and cracks in the
river bed six miles from the mouth of the Santa Clara River (City of Santa Paula, 1974). Two
earthquake “shocks” occurred on June 6, 1925 and June 30, 1941, of magnitudes 6.3 and 5.9,
respectively, which caused some damage in Ventura. The February 9, 1971 San Fernando
(magnitude 6.5) earthquake caused severe damage to older buildings in Santa Susana, and
                                                S-A2

small displacement along the Santa Susana Fault (the eastern extension of the Oak Ridge and
possibly San Cayetano Fault zones).
The 1994 Northridge (magnitude 6.7) earthquake resulted in a maximum displacement of 3.5
meters along a south-dipping blind thrust fault. As stated above, the Northridge blind thrust
fault is thought to be a continuation of the Oak Ridge Fault. The Oak Ridge Fault also
continues offshore. More than 400 earthquakes between magnitude 0.5 to 4.0 occurred on this
offshore segment of the Oak Ridge Fault in April of 1984 (CDMG, 1995).
         Probable Future Seismicity for the Santa Paula Area. The slip rate on the Oak Ridge
Fault at South Mountain is estimated at 4.9  1.0 millimeters per year (mm/yr) since the late
Pliocene/early Pleistocene time. A slip rate of 4.5  1.5 mm/yr was determined for the San
Cayetano Fault based on stratigraphic evidence from the oldest alluvial fans at Timber Canyon,
fluvial terrace deposits, and alluvial fan surfaces at Sisar Creek, Bear Canyon, and Mud Creek
(CDMG, 1995). Yeats (1988) assumed that the slip rates calculated for the San Cayetano Fault
are in the same general range as those for the Oak Ridge Fault, and that average recurrence
intervals for earthquakes on these faults are in the same range. However, the CDMG
determined in their study of the 1994 Northridge earthquake (CDMG, 1995) that the slip rate on
the San Cayetano Fault was greater than 10 mm/yr, and the slip rate on the Oak Ridge Fault
was between 1 and greater than 5 mm/yr. The average recurrence interval documented for the
Oak Ridge Fault (250 to 500 years), and surmised for the San Cayetano Fault, suggests that a
damaging earthquake may strike the lower Santa Clara Valley in the near future (Yeats, 1988).
SEISMIC HAZARDS
         Seismic Setting. The regular occurrence of earthquakes in the southern California area
serves as ongoing evidence that the area is seismically active. Although nothing can be done to
prevent the occurrence of earthquakes, through proper construction design and planning, their
destructive effects can be reduced. Within the last several decades, there has been a recognition
that structures should not be built over active fault traces. Ongoing earthquake research has
resulted in improved construction standards for buildings, roadways, and other structures.
Another approach to increasing awareness of seismic hazards has been the State requirement
that local governments address seismic safety issues in their General Plans Government Code
Section 65302(g). This Safety Element meets the requirement to consider the goals, programs,
and policies that are to be followed to reduce the danger of earthquakes.
Earthquake hazards are manifested in many ways, including ground rupture, ground shaking,
landslides, tsunamis, liquefaction, and seiches. Secondary hazards that can be caused by
earthquakes include flooding due to dam failure, urban fires, and toxic chemical releases.
         Previous Work. A Seismic Hazard Analysis of Santa Paula was performed by Earth
Technology Corporation of Long Beach, California, in February of 1985. Earth Technology
Corporation concluded that the recurrence interval for the Western Transverse Ranges province
(which includes the City of Santa Paula) for peak ground accelerations of 0.10 g, 0.14 g, 0.19 g,
0.24 g, and 0.28 g, was 50 years, 100 years, 200 years, 400 years, and 600 years, respectively. The
recurrence intervals for peak ground accelerations expected to be generated from an earthquake
along the San Andreas Fault were considered separately in Earth Technology’s report. The
                                                S-A3

recurrence interval along the San Andreas Fault, based on surface geomorphology, ranges from
140 to 300 years. The median peak ground acceleration in the City, based on a magnitude 8.25
event on the San Andreas Fault at a distance of 53 kilometers from the City, was calculated to
be 0.15 g. Earth Technology recommended that a seismic design criteria of 0.2 g should be
utilized in the analysis and redesign of unreinforced masonry buildings in the City.
        Seismically-Induced Ground Shaking. Earthquake-generated ground shaking is the
greatest cause of widespread damage in an earthquake. The California Seismic Safety
Commission (1993, 1994) estimates that ground shaking causes 99% of the earthquake damage
to residences and other structures in California. Local conditions can greatly influence the
intensity of ground shaking. Types of soil, depth to bedrock, depth to groundwater, and
orientation of the fault movement all influence the intensity of ground shaking.
Ground shaking is the shock wave produced when there is a sudden movement created by an
earthquake rupture. As the shock wave travels away from the hypocenter (the point of
rupture), energy is lost and the intensity of the wave diminishes. In general, ground shaking
diminishes as the distance from the earthquake epicenter increases. This attenuation
relationship has been studied by numerous scientists, resulting in several attenuation models.
Distance from the hypocenter also affects the form of the ground shaking. For sites near
(within about 10 miles) the hypocenter, one may feel a sharp, high-frequency shock wave. This
type of shock wave tends to affect short (one to two story) structures. At greater distances, the
high-frequency shock wave is attenuated and one feels a rolling motion. This rolling motion
tends to affect higher structures (multi-story structures, towers, large tanks).
A common scale used to measure the magnitude of an earthquake is the Richter scale. Richter
magnitude is a logarithmic measurement of the maximum motion of the earthquake event as
recorded on a seismograph. Richter magnitude is defined as the logarithm of the maximum
amplitude on a seismogram written by an instrument of a specified standard type calculated to
be at a distance of 62 miles (100 km) from the epicenter. By definition, Richter magnitude is
fixed to an event and does not vary with distance. Seismically-induced ground shaking can
also be measured quantitatively as ground surface acceleration (acceleration with respect to the
force of gravity-[g]), and qualitatively by the modified Mercalli scale (see Table S-A1). Because
of the attenuation of ground shaking with distance, modified Mercalli intensities (MMIs) vary
depending on distance from the earthquake, soil type, resonance of the underlying sediments,
and other site specific phenomena.
Ground shaking caused by the magnitude 6.7 Northridge Earthquake of January 17, 1994
resulted in the single most costly natural disaster in U.S. History. Over 33 fatalities and 7,000
injuries were attributed to the earthquake. Damages were widespread and included six
sections of collapsed highway structures, thousands of damaged or destroyed residential and
commercial structures, widespread disruption of utilities and other lifeline facilities, and
numerous landslides and soil embankment failures. In all, over 14,000 structures in 28 cities
were damaged by the earthquake. In the City of Santa Paula, located about 35 miles from the
epicenter, 22 buildings were damaged, but none were severely damaged (Earthquake
Engineering Research Center, 1994).

As stated previously, ground shaking attenuates with distance, thus, active faults near the City
of Santa Paula have the potential to produce the greatest ground accelerations. The 1994
Northridge earthquake resulted in accelerations (through bedrock and soil) of up to about 0.5 g
near the epicenter and accelerations were extrapolated to be less than 0.2 g near the City of
Santa Paula (Earthquake Engineering Research Center, 1994).
Proper design of new structures and strengthening of existing structures can reduce or prevent
damage associated with ground shaking. Conformance with the Building Code in the building
of new structures helps reduce the likelihood of damage. In residences, most of the damage
caused by groundshaking is the result of:
                                                      S-A5
            Unbraced water heaters,
            Houses not adequately anchored to their foundations, and
            Houses that have weak cripple walls, or are on pier-and-post foundation.
Much of the life-threatening earthquake damage to commercial property is caused by:
            Walls that are poorly anchored to the roof or floors,
            Unreinforced masonry walls,
            Poorly reinforced concrete walls or columns.
The majority of buildings in the City of Santa Paula area were constructed in the 1920s, 1950s
and 1960s. A large portion of the downtown area is considered “historic”. These historic
buildings, and many of the other residential and commercial structures within the City, were
constructed prior to the implementation of building codes. Many of the historic masonry
buildings are unreinforced.
The California Seismic Safety Commission (1993, 1994) has published guidebooks that assist
property owners with identifying structural weaknesses and provide recommendations for
mitigating these problems. These guidebooks can be ordered directly through the Seismic
Safety Commission (Sacramento) and are entitled:

         Fault Rupture. Ground rupture occurs when displacement along a fault reaches the
ground surface. Ground rupture capable of causing several inches or greater displacement
could have a catastrophic effect on the integrity of a structure. Thus, setbacks from active fault
traces are incorporated into determining areas that are suitable to develop. A difficulty in
determining the fault rupture hazard is predicting where future ground rupture will occur.
Fault displacement often is within a fault zone and not necessarily along exact traces of
previous breaks. Also, movement typically is along more than one fault break.
One way in which geologists classify faults is on their movement history. As defined by the
California State Mining and Geology Board (Hart, 1994), faults that have had surface
displacement within the last 11,000 years (Holocene age) are considered active faults. Faults
are considered potentially active if they show evidence of surface displacement during
Quaternary time (within the last 1.6 million years).
California’s Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (Public Resources Code Section 2621
et. seq.) regulates the development and construction of structures in the state. The act assures
that public buildings, and all other structures for human occupancy, are not built on active
faults. This act is designed to reduce earthquake hazards to life and property. Active and
potentially active faults are to be considered during construction within the state. Cities and
counties affected by the zones must regulate certain development within the zones. For
proposed development within one of the fault zones, a geologic study must be performed to
demonstrate that the sites are not threatened by ground rupture from future faulting.

When designing a structure, it is important to consider the likely earthquake that a fault can
produce. A maximum probable earthquake is the largest earthquake that is expected to be
produced within a 100-200 year time frame. Because the life of most structures is on the order
of this range, maximum probable earthquakes are commonly used as design criteria for a
structure. A maximum credible earthquake is the largest event that can be produced by a
particular fault, regardless of time span. For critical structures, such as dams, emergency
operation centers, fire stations, nuclear power plants, and other similar buildings, the
maximum credible earthquake is often used as the seismic design criteria.
The following is a brief description of the faults which may affect the Santa Paula planning
area.
         San Cayetano Fault. The San Cayetano Fault is an east-west trending active fault that
traverses the Sulphur Mountain ranges in the north end of the Santa Paula planning area and
extends eastward to the San Fernando Valley. The San Cayetano is a north-dipping reverse
fault on the north side of the Ventura Basin. A slip rate of approximately 4.5 mm/yr has been
adopted for the San Cayetano Fault based on displacement of fluvial terrace deposits and
alluvial fan surfaces at Sisar Creek, Bear Canyon, and Timber Canyon. There has been no
surface faulting event on this fault in at least the past 200 years (SCEC, 1995).
The San Cayetano Fault is modeled as having the potential to produce a MCE of magnitude 6.8
(CDMG, 1996). Such an event could produce ground shaking accelerations ranging from 0.26 g
to 0.63 g and a MMI of IX-X in the Santa Paula area.
         Santa Susana Fault. The Santa Susana Fault is an east-west trending active fault with
dip-slip and strike-slip components. About 2,000 meters of vertical offset (the north side up)
and 3,200 meters of left-lateral strike slip have been observed along the fault (Yerkes and Lee,
1981). In some places the fault cuts late Pleistocene fan deposits, and surface rupture occurred
along the northeast portion of the fault during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.
The Santa Susana Fault is modeled as having the potential to produce a MCE of magnitude 6.6
CDMG, 1996). Such an event could produce a ground shaking acceleration of 0.26 g and a MMI
of IX-X in the Santa Paula area.
         Blind Thrust Faults. Low-angle thrust faults, known as blind thrust faults, have
recently been recognized as a seismic risk in southern California. Blind thrust faults are low
angle features that do not reach the ground surface but do have surface expressions in the form
of overlying folds that grow during large earthquakes. The seismic hazard from blind thrust
faults has been demonstrated by the Northridge (1994) and the Whittier Narrows (1987)
earthquakes. The magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake was produced by a south dipping
blind thrust fault extending northward from beneath the San Fernando Valley to the Santa
Susana Mountains (Jackson, et. al., 1995). The blind thrust fault which caused the Northridge
earthquake is believed to be an eastward extension of the Oak Ridge Fault Zone which lies in
the southern portion of the Santa Paula planning area. The magnitude of an earthquake that a
blind thrust can produce is dependent on the fault’s area and characteristic displacement.
Earthquakes ranging in size from magnitude 6.4 to magnitude 7.5 can be expected on
individual blind thrust segments.
                                                  S-A7

The Northridge Blind Thrust Fault is modeled as having the potential to produce a MCE of
magnitude 6.9 (CDMG, 1996). Such an event could produce a ground shaking acceleration of
0.085 g and a MMI of VIII-IX in the Santa Paula area.
         Ventura Fault. The Ventura Fault is an east-west trending active fault which extends
from the east end of the City of Ventura near the Santa Clara River, into the Santa Barbara
Channel to the west. The Ventura Fault is a north-dipping reverse fault which appears to cut
Holocene strata (Yerkes and Lee, 1981).
The Ventura Fault is modeled as having the potential to produce a MCE of magnitude 6.8
(CDMG, 1996). Such an event could produce ground shaking accelerations ranging from 0.25 g
to 0.38 g and a MMI of X-XI in the Santa Paula area.
         San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault is mapped by Jennings (1994) as a
northwest-southeast trending active fault with a length of over 600 miles. This fault is a right-
lateral strike-slip fault which forms the plate tectonic boundary between the Pacific plate to the
west and the North American plate to the east. The San Andreas Fault has an estimated slip
rate of 16-38 mm per year and a recurrence interval of 132 years for large earthquakes (Peterson
and Wesnousky, 1994). Numerous earthquakes have been recorded along the San Andreas
Fault. Of the faults discussed here, the San Andreas Fault has the highest possibility of future
rupture. Because this fault is located about 70 miles east of Santa Paula, ground shaking from a
San Andreas Fault event would be somewhat attenuated by the time it reached the City.
The San Andreas Fault is rated as being able to produce a MCE of magnitude 7.8. Such an
earthquake could produce a peak ground acceleration of 0.18 g, or a MMI between X-XI in the
Santa Paula planning area. Because of the distance between the City and the fault, the nature of
ground shaking is expected to be a long period rolling movement.
         Oak Ridge Fault. The Oak Ridge Fault is an east-west trending potentially active fault
that traverses much of the Santa Clara River Valley, extending from the Santa Paula area to the
San Fernando Valley. This fault is a steeply south-dipping reverse fault that has an onshore
length of about 25 miles (SCEC, 1995). As described by Yeats and Huftile (1995), the 1994
Northridge earthquake may have occurred on a continuation of the Oak Ridge fault system.
Because slip rates along the Oak Ridge fault (5 millimeters per year) are nearly three times
greater than the Northridge blind thrust fault (the actual fault responsible for the Northridge
earthquake), they speculate that there is a potential for a Northridge-size earthquake in the
Ventura Basin area. The recurrence interval of this fault is estimated at 250 to 500 years (Yeats,
1988). The Oak Ridge Fault is located in the southern portion of the Santa Paula planning area.
The Oak Ridge Fault is modeled as having the potential to produce a MCE of magnitude 6.9
(CDMG, 1996). Such an event could produce ground shaking accelerations ranging from 0.26 g
to 0.64 g and a MMI of X-XI in the Santa Paula area. The nature of the ground shaking would
be a sharp, high-frequency wave if the earthquake occurs near Santa Paula, or a longer period,
rolling wave if the rupture takes place away from the City.

GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
         Liquefaction. Liquefaction is a phenomenon that occurs when loosely consolidated
soils lose their load bearing capabilities during shaking and flow in a fluid-like manner.
Liquefaction typically occurs in water-saturated, loosely compacted, fine- to medium-grained
sand where the groundwater table is within about 40 feet below grade. When these materials
are shaken, such as during an earthquake, pore pressure of the sediments increases, causing the
sediment to behave as a liquid. Where the liquefied layer occurs near the ground surface,
structures built on such a layer could sink into the ground. Other effects of liquefaction include
lateral spread, flow failures, ground oscillations, and loss of bearing strength (Tinsley et. al.,
1985). Because liquefaction occurs in sediments, areas of bedrock are not considered
liquefiable.
Because of a tendency for young sediments to be poorly consolidated, recently deposited
material, such as river and flood plain deposits, are more susceptible to liquefaction than other
types of sedimentary deposits. The distribution of sediment grain size also influence the
susceptibility of liquefaction. Silty sand deposits have the greatest potential for liquefaction.
Gravelly sand or deposits containing less than 15 percent clay are less likely to liquefy, and
bouldery and cobbly gravels or deposits containing more than 15 percent clay are not known to
liquefy (Tinsley et. al., 1985).
Depth to groundwater influences the susceptibility for liquefaction. Where groundwater is
within 10 feet from ground surface, the susceptibility is very high. For groundwater between
10 and 40 feet, the susceptibility is high. For groundwater at 40 to 50 feet below grade, the
susceptibility is low, and for groundwater deeper than 50 feet, the susceptibility is very low.
The magnitude and duration of ground shaking also has an influence on the susceptibility of
liquefaction. The larger the magnitude of an earthquake, the greater the distance at which
liquefaction is observed. Similarly, the longer the duration of shaking, the greater the distance
at which liquefaction is observed.
The Seismic Hazard Mapping Act was established in 1990 by the CDMG, following the
devastating 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The purpose of the Seismic Hazard Mapping Act is
to encourage land-use management policies and regulations that will reduce and mitigate
earthquake hazards, and assist cities and counties in preparing their general plans. The Act
calls for the delineation of seismic hazard zones that identify areas of high potential for ground
failures such as amplified ground shaking and liquefaction. The purpose of the seismic hazard
zones is to show local officials where geotechnical investigations should be required prior to
the issuance of a construction permit. The liquefaction zone criteria, based on the Seismic
Hazard Mapping Act, is shown in Table S-A2 (CDMG, 1995).

Lateral spread is the movement of blocks of ground as a result of liquefaction in a subsurface
layer. During liquefaction of a subsurface layer of sediment into a fluid mass, gravity can cause
the mass to flow down slope. Examples of this include movement into a cut slope such as a
river channel, irrigation channel, or a storm drain. Lateral spread typically occurs on gentle
slopes ranging from 0.3o to 3o. Ground movement of several feet to tens of feet are possible.
Lateral spread is particularly destructive for pipelines, utilities, bridge piers, and other
structures having shallow foundations.
Ground oscillation may take place where liquefaction occurs at depth and where the ground
slope is too gentle for lateral spreading. When deeper zones liquefy, overlying sediments that
are not liquefied can decouple and differentially move. Manifestations of ground oscillation
include a ground wave, ground settlement, and opening and closing of fissures.
Flow failure occurs when blocks of ground are decoupled from underlying sediment and move
downslope. Flow failures occur on slopes greater than 3o. These blocks can be quite large, from
tens of feet to several miles in length and width. Underwater flow failures can also generate
tsunamis. Flow failures constitute the greatest hazard produced by liquefaction.
Loss of bearing strength can occur under a structure when the underlying soil liquefies. Large
movement in the soil column is possible, allowing for structures to settle, tip, or float upwards.
The City of Santa Paula lies within the Santa Clara River Valley, and extends northward up
Santa Paula Creek. The surficial sediments beneath the Santa Clara River Valley and Santa
Paula Creek are recent valley and floodplain deposits consisting of silt, sand, and gravel. The
Santa Paula planning area extends northward into the Sulphur Mountain and Santa Paula Peak
areas, and southward into South Mountain, which are underlain by bedrock. The areas
underlain by bedrock are not susceptible to liquefaction. However, the area of the City
underlain by unconsolidated alluvial sediments within the Santa Clara River Valley may be
susceptible to liquefaction.
According to the United Water Conservation District (Dal Pozzo, 1997), the depth to
groundwater in two locations within the boundaries of the City of Santa Paula, and in the Santa
Clara River Valley, is less than 40 feet below ground surface (bgs). The depth to groundwater
in the two wells monitored by the United Water Conservation District, Well #-03N21W16H08S
and Well #03N21W15G05S, was last measured on January 23, 1997 as 31.59 feet bgs and 23.87
feet bgs, respectively. According to the City of Santa Paula Department of Public Works
(Wilkinson, 1997), groundwater levels in the Santa Clara River Valley within the planning area
are generally less than 40 feet below ground surface. Based on the depth to groundwater
beneath the Santa Clara River Valley within the planning area, and on the Seismic Hazard
                                                     S-A11
Mapping Act criteria, the entire alluvial basin may be susceptible to liquefaction. In areas
where the subsurface sediments have a high clay content (greater than 15%) or are very coarse
grained (containing cobbles or boulders), the susceptibility to liquefaction would be decreased.
         Slope Stability Hazards (Landslides, Mud and Debris Flows, and Rock Falls).
Landslides, debris and mud flows, and rock falls all occur within the planning area. All are
manifestations of gravity driven flows of earth materials due to slope instability. Hill slopes
naturally have a tendency to fail. Unless engineered properly, development in hillside areas
tends to increase the potential for slope failures. Slope modification by grading, changes in the
infiltration of surface water, and undercutting slopes can create unstable hill slopes, resulting in
landslides or debris flows.
Much of the City of Santa Paula is comprised of topographically pronounced areas. These hill
slopes and mountains predominantly consist of sedimentary rock outcrops that are locally
covered with soil. Slope instability is of greatest concern in these topographically pronounced
areas. The majority of landslide and slope wash problems in the Santa Paula area occur in
geologic terraces involving folded sequences of claystone, siltstone, and sandstone. Within the
planning area, the majority of the mapped landslides (Dibblee, 1990 and 1992) occur in the Pico
and Sespe Formations, and the Topanga Sandstone. Landslides and potentially unstable slopes
are especially common in hillside areas underlain by sedimentary bedrock of the Pico
Formation. This formation is generally soft and crumbly and contains abundant clay and silt
strata (City of Santa Paula, 1974).
Landslides. Naturally-occurring landslides are associated with steep slopes which have been
undercut by erosion or on slopes where the bedding planes of the bedrock are inclined down
the slope. The presence of subsurface water also contributes to slope instability. Ground
shaking, due to an earthquake, can trigger movement in terrain already prone to landslides.
Several landslides in the area are depicted on geologic quadrangle maps for Santa Paula and
Santa Paula Peak (Dibblee, 1990 and 1992). The largest landslides mapped in the planning area
are prominent along the major fault zones: San Cayetano and Oak Ridge Faults. According to
the CDMG (Open File Report No. 95-07, 1995), the largest, most extensive, landslides in the
planning area are ancient composite rotational failures along anti-dip slopes on the north side
of South Mountain and Oak Ridge. On the north slope of South Mountain, large composite
landslides have occurred in interbedded sandstone and claystone of the Sespe and Vaqueros
Formations, below a ridge top formed by a volcanic andesite sill and silicified sandstone.
Smaller dip slope landslides/earth flows are present in the south-dipping Pico siltstone and
coarser-grained Saugus Formation in the hillsides north of the City.
The Seismic Hazard Mapping Act discussed above also calls for the delineation of seismic
hazard zones that identify areas of high potential for ground failures such as earthquake-
induced landslides. The landslide hazard zone criteria, based on the Seismic Hazard Mapping
Act criteria, is shown in Table S-A3 (CDMG, 1995).

 *The Strength Category is based on the lithology, past performance, and structural features of geologic units
 identified on source maps.
The Seismic Hazard Maps for the Santa Paula or the Santa Paula Peak Quadrangles have not
yet been published by the CDMG as of the date of this report, but should be acquired by the
City of Santa Paula upon publication and incorporated by reference, herein. A breakdown of
the hillside areas, within a portion of the Santa Paula planning area, into landslide
susceptibility categories can be found in the CDMG Open File Report No. 95-07 (1995).
          Debris and Mud Flows. Debris and mud flows often occur after periods of
precipitation. Water soaked soil and rock are destabilized by the weight of the water. Often
compounding the added weight is erosion of the base of a hill slope. Once this slope becomes
destabilized, the water, soil, and mud mass is driven downhill by gravity. Numerous mud and
debris flows occurred during the very heavy rains of January 1969, especially north of the Santa
Clara River Valley, between Santa Paula and Piru Creeks (Weber, 1973). Inhabited building
structures at the bases of slopes are especially prone to destruction due to mud flows.
Debris flows most frequently occur during intense rainstorms of the wet season, on steep slopes
underlain by poorly indurated sand and silty units of granular soils, and on moderate slopes
where loose debris has accumulated in swales and gullies. Debris flows are abundant on steep
slopes underlain by the Pico Formation in the planning area (CDMG, 1995). Most of the hillside
terrain within the planning area has been identified by the CDMG as being the most susceptible
to debris flows because:
         The evidence of previous debris flows is common;
         Source hollows and swales were observed;
         The slopes are steeply inclined; and
         The appropriate source material is widespread.
In general, the areas most susceptible to debris and mud flows correspond to the areas with a
high potential for earthquake-induced landslides.
          Rock Falls. Rock falls occur in virtually all types of rocks and especially on slopes
steeper than 400. Areas of primary risk from rock falls are those located at the base of steep,
high slopes where rock outcrops (usually Saugus Formation, Conejo Volcanics, or Sespe
Formation) are susceptible to dislodgment of large cobbles or boulders. These conditions are
locally present along the northern and southern margins of the Santa Clara River Valley within
                                                       S-A13

the planning area. Rock falls are usually triggered by seismically-induced ground shaking or
by erosional destabilization of a hill slope.
SOIL HAZARDS
        Expansive Soils. Expansive soils are those that are characterized as having a high
shrink-swell potential (Edwards, et. al., 1970). The shrink-swell potential of a soil refers to the
change in volume resulting from a change in moisture content. Soils with high shrink-swell
potential generally have a high clay content and shrink when dry and swell when wet.
Expansive soils can cause considerable damage to building foundations, roads, and other
structures. Soils with low shrink-swell potential are generally suitable for building sites if
other geologic factors are also favorable.
Soils with a high clay content, and a moderate to high shrink-swell potential, can be derived
from weathering and erosion of many different rock types. The chemical breakdown of certain
minerals through the weathering process can produce a clay soil in an area underlain with
bedrock. In the planning area zones of soil with a high shrink-swell potential, as described in
the Soil Survey of Ventura County (Edwards, et. al., 1970), generally correspond with mapped
outcrops of claystone, siltstone, and shale as mapped by Dibblee (1990 and 1992).
        Settlement. Settlement is the downward movement of a soil or of the structure which it
supports, resulting from a reduction in the voids in the underlying strata. Settlement can result
from natural consequences such as accumulation of sediments (addition of weight) over porous
alluvial soils within a river valley. Settlement can also result from human activities which
include: improperly placed artificial fill, and structures built on two different soil and/or
bedrock materials with different settlement rates. In addition, settlement can result from
seismic ground shaking and/or liquefaction in naturally-occurring soils. Liquefaction is
discussed in its own section in this report.
Inadequately emplaced fill material, if not compacted properly, can subside when a structure is
built on the fill. It is important that fills be engineered so that the density and moisture of the
material can be controlled. Controlling the density, moisture, and compaction of the fill
material will reduce the possibility that the material will settle after development on the fill.
Structures which are constructed partially on a cut pad (into bedrock) and partially on a fill
pad may result in settlement problems and should be addressed during engineering design.
Settlement hazards can occur in areas with permeable alluvial deposits, where fill is improperly
placed, and in areas where construction occurs across a cut/fill boundary. Areas of poorly
consolidated sediments should be engineered to support the weight of a structure that is to be
built on the site. In areas of fill, the fill should be compacted to adequately support the
proposed development, and structures should not be placed partially on cut and partially on fill
unless specifically designed by civil and structural engineers.
        Subsidence. Subsidence is the decrease in volume of a material as the result of an
increase in the density of a material. It is generally related to the withdrawal of fluids such as
water, oil, and gas from the subsurface. When fluids are removed from the subsurface, the
overburden weight, which the water had previously helped support through buoyant forces, is
transferred to the soil structure. Subsidence typically occurs over a long period of time and
                                                    S-A14
results in a number of structural impacts. Facilities most impacted by subsidence are long,
surface infrastructure facilities such as canals, sewers and pipelines.
The extraction of groundwater from an aquifer beneath an alluvial valley can result in
subsidence, or settlement, of the alluvial soils. The factors which influence the potential
occurrence and severity of alluvial soil settlement due to groundwater withdrawal include:
degrees of groundwater confinement; thickness of aquifer systems; individual and total
thickness of fine-grained beds; compressibility of the fine-grained layers; probable future depth
of wells; and probable future decline in groundwater levels (City of Santa Paula, 1974).
According to the Ventura County Department of Water Resources (Panaro, 1997), groundwater
is withdrawn from the Santa Paula Groundwater Basin from an unconfined aquifer within
Quaternary alluvial sediments and the San Pedro Formation. The Santa Paula Groundwater
Basin services approximately 13,504 acres, and the groundwater is utilized for irrigation,
municipal and domestic supply. The aquifer within the Santa Paula Groundwater Basin is
approximately 2,000 feet thick based on oil well logs, can potentially hold up to 4,915,000 acre-
feet of water, and currently has an agreed upon initial allocation yield of 30,500 acre-feet
(Brommenschenkel, 1997). The water demand for the City of Santa Paula, and its general
service area, for 1990 was 6,500 acre-feet. Based on the conservative safe yield made by Dr.
Mann in 1959, Santa Paula has a water supply large enough to support its current population
and future development.
Oil extraction sometimes also results in overlying soil settlement or differential subsidence.
The Santa Paula area has not had significant subsidence problems despite historical oil drilling
in the area. According to the State of California Division of Oil and Gas (Fields, 1997), State
regulations require subsidence studies in coastal areas where sea water intrusion due to oil
extraction is an issue. Subsidence studies are generally not performed in inland areas.
        Hydrocompaction. Hydrocompaction occurs in relatively loose, open textured soils
above the groundwater table. Once water is introduced, whether by heavy irrigation or a rise
in the water table, the soil loses strength and consolidates under its own weight.
Hydroconsolidation typically occurs in desert environments and has been noted in some semi-
arid regions of southern California.
FLOOD HAZARDS
        Historic Flooding. Table S-A4 provides a listing of major flood events that have
occurred in Ventura County over the previous 25 years.
Heavy water flows occurred on Santa Paula Creek in 1938, 1943, 1969, 1973, 1978 and 1980. The
1938 and 1943 floods caused Congress to authorize a flood protection project on Santa Paula
Creek in 1948. Work on the flood protection project began in 1974, but was halted due to a
court order stating that an insufficient environmental study was performed. The Corps of
Engineers began work on the flood protection project again in 1994 (City of Santa Paula, 1994).

The 1969 and 1978 floods presented major threats to the City, as rock and debris completely
filled in the channel of Santa Paula Creek. Five inches of rain fell on the City of Santa Paula
within six hours in 1980. Fagan Barranca escaped its banks and flooded about 80 homes and
covered 11 miles of street with mud (City of Santa Paula, 1994).
         Flood Control and Prevention. Flood hazards may be alleviated through a variety of
measures, some corrective and some preventive. Corrective measures include warning and
relief programs, flood-proofing of existing structures, and the construction of flood control
works. Preventive measures include public acquisition of flood plain lands, public information
programs, development policies and regulations.
Flood control prevention is the responsibility of the Ventura County Flood Control District.
The Flood Control District has the authority to maintain and construct flood control facilities on
all major channels, including Santa Clara River, Santa Paula Creek, Adams Barranca, Fagan
Barranca, Todd Lane, and Peck Road. The network of tributary storm drain trunks and laterals
that collect and convey surface water from the urban areas to the major channels is the
responsibility of the City of Santa Paula Public Works Department (City of Santa Paula, 1994).
On the Federal level, the regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is
administered by the Federal Insurance Administration (a component of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency), require that communities adopt land use restrictions for the 100-year
flood plain in order to qualify for Federally-subsidized flood insurance. The program requires
that residential structures be elevated above the level of the 100-year flood and that other types
of structures be floodproofed. The NFIP was established by Congress with the passage of the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The NFIP was broadened and modified with the passage
of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and other legislative measures.
To provide for early flood warning, the Ventura County Flood Control District has been
operating an automated flood warning system since 1979. The system is known as “ALERT”
(Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time) and was developed by the National Weather
Service in Sacramento, California. The system is comprised of self reporting rain gages and
stream gages that collect data and transmit signals to a flood warning center computer system
located in the County Government Center Administration Building in Ventura. Operators of
the system compare rainfall forecasts with the runoff forecasts from the hydrologic models and
notify proper authorities in threatened areas to initiate evacuation warnings as appropriate. In
the Santa Paula area, self reporting stations are located at Santa Paula Creek near Steckel Park
                                                     S-A16

(stream level and precipitation) and at Fagan Canyon near Main Street (stream level and
precipitation) (Kane, 1997).
        Potential Inundation Due to Dam Failure. The State of California has been responsible
for supervising dams since August 14, 1929 for the purpose of safeguarding life and protecting
property (California Department of Resources, 1995). The legislation was enacted following the
failure of St. Francis Dam in March 1928. St. Francis Dam was located in San Francisquito
Creek, a tributary to the Santa Clara River, located east of the City of Santa Paula and north of
the City of Santa Clarita. In 1965, legislation was revised to include off stream storage
reservoirs as a result of the failure of Baldwin Hills Reservoir in December of 1963. In March
1973, Senate Bill 896 was adopted by the State of California amending the Government Code.
This law required dam owners, under the direction of the Office of Emergency Services, to
show the possible inundation below their dam in the event of a failure.
FIRE HAZARDS
        Causes and Origins of Wildland Brush Fires. The vegetation found within the City of
Santa Paula boundaries include agricultural and riparian vegetation. In the hillside areas of the
Santa Paula planning area, vegetation includes riparian, grassland, chaparral, oak woodland,
and coastal sage shrub. The hillside vegetation, primarily the chaparral and coastal sage shrub,
provides a major source of fire fuel. These vegetative associations contain many species of
plants considered pyrophytic, plants which need the heat of the fire to germinate their seeds for
reproduction. When these vegetation systems are burned over by a brush fire, the existing
ground cover is destroyed, but in many cases the plant association survives and is actually
improved by this means of natural selection.
The climate of the region is one of the critical factors influencing the occurrence and severity of
brush fires. The hot dry summers leave the area hillsides susceptible to a major fire. During
the early fall, periods of “Santa Ana” winds occur, caused by a local weather phenomenon of a
low pressure system developing off the coast while a high pressure system settles over the
inland desert areas. The result is the hot dry winds which pour over the mountain areas into
the Santa Clara River Valley aggravating the potential fire threat in the high brush areas
already dried out by the summer heat. Nearly 90 percent of the large Southern California fires
documented over the last 73 years have occurred between September and December, during the
Santa Ana season (Crosby, 1992).
Brush fires are often caused by man, either intentionally or unintentionally. Continued
urbanization of the flat lands within the valleys has put increasing pressure on the
development of hazardous brush covered hillsides. The longer a brush area goes without
burning, the older dry, dead materials and the new plant growth constitute potentially a more
volatile fuel source. These fuel sources are usually then ignited by man, either directly through
arson or careless action, or indirectly through accidents such as sparks from engine exhaust,
falling power lines, etc. Natural causes are now relatively minor causes of brush fires. Man is
the primary agent in this natural cycle of fire.
        Santa Paula Fire Department Response. The SPFD responded to 1,456 incidents in the
City of Santa Paula in 1996. Emergency medical aid responses were 978, comprising 67% of the
total incidents. Fire services consisted of that specified in Table S-A5.

Some cities within Ventura County have chosen to contract with the Ventura County Fire
Protection District for fire protection services. The Ventura County Fire Department’s Battalion
51 has two fire stations located in the Santa Paula area:
       Summit Fire Station, 12727 Santa Paula-Ojai Road, Santa Paula, California 93060; and
       Saticoy Fire Station, 12391 West Telegraph Road, Santa Paula, California 93060.
The SPFD has a number of mutual aid agreements with other fire departments and services
agencies within Ventura County. If the resources of these departments/agencies are depleted,
assistance can also be obtained through various state agencies including Office of Emergency
Services, the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the State Fire Marshall, and the
Department of Fish and Game; and various Federal agencies including the U.S. Forest Service,
the National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management, and the Department of Defense.
Urban fire hazard abatement is discussed in this section and Wildland fire hazard abatement is
discussed in the following section.
        Existing Fire Stations. The SPFD currently operates two fire stations. The SPFD
maintains a 5-minute response goal for any incident within the City. Table S-A6 provides a
summary of the local fire station’s capabilities (personnel and equipment).
The Santa Paula Fire Department is a combination full time/part time department providing
fire suppression and emergency medical services as well as fire prevention and business
hazardous materials regulation functions within the City. There are eight full time personnel,
consisting of a Fire Chief, Assistant Chief, three Captains and three Engineers, and 27 part time

   * Three each full time, work on a 24-hour rotating shift system
paid/call personnel, consisting of four Captains, four Engineers, and 19 firefighters. There are
two volunteer Chaplains. Administration and Prevention offices are at the Community
Development Building. Routine fire, medical and other calls are handled by the on-duty engine
company, which consists of a Captain and an Engineer on a rotating 24-hour shift system. They
are supplemented by the Chief and Assistant Chief during weekday business hours and during
the evenings and weekends by a third crew member scheduled from among the part time
personnel. All available part time personnel are dispatched to emergencies that require more
than the duty engine company. According to the Fire Chief, the average number of part time,
paid/call personnel responding to typical daytime fire emergencies in 1993 was between 14 to
20.
In 1995 six full-time firefighting positions were created and Fire Station 1 is now staffed 24-
hours a day with one Captain, one Engineer, and (in the evenings, weekends and holidays) a
part-time firefighter. This alleviated most of the problems related to part time, paid/call
personnel response time to fire emergencies. It has also been suggested by the SPFD that
another fire station be opened on Ojai Road above Mill Park to take advantage of the closer
availability of firefighters who live in that area. In addition, funding and staffing a one 3- or 4-
man engine company on a 24-hour basis using a combination of full time and part time
personnel at Station 2 has been recommended (Skeels, 1997), particularly in the event of
annexation and development of the Adams Canyon area. It may also be appropriate to locate
and staff a fire station within Adams Canyon.
Station 1, referenced in Table S-A6, was constructed prior to the enactment of strict seismic
structural codes and is of masonry construction. However, according to the SPFD (Skeels,
1997), the engine room of Station 1 was seismically upgraded in 1987, and has recently been
remodeled to include upgraded office space and living quarters for firefighters. Fire stations
are considered critical facilities that must be functional in the event of an earthquake or other
disaster to minimize loss of life and property damage.
         Historic Brush Fires. Table S-A7 provides a summary of brush fires which have
occurred in the Santa Paula planning area since 1936. The 1985 Ferndale fire, and the 1993
                                                        S-A19
Steckel fire, burned through all of Adams Canyon. Large uncontrolled fires occur on a regular
basis in the South Mountain area (City of Santa Paula, 1994).
         Effects of Brush Fires. The principal effects of brush fires include loss of vegetative
ground cover, increased erosion, loss of building structures, loss of utilities, and loss of life.
Loss of the vegetative ground cover results in damage to valuable recreational and open space
area. Many of the plant and animal associations in the natural communities have adapted
themselves to a fire-climax cycle, and will naturally generate themselves through fire. Hence,
they themselves may not be permanently impacted.
Loss of vegetative cover results in secondary erosional impacts, especially in steeply sloped
hillside areas. When a slope is burned over by a fire of intense heat, a chemical reaction in the
soil takes place which makes it less porous. As the rains of winter come, rain water runs off
and causes mudslides and mudflows. Properties not affected directly by the fire may be
damaged or destroyed by the effects of increased runoff due to brush fire.

The loss of man-made improvements in the brush covered areas constitute most of the dollar
loss from fires. Losses along this line include homes, barns and sheds, utility lines and
facilities. The loss of valuable watershed area combined with the actual suppression costs also
are major determinants of the total dollar costs of any fire. The potential for loss of life is the

most dangerous aspect of brush fires. Occasionally, trapped residents are injured or killed
when there is no warning of the impending disaster, or when they simply refuse to evacuate
their homes in the face of the fire. Unfortunately, the largest loss of life occurs to the
professional fire fighters who are killed while fighting brush fires, which have a highly
unpredictable nature, or in other accidents during the support operations necessary to suppress
the fire. Fortunately, there have been no serious injuries or deaths in the brush fires that have
come into Santa Paula.
As the population of California cities continue to grow, more and more people are encroaching
on what firefighters call the urban/wildland interface, the perimeter of urban areas adjacent to
wildlands. According to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) statistics,
since 1980 more than 5,000 structures have been damaged in wildland fires, triple the amount
of damage that occurred in the previous 15 year period. Some of the more recent devastating
examples of this phenomenon include:
        Santa Barbara: Painted Cave Fire of June 1990 which swept across almost 5,000 acres of
        coastal hillsides, destroying more than 600 houses.
        Oakland/Berkeley: 1991 fire covering over 1,600 acres, decimated entire
        neighborhoods, killing 25 people, destroying 2,900 homes, and leaving more than $1.5
        billion in property damage.
        Malibu to Laguna Beach: a series of fires in the fall of 1993 which killed three people
        and destroyed over 1,000 homes.
        Fire Hazard Reduction. Experienced firefighters believe they can no longer protect
homes and lives as well as they did in the past with fuel loading causing such catastrophic fires
(Gilmer, 1994). It is up to the homeowners living on the urban/wildland interface to establish
defensible space. Defensible space describes a band of managed vegetation around a home
which stops the movement of fire by denying fuel. The Fire Department does not recommend
indiscriminate clearing of native chaparral and other vegetation. Natural vegetation plays an
important role in erosion control. The goal is to obtain a balance between fire hazard reduction
and erosion control. Defensible space also provides a place where fire fighters can do their jobs
without unnecessary risk to themselves. According to the CDF, as many as 80 percent of the
homes lost to wildfires in the past could have been saved if the owners had followed a few
simple fire safe practices. Some of these fire safe practices include the following:
            Use fire resistant landscaping. Fire resistant plants are those with low growth habit
             (generally less than 18 inches in height), low fuel volume, and high moisture content. Such
             plants offer far less fuel than upright woody shrubs.
            Irrigate and maintain landscaping. A fire resistant plant will lose this quality if allowed to
             dry out. Maintenance insures the effectiveness of the fire resistant landscape by retaining
             proper spacing between plants and removing dead/dry vegetation.
            Have a fire-retardant roof. Untreated wood shake roofs provide fuel for an advancing fire.
             Class A roofs provide the most protection. These include: clay tile, concrete tile, fibrous
             cement shake, metal tile, and fiberglass composition shingles.
                                                     S-A21

The County Fire Protection District has developed a Fire Hazard Reduction Program with the
goal of preventing the loss of life and property due to uncontrolled wildfire in the
urban/wildland interface through the cooperation of the property owners of Ventura County
(Ventura County Fire Protection District). The stated objectives of the Fire Hazard Reduction
Program are to:
         1. Reduce significantly the incidence of destructive fires in the urban/wildland interface areas,
             and the resulting loss of life and property.
         2. Provide a defensive perimeter around urbanized areas of the Fire District.
         3. Provide for the protection of structures in the urban/wildland interface by establishing and
             maintaining a 100 foot defensible perimeter around each structure.
         4. Provide for the removal of annual fuels within the defensive perimeter.
         5. Provide any fire suppression resource from any agency the opportunity to successfully
             protect structures and other valuable properties during a wildfire threat.
         6. Protect the watershed fire areas from exposure to structure fires in the urban/wildland
             interface areas.
The Fire Hazard Reduction Program strives to establish defensive barriers in the
urban/wildland interface in preparation for the annual onslaught of wildfire. Hazardous
vegetation is at its peak growth in the spring and fall seasons. An inspection program has been
developed that targets hazard reduction in the spring and fall months. Within the 100 foot
defensible perimeter, all brush, flammable vegetation, or combustible growth identified as a
fire hazard by an inspecting officer is required to be mowed or cut to a stubble height not to
exceed 3 inches. All cuttings are required to be removed from the property. Single specimens
of trees, ornamental shrubbery or ground covers are permissible provided that they do not
form a means of rapidly transmitting fire from the native growth to any structure. Other
specific clearance requirements pertain to roof surfaces, chimneys, propane tanks, access roads,
and vacant parcels and are specified within the Fire Hazard Reduction Program guidelines.
The Santa Paula Fire Department has its own Fire Hazard Reduction Program, and has
required that the weed abatement and vegetation management programs be followed for new
developments in high fire risk areas. However, some questions regarding the effectiveness of
these programs, for new developments in canyons and on hillsides, in minimizing the risk of
loss of life or property from wildland fires still need to be addressed. The Santa Paula Fire
Department should be consulted when new development plans are being considered for
canyon and hillside areas within the Santa Paula planning area.
The best defense against disastrous fires affecting the urban/wildland interface is a working
partnership between developers, property owners, their neighbors, the Ventura County Fire
Department, and the Santa Paula Fire Department. More detailed information pertaining to
defensible space strategies and other fire hazard reduction approaches can be obtained from the
Santa Paula Fire Department.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
More than 60,000 chemicals are produced in the United States. Over 11,000 of these chemicals
are used for commercial purposes. Within the County of Ventura, over 5,000 manufacturing
                                                    S-A22
and service industries use or store hazardous materials, including pesticides, acids, caustics,
solvents, and heavy metals (County of Ventura, 1989). Because of the widespread use of
hazardous materials in our communities, minor and major hazardous materials spills and
incidents occur. Most of these incidents are related to the increasing transport of chemicals
over roadways or through industrial accidents. SR 126 and SR 150 are major transportation
corridors through Santa Paula.
In an effort to reduce impacts associated with a hazardous material incident, Ventura County
has developed a Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan. The goal of the plan is to
protect life, property, and the environment from the effects of a hazardous material release to
air, land or water or a hazardous material fire. Procedures to be used in the event of an
incident and specific agency responsibilities are identified within the plan. The Plan is
activated by the designated Incident Commander at the scene. Depending on the nature of the
incident, this could be either the appropriate law enforcement authority (City of Santa Paula
Police Department, Ventura County Sheriff’s Department or California Highway Patrol) or the
SPFD.
The County Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan is supplemented by individual
Business Plans for businesses/facilities that store or handle hazardous materials and wastes.
Under Chapter 6.95, section 25503 of the California Health and Safety Code, Business Plans are
required from California businesses that handle a hazardous material in quantities equal to or
greater than the following:
            55 gallons of a liquid;
            500 pounds of a solid;
            200 cubic feet of a compressed gas; or
            Extremely hazardous substances above Federal threshold reporting quantities
As part of the Business Plan, emergency response plans and procedures must be developed and
training sessions must be provided to employees. Businesses are periodically inspected by
local administering agencies (Santa Paula Fire Prevention Bureau) to ensure that handling,
storage, and waste disposal practices conform with appropriate laws and regulations.
According to the Santa Paula Fire Department (Araiza, 1997), 100 businesses use or store
hazardous materials in the City of Santa Paula (Table S-A8). These businesses include gasoline
stations, automotive repair facilities, dry cleaners, agricultural facilities, crude oil pipelines and
facilities, and miscellaneous commercial and industrial facilities. Industrial use of hazardous
materials is centered in the downtown Santa Paula area. Many of the commercial businesses
that store or use hazardous materials are located on Main Street or Harvard Boulevard. Specific
information regarding the location of businesses and types and quantities of hazardous
substances used or stored can be obtained through the Santa Paula Fire Department.

Only one facility uses or stores acutely hazardous materials within the City of Santa Paula:
Baker Performance Chemicals located at 265 Quail Court. Extremely hazardous wastes (or
materials) are defined by California HWCL as any hazardous waste or mixture of hazardous
wastes which, if human exposure should occur, may likely result in death, disabling personal
injury or serious injury because of its quantity, concentration, or chemical characteristics.
In addition to traffic related incidents, hazardous materials spills could be caused by ground
shaking associated with a large earthquake or other soil related hazards (landslide, debris flow,
liquefaction, etc.). As discussed in Section IIA, peak horizontal ground accelerations of 0.64 g
and Modified Mercalli Intensities of VIII-IX could cause major structural damage to facilities
using hazardous materials. Hazardous material containers not properly secured could be felled
and/or ruptured. Improperly segregated materials could result in toxic or explosive reactions.
AIRCRAFT HAZARDS
Based upon the Airports Comprehensive Land Use Plan Update for Ventura County (VCTC,
1991), the Ventura County Transportation Commission is also the Airport Land Use
Commission (ALUC) for the County, including Santa Paula Airport. The purpose of the ALUC
is to “formulate a comprehensive plan that will provide for the orderly growth of each public
airport and the area surrounding the airport within the jurisdiction of the commission” (Public
Utilities Code Section 21675). The ALUC comprehensive plan includes protecting public
health, safety, and welfare. The ALUC prepared an updated Airports Comprehensive Land Use
Plan (CLUP) for the four airports in Ventura County, including Santa Paula Airport.
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Division of Aeronautics maintains an
Airport Land Use Planning Handbook that addresses airport land use compatibility issues such
as aircraft accident characteristics and safety compatibility. Caltrans provides suggestions to
the ALUC in forming local policies. The ALUP designated Airport Safety Areas, for Santa
Paula Airport, extending from the runway as a basis for determining land use compatibility.
The Airport currently serves private passenger aircraft.
OIL WELLS AND OIL SUMPS
                                                   S-A24

         Existing Operations. The source for local oil regulations is the City of Santa Paula
Municipal Code No. 5.40, Santa Paula Oil Code. The following is a brief overview of the
procedures required to drill and abandon oil wells.
         Permits. A permit from the County of Ventura must be obtained for drilling a new well
or re-entering a well previously abandoned, prior to commencing said operation within the
planning area.
         Well Spacing. No well shall be located within 1090 feet of any building used for human
occupancy, nor shall any such building be erected within 100 feet of any well not abandoned,
except buildings incidental to the operation of the well. According to the City of Santa Paula
Municipal Code Section 5.40.070, well location shall be in accordance with the requirements of
the state and the zoning ordinance of the City.
         Storage Tanks. Tanks shall be constructed and maintained so as to prevent leakage.
Diversion walls or drains safely directing any escape of fluids to catchment basins, to
impounding basins formed by impervious dikes around tanks or groups of tanks, or
combinations thereof, shall be constructed. The net capacity of a catchment basin or dike
impounding basin, shall be equal to the capacity of the largest tank, plus six inches of
freeboard.
Any new crude petroleum storage facilities, incidental to a producing well, shall not exceed a
storage capacity of 2,000 barrels per well. The minimum distances between aboveground tanks
for storing flammable liquids other than crude petroleum, and for storing crude petroleum, to
the line of adjoining property which may be built upon are specified in the City of Santa Paula
Municipal Code Section 5.40.130.
         Fire Prevention. The Uniform Fire Code and the City of Santa Paula Fire Code applies
to all aspects of oil well operations. This includes, but is not limited to, no smoking within 50
feet of any well, tank, or area where hydrocarbons are present. The City of Santa Paula Fire
Department should be notified when an oil drilling permit has been filed. The code requires
that a minimum of two fire extinguishers be maintained at all oil well locations where drilling,
servicing, or repair work is being conducted.
         Abandonment Procedures. Abandonment of oil wells shall include the following
procedures:
         1. A copy of the Division of Oil and Gas “Notice of Intention to Abandon” furnished by the
             Division of Oil and Gas is mailed to the City;
         2. The well has been abandoned in accordance with the requirements of the Division of Oil and
             Gas;
         3. The site has been cleared of all drilling or producing equipment and left in a clean condition,
             which shall include draining and backfilling of any sump used in connection with the well
             and removal of concrete, pipe and other foreign materials from the surface of the ground, and
             the surface of the land, insofar as practicable, left in a neat and orderly condition; and
         4. The City shall have inspected and certified in writing that such well has been properly
             abandoned in accordance with the provisions of the Santa Paula Municipal Code, Chapter 5,
             Section 5.40.080.
                                                     S-A25

        Hazardous Conditions. In the event that the City of Santa Paula and/or the State
Supervisor of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources determines at any time that any well
heretofore or hereafter drilled, or other operations covered by the ordinances, is endangering
any fresh water body or strata, or that any oil field construction, improvement, or operation
constitutes a safety hazard, or a substantial nuisance to the public, the City of Santa Paula
and/or the State Supervisor of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources shall have the right to
compel the operator to make such modifications as may be required to correct such condition.
Equipment and appurtenances hazardous to life or limb shall either be attended 24 hours a day,
or enclosed, in all inhabited, urban, or common places of public use areas where there is a
reasonable likelihood of potential danger to persons. Perimeter enclosures shall conform to the
fencing requirements satisfactory to the City of Santa Paula. There shall be at least one gate
which is of sufficient width to give access to fire vehicles. The gate shall be locked at all times
when the property is unattended and a key or combination shall be made available to the City
of Santa Paula.
        Sumps. Most oil wells had associated oil sump areas where waste fluids and oil were
deposited. In the past, these oil sumps were buried and not removed. Placement of structures
over these areas could force the oil and waste fluids to the surface and will also contaminate the
soil. As part of the discretionary review process, the City should require a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment for all properties that have the potential to contain an oil sump
as defined as follows:
           All sites that contain an existing or abandoned oil well;
           All sites within the area of known oil drilling operations as shown on the State of California
            Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources Maps.
However, if a clearance letter from the State of California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal
Resources and/or the State Regional Water Quality Control Board is provided, a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment should not be necessary unless further evidence of soil
contamination is discovered.
The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment shall contain, at minimum, a description of the
study area, a past and present land use analysis, and the general field observations of the site to
determine the level of contamination on the site. If the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
indicates a presence of soil contamination or oil sumps, detailed soil testing should be
conducted and a report should be prepared that identifies the extent of the contamination and
the appropriate remediation techniques. The soils report shall be submitted prior to acceptance
of applications as complete applications.
The City should require that all oil sumps or contaminated soil that is discovered be remediated
in accordance with State and County procedures. The State Regional Water Quality Control
Board has the primary responsibility for overseeing the remediation process.
        Previous Operations. Prior to the enactment of the City of Santa Paula Municipal Code
Section 5.40.080 in 1981, oil wells and associated facilities and sumps may not have been
abandoned in accordance with current regulations. Improperly abandoned wells, improperly
                                                   S-A26

abandoned facilities, and improperly abandoned oil sumps all are potential sources of safety
hazards.
CRITICAL FACILITIES
New hospitals are required to undergo stringent design and construction standards in
conformance with the Hospital Act of 1972. This legislation was enacted following the 1971 San
Fernando Earthquake of Southern California in which several hospitals in the vicinity of the
epicenter were seriously damaged and unable to continue functioning during a critical period.
These newer standards are considerably more stringent than standards in place prior to 1972.
LIFELINE FACILITIES
         Electrical. The City of Santa Paula is supplied electrical power by Southern California
Edison. Substations are the most vulnerable component of the electrical power delivery system.
Transformers, switches, circuit breakers, control equipment, and high-voltage porcelain
insulators are especially susceptible to high-frequency ground motions which can be generated
in earthquakes. A substation can be disabled by seismic intensities as low as VII (Toppozada,
1988).
If damaged during an earthquake, sections of the City may be without power. Critical facilities
such as hospitals, the Police Station and Fire Stations can function on backup generators. If
only limited electrical service can be restored following a disaster, these facilities should be
given priority.
Lack of electrical power can also impair designated evacuation centers, communication
facilities, and water distribution systems. Evacuation centers that will most likely be used
during a disaster and emergency communication facilities should be equipped with backup
power systems. Much of the water supplied to the City of Santa Paula and to fire hydrants is
pumped electrically from groundwater wells. A backup power source for groundwater pumps,
or gravity-fed water distribution systems, should be incorporated into City-wide, fire
suppression emergency programs.
         Natural Gas and Oil. Natural gas is supplied to the City by Southern California Gas
Company through major distribution lines (6” to 12”). Numerous crude oil pipelines traverse
the Santa Paula planning area and within the City limits. The pipelines in the northern
planning area are operated by Unocal, those within the City limits are operated by Unocal,
Shell, Texaco, and Four Corners Pipe Line Company, and those in the southern portion of the
planning area are operated by Unocal, Shell, and Texaco. Crude oil pipelines are typically
buried within the upper 5 feet and are equipped with emergency shut off valves. These
pipelines could potentially be damaged in an earthquake, resulting in disruption of service and
contamination of surface waterways, soil, and underlying groundwater.
         Water. The City of Santa Paula supplies water to the City through the pumping of
groundwater from the Santa Paula Groundwater Basin. The groundwater is pumped
electrically to water tanks and fed by gravity to the City for municipal supply. There are also
private groundwater wells utilized for agriculture and domestic supply.
                                                S-A27

Water distribution lines could be damaged in an earthquake as a result of liquefaction. Breaks
in water distribution pipelines could result in disruption of service, loss of pressure, and
localized flooding and associated impacts (erosion, sinkholes, etc.). A lack of adequate water
pressure could result in inadequate flow for fire suppression. In addition, if electrical service
was terminated due to an earthquake, the electrically-operated pumps in the groundwater
wells would not operate. The issue of an electrical outage is discussed in the electricity section
above. Additional information pertaining to fire suppression is provided in the technical
background in the appendix of this document.
