    L       Introduction and Overview
    L.l     ROHNERT PARK: A CAPSUTE HISTORY
   Rohnert Park was founded as a master-planned community on the former site of the Rohnert Seed
   Farm, located along the Northwestern Pacific railroad right-of-way. The original 1954 master
   plan was based on the "neighborhood unit" concept of clustering single-family homes around
   local schools and parks. The master plan featured eight neighborhoods, each \¡/ith 200 to 250
   homes, a l0-acre school, and a five-acre park.
  In 1956, the Rohnert Park Community Services District was founded, and work began on digging
  wells, building a sewage plant, and installing water lines, sewer lines, and streets. By 1957, the
  first homes had been constructed. At the same time, the segment of US 101 from Petaluma north
  past Cotati was completed, making Rohnert Park more easily accessible from points throughout
  the region. Also, the California Legislature approved funds for Sonoma State University (SSU),
  which was located within Rohnert Park until moving to its current site in 1966, iîitiattng the
  City's long relationship with the University.
 In   1962, at the time of incorporation, Rohnert Park had a population of 2,77 5 , and the City limits
 encompassed 1,325 acres (approximately 2.1 square miles). The city grew quickly as the Bay
 Area economy continued to grow, and the demand for housing exploded. By 1980, urban uses
 extended from US 101 in the west to Snyder Lane in the east.
 The 1980s saw growth extend west of US 101; "G" section, east of Snyder Lane, was built in this
 period. Growth in the 1990s was slower because of limited availability of vacant land within the
 City limits. In 1999, the city had a population of about 41,000 and an area of nearly 4,400 acres
 (6.9 square miles), with nearly half the land dedicated to residential uses. Figure 1.1-1 shows the
 evolution of Rohnert Park from 1965 to 1999.
In conjunction with residential growth, Rohnert Park also attracted commercial and industrial
development and acquired a sizeable job base of almost 22,000 employees by 1999. Commercial
and industrial uses are concentrated west of the railroad tracks and north of Copeland Creek.
Major employers include Hewlett-Packard, located within an industrial campus in the southeast
corner of the city, State Farm Insurance, and SSU. The Double Tree Hotel, Rohnert Park
Municipal Golf Course, and the Sonoma County Wineries Association make Rohnert Park a
popular hospitality center.
Rohnert Park's limited Sphere of Influence (SOI) includes the Wilfred-Dowdell Specific Plan
area (24 acres in size; plans for which were developed in 1999) and Canon Manor, where fi.lrther
development is hindered by the need for public facility improvements and the ongoing debate
about how to fund the improvements. SSU is located outside the City's SOL

 Rohnert Park General Plan
 L.2       PURPOSE OF THE GENERAL PIAN
 The Rohnert Park General Plan is a document required by State law and adopted by the City
 Council that addresses issues related to physical development, growth, and conservation of City
 resources. It:
      a    Outlines a visio¡r uf lung-range physical aud ecorornic development and resourcc
          conservation that reilects the aspirations of the community;
      a   Provides strategies and specifîc implementing actions that    will allow this vision to be
          accomplished;
      a   Establishes a basis for judging whether specifrc development proposals and public
          projects are in harmony with Plan policies and standards;
      a   Allows Citv departments, other public ogencies, and pnvate developers to design projects
          that will enhance the character of the community, preserve and enhance critical
          en..'iron¡lenta! resources, and mininiz.- hzzards: atd
          Provides the basis for establishing and setting priorities for detailed plans and
          implementing programs, such as the Zoning Ordinance, specific plans, and the Capital
          Improvement Program.
WHY HAS THIS PIAN BEEN PREPARED?
General plans typically look out 20 years in the future and are revised every five to 10 years.
Rohnert Park adopted a General Plan in 1990. This plan was updated in 1995, but with a horizon
of 2000. In 1996, Rohnert Park voters approved Measure N, which confirmed the existing City
limits, along with a Z4-acre area (Wilfred-Dowdell Specific Plan area), as the boundary for urban
growth for a four-year period, slated to expire in July 2000.
As of mid-1999, the cify is almost entirely built out. Only about 190 acres of commercial and
industrial land within the City Limits are vacant and available; more than half of the available
non-residential land is part of the existing Hewlett-Packard development. There are no remaining
residential sites.
Thus, this General Plan has been prepared to
     o   Respond to the need of having policies to guide Rohnert Park's growth before urban
         boundary provisions of Measure N expire.
     a   Ensure that the General Plan reflects Rohnert Park's current planning context, and
         includes goals, policies, and desires ofRohnert Park citizens; and
     a   Address the issue of land availability to meet the City's economic development
         objectives, the need for housing in the community, and State law requirements for
         Rohnert Park to accept its "fair share" ofthe regional housing needs.

 The Committee met on a frequent basis and considered input from randomly chosen focus
 groups, open public workshops, and other methods of outreach. A community workshop was hcld
 in January 1999 to solicit ideas for the General Plan and was attended by 110 people. A wide
 variety of viewpoints werc expressed by a mix of palticipants fi'om all segments of the
 community. A second workshop held in February 1999, and attended by 120 people, provided an
 opportunity to gather input on three altemative land use scenarios and served as the basis for the
 preferred plan. Subsequent workshops helped refine the preferred plan and the proposed Urban
 Grorvth Boundary.

                                                                 Chapter 7: Introduction and Overview
   1.3       GENERAL PtAN REQUIREMENTS
   State law requires each California city and county to prepare a general plan. A general plan is
  defined as "a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the county
  or city, ar,d any land outside its boundaries, which in the planning agency's judgment, bears
  relation to its planning." State requirements call for general plans that "comprise an integrated,
  internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency,"
 A city's    general plan has been described as its "constitution" for development - the framework
 within which decisions on how to grow, provide public services and facilities, and protect and
 enhance the environment must be made. California's tradition of allowing local authority over
 land use decisions means that the State's cities have considerable flexibility in preparing their
 general plans.
'While they allow considerable flexibility, State planning laws do establish some requirements for
the issues that general plans must address. The California Government Code establishes both the
content of general plans and rules for their adoption and subsequent amendment. Together, State
law andjudicial decisions establish three overall guidelines for general plans.
      a     The General PIan Must Be Comprehensive. This requirement has two aspects. First, the
            general plan must be geographically comprehensive. That is, it must apply throughout the
           entire incorporated area and it should include other areas that the City determines are
           relevant to its planning. Second, the general plan must address the full range of issues
           that affects the city's physical development.
      a    The General PIan Must Be Internølly Consßtent. This requirement means that the general
          plan must fully integrate its separate parts and relate them to each other without conflict.
          "Hortzontal" consistency applies as much to figures and diagrams as to the general plan
          text. It also applies to data and analysis as well as policies. All adopted portions of the
          general plan, whether required by State law or not, have equal legal weight. None may
          supersede another, so the general plan must resolve conflicts among the provisions of
          each element.
     a    The General Plan Must Be Long-rønge. Because anticipated development will affect the
          city and the people who live or work there for years to come, State law requires every
          general plan to take a long-term perspective.
                                                                                                      1-5

 Rohnert Park General Plan
 1.4       OBJECTIVES AND THEMES
 GENERAT PLAN OBJECTIVES
 Several objectives    for the General Plan were identified and       considered  by the   Oversight
 Committee, based on pubiic outreach conducte<i eariy in ihe Generai Fian process. The o'ojeciives
 providc s foundation for development of tho goals and polioies in the General Plan, and include:
     ¡    Establish aZtJ-year Urban Growth Boundary;
     .    Keep the city's smaii-town feei;
     ¡    Provide for slow, managed, and predictable growth;
     ¡    Increase housing affordability and diversity;
     r    Establish better cross-town connections;
     ¡    Maintain or increase open space ratios within the City;
     .    Encourage local jobs and maintain the jobs/housing balance;
     .   Build and maintain infrastructure in anticipation of growth;
    .    Integrate land use planning with SSLI expansion plans ancl establish hefter c.onnections
         with îhe Ilniversify;
    .    Uphold or improve current levels of city services;
    r    Encouragesocioeconomicdiversity;
    ¡    Ensure legal adequacy and address externaljurisdictional issues, including coordination
         with the Sonoma County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), Sonoma
         Counfy, and Rohnert Park's neighbors;
    ¡    Increase pedestrian and bike access;
    .    Provide a framework for design standards that reflect these objectives; and
    r    Create options for the city's edges. Allow for soft boundaries and scenic corridors.
THEMES
Building on these overall objectives, the General Plan is structured around several themes, which
form the basis of goals and policies throughout the document.
        An (Jrban Growth Boundary ancl. Growth. Manage.ment Program. The General Plan
        establishes a 2}-year growth boundary, "triggef' caps on development, and adequate
        public facility requirements. These policies and programs will ensure phased and orderly
        development, and a sustained high quality of life.
    2. A "Greenbelt"     øround the city, with targeted growth areas. Growth is targeted in
        selected areas to the east and northwest to reinforce a contiguous and compact urban
        form. Land surrounding the city, where Rohnert Park's boundaries do not coincide with
        Cotati's, are maintained in open space. An open space buffer is also maintained between
7-6

                                                              Chapter 1: Introduction and Overvíew
        new growth areas and Petaluma Hill Road. The buffer varies in width and includes both
        open land and recreational facilities.
  3.    City/University Integration, and Mixed-Use Centers. The General Plan designates a new
        pedestrian-oriented University Disfrict-envisioned with a mix of residential, retail,
        entertainment, and office uses that cater to students, faculty, and staff, as well as
        residents-along Rohnert Park Expressway north of the campus. In addition, the City
        Center, adjacent to the Expressway and Commerce Boulevard, is designated for a mix of
       public, office, residential, and retail uses. In addition to these two new centers, the
       Wilfred-Dowdell Village is already being planned as of 1999 andprovides a variety of
       shops and commercial uses, in a pedestrian-oriented enclave on the westside.
  4.   Balanced Neighborhoods. A guiding premise of the Plan is that activities and facilities
       used on a frequent basis, such as stores and parks, should be easily accessible to
       residents. Land uses are designated to ensure balanced neighborhood development with a
       mix of uses and housing types, provision of parks and schools, and easy access to mixed-
      use and commercial activity centers.
 5.   Increased Connectivity and Accessibility. The city's existing neighborhoods have few
      interconnecting streets, and US 101 limits east-west access. Improved connections
      between neighborhoods, as well as new connections across the highway are included in
      the General Plan. Roadway improvements and new streets are also proposed to link
      different neighborhoods and to connect residential areas with SSU.
6.   A Network of Open Space. Using creeks as the armature, an interconnected network of
      open space, parks, and trails is provided. These will also enable connections from
      existing neighborhoods to open space areas beyond Petaluma Hill Road and the SSU
     campus.
7 .  Pedestrian- and Bicycle-Friendly Environmenß. Policies for land uses, mixes, intensities,
     and urban design are established to encourage walking and bicycling. In activity centers
     like the University District, policies are also established to promote small block sizes and
     frequent local streets, which help maximize the permeability of a neighborhood for
    people walking or bicycling.
8.  Enhanced Community Character. The General Plan establishes specific urban design
    policies at a citywide, neighborhood, and street scale. Connections between
    neighborhoods, transitions between urban and open space areas, city and neighborhood
    edges, community orientation of development, building massing, and streetscapes are all
    addressed. Policies are also included for viewshed protection.
                                                                                               t-7

   Rohnert Park General PIan
   1.5     REGIONAL TOCATION AND PTANNING BOUNDARIES
  REGIONAT LOCATION
  As shown in Figure 1.5-1, Rohnert Park is located in central Sonoma County along US l0l, in
  the northern San Francisco Bay Area. The Russian River, the Sonoma and Mendocino coasts, and
  the Sonoma-Napa wine country are all short distances arvr/ay. The Pacific Ocean to the west, with
  its cool marine air, and the warm Sonoma Valley to the east combine to create a mild climate,
 with mild, wet winters, dry summers, and seasonal fogs.
  Sonoma County as a whole is characterizedby rolling hills and a series of valleys. Rohnert Park
 lies within the broad Cotati Valley, which is bounded by the low, rolling coastal hills to the west
 and the Sonoma Mountains to the east. Several creeks run into the city from the eastem ridgeline.
 The hills, along with the surrounding crop flrelds and pastures, provide a rural backdrop to the
 city.
 Figure 1.5-l shows Rohnert Park's regional location. The city shares its boundaries with Cotati to
 the southwest. Santa Rosa's Urban Boundary at its closest point comes to within 1,000 feet of
 Rohnert Park. The city shares portions of its northern and northwestern boundary with two
 County-designated Community Separators - open spaces that separate Rohnert Park and Santa
 Rosa. SSU is located just outside the city's castcrn boundary.
 PLANNING BOUNDARIES
 State law requires that each city adopt a general plan "for the physical development of the county
or city, and any land outside its boundaries which ... bears relation to its planning." Figure 1.5-2
shows the Planning Area. The boundaries of the Planning Area are Stony Point Road to the
northwest, Todd Road and the Santa Rosa Urban Boundary to the north, the Taylor Mountain and
 Sonoma Mountain ritlgelines [o the east, arrt] Liuhau Crcek aud thc NurtLwestenr Pacific railruatl
right-of-way to the southeast. To the west the Planning Area boundary is conterminous with the
 1999 City Limits, because Rohnert Park abuts the Cotati City Limits and SOI on that side.
The Planning Area does not represent the area contemplated for annexation or development, but
is the extent of area around the city that was studied and considered in preparing the plan. For
example, ridgeline views (the Sonoma Mountain ridgeline is located approximately four miles
east of Petaluma Hill Road) are addressed in Chapter 3: Community Design. The Planning Area
has not changed from the 1995 General Plan.

 L.6      THE PTANNING PROCESS
The City's planning process includes rnonitoring and updating the General Plan and implementing
Plan policies, updating Íhe Zoning Ordinance, preparing other irnplementirrg ordinances, specific
plans, design guidelines, and other studies called for in the General Plan. An annual General Plan
Report will provide an overview of the status of the General Plan and its irnplementation.
Ordinances and documents the City must update or prepare upon adoption of the General Plan
include:
     a   Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance is one of the primary implementation tools of
         the General Plan, and it is required to be consistent with the General Plan by State law.
         The Land Use and Growth Management Element, as well as the Community Design
         Element, call for specific revisions to the Zoning Ordinance. A comprehensive update of
         The Zoning Ordinance will be necessary in order to implement the new General Plan
         Diagram and land use classifications, land use policies, and policies relating to the
         intensity, bulk, and character of new development.
         Specific Plans. The City has already prepared a specific plan for the V/ilfred-Dowdell
         area, located on the westside. To provide additional direction for new development,
         policies in the Land Use and Growth Managemerrt Element call for preparation of
         specific plans for all new development areas and identify the boundaries of the new
         specific plan areas. Requirements for specific plans are laid out in the State's
         Government Code.
     a  Neighborhood and Special Area Plans. A concept plan for the City Center was prepared
         in early 1999 and the Central Rohnert Park Priority Development Area Plan (PDA plan)
        was prepared in early 2016. Both documents are intended to guide filture development
        within the central portion of Rohnert Park. The City may consider establishing
        neighborhood and special area plans for additional areas witlr r.rnique planning needs.
        Neighborhood and special area plans need not necessarily address allthe topics required
        by State law for specific plans. All specific plans and neighborhoods and sþecial area
        plans must be consistent with the General Plan. The City retains the authority to require
        specific plans for areas in addition to the ones included in the General Plan.
        Redevelopment Plans. The City's Comrnunity Developnrerrt Area is the City's
        redevelopment area, as authorized by the State's cornmunity redevelopment law, and
        includes most sites in the city that were vacant as of I 999. ln redevelopment areas, the
        property tax increment from new developrnent is reinvested into the redevelopment area,
        whether through public improvemerlts, econolrìic developrnent strategies, or other
        rreasures. Redevelopment plans are required to be consistent with a city's general plan.
    a   Grou,th Managentent Ordinance. A Growth Managernent Ordinance is called for, in
        order to establish a comprehensive growth management prograrn. The ordinance would
       establish conditions of approval for new development, anrrual "trigger" caps on
       development, requirements for adequate public facilities, and other relevant provisions.
    a  Sttbdivision Regulations. Revisions to the City's subdivision regulations may be
       necessary in conjunction with establishnrent of the Crowth Marragernent Ordinance.
                                                                                                 1-1 1

 Rohnert Park General Plan
             Conditions on approval of tentative subdivision maps would need to be established in
             order to reflect the goals and policies of the growth management program.
             Capital Improvements Program. A Capital Improvement Program would need to be
             established to review and program public facility needs within the city, in conjunction
             with new development. The program is established through policies in the Land Use and

 comprehensive amendments over time. Amendments also may be needed from time to time to
 conform to State or federal law passed after adoption, and to eliminate or modifu policies that
may become obsolete or unrealistic due to changed conditions (such as cornpletion of a task or
project, development on a site, or adoption of an ortlinance or plarr).
 State law limits the number of times a jurisdiction can amend its general plan. Generally, no
jurisdiction can amend any mandatory element of its general plan more than four times in one
year, although each amendment may include more than one change to the general plan. 'l'his
restrictiorr, however, does not apply to amendments to:
       .     Optional elements (such                  as the     Community Design Element);

       .     Comply with a couft decision.
ANNUAL REPORT
The California Governmcnt Code requires City staff to "provide an annual report to the
legislative body on the status of the General Plan and progress in its implementation"
(Government Code $ 65400(b)). This report must also be submitted to the Governor's Office of
Planning and Research and the Department of Housing and Community Development. It must
include an analysis of the progress in meeting the city's share of regional housing needs and local
effofts to rernove governmental constraints to maintenance, improvement, and development of
affordable housing (Govenrment Code $ 65583, 65584).
In aclditiorr, arry rrritigatit-r¡l lllonitoling and reporting requireurents prescribed by the California
E,nvironmental Quality Act (CEQA) identified in the General Plan environmental irnpact report
(ElR) should be addressed in the annual report because they are closely tied to plan
irnplementation. Finally, the arrnual repoft should include a summary of all general plan
arnendrnents adopted during the preceding year and an outline of upcorning projects and general
plan issues to be addressed in the coming year, along with a work program.
The Rohnerl Park General Plan Annual Report will be prepared by City staff during the early
stages of the budget process and submitted for review to the Planning Commissiorr, which will
make a recommendation to the City Council. Public comments on the Annual Report rnay be
subrnitted in writing to the Planning and Community Development Departrnent. The Planning
Conrmissiorr and the City Cor,urcil also will hear public comments on the Annual Report at duly
noticed pLrblic hearings.

  PERIODTC REVIEW
 The City will prepare an Implementation Plan                six months of the General Plan's adoption.
 That Implementation Plan shall contain language   "i/ithin
                                                        that allows for technical changes to be made in
 the General Plan. FurtheÍnore, implementing ordinances required by the policies of this General
 Plan shall be adopted as soon as appropriate.
 The City will undertake a periodic review of the General Plan, to determine how well the General
 Plan has performed, that is, whether policies related to development and conservation have been
 effective. This review will include:
      a   Analysis of the effectiveness of implementation programs and strategies initiated to carry
          out the Plan;
     a    Assessment of the City's job/housing balance;
          Review of growth trends since Plan adoption, assessment of future urban land needs, and
          review of growth phasing; and
     a   Review of Performance Indicators, which reflect progress towards implementation of the
         General Plan.
The first review of the plan will start five years after adoption of the Plan. As part of the review,
a target date for a     comprehensive update of the General Plan will be established. A report
summarizing City staffs findings and recommendations will be circulated for public comment
and then presented to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission will review the report
and make a recommendation to the City Council. The Planning Commission and the City Council
also will hear comments on the report at duly noticed public hearings.

   POTICY STRUCTURE
  Each element of the General Plan is introduced by brief background information that establishes
  the policy context. This background material is neither a comprehensive statement of existing
  conditions nor does it contain any adopted policy, except where specifically stated otherwise.
  Readers interested in a more detailed description of issues related to a particular topic should
  refer to the "related documents" listed at the end of this Chapter.
  This background information is followed by goals and policies
      a    Goals. Building on the General Plan objectives, goals are statements of overall
           philosophy and approach to resolving major issues.
      a    Policies. Policies are specific actions that implement the stated goals. They may establish
           procedures, standards, or programs or call for specific City actions.
 Explanatory matenal accompanies some of the goals and policies; it provides background
 information or is intended to guide Plan implementation. The use of "should" or "would"
 indicates that a statement is advisory, not binding; details will need to be resolved in Plan
 implementation. Statements of "shall" or "\ryill" are mandatory. Where the same topic is
 addressed in more than one chapter, sections and policies are cross-referenced, fypically in itqlics
for easy reference.
Policy Numbering System
Policies in the General Plan are organized using a two-part numbering system that is intended to
give each goal and policy a discrete, easily referenced number. The first part refers to the element
(or the subsection within the element), and the second refers to the specific goal or policy. The
first part is represented by the abbreviated initials of the element or subsection (such as LU for
Land Use and GM for Growth Management). For the second part, goals are represented by a
capital letter and policies by a number. Thus, the first goal in Chapter 6: Environmental
Conservation is EC-A and the first policy is EC- 1.
                                                                                                  1-15

    2       Land Use and Growth Management
    Land use and growth management represent the prime planning concerns of most Rohnert Park
   residents. Based on input from public workshops, most residents want the City to ensure that any
   new development is in keeping with the community character and minimizes urbanization of
   open space outside the city. With only about 190 acres of vacant land within City limits in 1999,
   none of it designated for residential use, and limited reuse opporfunities as the city is still fairly
   young, the location, intensity, character, and management of growth at the city's edges is perhaps
   the most significant General Plan concem.
  The text and policies of the Land
  Use and Growth Management
  Element, and the General Plan
  Diagram constitute the physical
  framework of the General Plan.
 The chapter begins with a
 discussion of community form and
 population growth         and their
 implications   for regional growth
management. This       is followed by
definitions     of the land         use
classif,rcations, information on
population and projected buildout,
and land use policies. Last, growth
management policies are presented.
Issues specifically related to urban
design and development character
are addressed in Chapter 3:
Community Design.

  Rohnert Park General Plan
  2.1       BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
 Rohnert Park was established as a master planned community in the late 1950s, The first two
 neighborhoods were built in 1956, and the city continucd to cxpand over subsequent decades.
 However, the city's growth over the last few years has been limited; the current City limits were
 essentially reached in 1990.

 and 1999, the average annual growth rate dropped to 3,1 percent. Extensive development in the
 1980s at much higher rates of growth was counteracted by minimal residential development
 duringthe 1990s.

    IAND     USE PATTERN,1999
   As a master planned community, Rohnert Park has a well-structured pattern of land uses. Most
   neighborhoods are centered around an elementary school and/or a local park. The neighborhoods
   are separated by major streets, the railroad tracks, and open space and parks, such as the city's
   fwo golf courses. Neighborhood shopping centers are located at the intersections of major roads,
   serving several adjacent neighborhoods. Connections between different neighborhoods are
   generally limited to the major streets.
   Land Use Distribution
  The 1999 Cify limits encompass an areã of approximately 4,400 acres (6.9 square miles). Table
  2. I - 1 shows the distribution of this total area by land use. Residential is the predominant land use,
  occupying about 44 percent of the area. About a quarter of the remaining developed land has
  industrial, commercial, or office use, with the balance in public and institutional uses or rights-of-
  way. Only 192 acres of land are currently vacant.

 Sphere of Influence and Adiacent furisdictions
There was a limited amount of land outside the City limits in the L999 Rohnert Park Sphere of
Influence (SOI). The Sphere of Influence included Canon Manor and 24 commercial acres near
Wilfred Avenue west of Redwood Drive. The SOI does not include Creekside Middle School or
the Sonoma State University (SSU) campus, which are located adjacent to the eastern City limits.
To the southwest, the city shares its boundaries with Cotati. Open space and agricultural lands are
adjacent to the city's other boundaries.
To the north and northwest of the city are two County-designated, Community Separators - open
spaces that separate Rohnert Park and Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa's Urban Boundary at its closest
point comes to within 1,000 feet of Rohnert Park.
                                                                                                      2-3

  Residential Areas
  The city's neighborhood design concept was utilized in the development of new neighborhoods.
  Single family, townhouse, and garden apartment housing were constructed in each neighborhood.

 development is typically setback from the street, with on-site parking and landscaping. Three
 shopping centers, anchored by supermarkets, are located near the US 101 and Rohnert Park
 Expressway interchange, with surrounding restaurants, office buildings, and small commercial
 complexes. ln addition, regional commercial clevelopment locatecl west of LIS l0l includes stores
 such as Target, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, and Home Express.
The city's industrial center is located north of the Rohnert Park Expressway, west of the
Northwestern Pacific railroacl right-oÊway. State Farm Insurance, a major employer, is located in
this area. Hewlett Packard, another major employer, is located at the southeastern corner of
Rohnert Park.
Hospitality and Visitor Services
The Double Tree Hotel, Mountain Shadows Golf Resort, and Sonoma County Wineries
Association (California Welcome Center) are the key hospitality sites in Rohnert Park. They are
located at the northem end of the community on Golf Course Drive. The Rohnert Park Stadium,
located on Business Park Drive, provides a venue for sporting and other events.

  Public Facilities
  School Districts
  As discussed in Chapter 5: Open Space, Parks, and Public Facilities, three school districts serve
  Rohnert Park:
       a   Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District. This school district serves most of Rohnert
          Park, portions of neighboring Cotati, and limited surrounding areas. The school district
          operates one high school, two continuation high schools, three middle schools, and nine
          elementary schools.
       a  Bellevue Union School District and Sønta Rosa High School District. These two school
          districts serve areas north of Rohnert Park, including most areas on the westside and
          eastside, outside the 1999 City limits. None of Rohnert Park's residential areas in 1999
          were within these districts.
 Parks and Recreøtion
 In 1999, the City operated 32 rcqeational facilities and parks, including 14 neighborhood parks
 and nine mini-parks that total 116 acres. In addition, there are nine playgrounds on school sites. A
 more detailed description of City parks, as well as park policies, appear in Chapter 5: Open
 Space, Parks, and Public Facilities.
 City Buildings ønd Land
 The City owns andlor operates several other significant facilities. There are 84 City buildings
 which include offices, public safety facilities, and recreation buildings, The City also entered into
partnerships to provide facilities such as the Wine and Visitors Center, the Library, and the
Rohnert Park Municipal Golf Course. The City owns three significant parcels of land:
     a   500 City Høll Drive (8.4 Acres).In 1990, the City Council approved plans for a civic
         center complex at this location. Three buildings were planned - the public safety
         headquarters, a City office building, and a City Council chambers building. The public
         safety headquarters was completed and occupied in the mid-1990s.
     a   Near Rohnert Park Stadium (14 Acres). South of the Rohnert Park Stadium between
         Redwood Drive and Labath Ave.
    a    Near Rohnert Park Expresswøy (10 Acres) . North of the Expressway and east of Snyder
         Lane.
Vacant Land
As shown in Table 2.1-I, only about 190 acres of land within the L999 City limits, none of it
zoned for residential uses, was vacant. Some stores and office spaces were also vacant in the
Southwest Boulevard Shopping Center and the Padre Town Station center.
                                                                                                   2-5

  Rohnert Park General Plan
  Intensity of Development
  Rohnert Park is more densely developed than any other suburban jurisdiction in Sonoma County.
  Average citywide housing density for land occupied by residential uses, excluding Canon Manor,
  is approximately 8.0 housing units per gross acre. This is the highest residential density of all
  cities in Sonoma County. Density varies by neighborhood. Chapter 3: Community Design
  presents rnore detail on neighborhood form and character.
  Most non-residential uses in Rohnert Park occupy detached, single-story structures and have been
  suhiect to maximum loÍ coverase reouiremenls

  PTANS AND PROGRAMS, 1999
 Whilc plonning in Rohnert Park is controlled by the City, it is influenced by actions of the
 sunounding jurisdictions as well. This scction providcs an ovcrview of the major plans and
 programs in piace in ihe City ancÍ acijacent jurisciiciions.
 Rohnert Park Plans and Programs
 In addition to the     General Plan, the Cify had specific area plans, special area plans, and
 redevelopment plans in place in 1999.
 Specifíc Areø Plans and Specíal Area PIøns
 The City's specific area plans and special area plans include:
           Wilfred-Dowdell SpeciJìc Plan. Consisting of 24 acres between the 1999 City limits and
          Dowdell Avenue, this area is planned for more than 170,000 square feet of regional
          commercial development. The Plan has not been adopted by the City Council.
      a   City Center Concept Plan.'I'he City completed a Draft Concept Plan for the City Center,
          located near the intersection of Rohnert Park Expressway and State Farm Drive, in May
           1999. The Concept Plan is not a specific plan but would be used to guide the
          development of land purchased by the City for new offices and Council chambers. The
          Plan outlines a vision for the City Center that features a pedestrian-oriented main street,
          and establishes direction for land use, urban design, and circulation.
Community       D evelopment Area
The Community Development Area is the City's redevelopment area. It includes all sites that
were vacant within the Rohnert Park City limits in 1999, except for a five-acre commercial site
near the intersection of East Cotati Avenue and Bodway Parkway. The property tax increment
from new developrnent in the redevelopment area is reinvested into fhe area through public
improvement or other strategies. The City has been adhering to the State requirement of setting
aside 20 percent of available tax increment for low/moderate income housing, which are available
to meet the Cify's housing obligations.

   Plans and Programs of Surrounding Iurisdictions
   Sonoma County
   In response to strong growth pressures, the Sonoma County General Plan establishes a framework
   for protecting open space and agricultural uses, and uses a variety of strategies for limiting new
   development.
         a   LargeJot Zoning. Land adjacent to Rohnert Park is designated for very low-density
             residential uses (typically l0-acre or 2}-acre lots) and a rcnge of small-scale and
             commercial farming activities.
         a   Community Separators. Community separators are established adjacent to existing cities
             to limit development and provide distinct physical and visual    spaces between cities.
             Community separators are located between Rohnert Park and Santa Rosa, and between
             Cotati and Petaluma, southwest of Rohnert Park. The amount and intensity of
            development are limited, and additional requirements are imposed for screening,
            clustering, and preservation of trees and landforms.
       I    Urban Service Boundaríes. Policies limit the extension of urban services to land capable
            of supporting agriculture.
       a    Scenic and Riparian Corridors. US 101 and Petaluma Hill Road are designated as scenic
            corridors. As such, adjacent development is required to have setbacks of 30 percent or
            200 feet, whichever is smaller, and a 2D-foot setback in urban service areas. Copeland
            Creek and Crane Creek are classified riparian corridors and are subject to a 100-foot
            streamside conservation area setback.
 Sonoma County Agricultural PreservatÍon qnd Open Space DistrÍct
 Sonoma County voters approved a Y+-cent sales tax for the preservation of agricultural lands and
 open space. The Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District was formed
 for administration of these funds and has identified a process for determining lands to be
 preserved. Preservation of community separator lands is a pnmary goal, and the new acquisition
 plan calls for an emphasis on "greenbelt" conservation and easements and fee purchases. Several
 sites   or  easements   in the Rohnert Park     area have already been purchased   for  preservation
purposes; these sites are shown on Figure 5.1-1.
 Williamson Act Lands
Several sites around Rohnert Park have Williamson Act contracts. The Williamson Act of 1965
(California Land Conservation Act, Govemment Code $ 51200 et seq.) is intended to discourage
the unnecessary and premature conversion ofagricultural land to non-agricultural uses by taxing
land according to income-producing value, rather than its "highest and best use." lJnder contract,
farmers agree not to develop their land for 10 years in exchange for the lower tax rate; contracts
are automatically renewed each year.
                                                                                                  z-7

  Rohnert Park General Plan
  Land under a Williamson Act is designated as an agricultural preserve, which can be used for
  agricultural, recreational use, or open space use. Recreational uses include walking, hiking,
  picnicking, camping, swimming, boating, fishing, hunting, or other outdoor games or sports; open
  space uses include wildlife habitat and managed wetlarrd arcas. Lands within a scenic highway
  corridor may be included in an agricultural preserve.
  Santa Rosa
  The Santa Rosa General Plan establishes an Urban Boundary, and policies                encourage
  preservation of cornmunity separators and agricuiturai !an<Ís outside the Urban Boundary. lvfajor
  boundary changes can only be made during the five-year General Plan update process.
 According to the Santa Rosa General Plan, the Urban Boundary contained about 149,600 persons
 in 1995 arrd can ultirnately accommodate a population of 201,000. Thc City maintains a growtlt
 management program that liurits rcsidential building penuits to 1,000 per year until 2000, 900 per
 year between 2001 and 2005, and 850 per year from 2006 to 2010.
 CotatÍ
 Cutati's Cenelal Plan expresses thc City's dcsirc to maintain o small-town feeling and promoto
 compact. tlevekrprrrcut. Thç 1998 Cutati General Plan reduced the western cxtcnt of thc City's
 Urban Growth Boundary, while expanding it along the edges of Rohnert Park. Commercial
 Industrial and Rural Residential (1.0 unilacre) uses are planned for areas adjacent to Rohnert
 Park. The Comnercial Industrial area, while it does not border on Rohnert Park, could cause off-
 site impacts like traffic and noise.
 Cotati's growth management program limits the City to issuing 75 residential building permits
 pcr year, plus an additional 25 for affordable units. Average annual growth has been closer to 50
units.2 The 1999 population of about 7,200 is estimated to increase to more than 7,500 by 2005
 and more than 8,000 by 2010.
So  no m   a State U nlv er s lty
While SSU conhibutes strongly to the city's identity, it actually lies outside the city's eastern
boundary and the City's 1999 SOI. The 214-acre campus supports 7,000 full time equivalent
(FTE) students and 1,200 employees, making it one of the largest etnployers in the area.
University students, faculty and staff are a part of the Rohnert Park community.
The 1992 SSU Master Plan featured 880,000 square feet of new classrooms, facilities,            and
parking, and enhanced campus entryways. At buildout, the Master Plan was <iesigned to increase
the number of FTE students to 10,000. As of 1999, SSU is preparing an updated Master Plan that
plans for additional classrooms and facilities, as well as new student housing. The updated plan is
still expected to have 10,000 FTE students at buildout. The University is considering acquisition
of the site west of the concert hall for long-term expansion.

     In September 1998, SSU completed a master plan for a new concert hall and music center to be
     located between the existing campus and the Rohnert Park Expressway. Approximately 97,000
     square feet in size, the facility features a 1,400-seat concert hall, an outdoor theater, a recital hall,
     a rehearsal hall, abanquet hall, and as well as classrooms and offices.
     Canon  Manor
    The Canon Manor subdivision is located immediately south of SSU, west of Petaluma Hill Road.
    Although outside of the 1999 City limits, Canon Manor is within Rohnert Park's SOI, and within
    the Urban Growth Limit shown in this General Plan. The Counfy allowed largeJot development
    on parcels accessed on graveled roads and supported by individual water wells and septic
    systems. Water wells and septic systems in close proximity to each other in the heavy clay soils
    of Canon Manor may result in the infiltration of pollutants from septic systems into water wells.
   After extended periods of dry weather, the water table may drop below the level of water wells.
   Public improvements, commonly provided within City limits, either do not exist or 'ñ/ere not
   constructed to City standards in Canon Manor. Property owners, Sonoma County, LAFCO and
   the City eventually will need to resolve public service issues. Topics to be addressed include:
         a  Facility standards;
         a  Costs and mechanisms to install needed facilities;
         a  Payment of costs by Canon Manor property owners;
        a   Extension of City services, specifically water and sewer; and
        a   Annexation.
  Penngrove
  Established   in 1882, Penngrove is a small, unincorporated, rural town at the foothills of Sonoma
  Mountain. The Penngrove Specific Plan was adopted in 1984 and encompasses 2,750 acres
  located between Petaluma, Cotati, Rohnert Park and the Canon Manor subdivision to the north.
  Penngrove's core area is served by sewer system and aqueduct water, with parcels ranging from
  l/4 acre to 1 acre. The outlying areas are served by private wells and septic, with parcels ranging
  from 2 acres to the 20-acre density established by the Sonoma Mountain Specific Plan. Based on
 low-density land use policies, the Penngrove Specific Plan intends to accommodate a population
 of 2,744 at buildout.
 The Penngrove Specific Plan is committed to: a community centered concept; provisions of
 greenbelts surrounding and separating urban areas; retention of agricultural resources; adherence
 to the principle of environmental suitability; and preservation of natural resources.
Regional Agencies and Programs
Implementation of the General Plan           will require coordination with several regional and other
local agencies.
                                                                                                         2-9

  Rohnert Park General Plan
 Sonoma County and Community Sepørators
  Sonoma Counfy communities strive to maintain clear physical boundaries in order to avoid
  usrritlor-style urbanization and suburban sprawl. This conccpt is recognized as "community
 separators" in the Sonoma County General Plan. Two community separators are located in the
 Rohnert Park-Cotati area. The Petaluma-Roimert Park separator is iocated between Petaiuma,
 Penngrove, and Rohner[ Park-Cotati. The second separator is generally located north and
 northwest of Rohnert Park, between Rohnert Park and Santa Rosa (see Figure 5.1-l). The
 Sonoma County General Plan limits land uses in community separators to open space,
 agriuulture, and rural residential development.
 Santa Rosa's Urban Boundary, along the V/ilfred Channel, is close to the northemmost City
 limits. A County-designated Community Separator is in effect in this area, providing a green
 space between Santa Rosa and Rolurert Park. The Sonoma County General Plan allows only vcry
 low-de¡sity residential development in the separators, iu urtler to provide visual and physical
 greenbelts between communities.
For detailed discussion and policies related to separators, including the Sonomø County Measure
D, see Chapter 5: Open Space, Parks, and Publìc Faclllties.
 Regulation of llses in Ílnínatr¡torated Areøs
Because the General Plan does not propose annexation        of all lantl within the Plaruring Area,
development on unincorporatcd land, essentially all land east of Petaluma Hill Road in the
Planning Area, will continue to be regulated by the County General Plan and the Zoning
Ordinance. All land in the area is currently designated by the County for agricultural and rural
residential uses.
Land outside the Santa Rosa Urban Boundary, within the southern Santa Rosa SOI acljacent to
Rohnert Park, includes land designed as community separator. Very low density residential use
designations are in place there and permit minimum residential lots of 0.5 to 5 acres. These
designations are intended to be permanent, not to reserve land for future development.

  2,2       GENERAT PIAN DIAGRAM AND USE CLASSIFICATIONS
  GENERAL PLAN IAND USE FRAMEWORK
  General Plan Diagram
  The land use framework of the General Plan is embodied in the General Plan Diagram (Figure
 2.2-l), which is a graphic representation of the themes and policies in the Plan. The General Plan
 Diagram designates the proposed general location, distribution, and extent ofland uses through
 buildout, which is expected by about 2020. As required by State law, land use classifîcations,
 shown as color/graphic patterns, letter designations, or labels on the Diagram, speciff a range for
 housing density and building intensity for each type of designated land use. These
 density/intensity standards allow circulation and puþlic facility needs to be determined; they also
 reflect the environmental carrying-capacity limitations established by other elements of the
 General Plan.
The Diagram is to be used and interpreted only in conjunction with the text and other figures
contained in the General Plan. The legend of the General Plan Diagram abbreviates the land use
classifications described below, which represent an adopted part of the General Plan.
The General Plan Diagram is not parcel-specific, and uses on sites less than one acre in size are
generally not depicted on the Diagram. The interpretation of consistency with the General Plan on
sites less than one acre in size will be done through the Zoning Ordinance and the Zoning Map.
Land Use Framework Guiding Principles
The General Plan Diagram embodies several ideas and principles. These include:
     a     Compact urban form. All growth is contiguous to existing City limits and within 4,000
          feet of existing (as of 1999) development. The compact form of growth is supplemented
          by maintenance ofurban densities, to help preserve open space, protect agriculture, and
          ensure efficient provision of services.
     a    Urban Growth Boundary. The General Plan delineates an Urban Growth Boundary
          (UGB) as the edge within which all urban development will be contained, until the year
          2020.
         Close physical integration of the city and Sonoma State (Iniversity. New growth areas are
         located to foster a strong physical "town and gown" connection. A new University
         District is located north of the campus to bring the city and the University together, and
         provide a mixed-use residential and commercial center to meet the needs of students
         faculty, visitors, as well as city residents.
    a   Increased connectivity between and within neighborhoods. New streets are designated to
        result in increased connectivity. In addition, policies for locating local streets are included
        to ensure neighborhood-level connections while providing flexibilify to project
        developers.
                                                                                                    2-77

 Rohnert Park General Plon
     ¡   Designation    of mixed-use and pedestrian-oriented activity centers. Three pedestrian-
          oriented mixed-use centers are designated: the University District, the City Center and
          Sonoma Mountain Vitlage. In addition, mixed-use or multi-use development is
         encouraged     at three othcr sites: the northwest growth area, southwest of Adrian
         Drive/Southwest Boulevard, and a center in the southeast.
     o    l/ariety of housing untJ mi.r of housing types in all neighborhoods. The Gencral Plan
         provides t'or a variety of housing types, including Estate Residential, a housing type
         currently not found in Rohnert Park, as well as higher density housing to meet the needs
         of students, and mobile home subdivisions to pro'ridc for affordable housing. The
         General Plan Diagram illustrates neighborhoods with integrated housing types, designed
         to locate alarger share ofresidences close to transit and neighborhood centers.
     a  Protection of creeksitles and provision of a network of trails and parks. The Diagram
         illustrates a network of open space along crccks that will l¡e lealized over time. Thoso
        open space areas will also facilitate development of a network of bikeways and
        pedestrian trails.
     a  Land use pattern to maximize accessibilíty to parks and commerciul cenlers. All ltiglt
        density residential uses are located adjacent to parks/greerìways or mixed-use centers to
        ensure that recreational and everyday shopping facilities ate within walking dista¡tL;e ol
        most residents.
FUTURE BOUNDARIES
The General Plan Diagram shows the proposed future Sphere of Influence for the City; future
City limits are proposed to coincide with the Sphere of Influence. Decisions on changes to the
City limits and the Spherc uf Influence require approval of the Sonoma County Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCO). Âlso shown on the Diagram is the Urban Growth Boundary
(UGB), which outlines the limits of urban growth under this General Plan. This UGB is entirely
within the proposecl sphere, and will become operative upon the adoption of this General Plan;
UGBs are neither recognized by LA-b'CO, nor do they require LAFCO approval,

 DENSITY/INTENSITY STANDARDS
 The General Plan establishes density/intensity standards for each use classification. Residential
 density is expressed as housing units per gross (including public streets and other rights-of-way)
 acre. Maximum permitted ratio of gross floor area to site area (FAR) is specified for non-residential
 uses. FAR is a broad measure of building bulk that controls both visual prominence and traffic
 generation. It can be clearly translated to a limit on building bulk in fhe Zoning Ordinance and is
 independent of the type of use occupying the building.
 Density (housing units per gross acre) and intensity (FAR) standards are for gross developable land
 (that is, including streets and other rights-of-way), but excluding areas subject to physical or
 environmental constraints, as well as areas dedicated for creekside/greenways or habitat protection.
 Exceptions
 The Zoning Ordinance could provide specific exceptions to the FAR limitations for uses with low
 employment densities, such as research facilities, or low peak-hour traffic generation, such as
hospitals. Intensity standards for non-residential and mixed-use development are for the entire
development site; that is, intensities on individual parcels may exceed the maximum, provided the
overall development project does not exceed the stipulated intensity.
For residential uses, in contrast, density standards shall apply to individual parcels. The Planning
Commission may permit, subject to findings, deviations in residential density standards on
individual parcels for clustered development with common open space, as stipulated in the policies
included later in this chapter, provided overall project density is not exceeded.
Additionally, Planned Developments or Specific Plan areas which are subject to form-based zoning
codes shall be exempted from the FAR limitations set forth above. The density standards applicable
to such areas shall be the same as that set forth in the applicable form-based code.

Maximum Density/Intensity Not Automatic
The density/intensity standards do not imply that development projects will be approved only at
the maximum density or intensity specified for each use. Zoning regulations consistent with
General Plan policies and/or site conditions may reduce development potential within the stated
ranges. Examples of conditions that may limit attainment of the maximum densities/intensities
include, but are not limited to:
     a    Development standards established in the Zoning Ordinance (such as for heights and
          setbacks, or minimum habitable space) may limit building size;

   Classification System
   The classifications in this sectioÍr represent adopted City policy. They are rneant to be broad enough
  to give the City flexibility in implementing City policy, but clear enough to provide sufficient
  direction to carry out the General Plan. The City's Zot"ting Ordinance contains more detailed
  provisions and standards to implement these classifications. More than one zoning district may be
  consistent with a single General Plan land use classifìcation.
  Residential
  Four residential land use classifications are established to provide for development of a full range
  of housing types (mixed-use classifications that permit residential uses are included later in this
  section). Densities are stated as the number of housing units per gross acre of developable land,
  provided that at least one housing unit may be built on each existing legal parcel designated for
  residential use.
  Development would be required within the density range (both maximum and minimum) stipulated
  in the classification. Second units permitted by local regulation and State-mandated density bonuses
 for provision of affordable housing are in addition to densities otherwise permitted in each of the
 residential land use classifications.
 Assumed average densities listed are used to calculate probable hor-rsing unit and population
 holding capacity. Neither the averages nor the totals constitute General Plan policy. Population
 densities comesponding to the housing unit densities can be obtained by rnultiplying each housing
 unit by 2.62, the average projected Rohnert Park household size in 2020, according to the
 Association of Bay Area Governments' (ABAG) Projections '98.
Rural Estate Residential
 Single-family detached residential development at densities of 2.0 housing units per gross acre or
 less. This classification is intended for three areas: Canon Manor, Southeast Specifìc Plan Area and
at designated locations at the city's ultimate physical edge on the eastside to provide transition
between urban and open space uses. The Zoning Ordinance may split this classification into two
categories: Rural Residential, to be applied to the Canon Manor, and Estate Residential, whicll
would be applied to the Southeast Specific Plan Area and other areas with this designation.
Low Density
Single-farnily residential developrnent at density of 4.0 to 6.0 units per gross acre. Typical lots
worrld be 6,000 square feet, but the minimum would be 5,000 square feet, and |he ZoningOrdinance
rnay permit smaller lots (4,500 square feet) for projects that use features such as clustering and
common open space that may result in somewhat smaller lots, but increased community-wide open
space. This classification is mainly intended for detached single-farnily dwellings, but the Zoning
Ordinance may perrnit attached single-farnily units in selected or all areas, provided each unit has
ground-floor living area and private outdoor open space. The Zoning Ordinance rnay irrclude a
separate district for mobile home subdivisiolls or zero-lot-line developnrents.
                                                                                                     2-19

Rohnert Park General PIan
Medium Density
Housing at densities fi'om 6.1 to 12.0 units per gross acre. Dwelling types may include attached or
detached single-farnily housing. The Zoning Ordinance may reserve some areas designated as
Medium Density for detached (zero-lot-line or other) single-fämily residential developrnent.
Multifamily housing type is not permitted. Side-by-side duplexes not separated by a prooem_v line
or without individual heating systcms arc also pcrmittcd, providcd thcy arc similar in appcarancc
to single family struçtures,
High Density
Residential development           at densities ranging from l2.l to 30.0 units per gross acre. This
designation          would permit a wide range of housing types, ranging from single-family attached to
multifamily and may include other housing types identified within a Specific Plan, and is intended
for specific areas where higher clensities may be appropriate.

This designation is intended to provide sites for retail areas containing a rvide variety of businesses,
including: retail stores, eating and drinking establishments, commercial recreation, service stations,
automobile sales and repair scrvices, flnancial, busincss and pcrsonal scrviccs, hotcls and motcls,
and educational and social services. In order to provide for the housing anticipated in the Housing
Element, and provide for internal consistency between the Land Use Element and the Housing
Elenrent, resitlential uses tnay be conditionally perntitted. Maxinlum permitted FAR is 1.5 for
hotels and û.4 for all other uses. Letter designation on the General Plan Diagram may limit the type
of commercial uses in ceftain districts, as follows:
        a   N (lVeighborhood). Stores, personal service establishments, offices, financial businesses,
            and restaurants and cafes that serve the everyday needs of the immediate neighborhood.
            Department or big-box stores are not permitted, and the Zoning Ordinance rnay place
            linlitations on autornotive (for example, gas stations, auto sales and repair) and drive-
            through estabIishments.

   Industriatr
   This designation accommodates campus-like em¡ironments for corporate headquarters, research
   and development facilities, offices, light manufacturing and assembly, industrial processing,
   general service, warehousing, storage and distribution, and service commercial uses. Retail is
   permitted as an ancillary use only. Maximum FAR is 0.5, but discretionary increases may be
   permitted up to a total FAR of 1.0, subject to review and approval for development meeting
   specific standards included in the Zoning Ordinance.
   Mixed-Use
  This designation accommodates a vanety of compatible businesses, stores, institutions, servrce
   organizations, and residences in a pedestrian-oriented setting. Allowable uses include multifamily
  residences, retail shops, financial, business and personal services, and restaurants. Automotive
  (for example, motor vehicle sales, motor vehicle part sales, and gasoline stations) and drive-
  through establishments are not permitted, but may be allowed within Planned Development and
  Specific Plan areas if the governing provisions for such areas expressly provide otherwise. Plan
  policies andlor the Zoning Ordinance may require certain uses - such as groundJevel retail - in
  some or all portions of a site with this designation.
 In general, the maximum FAR for developments with a non-residential mix of uses is 1.5 and for
 residential and non-residential uses combined ís 2.0; however, in Planned Developments and
 Specific Plan areas, limitations on maximum FAR shall be as set forth in the applicable zoning
 district. Separate residential density limitations are not established; however, minimum unit size
 requirements established in the Zoning Ordinance will result in maximum density limitations. kr
 addition, limitations on the size and location of parking, coupled with building orientation and
 design standards, as specified in Chapter 3: Community Design and/or the Zoning Ordinance will
 ensure that a pedestrian-oriented environment is created. (Rev. 08/10)
 Areas on the General Plan Diagram that are striped with two different colors are not considered
 mixed use, which only applies to the areas with the Mixed Use designation.
 Public/Institutional
To provide for schools, government offlces, transit sites, and other facilities that have a unique
public character, as well as Sonoma State University. Religious facilities are not called out
separately on the General Plan Diagram, although they would be permitted in this designation as
well as other residential and commercial districts; these facilities may or may not be specifically
delineated on the ZoningMap.
Public/Institutional/Medium          D ensity Residential
This designation shown as a strþed area on the General Plan Diagram would allow either of the
two uses represented by the striping, or a combination of the two (Public/Institutional and
Medium Density Residential) consistent with their separate land use classifications.
                                                                                                 2-27

    Commercial- R/High Density Residential
   This designation shown as a striped area on the General Plan Diagram would allow either of the
   t"vo uses represented by the striping, or a combination of the two (Commercial and High Density
   Residential) consistent with their separate land use classifications.
   Parks/Recreation
   This designation provides for parks for active and passive recreation, recreation complexes,
   community fields, public golf courses, stadiums, arboretums, and greenways. Ancillary facilities
   such as concession stands, clubhouses, and equipment rental are also allowed.
   Open Space
  Two types of open space designations are included:
  Open Space    þr  Envíronmental Conservation
  This designation includes sites with environmental and/or safety constraints. Included are riparian
  couidurs, selsitive habitats, and wetlands. Fol sites entilely witlún this desígnation, developruert
  is limited to one housing unit per existing legal parcel, provided policies in             Chapter 6:
  Envirorunental Conservation. as well as protection standai'ds that niay be specified in the Zoning
  Ordinance or elsewhere, are adhered to. For parcels partially v/ithin this designation, no
  development is permitted within the Open Space desigrrated area if other land within the parcel
  <loes not have environmental and/or safety constraints. Land area with this designation shall not
  be used in calculating allowable development. However, for parcels that include creekside
 buffers, development rights that would result if adjacent land uses were to be extended into a
 buffer can be transferred for land in the buffer that is directly accessible to the public, subject to a
 maximum lO-foot depth, on an acre-for-acre basis, to the developable parts of the parcel.
 Open Space    for Agriculture and Resource Management
 This designation includes orchards and cropland, grasslands, and very low density rural
 residential areas, not to exceed one housing unit per 20 or 40 acres, provided that one housing
 unit may be built on each existing parcel. Agriculture is permitted with fewer restrictions on
 keeping animals than in the residential classifications. This classification will also accommodate
 any greenbelts and/or urban buffer areas that may be designated in the future. Greenbelts are open
 space, park land, and agricultural areas located outside urban areas, as opposed to urban parks
located within developed areas.
20 Year Urban Growth Boundary
This is the area within which urban development will be contained over the period 2000 to 2020.
                                                                                              (Rev. i1100)

     2,3     GENERAT PLAN BUITDOUT
    Table2.3-l shows the buildout acreage of the General Plan Diagram. Approximately 1,301 net
    acres would be developed within the UGB, including infill sites. An additional 50 acres would be
    developed for community fields outside the UGB. The table breaks out acreage by area of the
    city: areas inside the 1999 City limits and three areas outside the 1999 City limits, the eastside
    (north of the SSU campus), Canon Manor and southeast (south of the SSU campus), and the
    westside (west of Dowdell Avenue). Most areas that are planned for new development are
   residential in use, totaling abotÍ 640 acres. Amendments to the General Plan in 2010 have
   resulted in the designation of certain developed and undeveloped lands from an industrial
   designation to mixed use and parks/open space. An additional 550 acres outside the UGB and
   inside the SOI would be used for parks and open space. Figure 2.3-l compares land uses in 1999
  to those resulting from full buildout of the General Plan.

 Table 2.3-3 summarizes the buildout population and employment under the General Plan.
 Population and employment are based on estimates of housing units and non-residential building
 floor area, which are derived from the a$eage estimates inTable2.3-1.
Population is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 1.0 percent between 1999 and
 2020. Approximately 10,322 residents will be added to the city, reaching a total buildout
population of approximately 5l ,332. Whereas, jobs are planned to increase at a yearly rate of I .9
percent under the General Plan, reaching a total buildout of 29,479 jobs. Because jobs will
increase at a faster rate than population, the ratio of jobs to employed residents is expected to
increase from 1.04        to  1.22.

 2.4     LAND USE GOATS AND POLICIES
 GOALS: LAND USE
 LU-A Maintain a compact urban form, with a defined urban growth boundary and urban
        development intensities in land designated for urban uses. Work with other agencies to
       ensure that land surrounding the city is maintained in open space.
 LU-B  Provide soft urban edges and ensure that designated intensities provide gradual transition
       to open space at the city edges.
LU-C Promote a balanced land use program and increase the ability of people to live and work
       in the city.
LU-D Provide for concentrations of activity and mixed-use and pedestrian-oriented development
       in selected areas.
LU.E   Encourage development of the City Center as a mixed-use activity center with a range        of
       commercial, residential, and civic uses.
LU-F   Create a new mixed-use University District north of Sonoma State University that would
       draw visitors, serve as a destination point for the City, offer a wide mix of residential and
       employment opportunities, and foster close physical and visual relationship between the
       campus and the rest of the City.
LU-G Require preparation of specific plans for strategic new growth     areas with complex land use
      programs.
LU-H Maintain land use patterns that maximize residents' accessibility to parks, open space, and
      neighborhood shopping centers.
LU-I  Provide ataîge of housing types in type and price, including largeJot homes and housing
      oriented to students. Provide a variety ofhousing in all neighborhoods and reserve sites,
      where appropriate, for housing types that would ensure that Rohnert Park remains an
      inclusive, community.
LU-J  Continue to maintain efficient land use patterns and ensure that           infill development
      maintains the scale and character of established neighborhoods.
LU-K Promote a diverse range ofjobs within the city.
LU-L  Establish Central Rohnert Park as a complete community, with distinctive mixed-use areas
      and place, by:
           ¡   Promoting high-quality, compact infill growth that enhances the character of
               existing neighborhoods, complements the identity of subareas, and improves the
               bike, pedestrian, and transit orientation.

            A complete revision of the Zoning Ordinance u,ill be necessary,, including, but not limited
            to:
                  o   Establishment of new base districts, consistent with the land use classifications in

            wlrere necessary, the General Plan Diagram and/or the Zoning designation for parcels
            located within areas of existing development.
            The City's previous (as of 2000) Zoning Ordinance allowed alternate lønd uses in gíven

            Drive. This General Plan anticipates that the Zoning Ordinance will be revised including
            identification of new base zoning districts. It may be necessary to refine the General Plan
            Diagram and/or Zoning designations in order to implement the goals and policies in this
            General Plan and ensw'e that the Zoning Ordinance that is consistent with and implements
            this General Plan.
LU-2        Require sites designated as Mixed Use-University District, City Center, Southwest
            Shopping Center, and near Bodway Parkway/Valley House Road-to be developed with a
            variety of residential and non-residential uses, in accordance with the delineated land use
            program for the Specific Plan areas in this chapter.

                                                      Chapter 2: Land Use and Growth Management
 LU-4  Develop the City Center and the Sonoma Mountain Village Plarured Development                    as
       mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented areas.
       Permitted uses are stipulated in the land use classifications in Section 2.2.
 LU-5  Encourage development of the northwest growth area along Wilfred Avenue and on the
       area designated as Mixed Use on Bodway Parkway, south of Canon Manor, as mixed-use
       centers (that is, with different uses at different levels in a building), while permitting single-
       or multi-use (that is more than one use on the site, but in separate buildings) development.
       Encouragement þr mixed-use development is built into the General Plan Land (Ise
       Classification system, which permits an FAR of 2.0for mixed-use development that include
       residential uses, and FAR of 1.5 for projects with a non-residential mix (such as retail and
       offr"nÐ. Projects with single use buildings would be subject to the FARfor these individual
       uses, as included in Section 2.2, which are lower than the FARs stipulatedþr rnixed-use
       developments. Further incentives would result from reduced parking requirements for
       mixed-use development that may be included in the City's Zoning Ordinance.
 LU-6 Locate    new Medium and High Density Residential development adjacent to parks,
       creekways or other open space, in order to maximize residents' access to recreational uses,
       or adjacent to a Mixed Use or Neighborhood Commercial Center, to maximize access to
       services.
LU-7   Encourage new neighborhood commercial facilities and supermarkets to be located to
       maximize accessibility to all residential areas.
       The intent is to ensure that convenience shopping facilities such as supermarkets and
      drugstores are located close to where people líve and facilitøte access to these on foot or
      bicycles. AIso, because Rohnert Park's residentiøl population can support only a lirnited
      number of supermarkets, this policy will encourage dispersion of supermarkets rather than
      their clustering in afew locations.
Residential Development'
LU-8  Require that residential development projects comply not only with the stipulated
      maximum density for the Íaîge, but the minimum density as well.
      Because of limited land supply, it is vital that minimurn residential densities are adhered
      tofor achieving Generdl Plan buildout. Maintainingminimum densities is critical not only
      to achieve the intent of the General Plan Diagram and a balance and variety of housing
      types, but also to foster a compact urbanform, and ensure that services, such as transit,
      can be provided and access to focilities is ntaintained. This policy would also mean, as an
      example, that approval of a residential project at a Low Density Residential range on a
      site designated Medium Density Residential will require an amendment to the General
      Plan Diagram.
LU-9  Ensure that the Zoning Ordinance provides for:
           o A     5,000 square-foot minimum          lot area for    areas designated Low Density
               Residential on the General Plan Diagram.
               The Zoning Ordinance may permit lots as small as 4,500 square feet in selected
               areas and under speciJìc conditions.
                                                                                                    z_zg

  Rohnert Park Generol Plan
                    o    Development standards that permit zero-lot line attached or detached single-family
                         dwellings on sites designated for medium or higher densities in the General Plan;
                         and
                    r    Development standards that do not discourage provision of more local streets.
                         While General stipulations of gross (as opposed to net) should take out any
                         disincentives to providingmore through streets, minimum lot-size standards in the
                        Zoning Ordinance should be attsinable in residential projects that provide through
                        streets every 400 to 500feet.

Specific Plan, Planned Development, and OtherAreas
The new growth areas of the City have been divided into five specifi.c plan areas - Northwest,
Northeast, University District, Canon Manor, and Southeast; and two planned development areas
- Sonoma Mountain Village and Stadium Area. Policies have been developed that pertain to the
individual specific plan/planned development areas, as well as for the City Center area, for which
a Concept PIan exists. Boundaries for specific plan/planned development areas are demarcated in
Figure 2.4-1. For policies related to design issues, please see Chapter 3: Community Design.
LU-104           Coordinate the adoption of each specific plan and planned development in a manner that
                 provides for the systematic implementation of the General Plan, as is consistent with
                 the growth management and public facilities goals and policies of this General Plan. In
                 order to carry out this policy, the City Council may elect to adopt one specific plan and,/or

                  o     Consistent with General Plan Policy CD-7, minimize disruption of existing views
                        by adhering to the 60' setbacks between Vast Oak structures and existing structures
                        at the Medical Center and Kisco (Oakview Terrace) properties. Along the
                        boundaries between Redwood Park Estates and the Vast Oak Property, and
                        between the J Section and the IID LLC Property, provide a minimum of a 100'
                        setback between structures as well as a single-story requirement for those
                        structures immediately adjacent to this structural buffer. When the structural
                       buffer between structures along Redwood Park Estates and the J Section exceeds
                        150', then the requirement for the single story structures at Vast Oak and IID LLC
                       is waived as the visual goals of the General Plan are achieved through the increased
                       structural buffer width. The Vast Oak development that is adjacent to the Kisco /
                       Oakview Terrace and Medical Center development is allowed to be three stories
                       in height, as long as there remains the 60' building structure separation

 2.5       GROWTH MANAGEMENT
Management and predictability of growth emergcd as ulre uf the saliert issues tlut Rolurert Park
residents would like the General Plan to address. Based on community workshops held in 1999,
the Ad Hoc Oversight Committee established objectives for the General Plan, which included a 20-
year UGB and managed and predictable growth (see Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview).
Growth management policies are designed to balance competing interests, including the need for
additional housing and related development, and the expressed community desires to preserve open
space, maintain community charaeter, and ensure adequate public facilities.
Management of growth does not mean curtailing it, but rather structuring it to ensure that it is not
haphazard and supports broader planning objectives. As of 2000, Rohnert Park used several
conventional growth management tools, including zoning and subdivision regulations and
development impact fees. Several other Sonoma County cities have some form of additional growth

The o','erall amount and locaticn cf gro'*'th is addressed in the land use policies of this elernent (see
Sections 2.3 and 2.4). This section outlines the framework to phase and pace growth so as to
minimize its environmental, social, ancl fiscal impacts, ancl ensure concurrency between growth
and infrastructure and services. It also outlines policies relating to City boundaries and annexation,

INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES
The City    will coordinate with State and County agencies for transportation improvements and water
and wastewater services. Caltrans is responsible for improvements to US 101, and the Sonoma
County Department of Public Works is currently responsible for Petaluma Hill Road and other
county roads. The Sonoma County Water Agency supplies water to the city from the Russian River,
and the City of Santa Rosa manages the Subregional Wastewater Disposal System (see Chapter 5:
Open Space, Parks, and Public Facilities Element).
GOALS: GROWTH MANAGEMENT
GM-A       Recognize the availability of housing as a vital issue of statewide importance. Cooperate with
           other local govemments and the State in addressing regional housing needs, and balance regional
           and State considerations with the community's interest in preserving Rohnert Park's quiet, safe,
           small-town feeling and desire for carefully planned and managed growth.3
          Housing is addressed in greater detail in the Housing Element.
     See ktnd  Use Alternatives and Preferred   Plan; May 1999;page3:.
     "Based on the input at these forums,   it was clear that people don't neatly fit into pre-conceived categories; very few are
     either vehemently "pro- or anti-growth". Most people understand the inevitability of some growth, however, the great
     majority favor sloq managed growth that is carefully planned in ways that:
        o Maintains a diverse, quiet, safe, small-town, family-friendly feel; ..."

                                                      Chapter 2: Land Use and Growth Management
 GM-B     Undertake efforts to facilitate provision of housing affordable to low- and very-low income
          households by exempting affordable housing from any numerical "trigger cap" restrictions.
          Because regional housing needs are escalating the cost ofhousing, it is vital that provision
          of affordable housing remains a priority   þr   the City. This policy also clarifies that while
          affordable housingprojects are exemptfrom "trigger caps", they are still subject to the
          other growth management provisions.
GM-C Ensure that growth is paced to achieve General Plan buildout over a 2}-year period,
         representing an annual average population growth rate ofone percent.
GM-D Maintain a balance of land uses and avanety of housing           types over time.
GM-E Promote contiguous urban development and maintain a compact form over                    successive
         stages of the city's development.
GM-F     Ensure all new development provides necessary public facilities to support the development.
GM-G Require all urban development in the Rohnert Park Planning Area to be
         located within the Urban Growth Boundary; prohibit urban development outside
         the Urban Growth Boundary.
GM-H Minimize         the impacts-physical, visual, and  fiscal-of growth    and annexation on existing
        homes and businesses.
POLICIES: GROWTH MANAGEMENT
For policies related to the Community Sepørators, see Chapter 6: Conservation.
GM-l    Prepare and adopt a Growth Management Ordinance that implements policies in this Element.
        The Growth Management Ordinance shall establish a detailed program that implements the
        various policies in this element. Very-low and low-income housing shall be exempted from
        the numerical limitation provisions of the ordinance.
Phasingand Pace of Development
GM-2 A Twenty-Year (Year 2020)            IJrban Growth Boundary is established in accordance with
        ballot Measure N (2000) as follows:
        Section    l. Purpose and Findinss.
        1.1       This measure reaffirms and readopts the City of Rohnert Park's commitment to
                  planned growth through the designation of an urban growth boundary. This
                  measure establishes the City of Rohnert Park's Urban Growth Boundary ("UGB")
                  as depicted on the map shown in Figures 2.2-l and2.5-2 as the area within which
                  the City generally projects that development will occur within a specified period.
                  Until June 30,2020, the UGB shall be changed only by a vote of the people, except
                                                                                                    2-43

Rohnert Park General Plan
                in certain  circumstances and according    to specific procedures set forth in this
               measure.
       t.2     bncouraging a cohesive pattern of urbanization. Adoption of a UGB will
               encourägö a cohesive pattcnr of urbanizatiun by ( 1) pruuruting cffiuiunt antl urtlcr{y
               growth patterns; (2) supporting stability and certainty in long term planning by
               advancing the concept of planned growth; and (3) ensuring that lands outside the
               UGB are not prematurely or unnecessarily converted to urban uses.
       1.3     Protecting what is unique about Rohnert Park. The City of Rohnert Park is
               bordered to the east and to the west by unincorporated lands that are dominated by
               hills, farms, and fields. This unincorporated landscape is enjoyed by the persons
               who work and live in Rohnert Park and forms a part of the environment of Rohnert
               Park even though it is outside the city limits. Adoption of a UGB will preserve and
               protect this aspect of Rohnert Park by requiring urbanization to stop where the
               unincorporated landscape begins.
       1.4     This General Plan Amendment is not intended to prevent the City from meeting its
               obligation uncler state housing or zoning ancl planning law, The City's Housing
               Element, including the sites identified therein for housing, and the programs and

                                                                                                  " ^^'
               allow the City of Rohnert Park to meet its obligations for thc preservation,
               improvement, and development of housing. This measure establishing a UGB is
               consistent with the objectives of the City's Housing Element and with the other
               mandatory elements of the City's General Plan. It is fully expected that the policies
               and programs in the City's Housing Element, including the sites identified therein
               for housing, will allow the City of Rohnert Park to meet the requirements of State
               law to provide housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community.
               This measure allows the City Council to bring land into the UGB without a public
               vote for very low and low income housing only, in recognition of the fact that
               sometimes it is necessary for a local govcrnmcnt to takc spccial stcps to providc
               opportunities for very low and low income housing.
      1.5      The UGB outlines the area within which the City generally projects that
               development will occur within the next twenty years. However, the General Plan
               of the City of Rohnert Park Growth Management Policies prohibit growth from
               commencing, if the necessary public facilities - streets, water, wastewater, solid
              waste, and parks - are not in place when the growth is completed. In addition, the
               General Plan of the City of Rohnert Park Specihc Plan and Plarured Development
              Policies require that new growth will not be permitted unless and until the specific
              plan or planned development for the area in which the growth is proposed, has
              been adopted.
      Section 2. Establishins the Urban Growth Boundary
      The following policies shall apply to the Urban Growth Boundary:
      2.1     No urban development shall be permitted beyond the Urban Growth Boundary
2-44

       "lJrban development" shall mean development requiring one or more basic
       municipal services including, but not limited to, water service, sewer, improved
       storm drainage facilities, fire hydrants and other physical public facilities and
       services; provided, however, that open space uses, parks, agricultural uses,
       community fields and golf courses beyond the Urban Growth Boundary that are
       provided with municipal or public services, shall not be defined as "urban
       development."
2.2    The Urban Growth Boundary shall be in effect until June 30,2020
2.3    The Urban Growth Boundary may be amended only by a vote of the people or as
      provided for in Section 2.4.                                              (Rev. I l/00)
2.4   The Urban Growth Boundary may be amended by a majority vote (three
      affirmative votes) of the City Council under the following circumstances:
2.4.1 Affordable Housing. To comply with state law regarding the provision of housing
      for low and verylow income families, the City Council may amend the Urban
      Growth Boundary in order to include within the UGB, lands to be developed
      primarily (51%) for low and very-low income families provided, however:
      (a) An amendment to the UGB pursuant to this Section 2.4.1may not be made
           earlier than January 1, 2015;
      (b) No more than 10 acres may be brought into the UGB in any calendar year;
      (c) If in arry year, fewer than 10 acres are brought within the UGB, then the
           unused increment, up to a maximum of 5 acres, may be brought within the
           UGB in a subsequent year;
      (d) Such amendment may be adopted only if the City Council makes each of the
           following findings:
           (i)  That the land is immediately adjacent to comparably developed areas;
           (ii) That there is no existing residentially designated land available within
                the UGB that can feasibly accommodate the proposed development;
           (iii) That it is not reasonably        feasible to accommodate the proposed
                development by redesignating lands within the UGB for housing;
          (iv) That there has been an application submitted to provide housing
                primarily for low and very-low income families, and the applicant          has
                provided substantial evidence that sufficient and adequate capacity is
                available in all city services and facilities, all school district facilities,
                and any other relevant public agency facilities, to accommodate the
                proposed development.
                                                                                               2-45

                    (v) That the application to provide    housing primarily for low and very-low
                        income families is consistent with GM-4 in General Plan 2000.
               -Þor purposes of this section, the concept of "feasibility" shall include
               consitleratiurs of lurket feasil-rility, envit'otuttetttal feasibility, and other rules and

       2.5     This General Plan Amendment is not intended, and shall not be applied or
               construed, to authorize the City to exercise its powers in a manner which will take
               private property for public use without the payment of just compensation. This
               General Plan Amendment will be interpreted, applied and implemented so as to
               accomplish its purposes to the maximum permissible extent, by all constitutional
               means. If the application of this General Plan Amendment to a specific property
               would take private property for public use without the payment of just
               compcnsation ("taking"), then the City Council may take any action necessary to
               avoid a taking.

       Section 3. Amending the General Pl¿m to Manage Growth withirr thc Urt¡an Growth
       Boundary
       3.1    The UGB establishes the area within which urban development will be contained
              until the year 2020. This limitation restricts development to lands within the
              UGB. Such restriction is necessary to implement and to be consistent with the
               following community goals:
       3.1.1  Efficient and orderly growth patterns.
       3.1.2 A well-designed mix of residential,         commercial, business park, and open space
              uses, featuring a pedestrian-oriented community focal point with a small town,
              village-like character.
       3.1.3   Stability and certainty in long term planning through planned growth.
       3.1.4  Adequate and efficient delivery of public services and facilities

                                                   Chapter 2: Land Use and Growth Management
      In order to manage development within the UGB in a manner that is consistent with these
      community goals, a growth management program shall be adopted that includes each of
      the following components:
      3.2.1     An annual standard to determine the number of residential development approvals
                that are consistent with the goals and policies of the City's General Plan.
      3.2.2     A  requirement to implement the growth management program, including the
                annual standard in a manner that is consistent with the goals, objectives,
                obligations and policies of the City's Land Use and Housing Elements.
      3.2.3    An average approximate one percent (Io/o) amual population growth rate
     3.2.4     An annual review by the City Council to determine the consistency of each of the
               components of the growth management program with the goals, plans, and policies
               of the General Plan and State housing, planning, and zoning law.
     3.2.5 A requirement to coordinate         the development in each of the specific plan and
               plarured development areas with the growth management ordinance,        if applicable.
     Housing that is affordable to very low and low income households shall be exempt from
     the growth management progËm.
GM-3 Establish a"tngger cap" on annual residential development approvals with the following
     characteristics, in order to maintain an average development pace of 225 housing units per
     year for any three-year period:
          a    If  the combined number of residential development approvals in any two
               successive calendar years exceeds 560 housing units, and ifthe development pace
               fo¡ the preceding three-year period has exceeded an average of 225 housing units
               per year, then a cap on development on the following calendar year will be
               established ("tri gger cap") ;
              Based on an average approximate population growth rate of l%q General Plan buildout
               would permit an addition of approximately 4,450 housinguniß over a 2}-year period, or
              an average of approximately 225 hotxing units per year. The figure 560 represents 125
              percent of the two-year average growth of 450 (225 x 2) housinguniß.
          a   The "triggeÍ cap" may be adjusted up or down a maximum of ten (10) percent by
              the City Council on an annual basis (see GM-4) to accommodate changes in land
              use program assumptions (for example, vacancy rate factors and household size).
          a   The "trigger cap" will remain in effect as long as needed to ensure that housing
              approvals in any consecutive three-year period does not exceed atotal of675 (or
              aî average of 225 per year);
          a   Housing that is affordable to low- and very-low income households shall not be
              included in the total housing counts when the trigger cap is in place; and
                                                                                                 2-47

                    two or more years of no residential approvals.
         The "trigger cep" will help ensure predictahle growth. Like anru.tal growth caps, it will
         help average out gyowth-from year to year, but will allow both the City and the developers

       the City Council annual policy review (GM-4), to develop a site over a multi-year period.
       Do not enter into any development agreement for a project until a specific plan or planned
       development has been prepared and adopted by the City.
       This would permit, but not require, the City to enter into development agreements. Any
       proposed development agreement shall be consistent with the General Plan, any other
       relevant plans, policies, programs, regulations, and standards.
GM-8   For those residential development approvals that do not require the approval of a tentative
       subdivision map, or otherwise not vested through a development agreement with the City,
       approvals shall expire after a24-month period, unless extended for special circumstances
       by the City Council.

 Adequate Public Facilities
 GM-g    Require that each specific plan and planned development include, or be subject to, a
         Public Facilities Financing Plan that explains how streets, water, wastewater, solid waste,
         and parks, all meeting City standards, will be provided to the project. The Plan must
         demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the City Manager, based upon criteria developed in the
         Growth Management Ordinance, that completion of all necessary public facilities
         concurrently with completion of the specific plan or planned development is
         economically, physically, and legally feasible.
 GM-10 Require that economic, physical and legal feasibility (Policy GM-9) include the method
         of financing or otherwise paying for the facilities and the plan for receiving approval of
         all regulatory agencies. A Public Facilities Plan that provides for the project's fair share
         of the financing for the necessary public facilities, but does not provide for the
        completion of the public facilities prior to completion of the development due to lack of
        contribution by other responsible parties, will be deemed complete but will not be
        approved as part of development project approval unless the exceptions included in GM-
         1l or GM-12 apply.
GM-l1 Allow, only with the approval of the City Council, some required public facilities (GM-9)
        to be deferred for a specific time period by adopting a Statement of Public Policy
        Considerations. The Statement of Public Policy Considerations shall include findings that
        specific and offsetting community goals and objectives are achieved by the project that
       balance not meeting the goal of providing necessary public facilities concurrently with
       development and shall specifu        a time period in which the improvements must           be
       completed. Such findings shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record of the
       public hearing.
GM-12 As provided in GM-10, the City Council may allow an exception to the requirement that
       all public facilities must be provided prior to completion of the development for
       streets/highways/intersections only, for projects subject to a development agreement if it
       can be demonstrated that although adequate streelhighway/intersections are unable to be
       provided for the development at the time occupancy is projected, such facilities will be
       provided within two years of the time occupancy is projected. The determination that
       such facilities will be provided within two years of the time occupancy is projected shall
      be based upon the approved Public Facilities Financing Plans submitted by other projects
      that contribute to the need for the street/highway/intersection improvement.
GM-13 Require that new development maintain parkways, creeksides, and open spaces that are
      part of the development or are required to support it, and consider establishing multi-
      pulpose assessment districts or other financing mechanism in order to assign the cost of
      infrastructure improvements equitably to benefi ting sites.
      Assessment districts include     all property that would receive a special benefit from a
      capital improvement and then imposes assessments on euch parcel of property. The
      amount of the assessment reflects the cost of the proportional special benefit conferred
      on the parcel.
                                                                                                 z-51
  Rohnert Park General Plan
          The City already uses assessment districts in certøin areas þr roadway improvements, as
          along Redwood Drive. Assessment districts can be considered not onllt for roødwalt
          improvements, but also þr sewer and water line improvements, and other necessary

 GM-15 Prepare, adopt, and implement a Capital Improvement Program (CIP), based on
        established performance standards, to provide a framework to undertake necessary
        citywide public facility improvements. Ensure that the program reflccts expeutetl growth
        and estimated cost of improvements.
        As of 1999, the City did not hqve a CIP, but had considered estqbiishing a program in
        order to pri.ori.tize improvement project,r and firnd.i.ng. The City need,r hoth a.
        progrømming time horizon (swch as Jìve or seven years) qs well as an update cycle (such
        as every yeør or two years). Many cities work with a.five-year CIP that is updated every
        year or two years. The Sonoma County Transportalion Authority (SCfÐ uses u seven-
        year plønning horizon and two-year update cycle for its CIP, which is used by the
        Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) to prepqre the Regional Transportøtion
        Plan (RTP) and Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). The CIP's estimøte of
       future growth shall take into øccount development trends and projects in the development
       pipeline "trigger cap" and other growth manøgement provisions.
Land Use Balance
GM-16   As part of preparation and approval of specific plans and any other implementing
        ordinances, regulations and development agreements, and allocation of development
        entitlements for areas of new development, balance non-residential development with
       residential development over the different phases and require that the contemplated
       balance ofhousing fypes is attained at buildout.
        The land use program                   þr each area, including housing units by density range, is
       included in Section 2.4.

  Annexation
  GM-17 Consider ínitiating annexation of Canon Manor Specific Plan A¡ea only          if the following
         conditions are met:
              a    Adequate public facilities, meeting Rohnert Park's Rural Estate Residential
                   standards established for the area, established either separately or as a part ofthe
                   Specific Plan, are installed prior to annexation, or a program do so, with secure
                   funding sources, is established to the City's satisfaction;
              ¡   No facility improvement costs are borne by the City of Rohnert Park; and
              ¡   All land in Canon Manor is included in the annexation.
                  Canon Manor shall be deemed to have provided the adequate public facilities
                  when øll sites within Canon Manor meet estøblished standards for water,
                  wastewater, streets, lighting, fire hydrants, and other public focilities and
                  services.
 GM-18 Explore the feasibility of annexation of the Sonoma State University campus.
        Land uses and growth qreas in the Generøl Plan have been designøted to foster a close
        relationship between the City qnd SSU. Implementation of the Generøl Plan should result
        in close physical integration of the campus with the Ciþ's neighborhoods; extension of
        City limits to reflect the extent of contíguous urban limits is only nqtural. The City
        currently provides wøter and wastewater to the campw.
        SSU remqins perhaps the only campus in the Caliþrnia State University system that ß
        not ø part of the surrounding community. Annexqtion will not alter the University's
        øbility to pursue its development efforts; however, the City would moderøtely beneJìt by
        getting a small share of the existing taxes on retail sales at the campus.
Inter-Agency CoordÍnation
GM-19 Work with Sonoma State University to establish a planning group to coordinate              access
       and development.
       Coordination will become increasingly important as urban development embrøces the
       campus' northern edge. The location of campus entryways needs to be coordinøted with
       the City's nearby access improvements, including new streets, roadway and intersection
       improvements, parks, pedestrian wølkwøys, bicycle routes. Also, long-rønge planning
       and development on the SSU campus, including potential expansion of the SSU campu¡
       should be coordinated with land use policíes and development in ødjacent qreas. The
       timing of on-cømpus housing development, if any, also needs to be coordinøted with
       adj acent off cømpus housing development.
GM-20 Work with Sonoma County to ensure that all land in the Planning Area outside Rohnen
       Park's Urban Growth Boundary is preserved as open space.
                                                                                                   2-53

  Rohnert Park General Plan
  GM-21 Request that the County allow City review and comment on development proposals
         submitted to the County on unincorporated lantl in thc Rulurert Park Plarurirrg Alea.
  GM-22 Encourage Santa Rosa       to  designate land within the lMilfred Channel Community
         Separator and adjacent to it as open space.
         Santa Rosa's current General Plan (in 1999) permits development of land within the
        separator to the north of Wilfred Channel and up to approximately one mile north, as
         well as the "triangle" immediately north of the channel between the Northern PaciJìc
        Railroad and US I0I, with Very Low Density Residential uses (up to two housing units
        per acre).
 GM-23 Continue    joint city / county efforts, such as the Policy-Makers Working Group, to
        address the Community Separator mitigation issue.
 Implementation Monitoring
 GM-24 Undertake periodic review to monitor General Plan implementation, with the first review
        scheduled to occur within thrcc ycars of Plan atloption.
        The components of the revieu¡ ore spelled out in detail on page   I-13. Thìs reví.ew, which
        is ín addition to the annual report required by the State, should incorporate use of
        Performance Indicators - such as øverage trip time, total vehicle hours trøveled,
       jobs/housing balance, park spøce per resident.

 3        Community Design
 This Element includes goals and policies aimed at protecting and enhancing Rohnert Park's
physical and visual character. Community design issues are addressed at citywide, neighborhood,
and sheet scales. While reinforoing the positive athibutes of Rohnert Park's urban structure--
such as a compact form and well-defined neighborhoods-the Element seeks to foster creation of
distinctive centers to enhance the city's identity, and promote pedestrian and community
orientation of new development.
The Element also includes policies for increasing neighborhood connectivity and enhancing the
visual quality of urban edges. It includes a comprehensive set of measures to preserve the scenic
qualities and views from corridors, including goals and policies pertaining to setbacks, street and
block patterns in areas of new development, landscaping, streetscapes, and building massing.

 local streets form loops or cul de sacs, limiting physical and visual connections between
 neighborhoods. There is not a great level of distinction-in terms of layout, development
patterns, lot sizes, and building intensitics-bctween various neighborhoods.
 Fucal Fuittts
With the exception of Sonoma State University (SSU), located outside the City limits, and a
scattering of commercial and community facilities, Rohnert Park has few citywide focal points, In
addition, being a relatively young city, Rohnert Park has no traditional pedestrian-oriented center,
as in other older cities such as Petaluma, Sonoma, or Santa Rosa. The area around the Rohnert
Park Expressway-Commerce Boulevard intersection, where a majority of the city's neighborhood
retail development is clustered, is the city's major activity center.
VIEWS
Ridgelines
The eastern ridgelines constitute a prominent feature of the Rohnert Park landscape. Two peaks
are prominent - Taylor Mountain, with an elevation of about 1,400 t'eet, and Sonoma Mountain
with an elevation of 2,300 feet. Due to the height of the ridges and the low building heights
throughout the city (generally two stories or lower), the eastern ridges are visible from many
streets, parks, and open spaces, as well as buildings, throughout Rohnert Park fudgelines are
depicted in Figure 3.1-1.

    Often the view corridors toward the ridgelines are fftimed by the natural landscape - such as
    along the creek beds. Only along East Cotati Avenue, which forms the southern edge of the SSU
    campus, cioes a straight iine of trees create a more formal view corridor. Other east-west streets
    that terminate at Petaluma Hill Road-including the Rohnert Park Expressway, Keiser Avenue,
    Valley House Drive, and streets in Canon Manor-offer panoramic views of the ridgelines.

    any area to the east of Petaluma Hill Road, development in the area will continue to be governed

  but because the topography in the area is essentially flat, these views are not as dramatic.
  The County has designated IIS 101 and Petaluma Hill Road as scenic corriclors. While US 101-
  in almost its entire stretch through Rohnert Park-is lined with redwoods resulting in limited
  distant viervs, Petaluma Hill Road does provide distant vierve. At the southern end of the Planning
  Area boundary (near Railroad Avenue), Petaluma Hill Road is lined by open space and farms on
  both the eastern and westem sides. Stands of trees along Canon Manor block some views, and the
  view corridor is considerably narrowed along SSU, with tall eucalyptus trees along the westem
  edge of the street. The views open up dramatically north of the campus, and from Rohnert Park
  Expressway northward, the views are again panoramic.
  CITYEDGES
 Rohnert Park shares much of its western boundary-between Rohnert Park Expressway and
 Railroad Avenue-with Cotati. While about half the length of the shared boundary between the
 fwo cities is demarcated by the Laguna de Santa Rosa Flood Control Channel, the remaining
 extent of the boundary is visually amorphous. The city's northern edge, along Wilfred Channel, is
 a sfraight-line edge, with homes on the south and the Community Separator to the north.
 Opportunities to alter the character of these edges are limited. Therefore, the discussion here
focuses on the city's eastside and the northwest, where the potential for defining edge character
exlsts.
East and Southeast
The area north of the SSU has allractive open vistas from streets such as Petaluma Hill Road and
Snyder Lane. The scale of these views is dramatic, as the foreground is quite extensive, and trees,

                                                                        Chapter 3: Community Design
   along the creeks and the eastem edge of the built city, frame many of the views. Because this area
   is targeted for development in the General Plan, opporlunity to shape the new urban edge along
   Petaluma   Hill Road is present.
   South of SSU, Canon Manor has been partially developed as rural residential on half-acre to 2-
   acre lots. Canon Manor serves as a transition between the more intensive development west of
   Bodway Parlcaray and the open space and agriculfural uses east of Petaluma Hill Road. Some crop
   sales stands can be seen along Petaluma Hill Road near the intersection with East Cotati Avenue.
   Canon Manor is less formally landscaped than the adjacent SSU campus, with the exception of
  tall stands of eucalyptuses that line East Cotati Avenue.
  Northwest
  ln contrast to the eastside, open space lands in the northwest are cultivated and used for pasture.
  The Laguna de Santa Rosa Flood Control Channel includes riparian vegetation and defines the
  southem edge of irrigated cropland. Agrícultural fields can be seen from adjacent developed
 parcels within the City limits. Older, scattered rural residential uses along unimproved roads are
 found west of the commercial buildings in the Wal-Mart Center along Redwood Drive. These
 rural residential areas have visible stands of trses.
 The lndustrial Park abuts the city's western edge. The developed, suburban character of the park,
 with landscaped setbacks and regularly spaced trees, is in marked contrast to the adjacent rural
 areas. However, because of the several vacant sites along Business Park Drive, large setbacks,
 and extensive landscaping, the city's \Mestern edge is not as hard as the eastern edge. The western
 edge of the Rancho Verde mobile home park is separated and screened from adjacent rural areas
 by tall stands of trees, an open channel, and a solid wall. The regional commercial uses along
 Redwood Drive are oriented to US 101 and have a hard-edge blank wall along their western edge,
 adjacenf to open space areas.

  POLICIES: URBAN FORM, VIEWS, AND EDGES
  Urban Form and Struchrre
  CD.1   As part of preparation of specific plans, ordinances, capital improvements programs,
         design of public buildings, and other measures, ensure that the University District and the
         Cify Center are developed as citywide destinations and with a pedestrian orientation.
         Because these centers are       part of the General Plan Diagram and because detailed
         implementuliun in llrcse ureus will b¿ facilitated by urea ,nú specific plans, ntore
         detaíled policies in this element øre not essentíal. However, thís policy serves to
         recognize the role ofthese two centers in the urban structure sought to be created by this
         General Phtn.

        elements that provide identity to the city and the neighborhoods and result in the creation
        of diverse and distinctive places.
        Many of these elements, strch as open spaces and streets, are addressed in other policies
        in the General Plan. However, some salient features and elements are called out here
        becuuse lhey ure criticul tu þstering the desired identíty. Key urban þnn elentenîs are

                   flttíversíryt cfimpus: Thc proposed linear parlcway begins within the Sonoma
                   State Campus and continues north to Keiser Avenue. This parkway would
                  provide strong north-south connections to a bikeway system that now primarily
                  runs east to west along the existing creeks and channels, and would create a
                  public space within the proposed neighborhoods that would serve as an activity
                  center.
             o    fnturconnected network of streets. New collector connections are shown on the
                  General Plan Diagram at the northern portion of Snyder Lane, along the
                  extension of Eleanor Avenue, and at the eastem section of Rokrnert Park
                  Expressway. A1so, a minor collector is suggested to provide a north-south
                  corìnection through the proposed area along the linear parkway. The objective of
                  these st¡eet corinections is to provide the necessary connections for automobiles
                  without compromising pedestrian comfort and quality of the neighborhoods.
                  Whe¡e appropriate, existing streets should be extended into new developments to
                  provide for a more extended and continuous street system. More information on
                  standards for streets can be found in Chapter 4: Transportation.

           o    Extensíon of Creeksíde Greenwøy: The existing paths along creeks and channels
                provide important connections for bicyclists and pedestrians throughout Rohnert
                Park and also provide areas for recreation. These bikeways should be extended
                through the newly developed areas to continue to provide the amenity and strong
                pedestrian connections. The following guidelines should be used in extending the
                greenways:
                    Frequent entrances should be provided to incre¿¡fie access to bikeways;
                    A buffer should be provided between adjacent seryice areas and the bikeway;
                    If a wall is created between the bikeway, and adjacent property,        it should be
                    appropriate in size and material; and
                    Wherever possible, development should be oriented towards bikeways in order to
                    activate the space.
CD-3  Desigrrate gateway points at major entrances to the city, and prioritize their design and
      implementation through the City's Capital Improvements Program. Use landscaping,
      signs, lighting, and other'streetscape design techniques along streets to announce the
      gateway, and establish development regulations to provide visual emphasis to the
      gateway.
     Potential gateway points ìnclude, but are not limited to: Rohnert Park Expressway at
     Petaluma    Hill Road, at Commerce Boulevørd, and qt Hinebaugh Creek; Snyder Lane on
     the north síde of the "G" section neighborhood; and East Cotqti Avenue at Petaluma Hill
     Road and at the Cotati border.
     Street trees, welcome signs, decorative lighting, banners, archways ønd other streetscøpe
     design elements can be used þr the gateway. In addition, adjacent development should
     be required to orient building entrances to the gateway ønd provide pedestriøn amenities,
     such øs sídewalks ønd walla,vay lighting, while limiting adjacent parking lots.
                                                                                                    3-7

 CD.4      Desigrrate Petaluma   Hill Road  as a scenic corridor throughout its stretch along Rohnert Park
 CD-5      Ensure that any landscape heatment along Petaluma           Hill Road    does not obstruct views
          of the eastern ridgelines from the street.
          Because there are few trees along Petøluma          Hill Road north of SSU, the street provides
          uninterrupted views of the eastern and northern rídgelines. This visual quality of the
          street should be maintained by discouraging street planting on the edstern edge of the
          street, except in the general areas ofthe creeks.
CD-6     As part of any development along Petaluma Hill Road, ensure planting, if any, does not
         obstruct views of the ridges from the city's eastem neighborhoods. In no case shall hees
         or shrubs that exceed 25 feet in height upon mafurity be used.
        A    maximurn height       of 25 feet will permit views of the ridgelines above 1,000-þot
         elevation from a horizontal distance of about 1,000 feet from the open space edge.               If
         trees are taller, views of the ridgelines from the eastern neighborhoods will be dßrupted.
        Site speci/ìc characteristics møy necessitate heights shorter than 25 feet or no planting at
        all to ensure that views are preserved.
CD-7    Minimize disruption of existing views by new development.
        .     Along SnyderLane:
                   Provide an approximately 32-foot wide linear park/parkway (within the currentþ
                   acquired right-oÊway, which is not needed for street parking; see Chapter 4:
                   Transportation) along the eastem edge of Snyder Lane as a neighborhood amenity and
                   to provide primarily rurobstructed views of the ridgeline (see Figure 3J-Q;
                   Set back all development on the eastside at least 20 feet from the edge of the linear
                   parkuiay (that is, approximately 52 feet from the sfeet curb). Establish upper-story
                   step-back requirenrents for developrnent adjacent to the parkway as part of lhe Zoning
                   Ordinance.
       .      Along the 1999 City limits, in the area between Creekside Middle School and Rancho
              Cotati Senior High School, set back new structures at least 60 feet away from the edge of
              existing residential-use parcels immediately adjacent to the west.
       ¡     Maintain a 100-foot setback between the "G" section and any new development
             located south   ofit.
       .     Along Petaluma         Hill Road, north of Valley House Drive, require any new
             development on the western side of the street to be set back at least 50 feet from the
             edge of the street right-oÊway.
             Figure 3.1-3 shows an ilhntrative simulation of new development along Snyder Lane.        See

 CD-9       Ensure that development intensities provide adequate transition from urban to open space
            uses on the city's eastside, as indicated on the General Plan Diagram.
            Because much of the city's western edge will remqin unaltered as a result of this General
            Plan, a similar transition in intensities is not contemplated in the northwest area.
 CD-10 As part of implementing plans and programs, permit clustering of Estate Residential
            development, with resultant pockets of open space along the city's eastem eclge.
            The Zoning Ordinance shall establish a minimum lot size         for  clustered Estate Residential
            development.
 CD-l   l  Require all development along ttre city's eastem edge to plært tees and othervegetation along

           ,Se.e al,so Policy CD-S     pertaining to height o.fvegetation along Petaluma Hill Road.
 CD-12 As part           of the Zoning Ordinance,         establish setback requirements     for  development
           adjacent to open space buffers along city edges.
           This setback should be the         final step in the transitioning character between       developed

          a      Prohibiting the use of solid walls along these edges (i.e., fences must be visually
                 permeable);

  3.2       NEIGHBORHOODS AND FOCUS AREAS
  While polieies related to views and edges have implications that extend beyond inclividual
 neighborhoods, this section addresses the design and character at a neighborhood scale. Focused
 policies for certain areas (including specific plan areas) are also included.
 NEIGHBORHOODS
 Neighborhoods are Rohnert Park's building blocks. Rohnert Park's neighborhood structure has
 been, in many cases, characteized by homes clustered around a school and a park. Neighborhood
 areas are show.n in Figrre 3.2-1. Key aspeets of Rohnert Park's neighborhood structure include:
 a     (Jse Pattern. While Rohnert Park has a defined neighborhood development pattern, design of
       neighborhoods to be responsive to the context-such as by creating greenways that traverse
      neighborhoods, locating parks adjacent to creeks, and locating uses and acitivities in
      relationship to institutions such as SSU and physical conditions such as urban edges-can
      help in creating neighborhoods that are responsive to the landseape and lead to greater
      identity and diversity.

      has the grcatest number of through streets, blocks, and access points. It is charactenzedby
      long internal blocks, connecting local streets, and few cul-dc-sacs, complcmcnted by mature
      trees and larrdscaped front yards, making it easy and comfortable to bike or walk. Numerous
      access points provide connections            to adjacent areas.                    In         subsequently developed
      neighborhoods, fewer street connections and intersections, more cul de sacs, and larger
      blocks make it difficult to reach destinations via walking or biking.
a     Canon Manor-a County subdivision originally platted in the 1950s-has rural residential
      development with rectilinear streets, very large blocks, and large lots, in contrast to Rohnert
      Park's curvilinear streets and cul-de-sacs.
a     Sonoma Mountain Village       - a sustainable comrnunity in the southeast area of the City, is
      subject to "smart growth" development requirements which may differ substantially from the
     street-and-block pattern of neighborhoods in other areas in the City. Sonoma Mountain
     Village is typified by pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly elements, with street widths that may
     differ from standard City streets. Development is governed by a form-based code which
     seeks to encouraged mixed use development.
a    Streeß. Rohnert Park has a hierarchical system of streets that separates high-speed through
      traffic (along arterials and collectors) from low-speed local trafïic (along local streets).
      Chapter 4: Transportation provides a detailed description of the city's street pattern and
     outlines roadway classifications. Safety, convenience, and comfort for pedestrians and
     bicycles are aÍL important issue for Rohnert Park residents in 1999.
a    Streets in Rohnert Park have a distinctive character. Major arterials such as the Rohnert Park
     Expressway as well as recent residential arterials such as Snyder Lane have a planted median
     strip and flanking greenways with pedestrian paths and bikeways. Such streets contribute to
     the city's image as a place where residential neighborhoods are integrated with parks and

 FOCUS AREAS
 In addition to policies that apply across the city, this section of the General Plan includes policies
 targeted at design issues specific to certain parts of the city. These are:
          o   University District;
          .   City Center;
          ¡   Central Rohnert Park
          o   Northeast Area;
          o   Northwest Specific Plan Area;
          ¡   Sonoma Mountain Village;
          r   Stadium Area; and
          ¡   Southeast Area.
GOALS: NEIGHBORHOODS AND FOCUS AREAS
CD-G     Encourage development       of diverse and distinctive neighborhoods that build on the
         patterns ofthe natural landscape and are responsive in their location and context.
         Thís General Plan encourages developrnent of neighborhoods to be responsive to their
         locøtion and context, rather than being based on a uniþrm designþrmula.
CD-H Promote a mix         of  uses and   a variety of housing types and sizes within residential
         neighborhoods.
         The General PIan Diagram establishes a mix of uses within areas of new developrnent
         and promotes a mix of housing types by allowing a range of residential densities within
         the same areas. Thís goal and the subsequent policies build on the overall direction
         established in the diagram.
CD-I     Ensure that neighborhood streets provide an attractive physical environment for
         motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists.
CD-J     Maintain the character of existing neighborhoods while undertaking streetscape and
         signage improvements in selected areas.
CD-K Support improvements to the pedestrian orientation within Central Rohnert Park.
CD.L    Create a consistent character and identity for Central Rohnert Park      - particularly in area
        defined as Downtown.
CD-M    Ensure the quality of new development within Central Rohnert Park.

CD-16 Require neighborhood design-including components such as land use, development
        intensity, and street layouts-to be responsive to natural and institutional elements,
        including:
             c    Creeks. Ensure adequate access      by locating   streets and paths adjacent to
                 creekways, ancl integrate parks anrl open space with creekways;
             o    Urban edges. Ensure ffansition liom urban intensities to open space; and
             o   Integration with the surroundings. Promote connections with adjacent
                 neighborhoods by integrating street networks, and responding to existing
                 landscape and visual treatments.
CD-17  Allow townhomes and multifamily dwellings to be integrated with single-family
       residences.
        These buildings should be in character with the surrounding homes          in massing, scale,
       and orientation. See Figure 3.2-3 for illustrations of housing types.
CD-l8  Prepare a design standards checklist for design reviews.
        Thi,ç checklist would provide a simple means for evaluating proposals.
Street/Building Relationship
CD-19 As part of updating the City's zoning regulations or applicable specific plans, adopt
       standards to foster pedestrian orientation of new development in Mixed-Use and
       Neighborhood Commercial areas by:
             o   Developing a coherent set of standards for buildings, such that building facades
                 and entrances define the streetscape and promote street activity;
             ¡   Maintaining volumetric building standards that require buildings to be located at
                 the street by establishing maximum setback or "build-to lines", with appropriate
                 step-backs for upper stories;
             o   Ensuring that primary entrances of buildings face the street;
             o   Requiring that parking is provided in the interior of the block, screened by the
                 building or landscaping;
             r   Requiring awnings and canopies for pedestrian comfort, where appropriate; and
             ¡   Ustablishing building transparency from sidewalks.
CD-20 Encourage buildings to foster a sense of place by providing transitions between the street
       and building, front setback variation for residential development, and building
       articulation and massing, as part of development standards or any design guidelines that
       may be prepared.
       Elements such as porches, bay windows, and landscaping should be designed to create a
       transition between public and private spaces. When porches are used, they should be
       designed as a usable outdoor space.

 Rohnert Park General Plan
  CD-21 Minimize the visual dominance of garûges by rnaintaining appropriate development
         standards in the City's zoning and subdivision regulations and/or design guidelines.
         Potential strategies that can be considered as part of the City's Zoning Ordinance
         include:
              o    timiting the front width of a house that can be occupied with         a garage to be no
                  more that one-half the building width;
              o   Encouraging location of the garages towards the back of properties;
              .   Requirlng garages to be setback from the front edge ofhouse;
              ¡   Use of an additional setback  if more than a two-car      garage entrance is needed;
              r   Orienting garage doors 90 degrees lrom the street;
              .   Allowing implementation of an alley system in new development, with              garages
                  accessed from the rear; and
              r   Incorporatirrg design elements on the second level above the garages such as bay
                 windows or balconies that break down the scale of the garage.
 CD-22 Provitle streets at the edges of each phase of developurent in order to provide flexibility
        and better continuity for later phases.
CD-23 Establish design guidelines for Estate Residential uses to ensure new buildings are
        consistent with surrounding areas.
        The City's design guidelines shall establish provisions for Estate Residential to ensure
        that building mass will be compatible with suruounding transitional land uses to soften
        City edges and protect viewsheds.
Streets and Street Network
CD-24 Ensure that the Subdivision Regulations encourage a fine-grained and integrated pattem
       of streets that provide continuity between neighborhoods, have a human scale, and
       enhance the character ofneighborhoods and activity centers. Ensure that the Subdivision
       Regulations:
             o  Require lhe continuity of major streets between neighborhoods.
             ¡  Limit use of cul   de sacs to:
                      No more than ten percent of the length of all streets in a subdivision map; and
                      A  150-foot maximum length, to prevent their use as a substitute to through streets.
             .  Where cul de sacs are used, integrate pedestrian and bicycle connections through
                the end to the adjacent area.

                                                                      Chøpter 3: Community Design
             .    Promote closer spacing between the intersections of local streets, as defined in
                  Chapter 4: Transportation, with a maximum spacing of l/8th mile (660 feet) that
                 will strengthen pedestrian connections.
                 See Figures  i.2-4 and 3.2-5 for illustrative diagrams.
 CD-25 Use traffic calming measures to reduce traffic speeds in residential areas rather than
        limiting the street connections.
        Connecting streets provide direct linkages between different areas of the city.    Trffic
        calming measures are also discussed in Chapter 4: Transportation.
 CD-26 Design local streets to not only accommodate lraffrc, but also to serve as comfortable
        pedestrian environments. These should include, but not be limited to:
            o    Street tree planting adjacent to curb and between the street and sidewalk to
                provide a buffer between the pedestrian andthe automobile, where appropriate;
                See  Figure 3.2-5 for an illustrative diagram.
           .    Minimum curb cuts along streets; and
           .    Sidewalks on both s¡des of streets, where feasible.
CD-27 Allow sound walls only for development along US 101 and the NP Railroad, as shown in
       Figure 3.2-6.
      A revíew of the calculated noise levels and traffic counts along Rohnert Park's arterials,
       coupled with implementation of other tools such as larger setbacks, suggests that sound
       walls will not be necessary along proposed arterials. Restrictions on use of sound walls
      will allow neighborhoods to be less inward focused ond allow them to be perceived as
      more open and welcoming to passers by. See Figure 3.2-6.
CD-28 Ensure that development standards do not result in disincentives for providing closely
      spaced local streets.
      The City should, during updates to the Zoning Ordinance and the Subdivision
      Regulations, establish minimum lot sizes that take into consideration local streets every
      400-500 feet and still allow maximum densities/intensities þr the various land use
      categories to be attained.
                                                                                             3-23

Policies in this section refer to the individual specific plan and planned development areas and to
the City Center, as defined in Chapter 2:Land Use and Growth Management.
Uníversity Dístrict Specific PIan A'rea
CD-31 Ensure that the University Dístrict is developed as an active, mixed-use pedestrian center,
        integrated and responsive to the design of the University Concert Hall, sensitive to the
        existing residential developments to the west, and with transitions to open space'to the
        east.

                                                                        Chapter 3: Community Design
 CD-32 Require development of an appropriately scaled private plaza as the focal point of the
       mixed use portion of the University District. Ensure that the design of the plaza reflects
       the following considerations:
            r    Permit maximum accessibility and foster a public orientation;
            .    Protection and emphasis of primary view corridors to the east and the north;
           .     Definition of edges by adjacent buildings and proper landscaping;
           .     Adequate lighting for nighttime use;
           r    Flexibility of space for various programs such as concerts, flea markets, etc;
           ¡    Locating active uses such    as restaurants and cafes around theplaza; and
           ¡    A location that is accessible forpedestrians from adjacent       areas.
                The location of the pløza is critical þr its success. Ideally the pløza would be
                centrally located, and accessible to a large majority of the mixed-use areawíthin
                a l/¿-mile radius or a five minutes walk. The plaza should also be visible and
                accessible and øccessible from Rohnert Park Expressway, although it need not
                be locøted ødjacent to it.
               Many plaTas in the West provide successful examples of such considerations;
               most are based on precepts ofSpanish neighborhood design. The Plqza in Santa
               Fe, the oldest in the country, is perhaps the most successful example. The plaza
               in Sonoma is much larger, with wider streets as well.
CD-33 Ensure that the Circulation Plan for the University District Specific Plan incorporates:
          "    A modified grid-pattern of pedestrian-scaled intercornected streets, no more than
               400 to 500 feet apartin the mixed-use areas;
               l[/here thís grid pattern intersects with Rohnert Park Expressway and through-
               automobile trffic may not be feasible, throttgh pedestrian and bikeway
              connections across the Expressway should still be provided.
          o   A maximum block area;
              A maximum block size would help prevent large bloclcy thøt impede circulation within
              and between neighborhoods. An appropriate msximum block size, to be established as
              part of the specific pløn, would be in the range of 2.5 to 4.0 acres.
         o    Steet s)ßtem integrated with exísting and proposed  accesses to SSU and the Concert Hall;

         .    Bikeways, with Class I bikeways along the linear parkway leading to the campus
              and along Hinebaugh Creek, with connections to the citywide network; and
         .    Traffic calming measures and unified streetscape; and

CD-37 Ensure that the Specific Plan and/or the City Zoning Ordinance reinforce the area's
       pedestrian-oriented character. Development standards should include:
           .     "Build-to" lines;
           .     Defined active street-edges;
           ¡     Requiredtransparency;
           o    Maximum distance between entrances in the mixed-use areas;
           o    Allowing use of sidewalks for outdoor seating; and
           r    Integration   of  street furniture, signage, and elements such as awnings that
                increase the pedestrian comfort.
CD-38 The linear parkway shall be designed so that parking is provided on each side of this
      street. Allow half of this parking located immediately adjacent to the Medium- and High-
      Density Residentíal areas to count towards ofÊstreet parking for these uses.
                                                                                                 3-31

 3.3      COMMERCIAT CENTERS
 As of 1999, essentially two types of commercial centers exist in Rohnert Park:
         o    Neighborhood Commercial, locatedadjacent to neighborhoods, providing convenient
              shopping for nearby the residents. Neighborhood commercial centers are primarily
              oriented toward the automobile, but include amenities like large sidewalks and
              landscaped buffers that are pedestrian-friendly. The largest of these, at Rohnert Park
              Expressway/Commerce Boulevard, includes more than half the land devoted to
              neighborhood commercial facilities in the city.
         o   Regional Commercial,located primarily along US 101, serving a regional clientele,
              in addition to Rohnert Park residents. Large, big-box retail stores (such as Home
             Depot and Wal-Mart) along Redwood Drive are oriented to their parking lots and the
             visibility that US 101 provides. Large blocks, minimal access points, and lack of
              shade trees discourage walking and bicycling.
 While much new future commercial development is contemplated as being part of mixed-use
 centers (policies for which are included in the preceding section), single-use commercial
 development may occur in several areas.
 GOALS: COMMERCIAL CENTERS
 CD-N Provide safe, convenient, and comfortable pedestrian connections within commercial
         centers and between commercial centers and adjacent sites and residential
         neighborhoods.
 CD-O   Ensure that the location of buildings and the orientation of entrances within commercial
        centers allow for easy pedestrian access.
POLICIES: COMMERCIAL CENTERS
Figure 3.3-1 illustrates the potential visual appearance         of  commercial centers developed
according to the policies in this section.
CD-56 Require al1 development within commercial districts to provide pedestrian amenities,
        including:
             o    Pedestrian walkways through parking lots to connect buildings on opposite sides
                  ofparking areas;
             ¡    Sidewalks wide enough to accommodate pedestrian use;
             o    Sidewalk intersection bulbs, to reduce the walking distance across streets;
             o   Pedestrian lighting, benches, street trees, and other sidewalk amenities; and
             o   Landscaping that complements pedestrian circulation and eliminates barriers to

DOWNTOWN DISTRICT
In2016, in order to facilitate the development of downtoln, a Downtown District Amenity Zone
(DDAZ) was established by the Central Rohnert Park, Priority Development Area Plan. The
DDAZ is intended to focus investment in the downtown area and to facilitate and create a
compact, walkable, commercial district that is unique to Rohnert Park. The intent is to establish
an urban streetscape environment supporting creation of a walkable dining, entertainment, retail,
and civic district, within an urban atmosphere that is uniquely defined for the city. Figure 3.2-16
illustlates tlie DDAZ boundaries.

   4       Transportation
  The Transportation Element includes policies, programs, and standards that are intended to
  o    Maintain mobility and reduce traffic in congested locations;
  .    Improve connections between different parts of the city;
  ¡   Further an integrated multi-modal transportation system that encourages transit use, walking,
      and biking; and
  r   Provide incentives for travel demand reduction.
 The Transportaion Element identifies future circulation needs for a long-range planning horizon,
 based on General Plan buildout (see Chapter 2: Land Use and Growth Management). As part of
 the City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP), the identified improvements      will be studied in
  greater detail, and funding and implementation sources will be determined.
 This element addresses issues from a citywide to neighborhood and block-level scales, as well as
 other issues that are countywide or regional in scope. Coordination with other jurisdictions will
 be necessary for improvements to US 101 and other roads outside the City's jurisdiction. Transit
 service improvements will require coordination with transit operators.
Transportation and land use are closely connected. Development imposes new demands on the
transportation system, and the fransportation system shapes the character and intensity of
development over many years. Policies related to the physical framework for development that
the circulation system is designed to serve are included in Chapter 2: Land Use and Growth
Management and Chapter 3: Community Design. Provisions in Chapters 2,3, and 4 are intended
to be complementary, so that land use and transportation are coordinated.
                                                                                                4-7

  Rohnert Park General PIan
  4.I        STREET SYSTEM
  Rohnert Park's street network-including existing (1999) streets, roadway improvements, and
  new streets-is shown on Figure 4.1-1. US 101 bisects the city and serves as the main connection
  to cities to the north and south. Petaluma Hill Road and Stony Point Road are partially used as
  bypass routes for trips between Santa Rosa and Petaluma. State Route (SR) I 16 connects Rohnert
  Park with Sebastopol and the Russian River area to the west, with Petaluma to the south, and the
  Valley of the Moon wine country to the east.
  Rohnert Park has a hierarchical street system of city streets-characteristic of post-war suburban
  development-that separates fast-moving through-traffic from slow-moving local traffic. Arterial
  and collector streets provide circulation between and through neighborhoods, activity centers, and
 highways and other regional routes, and are characteized by higher traffic volumes and speeds
 and fewer curb cuts. In contrast, local streets have lower traffic volumes and speeds and provide
 curb cuts for most adjacent sites.
 TRAFFIC FTOWSTANDARDS
 Levels of Service
 The most widely used standard for cvaluating traffic flow is called level of service (LOS), which
 is a grade level assigned to volume-capacity ratios. As shown in Table 4.1-1, LOS dcscribcs the
 quality of flow, ranging from free flow (LOS A) to extreme congestion associated with over-
  capacity conditions (LOS F). Signalized intersection LOS definitions are included inTable 4.1-2.

   Other Standards
   Other standards, aside from LOS, can be used to evaluate and monitor traffic conditions. For
   example, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT) are measurements that
   are used to understand overall traffic conditions and delays experienced by commuters. Standards
   based on such measurements can ensure that traffic flow is evaluated and monitored in a
   comprehensive manner, not just on a segment-by-segment basis.
   TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
   1999 Operations
  As of 1999, trafftc in Rohnert Park flows relatively smoothly along most street segments.
  Although Traffic has increased over the course of the City's 43-year history, in conjunction with
  new development, most streets in Rohnert Park were designed with excess capacity and have
  been able to absorb the ftafftc increases. The fact that most streets have low traffic levels suggest
  that the roadway system can accommodate additional traffic volumes without significant
  increases in delay in most places.

  Rohnert Park General Plan
  However,   in 7999,  several artcli¿l stleets experienced congestion during peak hours, and some
  intersections also experienced congested conditions and delay. The principal congestion locations
  within the city inciude:
  .    US 101 interchange at the Rohnert Park Expressway;
  o    Rohnert Park Expressway-Commerce Boulevard intersection;
  ¡    US 101 interchange at Wilfred Avenue;
 r     Commerce Boulevard, between Golf Course Drive and Redwood Drive; and
 ¡     Snyder Lane, between Southwest Boulevard and Keiser Road.
 Congestion is also an issue on regional routes in the Rohnert Park Planning Area. US 101 has
 become increasingly congested throughout the 1990s, as a result of countywide population and
 employment growth.'l'he Rohnert Park segment of US l0l currently operates at LOS E during
 the peak hours. Petaluma Hill Road also experiences heavy traffrc, because it serves as a bypass
 for US 101 and provides access to Sonoma State Universitv (SSU). The segments of Petaluma
 Hill Road adjacent to Rohncrt Park gencrally operate at LOS D or worse.
 Traffic signals have been installed at intersections with high traffic volumes or accident rates, or
 have special traffrc control needs. In 1997, traffic light synchronization was installed on
 Commerce Boulevard between the Expressway and Enterprise Drive and on the Expressway
between Commerce Boulevard and Snyder Lane, but was disconnected due to programming and
 coordination problems. As of 1999, the Cify has allocated frinds to replace the controllers with
up-to-date units.
Proiected Traffic Flow
'ü/ith all the improvements listed in Table 4.L-4, many city streets would have relatively little
tratTic congestion (LOS A, B, C) during the PM peak commute hour under fr¡ll buildout of the
General Plan, as shown in Figure 4.1-2. The following roadway segments would experience
congested conditions and exceed the maximum acceptable level of service during the PM peak
hour:
      a   Commerce Boulevard
          r   northbound, befween State Farm Drive and US 101 intcrchange (LOS F)
          ¡   southbound, between State Farm Drive and US 101 interchange (LOS D)
          ¡   southbound, between Enterprise Drive and Old Redwood Highway (LOS D)
      a   Seed Farm   Drive
          .   southbound, befween State Farm Drive and Southwest Boulevard (LOS E)
      a   Petaluma  Hill Road
          ¡   northbound, between Valley House Drive and East Railroad Avenue (LOS D)
          r   southbound, between Valley House Drive and East Railroad Avenue (LOS F)
          .   northbound, northwest of Snyder Lane (LOS E)

                                                                       Chapter 4: Transportation
         I    southbound, northwest of Snyder Lane (LOS F)
    .    Stony Point Road
         ¡   northbound, north of Millbrae Avenue (LOS F)
    ¡    Millbrae Avenue
         r   westbound, east of Stony Point Road (LOS F)
    ¡   Wilfred Avenue
        ¡    eastbound, east of Stony Point Road (LOS E)
        r    westbound, east of Stony Point Road (LOS F)
The traffic model used to identifr these congested spots takes into account planned expansion of
SSU to 10,000 FTE students. In addition to these traffic congestion spots during the PM peak
commute hour, other school drop-off and pick-up locations           will continue    to experience
congestion under General Plan buildout at the beginning and end of the school day. The SSU
Concert Hall facility (in planning as of 1999) would be expected to generate traffic during special
events. Most events would be expected to start and finish in the evenings, after the PM peak
commute hour.

      REGIONAL ROADWAYS
     Plans and programs are in place for several regional roadways in the Rohnert Park Planning Area:
     us 101
     In  1999, funds were allocated under the Metropolitan Transportation Commissions (MTC)
     funding-constrained Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for additional improvements to
    the Rohnert Park Expressway interchange. Widening of the overpass was complete as of 1999,
    and an eastbound to northbound loop offamp is planned. (The Rohnert Park Expressway
    interchange improvements are being funded with local funds.) In 1996, the widening between the
    freeway and Redwood Drive was completed, and in 1999 the widening of the overcrossing
    structure was completed. The balance of the widening to Commerce Boulevard and construction
   of the northbound loop on-ramp is scheduled for completion in 2000. A second loop onramp for
   southbound trafftc and a second Park 'n Ride lot are scheduled for construction in 2002, pending
   final funding availabilify. Also, construction of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes along the
   US l0l freeway from Wilfred Avenue in Rohnert Park north to Steele Lane in Santa Rosa is
   funded and scheduled to begin construction in winter 2000.
   County-Monitored Transportation Network
  The l99l Congestion Management Plan (CMP) established the Monitored Transportation
  Network. The CMP requires that all roadway segments in the network meet specific LOS
  requirements, and improvements are planned accordingly, on an on-going basis. In the Rohnert
  Park Planning Area, segments that are part of the network (as listed in Appendix B of the 1993
  CMP) include:
  o     US 101;
  ¡     Rohnert Park Expressway, from Redwood Drive to the eastern Rohnert Park City limits. (The
        segment from Redwood Drive to State Farm Drive is grandfathered at LOS F); and
  ¡     SR116.
 Petaluma Hill Road
 Trafftc congestion presently exists in Penngrove at the Petaluma Hill Road and Old Adobe Road
 intersection during commute times. Implementation of this General Plan will result in additionat
 traffic in this area. As of 2000, planned County improvements along Petaluma Hill Road include
 signalization improvements at the Roberts Road intersection and a new left-turn pocket at the
 Keiser Avenue intersection. Long-term solutions to traffic congestion on Petaluma Hill Road
require a cooperative, regional approach by Sonoma County, the Penngrove community, Sonoma
 State University, and the cities of Cotati, Petaluma, Santa Rosa, and Rohnert Park. The City of
Rohnert Park commits to being a responsible pafücipant in formulating measures to minimize
fiafftc congestion on Petaluma Hill Road.
The City has been working with the County and other interested parties to identify potential
irnprovements that will mitigate regional impacts to the extent feasible. It is anticipated that the
process of studying and approving the selected improvements will take several years to complete.
                                                                                                4-tl

 Rohnert Park General Plan
 Therefore, specific improvements to existing and future traffic congestion on Petaluma Hill Road
 have not been identified at this time, but a process to address the issues has been established.
 Policies are included in this General Plan to establish Rohnert Park's commitment to contribute
 financially to the selected improvements.
 City of Cotati Roadways
 Because of the location of the City of Cotati between Rohnert Park and U.S. 101, a portion of
 Rohnert Park traffic passes through Cotati to reach the U.S. l0l corridor. Implementation of this
 General Plan may generate additional vehicle trips on City of Cotati roadways, particularly East
 Cotati Avenue. Long-term solutions to traffic congestion on East Cotati Avenue require a
 cooperative agency approach. Policies in this General Plan commit the City of Rohnert Park to
 being a responsible participant in developing measures to minimize the City's ftafftc effects on
 East Cotati Avenue.
 GOALS: STREET SYSTEM
 TR-A    Promote safe and efficient vehicular circulation throughout Rohnert Park.
TR-B Maintain high levels of mobility along all major street               segments and    at  major
         intersections.
TR-C Build new roads and improve         existing roadways, where necessary, in conjunotion with
         new development.
TR-D     Improve vehicular connections across US 101, to better link the western and eastem parts
         of the city.
TR-E    Discourage high-speed trafftc and trucks from using local streets.
TR-F    Encourage alternative modes of travel-including transit, bicycles, and walking-by
        coordinating land use planning and development with transportation and by promoting
        compact, mixed-use development in targeted areas.
TR-G    Integrate street alignments with natural features, such as creeks and greenways.
TR-H    Coordinate with regional agencies on transportation improvements         in the Rohnert Park
        Planning Area.
POLICIES: STREET SYSTEM
Street Classifications and Standards
TR-l    Establish LOS C as the minimum standard for       all artenal and collector roadway segments

 Rohnert Park General Plan
 TR-3    Establish additional taffic flow benchmarks in order to evaluate and monitor changes in taffic
         flow over time.
         Potential traffìc.flow benchmarlcs include vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or vehicle hours
         traveled (/HT). Increases in VMT or VHT cøn be compared to increases in population.
         By way of example, the Bay Area Aír Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
         establishes the ratio of population increase to WT increase qs the standard þr
         evaluating compliance of local land use plans to the Clean Air Plan.
 TR-4    Establish roadway classifications, as shown in Table 4.1-3. Require right-of-way dedications
         and design roadway improvements based on these classifications and Figure 4. 1- I .
        Roadways øre dffirentiated by function, width, number of lanes, presence or absenbe of
        on-street parking, speed, volumes, access, ønd design chøracterístics, Because width is
        not the only determinant, collectors can have þur lanes, and arterials can have two
        Ianes; thus, some cctllectors will be wider than sotne ørterials. Based on the
        ciassifications, the City wiii deveiop tíetaiie(í engineering stqndards for roaríwa1t
        improvements.
        Designation of an existing local street as an arterial or collector does not necessarily
        mean that trffic volumes or speed are expected to increase. Instead, it means that streets
        øre designed with the site øccess, parlcing, number of lanes, and other characteristics
        shown in Table 4.1-3. Trffic calming devices cøn be used to control volume and speed.
       Figure .(.1-I sentes øs the Master Street Plan, It shows only arterial and collectot' streets
        in areqs of new development. Local streets, which are not shown on the map, but are
        necessøry to provide adequate site access, will be required during Subdivision Map
        øpprovals.
        The design of certain streets may differ from the roadway classiJìcøtions, in accordance
       with   the policies in this chapter ønd Chapter 3: Community Design. These streets include
       the one-way collector couplet along the linear pørk, the one-way ørteriøl couplet along
       Five Creek, and Snyder Lane, designed with a greenway along its eastern edge.
TR-s   Require provision of local steets in accordance with the City's Subdivision Ordinance and the
       policies and standards in Chapter 3: Community Design.
Ruarlway lrnprovements
TR-6   Use the City's Capital Improvements Program ¿ß a means to prioritize and undertake roadway
       improvernents listed in Table4.l-4 and shown on Figure 4.1-1.
       Responsibilities for upgrading and maintaining roøds that were outside the City's
      jurisdiction in 1999 (such as Keßer Avenue and Petaluma Hill Road) will be negotiøted
       with the County and the County Local Agency Formation Commíssion (LAFCO) when

  TR-9    Design the Rohnert Park Expressway as apedestrian-friendiyboulevard between the i999 City
          limits and Petaluma Hill Road.
          A pedestrian-friendly environment would be created through provision of pedestrian
          ømenities, as called þr in Policy TR-38. Chapter 3 contøins qdditional policies to
         trtromote a pedestrian-oriented environment in the University District speciJic plan area
          and to create attractive streetscapes throughout the cíty.
 TR-10    Where street widening is proposed and the City owns an existing rigþt-of-way that exceeds the
         minimum required width, according to the roaclway classifications shown in Figure 4.1-3, the
          additional width shall be used for a greenway along one side of the street that has bikeways,
         pedestian paths, and landscaping. Create smooth connections between other parts of the
         roadway that may have a narrower right-oÊway or a different stneet configuration.
         Prior to orl-option of this Plen, erteríols u,ere required to be 120 þet wirle ín order to
         include on-street parking. As shown in Table 4.1-3 and Figtre 4.1-3, the upduteù urlerial
         roadway classificatìon prohibìts on-street parkìng and thus requires a narrower right-of-
         way. As a result, excess ríght-of-wøy width may result along some arterial streets where
         the Cíty has alreødy secure the 120-foot right-of-way.
         The primary example of such a street is Snyder Lane between the Creekside Middle
         School and the G Section neighborhood. The City owns ø 120-þot right-of-way, but
         would only need 90 feet to accommodate a Major Arterial, as calledþr in Figure 4.1-1.
         Chapter 3: Community Design proposes specffic street designs for Snyder Lane and
         establishes design policies þr all such streets. The Rohnert Park Expressway does not
        have an excess right-of-way, because the 120-þot width is needed to accommodate
       frontage streets, øs required in Policy TR-9.
TR-l1   Use the City's Capital Improvements Program as the mechanism to prioritize and undertake the
        intersection improvernents listed in Table 4.1-5.
        Thís policy is intended to maintain intersections above the LOS standards established in
        Policy TR-I and will help reduce trffic congestion, increase safety, and enhance traffic
       flows. Intersection improvements øre designed to reduce delay and improve flow at
        congested intersections identified in the trffic model run conducted as pørt of the
        General Plan anølysis

          T,øffr" congestion pr"esently exists itz Penngrove at tlte Petalunta Hill Road and Old
          Adobe Road intersectíon during commute times. Trffic congestion is a result from
          growth and commute patterns in Sonoma County, SSU, and the Cities of Sønta Rosa,
          Rohnert Park, Cotqti, and Petqluma. Implementation of this General PIan will result in
          ødditional trffic in this area. Long-term solutions to trffic congestion on Petaluma Hill
          Road require ø cooperative, regional approach by Sonoma County, the Penngrove qrea,
          Sorutmu Stute University, und the cities of Cotuti, Petaluma, Santa Rosu, and Rohnert
          Park. The City of Rohnert Park commits to being a responsible participant inþrmulating
          measures to minimize trffic congestion on Petaluma Hill Road. The City of Rohnert
         Pørk encourages the cities of Cotati, Petaluma and Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, and
         SSU to adopt policies demonstrating their commitment to participating in long-term
         solutions to these problems.
         During tlw period in vvhiclt this General PIan vvas being ú'afted, the City worked with the
         County and other interested parties to identifu potential improvements to mitigate
         regional trafìc impacts. Because of the regional nqture of issues ønd solutions, it is
         ønticipated that the process of studying and approving the selected improvements will
         take several years to complete. Thereþre, specific projects to mitigate existing andfuture
         trffic      congestion on Petaluma            Hill Road had not been identified at the time this General

TR-21     B.    Work with the City of Cotati and Sonoma State University to determine feasible
          measures to mitigate impacts of increased traffic on East Cotati Avenue (within the     City
          of Cotati, beginning with the LaPIaza intersection) associated with the proposed growth
          assumed in the 2000 General Plan. These measures shall be based on detailed
          (intersection-level) traffic studies that will be prepared with each specific plan. The
         Canon Manor Specific Plan, University Specific Plan, and Southeast Specific Plan shall
         include a detailed analysis of intersections within and outside of the city that are
         projected to be impacted by the specific plan project aÍea; an analysis of the traffic
         impacts of the specific plan project area on East Cotati Avenue; a cumulative impact
         analysis; and feasible mitigation measures for lessening the potential traffic impacts.
        Contribute the City's fair share to the feasible mitigation measures identified in each
        Specific Plan (Canon Manor Specific Plan, University Specific Plan, and the Southeast
        Specific Plan); provided that (1) the City's fair share is roughly proportional to the traffic
        impacts of development beyond the 1999 incorporated limits of the City of Rohnert Park;
        and (2) other jurisdictions that approve development that impacts traffic congestion at the
       impacted intersections on East Cotati Avenue contribute their fair share. In the event that
       the Cify of Cotati and/or SSU approve development that impacts East Cotati Avenue
       traffic congestion but do not contribute their fair share to fund the feasible mitigation
       measures, the City and City of Cotati will evaluate alternative feasible mitigation
       measures that can be implemented. The City's financial commitment is also contingent
       upon legal authority to collect payments through specific plans, development agreements,
       assessment districts, andlor ordinances to raise funds for needed improvements on East
       Cotati Avenue.
      Because of the locatíon of the City of Cotati adjacent to U.S. 101, a portion of the traffrc
      passing through Cotati to reach the U.S. l0I corridor is generated from jurísdictions
       outside the City of Cotati. Implementation of this General Plan may generate additíonal
      vehicle trips on City of Cotati roadways, partÌcularly East Cotati Avenue. Long-term
      solutions to trffic congestion on East Cotati Avenue require a cooperøtive regional
      approach. Policies in this General Plan commit the city of Rohnert Pørk to being a
      responsible participanÍ ín developing and funding these solutions. Development within
      the Specific Plan areas may occur without implementation of the identiJìed mitigation
      measures in the event that funding is not available from other jurisdictions to construct
      the improvements.
                                                                                                 4-27

    4.2         TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
    Policies in this section are designed to reduce peak-hour traffic congestion by limiting increases
    in  transportation demand. The policies provide an alternative to roadway improvements, by
    making more efñcient use of the existing transportation network. A variety of strategies can be
   used to limit demand, from emphasizing transit, ridesharing, and non-auto altematives for the
   commute to work, to creating pedestrian- and bicycle-frienclly development, to limiting excessive
   amoun[s of parking, which scrves as a major incentive to drive.
   Transportation demand management (TDM) programs are provided by employers to reduce the
   amount of peak-hour traffic by encouraging their employees to use modes other than single-
   occupancy automobiles for travel to the worþlace and to travel during non-peak times. While
   public agencies can no longer impose mandatory employer-based trip reduction programst,
   businesses can voluntarily participate in TDM programs, and local jurisdictions can still require
   TDM measures as mitigation for transportation and air quality impacts, under the auspices of
   CEQA review.z
   GOALS: TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
   TR-I        Develop a comprehensive transportation demand management (TDM) program that
              preseryes Rohnert Park's quality of life, while nmirrtainiug a positive business
              environment.
   TR-J       Reduce peak-hour traffic congestion and associated impacts, including air pollution,
              energy consumption, and noise.
  TR-K        Reduce the need for roadway improvements by making more efficient use of existing
              roads, bikeways, transit service, and other transportation facilities and services.
  POLICIES: TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
 TR-22 In cooperation with the Chamher of Commerce, arlopt a non-mandatory employer-hased
             transportation demand management (TDM) program for Rohnert Park businesses.
             This policy ís intended to reduce the use of single-occupqncy vehicles                 þr the commute to
             work- While voluntary,             a City program can alleviøte the cost of establishing an
             independent program           for each indivídual business. For example, the progrøm could

   The Bay Area Air Quality Management District's Regulation 13, Rule    l, requiring employers with over 100 employees to
decrease the average vehicle ridership, was overtumed. According    to Health and Safefy Code $40717.9(a), "a [air quality]
district, congestion management agency, ... or any other public agency shall not require an employer to implement an
employee trip reduction program unless the program is expressly required by fìderal law and the elimination ofthe program
will result in the imposition of federal sanctions.. ."

   Health and Safety Code $ 40717.5(c); $ 40717.6. The law also states that local jurisdictions can require trip reduction
measures pursuant     to a voter-mandated growth management program. However, no voter-mandated program has been
proposerl in Rohnert Pa¡k as   of 1999. Growth management policies in the Lancl l-lse ancl Growth Management Element have
not been subject to voter approval.

        seversl busínesses and thus removing a barrier to TDM.
         Voluntary progrqms have come into use since the Bay Area Air Quality Management
        District's (BAAQMD) Rule 13 was overturned. In the 1997 Clean Air Plan (CAP),
        BAAQMD establishes Transportation Conlrol Measure #I to "support voluntøry
        employer-based trip reduction programs. "
 TR-23 Allow reductions in transportation impact fees on new non-residential development
        commensurate with provision of transportation demand management (TDM) measures,
        and develop reduction parameters.
        This polícy is intended to serve as an íncentive for provision of alternatives to travel by
       single-occupancy vehicles. Project proponents takíng advantage ofreductions must agree
       to adopt and implement specified TDM measures as a condition of project approval.
      As part of an ordinance establishing impact fees and other funding mechanisms for
       infrastructure improvements, the City shall determine what TDM meøsures øre eligible
      þr impactfee reductions. Also, the City shall determine the relative trip reduction benefit
      of each TDM measure ønd assign each measure an impact fee credit. Meøsures with the
      greatest trip reduction would have the greatest credít. The Cíty should also consider
      imposing a maximum total reduction, to ensure that funding for public facility
      improvements in the CIP ís not depleted.
TR-24 Adopt and implement a TDM program to encourage the use of alternative transportation
      modes by City employees.

   4.3     TRANSIT
  As of 1999, Rohnert Park was served by three transit agencies:
       Golden Gate Transit, which is oriented mainly to commuters traveling to Marin County and
  '    San Francisco;
  .    Sonoma County Transit, which serves Rohnert Park and other destinations within Sonoma
       County; intra-city routes operate on 3O-minute to one-hour intervals;
  ¡    Rohnert Park Sunshine Bus, which serves elderly and disabled people.
  These bus routes offer altematives to auto use for regional, countywide, and local trips. Buses
 running to San Francisco via Golden Gate Transit carry the most passengers over the course of a
 year. However, Sonoma County Transit buses also carry a substantial number of riders,
 particularly between Petaluma and Santa Rosa. Ridership information by transit route is presented
 in Table 4.3-1.

RAIL SERVICE
The railroad line that runs through Rohnert Park has historically been used for freight service.
The segment of railway through Rohnert Park is owned by the Northwestern Pacific Railroad
                                                                                              4-3L

   Authority, and leased to the North Coast Rail Authority (NCRA), a consortium of local
   government agencies. By the early 1990s, the line had fallen into disrepair, and train traftic had
   declined. 'lhe line was closed to raii trat-1ic in 1998 as the result of storm water damage, and the
   line was reopened for minimal train service as of 1999.
   The line has been considered for conunuter rail service, as a slrategy to alleviate existing and
   projected trafftc congestion along US 101. The SCTA and the Marin Countywide Planning
   Agency (MCPA) conducted the 1997 Sonoma-Marin Multi-modal Transportation and Land Use
   Study, which recommended a l9-station commuter rail line between the Larkspur Ferry Landing
   and Windsor, with a station in Rohnert Park. The study also recommended a series of HOV lanes
   along US l0l.
  Funding
  Proposition 116 funding was used for purchase of the NP right-of-way, as the first step toward
  providing commuter rail service. However, aclditional Capital Rehabilitation ftinds will not be
  released unti! Sonoma and Marin counties can dernonstrate a pennanent scurce cf operating
  funds. Measure C was placed on the November 1998 ballot in both counties to provide the
  operating funds, but failed to obtain a majority vote. It would have established aYz-certt sales tax
  and raised $950 million. The associated Measure B, which listed specific projects to be funded by
 Measure C, passed by 72 percent. In the March 2000 ballot, both pro-rail and pro-Highway 101
 widening measures were placed on the ballot in the County, but neither secured the necessary
 two-thirds margin.
 TRANSIT CENTER
 Approximately $750,000 of federal Transportation Efficiency Act (TEA21) funds have been
 earmarked for an intermodal (bus and rail) fransit center in Rohnert Parþ Cotati, and Santa Rosa,
 as part of a $6 million earmark for transit centers countywide. The funds are available until
 October 2001. Transit centers funded with this earmark must have the potentíal for a future rail
 connection.3 As of 1999, SCTA is implementing the county's first transit station in Windsor.
 PARK-AND-RIDE
 Free-of-charge commuter parking lots in the Rohnert Park area include:
      l.  CalTrans lot, at the southwest quadrant of the US l0l-Rohnert Park Expressway
          interchange.
      2.  Rohnert Park City lot, at the northwest comer of Roberts Lake Road and Golf Course
          Drive.
      3.  CalTrans lot, on Saint Joseph Way, off of Old Redwood Highway in Cotati.
An additional commuter parking lot is planned for the northeastem quadrant of the US                101-
Rohnert Park Expressway interchange. Joint-use commuter parking is also available at 4627-4675
Snyder Lane, north ofEleanor Avenue.

 TR-28 Work with Sonoma        State University (SSU) to explore the feasibility of a campus shuttle.
         Ideally, a cqmpus shuttle would connect the SSU campus, the adjacent Uníversity
         District, the transit center (if it is developed; see Polícy TR-34), the City Center, møjor
         commercial centers, and hígh-density residential areøs.
 TR-29 Explore the feasibility of offering additional student discounts on monthly bus passes, in
        consultation with Sonoma State University (SSU), Sonoma County Transit, and Golden
        Gate Transit.
        Sonoma County Transit already offers        ø 830 monthly student bus pass, compared to the
        840 adult   pass. Golden Gate Trqnsit        does not offer a college student discount (only
        students under the age of 18 are offered discounts), and there ís no discounted student
        røte for the Sonoma SuperPøss, which allows unlimited rides on both Golden Gqte
        Transit and Sonoma County Transit at a monthly cost of 870             þr   qdults. Providing

              r  Bus shelters shall be adequately designed and sized to accommodate waiting
                 passengers during inclement weather.
 Rail Service and Transit Center
 TR-33 Encourage the Sonoma County Transportation Authority (SCTA) to continue in their
        efforts to develop commuter rail service along the Northwestern Pacific (NP) right-of-
        way. Work with SCTA to resolve issues regarding commuter rail design and operation in
        Rohnert Park, including:
             ¡   Location of rail stations;
             o   Desigr of roadway crossings at the Rohnert Park Expressway, Southwest
                 Boulevard, and Golf Course Drive; and
            .    Noise impacts and mitigatron measures.
TR-34 Undertake a comprehensive study to evaluate and implement          a multi-hub transit corridor
        along Rohnert Park Expressway with the following characteristics:
            .   Rail transit station in the vicinity of the Rohnert Park ExpresswayÆ.lorthwestem
                Pacific right-of-way;
            ¡   A bus transfer station, either in the vicinity of the station or in another location
                with frequent shuttle connections between the rail and the bus stations;
            .   Frequent shuttles between the raillbus station(s) and the University District and
                Sonoma State University; and
            .   Parking either in vicinity of the raillbus station (s) or in a location with shuttle
                access to the station (s).
       A trønsít center or corridor would provide a convenient place for transfers between bus
       routes and línes. As of 2000, the Rohnert Park Expressway-Commerce Boulevard
       intersection served as an inþrmal transfer area, because mqny bus routes stop there. A

         new transít center (eíther bus only, or bus and rail together) could potentially be located
         closer to pedestriøn-oriented activity centers-such as the University District ønd City
         Center-because walking ønd riding transit are complementary modes of travel.
        Locations along the Northwestern Pøcific (NP) railroad right-of-way could also
        potentially øllow for future rail connections. A transit center, øs opposed to the
        intersection, could also be associated with a park-and-ride ønd drop-offfocilities.
Park-and-Ride Lots
TR-35 Work with CalTrans to implement plans for the park-and-ride lot in the northeast
        quadrant of the Rohnert Park Expressway interchange along US 101.
       The 1998 TIP allocated funding          þr the new park-and-ride lot. As of 1999, CalTrans
       started planning and preliminary design. However, the project was not initiated and may
       r e qui r e ad d i t i ona I fun din g.
TR-36 Explore the feasibility of additional park-and-ride lots at the Rohnert Park Expressway
      and Wilfred Avenue interchanges along US 101.
      In    the future, additíonql park-and-ride facilíties may be warranted in conjunction with
      the construction of HOV lanes along US I}L The HOV lanes that are being planned and
      built through Santa Rosa wíll terminate at Wlfred Avenue, making that interchange a
      strong candidate for additionøl pørk-ønd-ride facilities.

    Rohnert Park General PIan
   4.4       PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE CIRCULATION
   Rohnert Park's land uses and hierarchical street system were designed primarily for automobile
   circulation (see Chapter 2: Land Use and Growth Management and Section 4.1). While ensuring
   that automobile circulation flow is maintained, this General Plan makes a commitment to
   improved pedestrian and bicycle circulation, in order to provide altematives to auto use.
   PEDESTRIAN CIRCUIITTION
  While many city streets have sidewalks, trees, and lighting, limited connections between
  neighborhoods and the distance between neighborhoods and activity centers (including SSU,
  conunercial centers, offrces, industrial areas) discourage walking for the purposes of going to
  work, shopping, or running errands. Walking is a major mode of travel for school-age children.
  The city's numerous parks, recreational facilities, and open space areas encourage pedestrian trips
  for recreational purposes. Local streets within residential neighborhoods typically have slow-
 moving, iow-voiume traffic, aiiowing for comiortabie pedesirian circuiaiion belwcc¡r residcnucs,
 schools, and neighborhood parks.
 BIKEWAYS
 In   1995, bikeways existed   in several parts of the city but did not form a comprehensive network,
 discouraging extensive    bicycle  use. [n response to this deficiency, the City prepared and adopted
 the 1995 Bicycle     Master  Plan to establish a complete network of bikeways that connects all the
 different parts of the city. The Plan established thrce bikeway classifications:
 .     Class I. Paved paths on separate rights-of-way.
 .     Class  IL Striped lanes within  roadways, separate from vehicular travel lanes, parking, bus
       stops, and sidewalks.
o      Class  III. Designated bicycle routes within roadways, shared        with either pedestrians  or
      motorists,
As of 1999, many Class II bike paths outlined in the Master Plan were implemented, and some
Class I bikeways were completed. The improvements have increased safety, facilitated bicycle
access to sites throughout the city, allowed for greater choice in transportation modes, and
improved recreational amenities. Bike commuters include an active bike club at the Hewlett
Packard complex and student riders at SSU, and children make use of bikeways for going to
school. Bikeways alsu alc pupulal with rsureatiuttal users or tlte weekends.
GOALS: PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE CIRCULATION
TR-N Promote safe, efficient, and comfortable circulation for cyclists and                  pedestrians
           throughout Rohnert Park.
TR-O       Create pedestrian-friendly activity centers that encourage local walking trips between to
           and from adjacent uses.

 TR-P Provide        continuous, direct pedestrian routes and bikeways between and through
        neighborhoods and activity centers, and job centers and residential areas, including the
        University District, the City Center, and commercial and industrial areas.
 TR-Q  Provide pedestrian routes and bikeways that link residential areas to city parks and open
       space areas outside the city.
 TR-R  Continue to develop a comprehensive network of bikeways that promote bicycle riding
       for transportation and recreation.
TR-S   Provide adequate bicycle parking facilities.
POLICIES: PEDESTRIANAND BICYCLE CIRCULATION
Pedestrian Circulation
TR-37 Provide continuous sidewalks along all existing and future    streets.
      The City shall establish specific engineering standardsþr sidewalks
TR-38 Establish pedestrian-friendly amenities along streets that run through or adjacent to areas
      designated for Mixed Use, High Density Residential, Public, or Parks. Ensure that:
           .     Sidewalks are wide enough to accommodate pedeshian use;
           .     Sidewalk intersection bulbs (rounded curves that extend the area of the sidewalk
                 intersection comer) are provided to reduce the walking distance across streets;
          .     Pedestrian lighting, benches, street trees, and other sidewalk amenities are
                provided; and
          .     Landscaping complements pedestrian circulation and eliminates barriers to
                pedestrian access.
               Pedestrian-friendly environments are created not only by amenities, but also by
               the use, intensity, location, orientation, and character of buildings. Chøpter 2:
              Land Use and Growth Management includes policies to establish uses and
               intensitíes that encourage pedestrian activity in key øreas throughout the city,
             particularly in the University District and City Center. Chapter 3: Community
              Design includes policies that promote pedestrian-friendly building design. Street
              connections and block size also ínfluence the accessibility and permeability of
              areas to pedestrians. Policies in Chapter 3: Community Design address these
              issues as well.
             Pedestrian connections between the University District ønd SSU are pørticulørly
             important. Heavy high-speed trffic ølong the Rohnert Pørk Expressway could
             potentially díscourage pedestrian activity.
                                                                                               4-37

   Bicycles
  TR-39 Update the Bicycie Master Plan to incorporate Class t bikeways shown in t igure 4.4-l
           Develop locations and alignments for Class II and III bikeways.
           Class I bikeways are located along major streeti, as well at creehr, lineur ¡turht, open.
           space areas, and the NP railroad right-of-way. CIøss II and III bikeways are not shown
           in Figure 4.4-1.
  TR-40 Implement comprehensive design standards for bikeways,              as part  of the Bicycle Master
          Plan. Ensure that adequate lighting, signage, and other amenities are provided.
          In 1995 Bicycle Master PIan, cløssifications    þr Cløss I, II, and III bíkeways are based on
          the State Street and Highways Code and specify function, typical width, road striping,
          and signage. Separately, Goql 6 of the Plan cølls þr amenities such as water þuntains,
          ernergency telephones, lighting,         and convex mirrors at hlind                interse.ctions,
          Comprelten-tive clesign stq.ndo-rds y,ould- consolicl-qte existing stantl-ards and prot,ide more
         detail on the design, ftmctíon, qnd choracter of bikeway cløssifications.
 TR-41 Ensure that bikeways are continuous and interconnected, and that access points into
         bikeways minimize conflicts with pedestrian and traffic circulation.
         The 1995 Bicycle Master Plan calls Jbr trffic lights where bikeways cross busy streets,
         removal of barriers to bicycle crossíngs at these locations, qnd consideration of bícycle-
         activated signøls øt major intersections. These policies already help minimize conflicts
         between bicycles and other modes of traffic.
 TR-42 Make bikeway improvements         a funding priority by:
              ¡   Incorporating bikeway improvements as part of the CIP;
              .   Requiring developers       to  provide bikeways and associated amenities                 in
                  conjunction with new development; and
              o   Pursuing regional and other funding sources for new bikeways               to the   extent
                  possible under federal and State law.
TR-43 Establish requirements for bicycle parking as part of the Zoning Ordinance update.
        Ensure that secure bicycle parking is provided in conjunction with new development in
        areas desi¡grated for Mixed Use, Commercial. Industrial, Office, Public, Park, and High
        Density Residential uses.
        These requirements could include the minimum number of bicycle parking spaces thøt
        must be provided, as well as the type ofrack or locker, for each use.

   Rohncrt Park Gcneral Plan
   4.5      CENTRAL ROHNERT PARK, CTRCIII.ATTON AND CONNECTTVITY
  This section provides goals and policies to implement circulation end connectivity objectives i,vith
  the Central Rohnert Park area, including vehicular roadways, regional and local transit services,
  and bicycle and pedestrian travel routes. Arrival of tlle Sonoma-Mal'in Area Rail Transit
  (SMART) commuter rail station will be an opportunity to shape future development by creating a
  transportation hub in the city, supported by a new town center in the Station Center subarea and
  coordinated with regional and local bus service.
  Circulation and connectivity concepts for Central Rohnert Park focus on enhancements to the
  city's existing roadways and potential for new roadways that support and improve: overall multi-
  modal connectivity; efficient utilization of roadway right-of-way; and safe vehicular connections
  and continuous bike and pedestrian access to destinations in Central Rohnert Park and
  surrounding neighborhoods.
 In addition to addressing transportation goals and policies provided earlier in this Chapter,
 development in Central Rohneft Park will be sub_iect to the following circulation and connectivify
 goals and policies:
 GOALS: ROADWAY DESIGN
 TR-T      Balance the need of arterial and collector roadways to efficiently carry traffic, with
           establishing Central Rohnert Park as a walkable, bikable commnnity, with pedestrian-
           oriented streets, centers, and mixed-use subareas.
 POLICIES: ROADWAY DESIGN
 TR-44 Implement recommended intersection improvements identified in the Central Rohnert
          Park, Priority Development Area Plan, Table 5.1.
 TR-45 To support safe bike and pedestrian access to the SMART station and where a pedestrian-
          friendly town center atmosphere is desired within and in the vicinity of the City Center
          and Station Center subareas, allow for lower level of service (LOS) standards (than LOS
          C), called for in General Plan policy TR-  l, for the following arterial and collector
          roaclway intersections within Central Rohnefi Park, where no other feasible
          improvements exist to improve LOS:
               ¡   At the intersection of Rohnerl Park Expressway (RPX) and Commerce Boulevard
                   (already operating at LOS D dLrring PM peak hours, under existing conditions);
               o   At the intersection of Rohnerl Park Expressway and State Fann Drive (already
                   operating at LOS D during PM peak hours, under existing conditions);
               ¡   At the intersection of Commerce Boulevard and State Farm Drive; and
               .   At the intersection of Enterprise Drive and State Farrr Drive.

                                                                           Chapter 4: Transportation
TR-46 Recognize that future development of CentralRohnert Park Plan will contribute to
         unacceptable operation on U.S. 101 . The type of transit-supportive, pedestrian-oriented
         development pattern envisioned by the Plan plays an important role in reducing regional
         traffic impacts through smart growth.
GOALS: MUTTI-MODAL TRANSPORTATION
Goal U Design streets that integrate walking, biking, transit use, and green infrastructure.
Goal V  Connect Central Rohnert Park to the existing roadway, bike, and pedestrian networks in
        the City.
Goal WCoordinate transit improvements to connect the SMART rail station to surounding land
        uses, commercial areas, and residential communities.
Goal X  Ensure appropriate levels of parking, associated with new development.
POLICIES: MULTI-MODAL TRANSPORTATION
Street Design
TR-47 Retrofit existing    streets as complete streets, in addition to providing vehicular access that
        supports safe and continuous bike and pedestrian facilities and landscape improvements.
TR-48 As recommended in the street sections in Section 5.3 of this Plan, retrofit or design new
        roadways and/or landscape right-of-ways to incorporate low impact development features
        such as, stormwater management curb extensions, infiltration planters, bioswales, and
        other similar measures.
TR-49 Expand bike and pedestrian connections within Central Rohnert Park, including
        connections to the SMART station and multi-use path through:
        o    Off-Street Bicycle/Pedestrian Trail hnprovements
                  .  Adding bicycle trails and bicycle boulevards within new development in the
                     Station Center subarea.
                     Completing trail gaps along the Copeland Creek and Hinebaugh Creek
                     corridors.
                     Improving the meandering sidewalks along RPX to a wider, rneandering
                     bike/pedestrian multi-use path.
                     Extending the bike/pedestrian multi-use path frorn Enterprise Drive to
                     Rohnert Park Expressway.

       o    Pedestrian Facility lmprovements
                .    Adding and providing more defined north-south walkways in the City Center
                     subarea that connect to Hinebaugh Creek.
                .    Establishing defined pedestrian walkway and landscape improvernents in the
                     existing commercial shopping centers to support safe pedestrian access from
                     adjoining residential areas and neighborhoods.
TR-50 Improve at-grade       street crossings for intersections throughout Central Rohnert Park,
       particularly at busy traffic intersections, that will support active or high volume bike or
       pedestrian use.
TR-51 Establish midblock crossings            on:
       o   Rohnert Park Expressway, at the SMART MUP and as a pedestrian link between the
           City Center and Station Center subareas, at Lynne Conde Vy'ay, witlr pedestriarr
           refuges in the median and the potential for a pedestrian hybrid beacon or HAWK
           signal, coordinated with the timing of signals along RPX, SMART rail gate
           operations, and fire station emergency signals.
       o   E,nterprise Drive to connect with existing      trail links or greenways to Copeland Creek.
           This crossilrg should        be coordinated with future roadway networks in the Station
           Center subarea and designed with bulb-outs, a median refuge, high visibility
           markings, and if needed a pedestrian signal.

  TR-52 Consider the feasibility of grade     separated pedestrian crossings at the following locations:
           o  Provide an undercrossing of the greenway trail along the southern side of Hinebaugh
              Creek at the SMART rail tracks to connect Central Rohner-t Park to the SMART
              multi-use path and neighborhoods east of Central Rohnert Park.
          o   Consider the future feasibility of an over-crossing or undercrossing of U.S. 1 01 along
              Hinebaugh Creek.
  Transit Facility Improvements
  TR-53 Plan for improvements to existing bus services or other future circulation modes within
          Central Rohneft Park to coordinate with SMART rail service to meet the transportation
          demands in Rohnert Park, including:
          o   Coordinate with the Sonoma County Transit and the property o\¡/ners for the Station
             Center subarea to plan for expansion of existing bus transit lines and facilities to
             serve the SMART rail station and adjacent Station Center subarea.
           .
         o   Work with the Sonoma County Transit, SMART, and private properfy owners in
             Central Rohnert Park to ensure safe and convenient access to bike and pedestrian
             facilities that supporl transit use and needs of cyclists and pedestrians, who may
             choose to continue their journey in Rohnert Park by bicycle or foot.
         o   As transit demand warrants, plan for developmellt of a community circulator such as
             a shuttle service that travels to key destinations in the community, including Sonoma
             State University and the Graton Rancheria Casino.
 Parking
TR-54 Provide parking in Central Rohnert Park at the parking ratios shown in Table 5-2.
TR-55 Encourage       use of shared parking facilities within multi-tenant buildings and between
        adjacent private developments, particularly on larger developrnent sites. Use leftover
        spaces  for landscape improvements and to provide other community facilities.
TR-56 To the extent feasible, encourage private parking entities to allow public parking after
        typical business hours.
TR-57 Facilitate a"park once" strategy in Central Rohnert Park by irnplementilrg        pedestriarr
        connectívity strategies and promoting the development of a parking district alld common

 5       Open Space, Parks, and Public Facilities
Open space areas within and around Rohnert Park are valuable resources and provide the city a
scenic setting. Parks are a necessity for active and passive recreation. The Open Space, Parks, and
Public Facilities Elèment addresses these and other related topics. Also addressed in this Element
are public facilities, including schools, water service, and wastewater collection, and disposal.
According to Government Code $ 65910, four types of open space must be considered in the
General Plan. These are addressed in different parts of the Plan, as described below:
    l.  Open space for the preservation ofnatural resources: Section 5. I addresses farmland and
        open space conservation; open space as habitat for biological resources is addressed in
        Chapter 6: Conservation;
    2.  Open space for the managed production of resources: Farmland resources are addressed
       in Section 5.1;
    3. Open spacefor outdoor recreation: Section 5.2 addresses park land and outdoor
       recreational facilities; and
   4.  Open spacefor public health and safety: Chapter 7:Healthand Safety addresses seismic
       conditions and flood hazards.

  Rohnert Park General PIan
  5.1      OPEN SPACE
  Since Rohnert Park's founding in the 1950s, the city has maintained a compact urban fonn
  surrounded by open space. With the exception of the City of Cotati to the southwest and rural
  residential subdivisions such as Canon Manor, the sense of open space around the cifv's edges is
  pervasive. While much of the open space is used for grazing, orchards and cultivated land as well
  as Crane Creek Regional Park are also notable uses. This element seeks to ensure that land
  outside the designated extent of urban uses in the Planning Area is maintained as open space. In
  addition. it addresses issues related to buffers between urban uses and open space.
  Two classifications of open space are included in the Land Use and Growth               Management
  Element (Chapter 2):
     .    Open Space for Environmental Conservatio¡e includes sites with environmental andlor
         safety constraints, such as riparian corridors, sensitive habitats, and wetlands (see Chapter
         6: Conservation).
     .   Open Space for Agriculture and Resource Managemen¡ includes orchards and cropland,
         grasslands, cemeterics, and rural rcsidential areas. This classification also accommodates
         greenbelts and urban buffers - open space, park land, and agricultural areas outside urban
         areas. as opposcd to urban parks, which arc locatcd within dcvclopccl arcas and scrvc as
         outcl oor recreational faci I ities.
Excluding creekside greenways and parkways alongside streets, no designated open space is
 located within the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). Between the UGB and the Sphere of
Influence (SOI), two open space areas are included - the 50-acre Community Fields, located
north ofCrane Creek, and a 3O-acre open space buffer south ofG Section. In addition, open space
buffers are located between within the SOI between Petaluma Hill Road and the UGB in the
University District and in the southeast.
OPEN SPACE AND COMMUNITY SEPARATORS
One of Sonoma County's unique characteristics is the diversity and abundance of open space.
Approximately 92 percent of the County's land area is used for mixed agricultural-residential
uses, intensive and extensive agriculture, resource extraction, and watershed-wildlife habitat.
Economic pressure on farmers and ranchers to subdivide or convert their land to non-agricultural
uses is increasing with growth. Conflicts between urban and agricultural also occur at
urbar/agricultural edges. The reduction of this pressure and competition, through mechanisms
such as the dcsignation of community scparators and agricultural prcscrvcs undcr thc Williamson
Act, is essential to the long-term preservation ofopen space. Open Space around Rohnert Park is
shown on Figure     5. I - I .
Community Separators
Two Community Separators are located in the Rohnert Park-Cotati area. The Petaluma-Rohnert
Park separator is located between Petaluma, Penngrove, and Rohnert Park-Cotati. The second
separator is generally located north and northwest of Rohnert Park, between Rohnert Park and
Santa Rosa (see Figure 5.1-l). Measure D, approved by County voters in November 1996,
5-2

                                                Chapter 5: Open Space, Parks, and Public Facilíties
    establishes procedures for changes to boundaries or use regulations applicable to Community
    Separators established in the 1989 County General Plan. Essentially, the Measure establishes that,
   with limited exceptions, County voter approval is required for changes (in use or boundaries) of
   the separators.
   However, because the Counfy's ability to maintain the separators is limited without the
   cooperation of the cities, the Measure "associated" each separator with an adjacent city. The
   Rohnert Park-Santa Rosa "north" Separator (north of the flood control channel, and the portion
   east of US 101) is associated with the City of Santa Rosa, while the Northwest Community
   Separator south of the flood control channel is associated with Rohnert Park. (See Figure 2.2-l).
   Such an initiative has been passed by Santa Rosa, but not by Rohnert Park voters. Thus, while the
   North Separator is currently governed by the provisions of Measure D, the Northwest Separator is
   not. This General Plan outlines efforts, including those requiring CitylCounty cooperation, to
   mitigate impacts of growth into the Northwest Community Separator.
  This General Plan designates approximately 180 acres of Northwest Community Separator land
  for inclusion in the urban area. It is LAFCO's policy to disapprove annexations within the
  designated Community Separator. Pursuant to LAFCO and County direction, removal of the
  Community Separator will require mitigation in the form of providing permanent protection of
  other similar open space land within the Rohnert Park Planning Area. A four-member policy
  makers' "Working Group" has been formed between the City and County to address the
  Community Separator mitigation issue. This General Plan includes provisions for effective
  enforcement mechanisms       to  ensure implementation    of a Community     Separator mitigation
  program.
  Williamson Act Lands
  Several agriculfural sites surrounding Rohnert Park are designated agricultural preserves under
 Williamson Act contracts. The Williamson Act, also known as the California Land Conservation
 Act of 1965 (Government Code $ 51200 et seq.), is intended to discourage the unnecessary
 conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses and conserve land within a scenic
 highway corridor or wildlife habitat. Agricultural preserves are assessed with lower property tax
 rates, providing owners with an incentive to continue agriculfural activity. The initial term of the
 contract is ten years and is automatically renewed eachyear unless cancelled.
 Three parcels outside the existing and proposed Cify limits are currently subject to Williamson
 Act contracts (1999). One of these parcels is located just west of Petaluma Hill Road and north of
 Keiser Avenue. The two other parcels are located with the Community Separators.
 Sonoma CountyAgricultural Preservation and Open Space               District
The Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District was established as part of
the Open Space Element of the Sonoma County General Plan to acquire and administer open
space lands. The formation of the District and the establishment of a l/4-cent sales tax to fund
land purchases and conservation easements over 20 years were approved by County voters in
1990.
                                                                                                  5-3

  Rohnert Park General Plan
 The District adopted an Interim Acquisition Plan in 1991 and an Acquisition Plan in 1993, which
 was revised in 2000. The new plan establishes five-year objectives, specific selection criteria, and
 implementation strategies, and includes greenbelt purchases as a priority. The District collects
 applications from landowners, working only with willing sellers. As of 1999, over 25,000 acres
 have besr proteeted undc¡ the progrrim, There have been six District transactions in the Rohnert
 Purk area. Tluee transactions involved the purchase of conservation easements, and three
 involved the purchase of a fec titlc, A total of 360 acres of open space have been preserved, as
 shown in Figurc 5.1-1.
 URBAN OPEN SPACE
 Street Rights-of-Way
 F.xtensive landscaping within urban open space areas along street rights-of-way is one of Rohnert
 Park's unique features. The redwood trees planted along the median of the Rohnert Park
 Expressway, median treatments along other streets such as Snyder Lane, the landscaped buffer
 area between US 101 and Commerce Boulevard are examples of open space along streets.
 Approxirnately 26 acres of such open space are found within the City limits.
 Business Campuses
 Several office, commercial and industrial sites in the city contain substantial landscaped areas.
 While these are privately owned, they serve as visual resources for the community. Two parcels
retain significant amounts of urban open space. The State Farm site has about five acres of open
space, and the Hewlett Packard campus has about 2l acres of open space, which includes
recreational facilities for employees.

 POLICIES: OPEN SPACE
 OS-1      Work with Sonoma County to ensure that land in the Planning Area designated as Open
           Space in the Rohnert Park General Plan is maintained in rural use or as pennanent open
           spa0c.
           Because the City is not contemplating annexation of any lsnd to the eqst of Petaluma Hill
          Road or open space land in the northeøst, development in thcse arcas will continue to be
          regulated by the Coamty General Plan and Zoning Ordinqnce. The City can take several
          steps to encourage the Coz.tnty to maintain the areø *s in open spsce or rural land uses,
          including:
          o       Formal agreement with the County to ensure that the County and the City will
                  maintain land outside the Rohnert Park Urban Growth Boundary as open space in
                  their general plans at least until the year 2020; and
          o       Seeking language       in the County General Plan requiring the County to consult with
                 the City for any dcvclopmcnt within thc Rohnert Park Planning Area.
os-2      Encourage dedication of the open space buffers aiong the westside of Petaluma                    Hill Road
          as part of the University District and Northeast Specific Plans.
          Crane Creek marks the northern edge of the University District Specific Plan Area. As
         shown on the General Plan Díagram, the open space buffer between the University
         Dístrict Specífic Plan Area and Petqluma Hill Road is abowt 30 acres ín size. Policy CD-
         34 requires preparatì,on of an Open Space Plan as part of the SpeciJic Plan and a
         m.in.imt¿m l7-acre open ,space btffir. Open Space. bttffers in the Northeast Specific Plan
         areø would include the proposed Community Fîelds. A buffer about 100 acres in size is
         located along Petaluma Hill Road in the Southeast Specific PIan areø.
os-3     As part of the Northwest Area Specific Plan, which will include development in the
         County-desigrated Northwest Community Separator, require the permanent preservation
         ofopen space in an area that provides visual relieffrom continuous urbanization and is a
         special type of scenic border. Except as provided in OS-44, a minimum of one acre of

                                               Chqpter 5: Open Space, Parks, and Public Facilities
          open space land will be required for each acre of Community Separator land converted to
         urban uses. (Rev. 10/02)
 OS-4 Approximately 180 acres of land will be required to be preserved based upon
         approximately 180 acres of land      in the Northwest Community     Separator that will be
         developed with urban uses.
 OS-44 The geographic arca suitable for Community Separator mitigation is limited to lands
         within the Rohnert Park Planning Area, (as defined in Figure L5-2).
         Within this Planning Area, give first priority to preservation of:
              ¡   Lands adjacent to the Urban Growth Boundary;
              r   Lands that would serve as "green belts" around the City of Rohnert Park; and
              .   View corridors along Petaluma Hill Road.
         Give second priority to:
             .   View corridors along Railroad Avenue and Stony Point Road;
             .   Prime Farmland (as defined by the State and shown in Figure 4.9-1 of the
                 General Plan EIR);
             .   Lands under Williamson Act agreements; and
             .   Environmentally sensitive habitat areas (defined as areas that are classified as
                 having high wildlife habitat value, high wetlands potential, or high vernal pool
                 and rare plant habitat potential).
        These priority lands are shown in Figure 5.1-2. lf lands in second priority areas or lower
        priority areas in the planning atea are selected for mitigation, the ratio of replacement
        shall be 2 aqes for each acre of Community Separator land converted to urban uses.
OS-48 Require permanent preservation of open space as mitigation for development in the
       Northwest Community Separator as a condition of development included within the
       Northwest Specific Plan. Prior to annexation approval, require applicants to demonstrate
       the ability to ensure the permanent preservation of open space land.
OS-4C Ensure that permanent preservation of open space takes the form of grants in fee title or
       easement to the appropriate governmental body (other than the City of Rohnert Parþ or
       third party land trust, andthat provision is made for the maintenance of the open space.
OS-4D The City shall adopt an adequate and appropriate mechanism to ensure that the required
      open space mitigation will occur through acquisition of open space land within the areas
      described in OS-44 or payment of a fee in lieu of acquisition. Payment of an in lieu fee
      will be permitted in the event that the Council finds that unique circumstances warrant
      payment of a t'ee rather than provision of land and that payment of a fee is consistent with
      implementation of this policy. V/hether the land is acquired by the developer or through
                                                                                               s-7

  Rohnert Park General Plan
          fees paid to the City by the developer, the acquisition of the open space land must be in
          place prior to City issuance of any ggading or building permits .
 os-5     Ensure that open space parcels are aggregated to the maximum extent l'easible, in order to
          avoid piecemeal acquisition that would not serve to mitigate the loss of Community
          Separator lands. However, acqnisition of indiviclual onen space parcels may occur,
          consistent with the County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District's
          acquisition plan.
          The City's commitment to the preservation of open space is more than a written statement
          of public policy. The City believes that the ffictive preservation of open space is best
          approached on ø regional, multi-agency level. To that end, the City supports exploring
          cooperative methods such øs ø joint powers agreement between the City of Rohnert Park,
         Sonoma County, the Sonoma County Open Space District, ønd other interested agencies.
         Such an øgreement would províde Jor the ìdentiJìcøtion, øcquisìtlon, maintenance, and
        pres ervation of open space.
         As  part of preparation of the Park, Recreation, ønd Open Space Master Plan (see Section
         5.2), the City shoutd identifu open space priorities and work wtth the dwlrtcl þr lheir
         inclusion in the district's acquisition plan.
 05-6    Require property developers adjacont to sites where agricultural use is permitted or being
         conducted to inform subsequent buyers ofpotential continued agricultural production and
         the lawful use of agricultural chemiuals, including pesticicles arrd fertilizers.
 os-7 Use creek protection zones (see Section 6.2) for permanent public open space and
        compatible purposes including habitat conservation, bike and walking paths, wildlife
        habitat, and native plant landscaping.
        Creel<s are \ocated in close proximity to residential neighborhoods, providing accessible
        open spøce getaways þr residents. Adverse impacts to ecologically sensitive habitat,
        wildlife, ønd wetlands should be minimized            in  the planning, construction,   qnd
        maintenance of paths.
OS-8    Explore the feasibility of integrating natural and restored wetlands and vernal pool   areas
        with new development or open space areas.
os-9    As part of the specific plan process, institute mechanisms for maintenance of Open Space
        west of Petaluma Hill Road. Establish standards and schedules for the maintenance and
        management of any City-owned open space.
       Maintenance should include measures to cut bqck grass and brush to reduce the risk         of
       fire, reduceflood hazards,     and perþrm related maintenance øctivities.
OS-94 Undertake a study to explore the feasibility of mitigating open space loss on the East
        Side.

  STANDARDS AND CLASSIFICATION
  Standards
 Re sidential D eve lo     pment
 Although there are no State standards for parks, the Quimby Act (Government Code ç66471)
 allows local agencies to require dedication standards-at up to three acres per 1,000 residents, or
  ahigher amount matching existing availability, up to five acres/1,000 residents-for residential
 subdivisions to provide land or in-lieu fees for developing ne\M or rehabilitating existing
 neighborhood or community park or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision.
 N o n- re sí de nti al D ev e lo p me nt
 kr addition to parkiand need that stems from residential development, employment-generating
 uses also have recreation and open space needs. In business park kind of developments, open
 space on the site often suffices for lunchtime open space needs. However, in more urban settings,
 plazas and mini-parks may be necessary. Thus, in addition to the residential parkiand standards,
the City may require plazas, mini-parks, and other appropriate open spaces from non-residential
developments in locations such as the University Dístrict, subject to a maximum of one acre per
250,000 square feet ofnon-residential space.
Classification
Community and neighborhood parks are defined as follows:
    a     Commttnity Parks. Community parks serve a citywide population and usually include
          sports facilities, such as lighted fields, courts, swimming pools, recreation buildings, and
          other special use facilities. Restrooms and ofÊstreet parking are generally provided.

            Although community parks have             a much larger service      arcathaî neighborhood parks, they
            often serve a neighborhood function as well.
       .   Neighborhood Parlcs. Neighborhood parks are devoted primarily to serving a small
           portion of the city, usually within easy walking and biking distance from residences.
           These parks are designed for unorganized and unsupervised recreation activities. Play
           equipment, open turf areas, and picnic tables may be provided, although restrooms and
           off-street parking may not. Neighborhood parks fypically measure between three and
           fifteen acres.
 Based on a standard of 5.0 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, buildout of the General Plan
 would result in the need for an additional 60 acres of neighborhood and community parkland.
 This is the amount of parkland that the City could require of developers submitting subdivísion
 maps; the City may provide additional park and recreation facilities independently.

CREEK CHANNETS
The Cit¡ in cooperation with the Sonoma County Water Agency, owns and maintains creek
channels within Rohnert Park. These channels include Coleman Creek, Copeland Creek, Crane
Creek, Five Creek, and the Five Creek Diversion. The'Wilfred Channel, located adjacent to the
northern City boundary, also is an urban open space resource for the community. The amount of
urban open space along creek channels totals approximately 96 acres. Public access to these

   SCHOOL SITES
  The Cotati-Rohnert Park School District maintains 15 schools on 14 sites. Eleven of the school
  sites are located within 1999 City limits, and in addition, Creekside Middle School is located
  immediately outside the 1999 City limits. The land within 1l school sites plus Creekside totals
  180 acres. Each school site includes playing fields and other urban open space areas. Most of the
  school sites are located adjacent to City parks, thereby compounding the amount of urban open
  space at each locale. If school buildings and grounds are assumed to occupy approximately 30
 percent of the site areas, the amount of recreational space would be 126.2 acres.

OS-10 Prepare a Parks, Recreation, and Open Space (PROS) Master Plan as the implementing
          tool for General Plan park and recreation policies and proposals. Ensure that the Plan
          includes phasing and priority acquisitions. As part of the Plan development, explore
          financing mechanisms, including methods for upfront acquisition and development of
          priority parklands and fields.
          The PROS Master Plan will cover several topics related to park and recreationøl open
         space, such qs: precise location of parl<s øndJìnancial planning to improve undeveloped
        park land and trails, maintain existing facilities, develop new trails, ønd acquire land for
         new parks. The PROS Master will also estqblish standards and identify funding      þr  both
         specific park facilities and City-owned, non-park open space areas, such ss street

OS-1  1 As part of the update of the Subdivision Regulations, establish parkland dedication or in
         lieu fee at a standard of five acres of community and neighborhood parks per 1,000 new
        residents. Require development in high-intensity employment-generating areas-such as
        the University District-to provide additional parkland for employees at 1 acre per
        250,000 square feet of non-residential development.
        The standards set out in this policy will generate a need for øpproximately 60 acres of
        new neighborhood and communily parkland, as shown in Table 5.2-3, as well øs plazas
        and mini-parks      in high-intensity centers. Policy   LU-I   calls for an update of the
        Subdivision Regulations.

 OS-12 Acquire and develop new parks in the approximate locations and sizes shown on Figure
           5.2-l andTable5.2-2.
           The General Plan proposes several new pørks that will provide acreage to meet the
           standard, as indícated in Table 5.2-2. Locations shown on Figure 5.2-I are generalized,
           with precise locstions to be determined during implementation. At buildout, the parkland
           acreage for neighborhood and communíty parlcs wíll increase to about 175 acres. The
           ratío oJ this acreage to 1,000 resìdents will remain roughly the sarne.
 RecreatÍon Facilities
 OS-13 Develop the approximately SO-acre area north of Crane Creek west of Petaluma Hill
          Road as community recreation fields. within City limits. Ensure that development of the
          fields is a priority and that this land will not be used for any other use, including
          affortlablt: huusiug, fur thc litc uf Lhc Gclrcrul Plun. Ensurc that lields are tlesigned tu
          have minimal impacts on adjacent residential uses to the west, and have ingress and
          egress from several roads to minimize traflic impacts. Ensure that only a small portion of
          the fields is lit for nighttime recreation.
 OS-14 Continue cooperating with the Cotati-Rohnert Park School District to develop parks near
          schools as joint use fncilities and coordinate maintenance ancl management of park/school
          sites.
 OS-15 Integrate citywide plans for bicycle and pedestrian paths with park plans
          The network of paths     will allow alternative access routes to pørks. The development of ø

         Diagram.
OS-16 Expand the city's network of bike and pedestrian paths in areas of new development.
         These patlrs, vvhich should be locøted along creek rights-of-way, sltould be linked to the
         existing path system. Paths should also run along the University District Linear Park,
         connecting new residential areas with the SSU campus. The access needs ofa variety of
         users, including school-age children, college students, the elderly, ønd persons with
         disabilities should be considered in the path design. More detail on bilceways and
        pedestrian trails is included in Chapter 4: Transportation.
OS- I 7  Ensure that parks and recreation facilities are safe secure areas.
         The City should request Department of Public Ssfety review and comment on park and
         recreøtion facility projects. The design and construction of these facilities should allow
        for safety, security, and reliable patrol and response.

      5.3      SCHOOLS
     FACILITIES,L999
     Rohnert Park schools are under the authority of the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School Dishict
     (CRPUSD). The District operates 15 schools, including nine elementary schools, three middle
     schools, and one high school, and two continuation high schools. There are i4 school sites in all,
     with a combined elementary and middle school program at the Thomas Page School, and eleven
     sites are found inside Rohnert Park's 1999 City limits. The CRPUSD also runs an alternative
    secondary program. School sites are shown on Figure 5.2-1.
    As in many cities, the District and the City work closely to provide complementary services. The
    City maintains turf areas and plalng fields on school grounds as part of regular park
    maintenance, and the District reimburses the City for the service. School buildings and
    recreational facilities are available for community use during non-school hoursl. Parks located
    adjacent to schools provide additional outdoor recreational space for students.
   The boundaries of the CRPUSD are shown on Figure 5.3-1. The Bellevue Union School District
   (BUSD) and Santa Rosa High School District (SRHSD) are located on the north side of the
   CRPUSD. As of 7999, the boundaries of the BUSD-SRHSD include areas planned for new
  development under this General Plan on both the eastside and the westside.
  ENR.OT,LMENT AND CAPACITY, X.999
  In    1999, approximately 8,120 students were enrolled in the CRPUSD. This number is reduced to
  7,970,    if krdependent Study sfudents are subtracted out.2 The CRPUSD had excess capacity
  (7,970 students enrolled, vs.9,110 capacity). Moreover, all school levels--elemeírfary, middle,
  and high school-had some excess capacity (see Table 5.3-l).
 PROJECTED ENROI,TMENT
 Buiidout of the General Plan will result in the addition of approximately 5,382 housing units,
 with a total buildout population of approximately 57,332. According to the Association of Bay
 Area Governments (ABAG), Cotati is projected to have a popuiation of 9,400by2020.
 Based on General Plan buildout population, Cotati's 2020 population projection, ABAG age-class
projections, and Sonoma County grade-level enrollment projections, decreased enrollment is
expected among elementary school students; middle school enrollment                                                           is

 CRPUSD estimates in the 1997 School Facility Analysis and JustiJìcation Report for School
 Facility Fees are projected only until the 2010-201I school year. Enrollment projections in that
 report are based on constant rates of students per household,3 while current ABAG Projections '98
 expect a decrease in household size and children per household.
 Proiected School Needs
 As shown in Table 5.3-1, the estimated decrease in elementary school enrollment, combined with
 existing excess capacity in 1999, would generate an excess capacity of about 1,200 under General
Plan buildout if the school district boundary is changed. The average capacity of the CRPUSD's
nine elementary schools is 550, suggesting than two or three elementary schools could potentially
be closed as a result of decreased enrollment. In addition, the elementary school site reserved by
CRPUSD on the eastside adjacent to the Creekside Middle School may no longer be needed. The
drop in enrollment is primarily the result of projected decreases in household school-age children
per household, which would counteract the increased number of housing units and households in
Cotati and Rohnert Park.
3 The report expresses the rates on a 'þer home" basis, not specifying whether the unit of measure is "housing unit" or
  "household." Because the repof states that "housing vacancy rates are assumed to remain constant and do not affect [the
  rates]," households--defined as occupied housing units-are implied.
                                                                                                                   5-19

  Rohnert Park General PIan
  Because middle school enrollment is expected to increase only very slightly at buildout with a
 boundary change, assuming 27 stude¡rts per classroom (the State rate), capacity arrtl eruollment
  are likely to be in balance. The estimated increase in high school students is expected to exceed
  1999 capacity at the Rancho Cotate and extension high schools. Additional space would be
 necessary. This would be true regardless of whether the school district boundary is changed or
 not.
 SCHOOT DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGES
 The City does not control school boundaries. However, however, the City can encourage actions
 that  will promote a cohesive community. Procedures for rcorganizing the boundaries of a school
 district are described in $ 35700 of the California Education Code. There are tv/o alternative
 procedures for changing the school district boundaries:
     t   Negotiated Agreement. The CRPUSD and each of the other two districts would mutually
          agree that they would be reorganized "on the basis of a substantial community identity"
         and that the reorganization would not cause a "substantial negative effect on the fiscal
         management or fiscal status of...any existing district affected by the proposed
          reorganization." 'lhe three districts would file a petition with the County Superintendent
         of Schools asking for a reorganization action. A "county committee" comprised of two
         representatives from each of the supewisorial districts and one at-large member would
         vote on the petition. Its recommendation would be sent to the State Board of Education tbr
         action, which is likely to approve the transfer if two or all three districts support it.
     o   Pelition Petition for reorganization by 25 percent or more of registered voters within the
         transfer territory in each of the BUSD and SRHSD districts. This altemative could be
         pursued if agreement could not be reached among the three districts and would be initiated
         by one or more of the property or¡/ners. If the county committee grants the petition but one
         or more of the districts opposes it, an election woulcl be callecl in the territory of the
         districts to vote on the reorganization. The vote would occur at the next available regular
         election.
GOALS: SCHOOTS
PF-A Work        with the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District (CRPUSD) to ensure that all
          school-age children living in Rohnert Park can attend public schools in Rohnert Park,
          without having to travel to adjacent jurisdictions.
PF-B      Work with the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified Sohool District (CRPUSD), with the
          Bellevue Union School District (BUSD), and the Santa Rosa High School District
          (SRHSD), to ensure availability of adequate sites for schools.
PF-C      Work with Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District (CRPUSD) to flrnd alternative
          uses for facilities that are closed or sites and facilities that may not be needed in the

  POLICIES: SCHOOTS
 PF-1     Work actively with the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District (CRPUSD) to amend
          school district bóundaries, so that all new development under this General Plan is
          included in the CRPUSD. Encourage CRPUSD, the Bellewe Union School District
          (BUSD), and the Santa Rosa High School District (SRHSD) to reach a negotiated
          agreement on the boundary changes.
 PF-z    Work with the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District (CRPUSD) to provide
         adequate high school sites and facilities.
         If students from new development in the Rohnert Park Planning Area, including those
         sreas within the BUSD and S&HSD as of 1999, were to enroll at the Rancho Cotate High
        School, demand at buildout ß likely to exceed 1999 capacity, creating the need þr
        additional facilities. The City should encourage CfuPUSD to undertake a comprehensive
        øssessment of facility needs and work with the district to accommodate the districts
        needs. Options to the district include, but are not limited to:
                  o   Expansion of Rancho Cotate High School, or use of temporary classrooms at
                       the high school;
                  o    Construction of a second high schooL As of 1999, capøcity at Rancho Cotate
                      High School was approximately 2,100. Buildings, parking lots, ønd playing
                     fields already occupy the most of the site, Iimiting the potential þr
                      expansion. Construction of ø smaller 51}-student high school can be
                      considered,'
                 o    Retrofr.t and reuse of an elementary school. According to projected
                      enrollment levels, two to three elementary schools can potentially be closed
                      by 2020, while additional space will be needed for hígh school students.
                     Reuse of øn elementary school site could be a considered as an ølternative to
                      building new high school classrooms.
                 t    This option røises issues of displacement of elementary school students from
                     their home neighborhoods, proximity of the "satellite" high school to the
                     Rancho Cotate High School, compatibility with residential neighborhoods,
                     and the feasibility and cost of retrofitting øn elementary school to high
                     school needs. The only elementary school within walking distønce of Røncho
                     Cotate High School is Crane Elementary School, which is approximately a
                     l/4-mile or 5-minute walk away.
PF-3  Require developers to dedicate any necessary school sites to the Cotati-Rohnert Park
      Unified School District (CRPUSD).
      At the time SpeciJic Plans are developed, øn anølysis of the      need þr  additionøl school

  Rohnert Park General Plan
 PF-4    Work with the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District (CRPUSD) to ensure that
         CRPUSD land that is part of the Creekside Middle School site and is not needed tbr
         school facilities is developed in accordance with the General Plan Diagram.
 PF-5 Work with the Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District (CRPUSD) to reuse any
         closed elementary school sites, and ensure that new uses are compatible with acljacent
        Itses.
        Reuse of elementøry school sites should be consistent with surrounding uses. In cøse
        CRPUSD determines that one or more of the sites is no longer needed, appropriate
        alternatives should be considered for each closed site. The Naylor Act allows cities and
        counties to acquire surplus school properties þr recreationøl purposes, so recreationql
        reuse is a possibility. Reuse could include a community servíce center, occupied by ø
        group ofnon-profii organizations, and mønaged by the City or a lessee. The lessee could
        be a non-proJìt organization that also occupies theføcility.
 PF-6   In  case CRPUSD determines that the vacant elementary school site on the eastside
        adjacent to Creekside Middle School is no longer needed for school use, encourage its
        development with Medium Density Residential use.
        Thc appropriatcncss of developing this site þr an elementary school, in viet+, of the

    SEWER SERVICE,1999
    All development within the 1999 City limits rù/as connected to sewer service as of 1999. The City
   also provides sewer service to the Sonoma State University (SSU) campus, located east of the
    1999 City limits. Residential development in Canon Manor, located outside the 1999 City limits
   but within its SOI, is served by septic systems, not City sewers. Sewer mains collect wastewater
   and transport it to the Rohnert Park Pumping Station. As of 1999,the wastewater mains were
   adequate in size to serve the area within the 1999 City limits. A24-inch interceptor sewer main
   extends westward from the pumping station to the treatment plant.
   SUBREGIONAL WASTEWATER DISPOSAT SYSTEM
  Rohnert Park is a partner in the subregional wastewater disposal system, which also serves Santa
  Rosa, Sebastopol, and Cotati. The City of Santa Rosa is the managing partner and has a
  contractual obligation to meet the wastewater treatment and disposal needs of the other partners.
  Wastewater from the subregional system is treated at the Laguna Water Reclamation Treatment
  Plant (LWRTP), located about two miles northwest of Rohnert Park.
  The LWRTP provides primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. Agricultural and                  urban
  irngation is the primary method used to dispose of tertiary wastewater, and river discharge is used
  only as necessary during wet weather. After treatment, tertiary water is stored in containment
 ponds. Water levels in the ponds are monitored, and when they reach maximum capacity, water is
  discharged into the Russian River, which empties into the Pacific Ocean. Based on the City of
  Santa Rosa's NPDES permit for the treatment plan, discharged water cannot exceed 5 percent of
 the river flow.
 The City of Rohnert Park is currently allotted a capacity of 3.22 million gallons per day (mgd) in
 the subregional system, including 0.10 for SSU. Estimated,1999 wastewater flows are shown in
 Table 5.4-1. The City of Cotati funnels wastewater through the Rohnert Park system, but has been
 developing its own connection to the LWRTP and will no longer direct wastewater through
 Rohnert Park as of fall 1999. Cotati has an allocation of 0.62 mgd.

Geysers Recharge Proiect
In the early 1990s, the City of          Santa Rosa initiated the Subregional Long Term Wastewater
Project to bring the subregional system into compliance with the needs of partner cities through
                                                                                                    5-23

   Rohnert Park General Plan
   2010. The wastewater project included expansion of treatment capacity at the LWRTP from 18 to
   2l.2mgd and an increase in reclaimed'water storage and distribution capacity.
   Several alternatives were considered for the wastewater project, including a reclaimed water
   reservoir south of Rohnert Park. The Geysers Recharge alternative was selected in February 1997
   as the preferred alternative. This project will enable the Lagnna Water Reclamation Treatment
   Plan to treat the higher capacity of wastewater, because the Plant is constrained by the amount of
   available online storage, rather than by the amount of water it can physically treat. The City of
   Santa Rosa has opened bids on the first phase of the construction project, and the pipeline is
  projected to become operational by 20024.
  The City of Santa Rosa has a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
  to release treated wastewater from the treatment plant. On March l, 2000, the State Board
  approved an incre,me.ntal capacity inçrease tbr thc Suhregional System, increasing the permitted
  amount of released water from l8 mgd to 19.2 mgd. The allocation of this increased capacity has
  ,vet tu be negotiated. On March 15. 2000. thc State Board approved an additional capaci¡v
  increase for the Subregional System to 21,2 mgd, pending completion of the Geysers Recharge
 project5.
  Storage Pond Expansion
 Because the Geysers Recharge project was developed over many years, starting in the early
  1990s, the City of Santa Rosa initiated and has now completed an interim project to meet
 wastewater needs throughout the county. Online pond storage is the major constraint on
 wastewater treatment capacity, because no wastewater can be directly discharged into the Russian
 River. A storage pond has been completed northwest of Rohnert Park, and the State Board has
 approved an incremental capacity increase for the Subregional System, as described in the
 plevious section.
 TREATMENT CAPACITY NEEDS
 In 1999, average dry weather wastewater flow from Rohnert Park, SSU, and Cotati was 3.50
mgd. In 1998 however, Rohnert Park, SSU, and Cotati exceeded their combined 1999 allocation
 capacity of 3.84 mgd with an average dry weather waste\¡/ater flow of 3.93 mgd, although Cotati
was actually under capacity. Rohnert Park uses the excess capacity of other subregional system
partners, and pays its proportionate share of operation and maintenance costs based on its actual
flow, not on its allocation. Rohnert Park is the only subregional partner over its allocation.
For the purpose of the wastewater project, the wastewater needs of partner cities were based on
adopted General Plans that were cuffent when the wastewater project was being planned.
Buildout of the 1995 Rohnert Park General Plan warranted an increase in capacity fuom 3.22 to
3.81 mgd for Rohnert Park and SSU (or from 3.84 to 4.65 mgd, including Cotati). As shown in
Table 5.4-2, additional capacity is needed to accommodate buildout of this General Plan. This

 Table 5.4-2 provides an estimate of when additional capacity may be needed. Rohnert Park's
 increased capacity allotment from the Geysers Recharge project would be adequate to
 accommodate an additional 2,751 dwelling units and about 2.53 million square feet of non-
residential development, assuming balanced residential/non-residential use development,
sufficient for residential development to about 2012-13.
If Canon Manor hook-ups are not provided, additional capacity will not be needed until2014-15,
and about 3,155 units could be accommodated. A more detailed analysis will need to be prepared
in order to determine wastewater needs and timing with greater precision.

  5.5       WATER SUPPLY AND CONSERVATION
  The City of Rohnert Park currently derives its drinking-water supply from a wellfield consisting
  of 42 municipal supply wells, 3l of which were active in 1999; and eight active connections to
  the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) Petaluma Aqueduct, which supplies water from the
  Russian fuver. The Sonoma County Water Agency operates and maintains a water transmission
  system authorized by the Agreement tbr Water Supply and Construction of Russian River-Cotati
  Intertie Project. Parties to the Agreement are the Agency and eight public entities, including
  Rohnert Park. Table 5.5-l shows the amount of water supplied by each source. The total amount
  of waterpumped from the 3l operational wells in 1999 was approximately 1.5 billion gallons.
 Agricultural users in the vicinity of Rohnert Park use a combination of private well water and
 reclaimed water for irrigation. Canon Manor residences use both shared and individual wells as
 their water supply.

 EXISTING SUPPLY
 Municipal Wells
 Municipal wells are typically 280 to 1,500 feet below ground and tap into an aquifer that lies
under the Santa Rosa plain. The aquifer is recharged from the mountains around the Cotati
Valley. The majority of the wells pump from water-bearing zones present within the alluvial fan
 deposits, Glen Ellen Formation, and Wilson Grove Formation located from 200 to 1,200 t'eet
below ground surface (bgs).
No sites within the existing City limits use private wells for drinking-water supply, although
many sites outside the City limits do, including Canon Manor and Sonoma State University. 'lhe
private wells in the Canon Manor area are usually less than 200 feet in depth. Sonoma State
Unive.rsity maintains ancl operates their own municipal well field that consists of three municipal
supply wells. In 1999, two wells were operated by SSU which produced a total of approximately
 13 million gallons of water for the year (0.04 mgd).
Since at least L966, it was less expensive for the City to pump groundwater as a source to
supplement water-supply requirements, than to purchase water from the SCWA. However, over
time, purchasing water from the SCWA became less expensive due to increased energy costs and
capital and operation costs associated with maintaining a wellfield. Also, groundwater pumping
has been affected by increasing well maintenance requirements. Hence, since the mid-1990s, the
City has used additional SCV/A water and relied less on their municipal wellfield; the excess well

     capacity serves as a back-up system in case ofemergency situations or drought conditions. The
    production rates range from an annual average of approximately 0.8 mgd in 1970 to 4.8 mgd in
     1994.
    Sonoma County Water Agency
    "SCWA provides potable water to more than 500,000 people in Sonoma and Marin counties,
   Rohnert Park receives SCWA water from the Petaluma Aqueduct. The sources of the aqueduct
   water i* are the Dry Creek and Russian River Watersheds, To facilitate water supply, the SCWA
   stores water in two reservoirs, Lake Mendocino and Lake Sonoma. Water from these reservoirs
   is conveyed as released flows to Dry Creek and the Russian River to diversion facilities located
   near the community of Forestville. Water is then diverted, treated, and delivered to the SCWA's
   contractors including Rohnert Park, via the Agency's water transmission system.
   In 1999, Rohnert Park's entitlement to SCWA water r¡/as 1.0 mgd, but the City was able to
  purchase additional water beyond its entitlement. In 1998, the City used 2.62 mgd (annual
  average) of SCWA water.
  Rohnert Park was provided additional water from the unused allocation of another SCWA
  member, the North Marin Water District CNMWD). In 1991, the City of Petaluma entered into an
  agreement with the NMWD that allows NMWD to take excess water from Petaluma's allocation
  in exchange for granting the City of Petaluma permission to connect to the NMWD aqueduct.
  Since then, Rohnert Park has continued to use NMWD's excess allocation.
 To continue to provide a safe, economical, and reliable water supply to meet the future needs of
  SCWA's service area, SCWA proposed the Water Supply and Transmission System Project
 (WSTSP)      in 1998. When  fully constructed and operational, the WSTSP will increase the amount
 of water that can safely be diverted, and increase SCWA's delivery capacity to its service area.
 However, due to delays in implementation resulting from litigation and regulatory constraints, all
 facilities associated with the WSTSP have not been constructed. As a result of SC\MA's ongoing
 Federal Endangered Species Act compliance efforts for listed salmonid species and current
litigation on the WSTSP Environmental Impact Report, SCWA estimates their new water
facilities will not be constructed for ten years. Consequently, current limitations exist in the
Transmission System primanly due to temporary impairment during summertime water
production and new development within the service area.
PROIECTED DEMAND AND CAPACITY NEEDS
In    L999, a-veruge annual water use in Rohnert Park was 6.87 mgd (Table 5.5-l); an annual
average of 4.19 mgd of water was derived from the City of Rohnert Park's municipal well system
and an annual average of 2.68 mgd of water was obtained from SCWA water allocations to
Rohnert Park (1.0 mgd entitlement) and an unused portion of NMWD's allocation (1.68 mgd). As
of 1999/2000, Rohnert Park's population is approximately 41,000. Applying the 1999 average
annual water use of 6.9 mgd and a population of 41,000, it is projected that the City's water
                                                                                                5-29

   Rohnert Park General Plan
   supply requirement to meet the year 2020 buildout at a population of 50,400 is estimated to be an
                                        78
   annual average of 8.5 mgcl.
  As of 2000, a Memorandum of Undcrstanding (MOU) Regarding Water Transmission System
   Capaeity Allocation During Temporary Impairment has been established between the SCWA and
  the eight public parties to whom the SCWÂ provides water supply. The purpose of the MOU is to
  estahlish a procedure to optimize allocation of the available supply of SCWA water among the
  eight public parties during the projected period of temporary impairment of Transmission System
   capacity. As part of the MOU, a temporary delivery capacity allocation (that remains in effect
  until September 2010) was developed which includes the schedule presented in Table 5.5-2 for
  the City of Rohnert Park. The delivery rates are based on historic maximum monthly demand.

 On the basis        of SCWA's allocation schedule developed for Rohnert Park as presented in Table
 5.5-2, and the planned increase for an entitlement of i5 mgd by 2010, the City's reliance on
 groundwater from their municipal wellfield to meet future demands through the 2020 buildout is
 summarizecl below in Table 5.5-3. As indicated, the planned SCWA entitlement of 15.0 mgd hy
2010 would fulfill tuture growth demands fiom 2010 through 2020, and allow the City to reserve
municipal wellfield production for backup and emergency supply purposes. However, during the
interim, the City will continue to rely on their municipal wellfield as a source of water to
supplement the SCWA allocation schedule. Production requirements from the municipal wellfield
are estimated to range           from  I . 9 mgd in 2004 , to 2 .3 mgd in     2009  .
Groundwater conditions were assessed based on historical data and a groundwater study prepared
for the City in May, 2000 entitled City of Rohnert Park Groundwater Study. Conditions indicate
that in previous years, production has exceeded recharge. Comparison of the range of estimated
7
  Total Rohnert Park water consumption divided by the number of residents.

  An altemative way to project future water consumption is to use wastewater flow rates, assuming than all water supplied to
  land uses is ultimately discharged again. For this method, separate rates are used for residential and non-residential uses, as
  well as students. As discussed in Section 5.4, projected wastewater flows are 5.04 mgd under buildout. The 5.04 mgd water
  consumption implies a consumption rate ofonly 100.8 gallons per person per day. At another 40 percent less than 1998
  rates, the rate does not reflect known amounts of consumption.

   annual average recharge rates (0.66           to 3.28  mgd) with the City's municipal wellfield
   requirements during implementation of the General Plan (1.9 to 2.3 mgd as indicated in Table
   5.5-3), indicates the potential for short-term impacts to occur during years of implementation
   from 2000 through 2009 if annual average recharge is less than 1.9 to 2.3 mgd. Annual average
  recharge would be less than I .9 to 2.3 mgd if annual precipitation is less than 36 to 44 inches. The
  magnitude of the impact, if any, depends on the amount of precipitation in years 2000 through
  2009. Policies have been developed to ensure that groundwater levels are not substantially
  lowered.

 Although the infrastructure associated with the current water distribution system is adequate to
 serve areas within the existing City limits, new development extending to the 2020 tJrban Growth
 boundary would necessitate the installation of additional distribution lines to serve the new areas.
 WATER CONSERVATION
 Use of reclaimed water, discharge reduction programs, and water metering are used to promote
 water conservation.
Discharge Reduction Programs
Discharge reduction programs are used to limit wastewater discharge, and reuse of reclaimed
waler, rather than discharge, is the primary method of wastewater disposal. Discharge reduction
programs include the use of water-efficient devices and water-efficient use patterns for both
residential and non-residential uses. Strategies used by Rolnerl Park include:
    a   Distribution of information and conservation devices;
                                                                                                  5-31

  Reclaimed Water
  Rohnert Park uses approximately l0 million gallons of reclaimed water per month in summer
  months and is one of the largest users of reclaimed water in the county. Approximately 270 acres
  in Rohnert Park and on the SSU campus use reclaimed water, out of 570 "urban" acres

  throughout the city. Sites in Rohnert Park that use reclaimed water include all parks and school
  grnunds south of Golf Course Drive, the North and South Rohnert Park Municipal Golf Courses,
  Roberts Lake, and various commercial and industrial sites, including Hewlett Packard, State
  Farm, Press Democrat, Compumotor, and Fresh Choice.
  Water Metering antl Dry-Weather Thresholds
 'l'o reduoe water consumption, Rohnert Park requires water meters on all new consttuction. Ths
 City's Water Shortage Contingency Plan establishes water supply thresholds that trigger
 automatic restrictions on water use during dry weather.
 GOALS: WATER SUPPLY AND CONSERVATION
 PF-E          Provide sufficient quantities of water for Rohnert Park residents and businesses, while
               ensuring that safe groundwater yield is not exceeded.
 PF-F Utilize           purchased water supplies (Table 5.5-2), and reduce reliance                    on groundwater
              drawn from municipal wells, except for emergency use.
PF-G          Continue to encourage water conservation through use of reclaimed water and reduction
              of water consumption and discharge, for both existing and new development.
PF-H Ensure that groundwater                withdrawal does not exceed safe yield.

             monthly basis to ensure that production does not exceed the recharge rates quantified in
             the study so as to result in a substantial lowering of groundwater levels in the vicinity of
             the Urban Growth Boundary.
  PF-l lA     Develop a monthly municipal wellfield monitoring program that (i) identifies points of
            compliance; (ii) establishes the factors to be considered in determining when production
            which exceeds the recharge rates will result in a substantial lowering of groundwater
            levels ("thresholds"); and (iii) includes any other information necessary to implement PF
            11.
 PF-118 In the event that the monthly municipal wellfield monitoring program concludes that a
            substantial lowering of groundwater levels in the vicinity of the Urban Growth Boundary
            will occur because development proposed in the area outside the existing City limits as of
            July 1,2000 requires production that exceeds the appropriate recharge rates, the City
            shall either disapprove such development or deny such development connection to the
           water system until such time that the program concludes that the City is in compliance
           with the standard established in PF-l l.
 PF-12 Work with the Sonoma County Water Agency and other water contractors who rely                   on
           the Petaluma Aqueduct System to ensure adequate water deliveries for all the contractors'
          needs.
          Purchasing additional SCWA water supply can be considered an ølternative, after
          execution of the Memorandum of Understønding, until the increased entitlement is
          implemented. An additional L8 mgd (ønnuøI average) of water is necessary to
          accommodqte buildout. Because provision of the 15.0 mgd entitlement may be delayed by
          litigøtion, purchase of additionøl water may be necessary in the interim. Purchøsing
         waterfrom SCWA is less expensive than building and operating wells.
PF-13 Continue to collect       and analyze monthly groundwater level data to assist in management
         and operation of Rohnert Park's municipal wellfield. Coordinate with other agencies on
         regional drawdown impacts.
PF-14 Require developers to dedicate new well sites in locations identified by the City          and to
         pay for the cost of new wells, water lines, and other water supply infrastructure needed to
         accommodate new development.
         llater mains may need to be         expanded and new wells may be required in order to
         accommodqte new development. Sites dedicated to the City        will need to be returned to the
         dedicatees if not needed þr      the purpose, unless the City's Subdivision Regulations seek
        multi-purp o s e dedic ations.
        Developers should be required not only to install onsite wqter supply lines, but also to
        contribute to the cost of offsite improvements. Chapter 2: Land (Jse and Growth
        Management inchtdes specific policies for assessing costs and prioritizing and
        implementing infrastructure improvements through a Capital Improvement Program.

 6        Environmental Conservation
Rohnert Park and its environs are endowed with a bounty of natural resources, including
undeveloped and developed open spaces, creeks, agricultural resources, and areas with high
potential to sustain wetlands, vernal pools, and wildlife. An overriding goal of the General Plan is
to conserve these natural resources to ensure that future development does not adversely affect
the environment. The Environmental Conservation Element contains goals and policies to
encourage the conservation and proper management of the community's resources. The Element
seeks to:
    a    Guide development in order to
         make wise and prudent use of the
         city's natural and cultural
         resources;
    a    Maintain and enhance the city's
        valuable natural resource areas
        necessary for the continued
        survival of significant wildlife and
        vegetation; and
   a    Ensure the continued protection   of
        the city's natural resources.
                                                                                                6-7

    6.I     HISTORIC AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
   NATIVE AMERICAN CUTTURAL RESOURCES
   The city is located in an area which, prior to Euro-American contact, was inhabited by the Coast
   Miwok Indians and the Southern Pomo lndians. On the alluvial planes in the eastside of the city.
   there are three recorded Native American (CA-SON-1061, CA-SON-I147, and CA-SON-1923)
   archaeological sites.r These sites contain scattered chert and obsidian stone tool manufacturing
   debris, and'stone tools. There are no recorded cultural resources located on the westside.
  The possibility of identifying additional Native American cultural resources can be determined by
  assessing ethnographic information, environmental setting, and the locations of recorded
  archaeological sites. Native American cr¡ltural resources in this portion of Sonoma County tend 1o
  be situated on alluvial plains and atthe base of hills, as well as near former and existing sources
  of water.
  The eastside of the city has high potential for discovery of additional Native American cultural
  resources, for two reasons. First, the presence ofrecorded sites suggests that there may be others
  nearby. Second, the area includes broad alluvial flats near Crane, Copeland, and Hinebaugh
  creeks, and it is next to an area that was once part of a marsh.
  The area west of Rohnert Park encompasses a broad alluvial flat that lies within the boundaries  of
  an historic marsh. Areas within a historic marsh are less likely to contain artit'acts than areas
  beside the historic marsh. No archaeological sites have been recorded on the westside.
  Consequently, there is a low possibility of identification of unrecorded cultural resources in this
  area.
  HISTORIC RESOURCES
 Tlrere are two rccorded historic archaeological sites (C-728 and CA-SON-I9l3H) on the eastside.
 In addition, there are two unofficially recorded historic ranching complexes located in the
 eastside (C-727 and C-728). A third archaeological site located within the eastern project area
 (CA-SON-1574) consists of materials that have been redeposited as a result of analysis conducted
 at Sonoma State University (SSU).
On the westside, there are two recorded historic structures, but they are located west of the
Bellevue-V/ilfred Channel, outside the areas contemplated for growth. Resource C-728 is a tank
house and windmill stand that may have belonged to Robert Crane, an early settler. Resource CA-
SON-1913H is the archaeological remains of a house that was shown on the 1877 Thompson
Atlas.

   In addition to the recorded sites, several historic period buildings and structures located on the
   eastside and westside are depicted on historic maps. Some of them are still standing, while only
  archaeological remains may be left of others. Although several properties along Wilfred Avenue
  on the westside have been identified as being potentially historically significant in State and
  federal inventories, these properties have been determined ineligible for the National Register of
  Historic Places. The possibility remains that additional historic cultural resources will be
  identified in both the eastside and westside in the future.
  Several State laws, most notably CEQA Guidelines $ 15064.5(Ð and Public Resources Code g
  5020-5029 and 21083.2 of the Public Resources Code, protect archaeological and historic
 resources. CEQA requires assessment of the impacts to unique archaeological resources or Native
 American culturally significant sites. If a development project is found to cause damage to the
 resource, reasonable efforts may be required to preserve the resources or leave them in an
 undisturbed state, or undertake additional mitigation measures if avoidance is not possible. To
 protect historic resources, the State has formed the State Historical Resources Committee that
 conducts the State Historic Resource Inventory and maintains the California Register of Historic
 Resources, which identifies historical landmarks and points of interest. The Committee also
 provides recommendations for the National Register of Historic Resources.
 GOALS: HISTORIC AND ARCHAEOIOGICAL RESOURCES
EC-A       Conserve historic and archaeological resources for the aesthetic, educational, economic,
           and scientific contribution they make to Rohnert Park's identity and quality of life.
POLICIES: HISTORIC AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
EC-1       Undertake an inventory of historic resources to determine sites or buildings of federal,
           State, or local historic significance.
           The State Office of Historíc Preservation has determined that buildings or structures 45
          years or older have the potential to be historically significant. Sections 5020-5029 of the
          State Public Resources Code addresses historic resource assessment and protection.
          Since Rohnert Park was first developed in the mid-1950s, the City should undertake this
          inventory over the next decade. Identi/ìed historic resources should be recorded on the
          State Department of Parks and Recreation Historic Resources Inventory Form (DPR
          Form 523).
EC.2      Insure the protection ofknown archaeological resources in the city by requiring a records
         review for any development proposed in areas that are considered archaeologically
         sensitive for Native American and/or historic remains. Require construction activities and
         development adjacent to sites ofhistoric or archaeological resources to avoid degradation
         by:
              .    Studying the potential effects ofdevelopment and construction in the resource;
              .    Requiring pre-construction surveys and monitoring during any ground
                   disturbance for all development in areas of historical and archaeological
                   sensitivity; and
                                                                                                  6-3

     6.2       HABITAT AND BIOLOGICAT RESOURCES
     Several sites in the Planning Area have the potential to support wetlandso vemal pools, rare
     plants, and wildlife, and special status species have been found in the Rohnert Park area. Habitat
    areas and locations ofspecial status species are shown on Figure 6.2-1.
    WETTANDS
    Mapped soil types (USDA 1972), mapped wetlands (USFWS 7987)2, aerial photographs (Aero
    Cartographics 1995), and field assessment conducted in 1997 were used to rank the potential for
    wetland occurrence in the Planning Area, focusing on areas considered for development. The site
    classifications include high, moderate, and low wetlands potential.
    Sites with high wetlands potential include riparian areas, ditches with hydrophytic vegetation,
   mapped wetland areas (USFWS 1987), areas with hydric soils (USDA 1972), and other likely
   wetland arerrs seen in the field and on aerial photographs (Aero Cartographics June 1995).
   Areas    in flat or rolling agricultural fields that had no immediately obvious signs of                  wetlands
   presence were classified as having a modêrate potential to contain wetlands. These areas
   contained mapped soil types that may have hydric soil inclusions, but aerial photograph and field
   analysis did not reveal any well-defined wetland indicators.
   Mounded, sloping, or urbanized areas that showed little capacity for ponding or conveying water
   were characterized as having a low potential to contain wetlands. These characterizations were
  made entirely frorn aerial photographs and reconnaissance-level field ground truthing.
  Because wetlands can occur in existing and abandoned agricultural areas and in riparian areas,
  large portions of the areas considered for development have the potential to contain wetlands. A
  large stretch of land approximately 20 acres in size with high potential for wetlands occurs in the
  area immediately north of the SSU campus, spreading north from Copeland Creek. These are only
 potential areas, however, and wetlands have not been documented in many of areas designated as
 having potential.
 RegulatÍon of Activities in Wetlands
 The US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has primary federal authority for administering
 regulations that concern wetlands within the Planning Area under the Clean Water Act $ 404,
 which governs specified activities in "waters of the United States," including wetlands. The Corps
requires fhat a permit be obtained if a project includes any activity that adversely affects wetlands
and involves placement of dredged or fill material into wetlands. The US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the National Marine
Fisheries Service (NMFS), and several other agencies provide comment on Corps permit

  applications. The  EfA  has provided the primary criteria for evaluating the biological impacts  of
  Corps permit actions in wetlands.
  The State's authority in regulating activities in wetlands and waters at the site resides primarily
  with the Califomia Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the State Water Resources Control
  Board (SV/RCB). The CDFG provides comment on Corps permit actions under the Fish and
  Wildlife Coordination Act. CDFG is also authorized under the State F'ish and Game Code $ 1600-
  1607 to develop mitigation measures and enter into a Stream Alteration Agreement (SSA) with
 applicants that propose a project that would substantially divert, obstruct, or change the natural
 flow ofa iiver, stream or lake; substantially change the bed, channel, or bank ofa river, stream or
 lake; or use material from a streambed. The SWRCB, actingthrough the Regional Water Quality
 Control Board (RWQCB), must certiff that a Corps permit action meets State water quality
 objectives (Clean Water Act $ 401). In addition, CEQA requirements must be met.
 VERNAL POOTS AND RARE PTANT HABITATS
 Agricultural activity and urbanization in the Rohnert Park area has eliminated most natural
 habitat and vegetation, including native vernal pool species. Areas that have not been farmed,
 have been abancloned for some time, or have been used for graz,ing, have the potential to contain
 vernal pools with vernal pool endemic plant species. The potential occurrence of vernal pools and
 special status plant species habitat ,wrìs assessed and rankecl as high, meclittm, or low. Vernal
 pools may provide habitat for rare plants and other species.
Based on analysis ofaerial photographs and soil types, several sites in the Rohnert Park area were
found to have high potential for vernal pools. On the west side, the two identified high-potential
sites are located along the Bellevue-lVilfred Channel. On the east side, the only identified high-
potential site is found along Railroad Avenue near Petaluma Hill Road.
High vernal pool and rare plant habitat potential occurs in areas used for grazing or open space,
with known mapped vernal pool soil types, and clear signatures on aerial photographs. Existing
and abandoned agricultural fields or areas used for grazing with flat to rolling topography were
classified as having a moderate potential to contain vernal pools. Mounded, sloping, farmed,
riparian, or urbanized areas were characterized as having a low potential to contain vernal pools.

 CREEKS
 Rohnert Park's creeks are one of the city's most û'easured natural resources. The creeks, notably
 live,       Crane, Hinebaugh, and Copeland creeks, have been characterized as areas of high potential
 for wetlands, veLnal ptiul, and rarc plant habitat. In atldition, urecks provitlu thc opporturtity fur
 community members to enjoy their aesthetic qualities through use of the pedestrian and bike
paths located along existing creeks in the city. Most of the creeks are channelized to'provide
flood protection and are intermittent, flowing only part of the year because they receive water
from seasonal sources. The creeks have a well-defined channel with distinguishable bed and
bank; evidence of scour or deposit of rock, sand, gravel, or soil; and evidence of riparian
vegetation or aquatic organisms.
Vegetation along waterways                       is limited to          grass and sedge species and introduced landscape
species within the 1999 City Limits. One exception is the Laguna de Santa Rosa Flood Control
Channel southwest of the city, which contains thicker native riparian vegetation including various
willow and alder trees. The creek corridors in the eastside have a high potential to sustain
biological resources and for providing habitat for wildlife as they include several species of
riparian vegetation. In addition to willows and alder trees, these coridors may also contain native
vegetation such as California blackberry, wild grape, wild rose, and non-native species such as
fennel and hemlock. Riparian vegetation helps stabilize banks, decreasing erosion and siltation,
and filters sediment, improving water quality.
SPECIAT STATUS SPECIES
As shown in Table 6.2-1, only four special status species are potentially found within the Rohnert
Park Urban Growth Boundary. Figure 6.2-l shows where the species have been observed and the
potential extent ofarea that potentially serves as the species' habitat.
Two species-the Tri-colored Blackbird and the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog-have                                                       been

   development is planned under General Plan. In addition, two other species-the Northwestem
   Pond Turtle and the Western Yellow-billed Cuckoo-have been observed in the Copeland Creek

  GOALS: HABITAT AND BIOLOGICAT RESOURCES
  EC-B      Protect special status species and supporting habitats within Rohnert Park, including
            species thatare State or federally listed as Endangered, Threatened, or Rare.
            New development projects in ecologically sensitive areas should consider impacts on
            valuable and sensitive natural habitats.
  EC-C Protect sensitive habitat areas and wetlands in the following order of                           protection
            preference: 1) avoidance,2) on-site mitigation, and 3) off-site mitigation.
            These  priorities are in accordance with the California Department of Fish and Game
            guidelines.
  EC-D      Maintain existing native vegetation and encourage planting of native plants and trees.
                                                                                                               6-9

  Rohnert Park General PIan
  POLICIHS: HABITAT AND BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
 Special HabitatAreas
 EC-4    Cooperate with State and federal agencies to ensure that development does not
         substantially affect special status species appearing on any State or federal list of rare,
         endangered, or threatened species. Require assessments of biological resources prior to
         approval of any development within 300 feet of any creeks, high potential wetlands, or
         habitat areas ofidentified special status species, as depicted in Figure 6.2-1.
         Ecologically sensitive sites include areas that are classffied as having high wildlife
         habitat value, high wetlands potential or high vernal pool and rare plant habitat
        potential. Also, special status species have been obsen ed in the vícinity of Rohnert Park.
         Conservation will provide for the perpetuütlon of threatened, endangered, and other rare
         species, as well as the protection of the unique and diverse ecology of these areüs üs a
         whole.
        Development located in or adjacent to these ecologicolly sensitive areas must complele a
        site-speci/ic assessment of biological resources as part of the development review
        process. The Cillt's environmenÍal revi.ew process wou.lrJ. he u.scd. to i.mpose ctppropriøte
        mitigation rneesures on development to reduce impacts on sensitive habitat and special
        status species.
Wetland Conservation
EC-5    Require development in areas with high and moderate wetlands potential and habitat
        areas delineated in Figure 6.2-1, as well as other areas where wetland or habitat for
        special-status species is present, to complete assessments of biological resourçcs."
       Assessments of biological resources would consider the ímpacts on wetlands and the
       special status species supported by this habitat. Appropriate mitigation measures may be
        required as a conditíon of approval for development that signlÍlcantly impacts wetlands
        or special status species. If any development is permitted within wetlands, mitigation
       measures must be considered. This mitigation may include providing wetland habitat of
       the same type as the lost habitat, equal in size or larger than existing conditions. Off-site
       mitigation in designated open space, the community separator, or other similar areqs
       should be required in cases where on-site avoidance or mitigation is not possible. Off-site
       mitigation sites should be as close to the project site as possible.
        Wetlands are a subset    of "waters of the United States" and receive protection under the
       Clean Water Act      $  404.   Wetlands are defined by the federal government ICFR S
       328.3(b), 19911 as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground
       water at a frequency and durotion sfficient to support, and that under normal
       circumstances do support, q prevalence of vegetation typically adapted þr life in
       saturated soil conditions. Under normal circumstances, the federal definition of wetlands
       requires all three wetland identffication parameters to be met, whereas the CDFG
       definition requires the presence of at least one of these parameters. For this reason,
       identification of wetlands by CDFG consists of the union of all areas which are
       periodically inundated or saturated, or in which at least seasonal dominance by

           hydrophytes may be documented, or in which hydric soils are present. The CDFG does
          not normally have direct jurisdiction over wetlands unless they are subject to jurisdiction
           under Streambed Alteration Agreements or they support StateJisted endangered species.
           The CDFG recommends a minimum buffer, measured outward from the edge of any
          wetland, be established to protect the wetlands.
 EC-6 Work with        private, non-profit conservation, and public groups      to secure funding for
          wetland protection and restoration projects.
          Since the City's ability to fund these projecß is limited, funding þr restoration projeits
          should be sought from a variety of sources. The City should consider creation of a
          "wetlands bank" on the westside areas not contemplated for development or in the
         proposed golf course. The bank would provide a large area for off-site mitigation of
         development located elsewhere in the city, in the event that onsite avoidance or
         mitigation is not feasible.
 Native Species
 EC.7    Encourage planting of native vegetation in new development sites, parks, public areas,
         and open space.
         Guidelines should be developed that include a list of native species that may be planted
         as part of landscaping associated with future development. Drought tolerant and low
         mqintenance species should be emphasized.
EC-8 As part of the City's Park, Recreation, and Open Space Master Plan (see Chapter 5: Open
         Space, Parks, and Public Facilities), institute an ongoing program to remove and prevent
        the re-establishment of invasive plant species from ecologically sensitive areas, including
        City parks and other City-owned open space.
        Removal of invasive species from public parks and open space or in areas with high
        wetland potential, is required only where these species are known to threaten habitat for
        special status plant and animal species. Removal of invasive species may also be
        required ifthey are anotablefire hazardinparks or openspace.
Vegetation
EC-9   As part of the City's Capital lmprovement Program (see Policy GM-15 in the Chapter 2:
       Land Use and Growth Management), incorporate a tree planting program for new and
       existing streets and maintenance of existing trees.
       Trees growing in urban settings provide environmental benefits including energ) carbon-
       dioxide absorption, reduced air and noise pollution, and erosion control. Trees also
       beautify, shade, and mitígate the 'urban heat island effect' by shading pavement and
       other dark surfaces and through the cooling fficts of their evapotranspiration. Funding
       should be soughtfrom a variety ofsources, including local conservation groups. Existing
       businesses and residents should be encouraged to plant more trees in parking areas and
       building landscaping. Native tree species should be encouraged over non-native species.
                                                                                                6.LT

  Rohnert Park General Plan
          The City should consider instituting an urban forest management program, establishing
          varietíes, size and spacing requirements, maintenance standards, and priority planting
         schedules.
  EC-10 As part of development approval in any new growth area, require participation in a
         landscape assessment district, with responsibility for maintaining creekways, open
         spaces, landscaped medians, and other similar fbatures.
         Planting of native vegetation with minimal water demand should be encouraged in the
         district.
 EC-ll As part of the update of the City's        Zoning Ordinance, establish landscape and tree
         planting standards, including provisions for large paved areas such as parking lots.
 F,C-12 Protect oaks and other native trees that are of significant size through the establishment of
         a Heritage Tree Preselvation Ordinance.
 Creeks
 EC-13  Maintain creek protection zones extending a minimum of 50 feet (measured from the tops
        of the banks and a strip of land extending laterally outward from the top of each bank) for
        creeks, with extended buffers where significant habitat areas or high potential wetlands
        exist (ligure 6.2-2). Where high potential wetland or other biological resources exist,
        require appropriately wide buffers to encompass and protect the resource. Development
        shall not occur within this zone, except as part of greenway enhancement (fbr example,
        trails and bikeways). Require City approval for the following activities within the creek
        protection zones:
        o    Construction, alteration, or removal of any structure;
        .    Excavation, filling, or grading;
        .    Removal or planting of vegetation (except for removal of invasive plant species); or
        o    Alteration of any embankment.
       Rohnert Park's creeks are a key part of the City's open space network. They are valuabLe
       physical, aesthetic, recreational, and ecological assets. Protection of creeks protects not
        only surface water quality, but also reduces flood risks, preserves bio-diversity and
       habitat, minimizes erosion of stream banks, and prevents downstream siltation. The
        General Plan designates 3.5 miles of creeku,ays in the neu¡ growth areas on the City's
       eastside. Wider buffers-up to about 150 feet from the ueek bank-could be required
       because high potential wetland areas alongside creeks in some areas extend to about a
       15)-þot width.
EC-14 As part of specific plans, require evaluation and implementation of appropriate        measures
       for creek bank stabilization, and any necessary steps to reduce erosion and sedimentation,
       but preserve natural creek channels and riparian vegetation.

    System (NPDES) permit process. Permits are required under NPDES for all publicly operated
    treatment plants and for surface-water runoff in urban areas. These permits specifu the discharge
    limits for certain pollutants and ensure that local industries pre-treat the pollutants they discharge
    into treatment plants.
   For the purposes of administerirrg NPDES, the State Waler Resources Control Board (SWRCB)
   has jurisdiction over nine Regional Vy'ater Quality Control Boards (RV/QCB) in California.
   Rohnert Park falls under the ãuthority of the North Coast RWQCB, which is responsible for
   implementing State policy through the preparation of regional plans for water quality control and
   the regulation of all activities affecting water quality.
  NONPOINT POLLUTION SOURCIS
  The quality of groundwater and water florving into the city's creeks is most likely to be affected
  by nonpoint pollution sources in Rohnert Park, simply because they are not as rigorously
  regulated as point sources. Development can potentially pose a threat to surface and groundwater
  quality through construction sediment, materials used on-site, and related increases in automobile
 use. The RV/QCB has limited the amount of treated wastewater that can be discharged into the
 Russian fuver. Use of reclaimed water for irrigation helps reduce the amount of water discharged
 to the River.
 Rolurc¡l Park curreutly derives its watet-supply fl'om 31 active wells                                   (in 1999) and B active
 connections to the Sonoma County Water Agency's (SC'WA) Petaluma Aqueduct, which supplies
 water from Lake Sonoma, the Russian River, and other sources. The City's water supply and
 water system are regulated by the State Health Service Department. This Department requires that
 the City's water suppiy be tested on a regular basis to guarantee water quality. Tests are
 conducted to assure that maximum contaminant levels are not exceeded. The City and SCWA
have conducted such tests continually and water supplies have consistently met ail State
requirements.
The City periodically obtains well water samples and submits them for laboratory anaiysis. The
laboratory tests are capable of detectíng minute levels of bactena, pesticides, herbicides,
fungicides, organic chemicals, inorganic chemicals, nitrates, radioactivity, corrosivity,
triholomethanes, iron, manganese and other substances for a total of 139 separate items.
In 1999, well                    water did not exhibit concentrations of any pollutants that would be considered
health hazards. In 1997, well water did not meet water quality standards for iron and manganese
6-14

                                                             Chapter 6 : Environmental Conservation
  in five wells prior to treatment. These are not considered health hazards, only nuisance problems.
  After treatment, the levels of iron and         manganese were reduced below the Maximum
  Contaminant Levels (MCL).
  GOALS: WATER QUALITY
  EC-E      Cornply with the Regional Water Quality Control Board's regulations and standards to
           maintain and improve the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources.
  EC-F     Enhance the quality     of surface water and groundwater resources and prevent their
           contamination.
           Contamination may result from erosion, sedimentation, and the dumping of debris and
           refuge.
 EC.G      Undertake steps to minimize the depletion of groundwater resources.
 EC-H      Where feasible, given flood control requirements, maintain the natural condition of
           waterways and flood plains and protect watersheds to ensure adequate groundwater
          recharge and water quality.
 EC-I     Ensure that the Cify's drinking water continues to meet or exceed water quality standards.
 EC-J     Discourage use of insecticides, herbicides, or toxic chemical substances within the city
          and encourage development and use of pesticide and fefülizer management plans for
          landscaped areas.
 POLICIES: WATER QUATITY
EC-15 Continue working with the Regional Water Quality Control Board to protect water
          quality.
          The City is currently exempt from the NPDES requirement, but the City will be required
         to comply with NPDES when the population of Rohnert Park grows beyond.50,000
         people, which it is projected to do at buildout. (See Chapter 7: Health and Safety.)
8C.16 Regularly monitor water quality        to maintain high levels of water quality for     human
         consumption and ecosystem health.
EC-17    Work with the relevant agencies to ensure that groundwater supplies are                  not
         contaminated in the recharge areas east of the city.
EC-I8 Protect waterways by prohibiting the dumping of debris and refuse in and near waterways
         and storm drains.
EC-19 Require ne\ry construction to utilize site preparation, grading, and foundation designs for
         erosion control to prevent sedimentation and contamination of streams.
         Construction activilies such as grading, excavating, and filling, may result         in  the
        exposure of bare soil. Rain and wind may erode this soil, transporting soil particles to
        creeks and storm drain systems          and resulting in declining water quality. The
        sedimentation can reduce the water      flow capacity of these waterways, contributing to
        increas ed ris k offlooding.
                                                                                                 6-75

  EC-20 Prepare and disseminate information about the potentially harmful effects of toxic
        chemical substances ancl safe alternative mea"sures, including information about safe
        alternatives to toxics for home and garden use.
 EC-21 Establish development standards for new construction adjacent to riparian zones to
        recluce secÍimentation ancÍ fioo<Íing.
        Standards s hould include :
             a   Requirements that low berms or other temporary structures such as protection
                fences be built between a construction site and riparian corridor to preclude
                 sheet-flooding stormwater from entering the corridors during the construction
                period.
             a  As part of construction permits, require the installation of storm sewers beþre

                Development standards could also include minimizing paved areas, retaining

    While air quality is largely a regional issue, the protection of air quality is vital to the overall
    health of the environment and the attractiveness of any locality. Since Rohnert Park is located in a
    valley, temperature inversions may occur, preventing the dispersal of pollutants.
    SAN FRANCTSCO BAYAREA AIR BASIN
   Rohnert Park is located in the northern region of the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area air
   basin.  Air quality in the basin is monitored by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
   (BAAQMD), which operates a regional network of air pollution monitoring stations. BAAQMD
   determines if the federal and State standards for criteria air pollutants and emission limits of toxic
   air contaminants are being achieved.
   Under the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA classifies air basins, or portions thereof, as either
   "attairunent" or "nonattairunent" for the national standards. Likewise, an air basin is classified
  under the California Clean Air Act with respect to the achievement of the State standards. The
  Bay Area is considered 'oattainment" for all of the national standards, with the exception of ozone.
  It is considered 'ononattainment" for State standards for ozone and suspended particulate matter
  (PM-10).
  In 7991, the Bay Area '91 Clean Air PIan (1991 Clean Air Plan) was developed to address the
 nonattainment status of the Bay Area with respect to the State ozone standard. The 1991 Clean
 Air Plan included more control strategies than the correspondingBay Area federal ozone plân
 since the State ozone standard is more stringent than the national ozone standard. The l99l Clean
 Air Plan has been updated twice, in 1994 and 1997, with the continued goal of improving air
 quality through tighter industry controls, cleaner fuels and combustion in cars and trucks, and
 increased commute alternatives.
 The Bay Area's air quality is influenced largely by motor vehicle use. Automobile ownership and
 use are increasing at fast rates. However, the trend towards a newer, cleaner vehicle mix will
 serve to counteract some of the negative air quality impact associated with increased vehicle use.
 Overall, a net reduction in the emissions of ozone precursors and carbon monoxide is expected,
 while particulate matter emissions are expected to increase into the future.
CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS
The federal Clean Air Act requires the EPA to identify National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(national standards). The EPA has established national standards for six criteria air pollutants,
including ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, PM-10, and lead. Under
State law, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has established State ambient air quality
standards (State standards) that are generally more stringent than the corresponding national
standards. Pollutants for which ambient air quality standards have been established are referred to
as "criteria air pollutants."
                                                                                                     6-77

   Rohnert Park General Plan
  The BAAQMD air quality monitoring station nearest to Rohnert Park is located in Santa Rosa,
  ten miles north of Rohnert Park. Relatively few days of poor air quality with measured pollutants
  exceeding State standards were recorded at the Santa Rosa monitoring station and improvements
  in air quality havc becn documcnted during thc past 15 ycars. The air pollutant summary for the
  Santa Rosa monitoring station is included in Table 6.4- l.

TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS
Unlike criteria air pollutants, ambient air quality standards have not been established for toxic air
contaminants. These pollutants are typically carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxins.
Regulation of toxic air contaminants is'achieved through federal and State controls on individual
sources. The preferred technique for reducing toxic air emissions is source reduction. As part of a
Iocal control strategy in the Bay Area, all applications for new stationary sources are reviewed to
ensure compliance with required emission controls and limits.
BAAQMD's 1997 Annual Report on its Toxic Air Contaminant Control Proglam lists four dry
cleaners and the Weyerhaeuser Company at 5600 State Farm Drive. These sources do not emit
hazardous quantities of toxic contarninants. The Weyerhaeuser Company's facilities emit 7.2
pounds of benzene per year, considered a small quantity. By way of comparison, various large

  service stations emit more than 7.2 pounds of benzene per year. The amount of pollutants from
  the four dry-cleaning establishments are very low.
  Sensitive Receptors
 Some people are more sensitive than others         to air pollutants, Heightened sensitivity may be
 caused by health problems, proximity to the emissions source, and duration of exposure to air
 pollutants. Sensitive receptors are facilities that house or attract children, the elderly, people with
 illnesses, or others who are especially sensitive to the effects of air pollution. Hospitals, schools,
 convalescent facilities, and residential areas are examples ofsensitive receptors. Residential areas
are considered sensitive to poor air quality as people in residential areas are often at home for
extended periods.
GOALS: AIR QUATITY
EC-K       Continue to work toward improving air quality and meeting all federal and State ambient
           air quality standards and by reducing the generation ofair pollutants both from stationary
          and mobile sources, where feasible.
           WhÌle Rohnert Park's air quality meets State standards, the City has a responsibilíty to
          contribute to regional air quality improvement efforîs.
EC-L      Encourage land use and transportation strategies that promote use of alternatives to the
          automobile for transpoftation, including bicycling, bus transit, and carpooling.
          Motor vehicle emissions, regulation of which is preemptedby State laws, are the major
          source of criteria air pollutants in the Bay Area Air Basin, accounting for the vast
          majority of carbon monoxide and particulate matter and over a quarter of the reactive
          oxygen gas and nitrogen dioxide in the region. A majority of automobile emissions in the
         city result from regional through trips on US 101. Thus, while reduced trffic congestion
         or vehicle miles traveled in Rohnert Park will only minimally impact the Bay Area's qir
         quality, the City's planning decisions can help to moderately reduce motor vehicle use,
         contributing to cumulative reductions in emissions across the entire Bay Area. Increased
         use of transit and carpooling, coupled with land use and circulation pqtterns that
        promote walking and bicycling, can lead to a decreqse in daily trips, less emissions, and
         improved air qualíty.
        Reducing the reliance on automobiles will minimíze air pollution in the city. The
         Transportation Element includes policies for bicycle and pedestrian circulation to reduce
        emissions and alleviate       trffic   congestion. Chapter      2: Land     Use and Growth
        Management includes policies that encourage pedestrian and transit travel between
        home and work and provide housíng near SSU, reducing negative air quality impacts. Of
        particular importance are proposals designed to expand the bicycle route system in
        Rohnert Park and encourage the use of bicycles, development of a rail transit system on
        the Northwestern Pacífic railroad and encouraging use of bus transportation systems.
        See Chapter 4: Transportation .þr related goals and policies.

 EC-22 Cooperate with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to achieve emissions
         redr¡ctions for nonattainment pollutants, including carbon monoxide, ozone, and PM-10,
         by implementation of air pollution control measures as required by State and federal
         statutes.
 EC-23 Use the City's development revierv process and the California Environmental Quality Act
         (CEQA) regulations to evaluate antl rnitigate the looal a¡ul uumulative effects uf new

         BAAQMD's CEQA Guidelines should be used as the fottndation       for the City's review oJ'
         air quality impacts under CEQA.
 EC-24 Adopt the standard construction dust abatement measures included in BAAQMD's
         CEQA Guidelines.
         These measures would reduce exhaust and particulate emissions     from construction and
        grading activities.
 EC-25 Prohibit emission-generating facilities     in the Northwest Specific Plan area or in   the
        planned industrial areas in the southeast.
DC-26 Encourage new residential devclopment and rcmodclcd homcs to install clcan-burning
        fireplaces and wood stoves.
        Many homes in Rohnert Park are equipped with fireplaces, which are a growing source
        of localized air pollution. llood smoke released from fireplaces and wood stoves contains
        carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and PM-10. Wood burning should be encouraged
        only in stoves and fireplaces designed îo minimize air pollutants. Pollution can be
        reduced by installing gas fireplaces or EPA certified wood heaters and operating existing
       /ireplaces andwood stoves more fficiently.

 7       Health and Safety
State law requires that the Health and Safety Element address the protection of the community
from risks posed by environmental hazards. These include effects of seismically induced surface
rupture, ground shaking, and ground failure, geologic hazards including landslides and
subsidence, flooding, and hazardous materials and waste. The Health and Safety Element
addresses these topics as well as emergency preparedness and management.
                                                                                            7-7

    7.T      SEISMIC AND GEOTOGIC HAZARDS
   GEOTOGYAND SOITS
   Rohneil Park is located in the Santa Rosa-Petali¡ma Valley where the ünderlying geologic
   structure is characterizedby sediments deposited by streams on floodplains, alluvial deposits, and
   basins. This geologic structure is depicted in Figure 7.i-l. Overall, general geologic conditions,
   slopes, and soils do not vary significantly from one part ofthe city to another.
   The geologic formations in Rohnert Park range in age from Jurassic to Holocene. The Franciscan
   Complex of Jurassic-Cretaceous age is the oldest geologic unit and constitutes the basement rock
  in the vicinity. The Franciscan Complex consists of a chaotic mixture of deformed sedimentary,
  igneous, and metamorphic rocks. Although at a great depth beneath Cotati valley, the Franciscan
  is exposed in the surrounding highlands. During the late Tertiary age, marine sediments and
  volcanic rocks were deposited over & large area of the Franoiscan Complex. Sedimentary rocks of
  the Petaluma formation and volcanic rocks of the Sonoma group underlie the valley alluvium and
  are exposed in the hills to the east. Several hundred feet of alluvial sediments of Quaternary age
  have been depositcd in thc Cotati Vallc¡, by strcams draining thc surrounding highland arcar.
  Soils rvithin tho oity are almoot ontiroly Cloar Laks olays, as shown in Figure 7.1-2. The soils,
  typical of poorly drained basins and floodplains, were formed from alluvial sediments derivecl
  from the sunounding highlands. Clear Lake clays typically have low permeability, slow runoff
 characteristics, low erosion potential, high shrink-swell potential, and rnay be corosive tt¡
  unuo¿ted steel products2.
 SEISMIC HAZARDS
 There are no known active faults within Rohnert Park. The llealdsburg-Rodgers Creek fault zone
 lies about five miles to the east of the city. The San Andreas Fault System is located
 approximately 15 miles west of the city. During the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, Rohnert Park
 experienced sustaincd shaking lasting 15 scconds and little damage. Secondary scismic hazards
that could affect Rohnert Park include ground-shaking, liquefaction, and ground settlement. Since
virtually all construction in Rohnert Park occurred after the incorporation of earthquake safety
design in California construction, there are no known structures in Rohnert Park that would be
specifically hazardous during an earthquake, such as unreinforced masonry buildings. The City's
Emergency Management Plan is discussed in Section 7.5.

  LANDSTID E AND TIQUEF'ACTION HAZARDS
  Given the relatively flat topography and the nature of soi1s, the¡e is little risk of mudslides,
  lancislicles, or erosion in the immcdiatc Rohncrt Park arca. Soil liqucfaction has the potential to
  impact the Rohnert Park area during a significant earthquake. Liquefaction occurs when soils lose
  their bearing capacity during a seismic event. The potential for liquefaction depends on the type
 of soil anri the extent that the soils are safurated with ground water. Soils underlying almost the
 entire area within the city exhibit moderate susceptibility           to  liquefaction. Liquefaction
 srrsceptihility is shown on Figure 7.1-2.
 The seasonal expansion and contraction of Clear Lake clays can cause gradual cracking,
 differential settling, and weakening of structures ancl roa<lways. Perhaps the most visible example
 of the effects of Clear Lake clays is the cracked driveways and foundations in older sections of
 Rohnert Park.

   7.2       DRAINAGE, EROSION, STORMWATER, AND FTOODING
   DRAINAGE
   Creeks that drain the mountainsides flow into drainage channels that transverse Rohnert Park
   generally from east to west. Excluding a small area near East Railroad Avenue, the city drains
   westerly to the Laguna de Santa Rosa Creek. The area near East Railroad Avenue drains south to
   Lichau Creek, which flows into the Petaluma River.
   Gravel and silt may wash from the slopes into these drainage channels. In recent years, gravel and
  silt were deposited in an enclosed stormwater drain underneath Goldridge Elementary School and
  Golis Park. The materials reduced the capacity of the stormwater drain resulting in localized
  street flooding. The problem has been addressed by annual clearing of the stormwater drain. The
  Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) installed a siltation basin east of Petaluma Hill Road to
  intercept the gravel and silt. The city's drainage and 100- and 500-year flood zones are shown in
  Figure  7 .2-7.
  Mud and Debris Flows
 Mud and debris flows originate in hillside areas having deep topsoil with poor drainage
 characteristics. Sloped hillsides, which may be the source of mud and debris flows, are located
 approximately a mile east of Petaluma Hill Road. Given the topography, such mud and debris
 flows would be channeled into drainage ways that generally flow east to west within the Rohnert
 Park area. The SCWA regularly removes gravel and silt from these channels to maintain their
 ability to adequately handle stormwater flows.
 EROSION
 As shown in Figure 7.2-1, erosion potential is low for almost all soils in the city, according to US
 Soil Conservation Service ratings. This low potential is primarily related to high soil stability
 since the slopes in the city are generally less than 2 percent. Erosion is presumably higher for
 soils in the vicinity of creeks, as well as for loam soils and ponded clay soils. Instances of
 significant erosion are most likely during construction. The formation of embankments or uneven
topography, the effects of machinery, and the removal of vegetation, can contribute to increased
rates oferosion.
STORMWATER
Rohnert Park's storm drainage is under joint management of the City and the SCV/A. The City
maintains responsibility for the system of underground pipes that provides for minor and
intermediate drainage, while SCWA maintains the system of open channels that diverts major
drainage flows west towards the Laguna de Santa Rosa. Both the open channels and pipe systems
are designed to meet SCV/A standards and comply with the National Flood Hazard Insurance
Program.
Amendments to the Clean Water Act established a two-phased approach to addressing storm
water discharges. Phase I, which is currently being implemented, requires National Pollutant
                                                                                                   7-7
   Rohnert Park General Plan
   Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for separate storm water systems serving large-
   and medium-sizecl communities (those with over 50,000 inhabitants), and for storm water
   discharges associated with industrial and construction activity involving at least five acres.
   Buildout of this General Plan is exoected to increase Rohnert Park's pooulation to about 50.000.
  Phase    II, which is currently under development by the US Environmental Protection Agency
  (EPA), will address remaining storm water discharges, including urban areas with populations
  under 50,000, smaller construction sites, and retail, commercial, and residential activities.
  NPDES requirements and regulations are expected to be similar for all cities with populations
   greater than 10,000.
  As shown in Figure 7.2-2, there are a few isolated areas within the 1999 City Limits that are
  located within the 100-year floocl zone. Approximately 60 acres of land clesignated for future
  development in the eastside is located in the 100-year flood zone, primarily along Copelancl
  Creek and the Hinebaugh Flood Control Channel. A small portion of land within the ÏVilfred-
 Dowdell Specific Plan Area in the westside is located in the 500-year flood zone.
 The City enforces flood control standards within 100-year flood hazard areas in accord with the
 requirements of the National Flood Hazard Insurance Program. In addition to 100-year flood
 hazard areas, localized, relatively minor flooding has occurred within Rohnert Park in recent
 years.
 Natural flooding results from major rainstorms that cause overflows of stream courses, and may
 be aggravated by inadequacies in local storm drain facilities. Flooding may occur in two ways:
 a    Stormwater may overflow the banks       of drainage ways because the water flow    exceeds the
      channcl capacity; or
 a    Stormwater may back up and collect in a low area because       it cannot flow into a receiving
      drainage channel.

    One area that experienced street flooding prior to 1999 was in the "G" Section neighborhood.
    Gravel and silt partially filled and reduced the capacity of an underground storm water drain.
   During a subsequent storm, storm water backed up street drains. The storm drain has since been
   cleared of gravel and silt. The SCWA installed a siltation basin to intercept gravel and silt east of
   Petaluma  Hill Road.
   Localized flooding also occurred in the "F" Section. In this instance, storm water backed up into
   low lying streets, the North Rohnert Park Municipal Golf Course, and adjacent parcels because
   storm water was unable to flow into the Bellevue-Wilfred Channel and the Laguna de Santa Rosa.
  Another area of local flooding in 1999 included portions of the Rancho Verde Mobile Home
  Park, parts of Martin Avenue, and adjacent commercial/industrial parcels. In this instance storm
  water backed up and was unable to flow into the Labath Channel. As the rain tapered off and the
  level of the Laguna de Santa Rosa fell, storm water drained from the flooded areas.
 Silt deposited over the years in the Bellevue-Wilfred, Laguna de Santa Rosa, and Labath Flood
 Control Channels has reduced the capacity of these channels, which has contributed to the
 flooding problems. The SCWA widened both the Bellevue-Wilfred Flood Control Channel and
 the Laguna de Santa Rosa and plans to remove accumulated silt in the near future.
 SCWA Capital Proiects Plan
 Rohnert Park participates      in the planning and development of drainage and flood control
 activities within the Laguna-Mark West Zone 14, administered by SCWA. In March 1998,
 SCWA circulated a revised Capital Projects Plan for Fiscal Year 1999 to Fiscal Year 2003.
 Projects in the Capital Projects Plan include improvements for the County's seven designated
flood control zones.
The Capital Projects Plan identifies 17 projects for fundinginZone lA. Projects were identified
by an Advisory Cornmittee for the Flood Control Zone, appointed by the SCWA's Board of
Directors. Information and criteria used for selecting projects include historical flooding
problems, areas benefited, altemative funding available, special safety and health factors,
coordination with other public projects, and environmental concerns. Several of the projects will
directly help improve potential flooding problems in the Rohnert Park area. All projects are
scheduled for completion by the end of Fiscal Year 2000.

            The City should recommend the use of high infiltration measures to reduce stormwater
            discharge into the regional storm drain system. Measures to divert surface runoff into
            open areas that have hígh ín/ìltration capabilities could include ponds built into
            landscapes, unlinedrunofchannels, and dispersionpoints into landscaped areas. llhere
            possible and technically feasible, roof tops and paved areas should drain into
            underground dispersal pipes or vegetated percolation beds. Landscaping in parking lots
            and around building perimeters should be maximized.
            The City shall review and approve the proposed drainage system requirements prior to
            construction on the project site.

 HS-6     As part of the building permit process, require new development greater than five acres in
          size to prepare and implement a site-specific storm water pollution prevention plan
         (SWPPP) that effectively reduces discharges of stormwater containing sediment and
         other pollutants resulting from site construction activities. ln addition, require all projects,
         regardless of size, to comply with any other stormwater provisions of the specific plans
         for their respective areas.

HS-8   Systematically conduct maintenance, make repairs, or improve drainage facilities to
       minimize localized flooding during rainstorms. Provide treatment to first-flush runoff
       flows, street sweeping programs, and additional source controls to minimize non-point
       source pollution.
      Maintenance should occur more frequently during the winter.
HS-9 Use the City's developrnent      review process to ensure that proposed development located
      in   1O0-year flood zones undertakes measures to provide adequate protection from flood

     7.3      SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
    The City is responsible for waste collections and diversion within the incorporated limits. Solid
    waste disposal facilities are owned and operated by the Sonoma County Department of
    Transportation and Public lVorks, which also helps maintain the County Integrated Waste
    Management PIan (CoIWMP) jointly with the Sonoma County Waste Management Agency
    (scwMA).
    The California Waste Management Act, passed in 1989, required cities to prepare solid waste
   management planning documents that demonstrate how they would reduce the amount of waste
   sent to landfills by 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by the year 2000. These planning
   documents are known as the Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE) and Household
   Hazardous Waste Element (HHWE). The SRRE includes four main components: source
   reduction, recycling, composting, and special waste. Each component identifies existing diversion
   programs and examines, evaluates, and selects future diversion programs. Hazardous waste is
   discussed in Section 7.4.
  Rohnert Park's SRRE and HHWE, both adopted in 1992, were incorporated into the 1994
  CoIWMP, which consolidates the SRREs and HHTWEs prepared by each jurisdiction in Sonoma
  County. The CoIWMP, which includes a Facilify Siting Element, is required to demonstrate the
  county's long-term ability to ensure the implementation of countywide diversion programs and to
  provide adequate disposal for localjurisdictions through the siting ofdisposal and transformation
  facilities.
  SOLID WASTE
 In 1995, Rohnert Park achieved a diversion or source reduction rate of 39 percent, which was l4
 percent higher than the 1995 statewide diversion goal. However, in 1997, this rate fell to 38
 percent, which is 6 percent higher than the estimated state diversion rate. Some of this success
 was due to the County's comprehensive approach to waste reduction. Diversion goals are met
 through a combination of local and countywide source reduction, recycling, and composting
 programs. In adopting this approach, Rohnert Park has agreed in concept to sponsor or develop
jointly some programs and facilities with neighboring communities or with the County.
 COLLECTION AND RECYCLING
Municipal solid waste is transported to the Central Disposal Site owned and operated by Sonoma
County Public Works Department. The site is located approximately fîve miles southwest of the
city in unincorporated Sonoma County. The City does not currently hold a disposal contract
directly with the landfill, but contracts for collection and disposal services with private haulers. In
1997, Rohnert Park disposed of 50,528 tons of solid waste (see Table 7.3-l). Of the solid waste
generated, 51 percent was used for fuel, 25 percent was recycled, 12 percent was landfilled, eight
percent was incinerated, and four percent was treated. Over 4,000 tons of recyclables were
collected through residential curbsi<le and commercial collection. Furthermore, over 5,000 tons of
yard debris and wood waste was composted.
                                                                                                  7-15

 The City contracts out to Empire Waste Management for refuse hauling and curbside recycling
 services for single-family residents. Although there are no buy-back centers in Rohnert Park, two
 are located north of the city. Commercial recycling includes cardboard, glass, newspaper, and
 office paper collection. Approximately 2,951tons of materials were collection through residenfial
 curbside collection and 1,070 tons through commercial collection.
 The SCWMA sponsors several other waste reduction etÏorts including the Eco-Desk hotline, the
 annual Sonoma County Recycling Guide, the SonoMax waste exchange, master gardener home
 composting workshops, the Recycling Market Development Zone, and Household Toxics
 Roundups. The regional approac.h of the SCWMA has helped Sonoma County reduce solid waste
 at the lowest possible cost.
 Expansion of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities
Given curent capacity and projected diversion rates, the Central Landfill is expected to reach
 capacity in approximately 2005. The expansion of the Central Landfill was recently approved by
the County, allowing for disposal of solid waste up to 2010.
GOALS: SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCIING
HS-D       Reduce the generation of solid waste and recycle those materials that are used, to slow
           the filling of local and regional landfills, in accord with the California Integrated Waste
           Management Act       of 1989.
POLICIES: SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCTING
HS-12 Continue to work toward reducing solid waste and increasing recycling, in compliance
           with the Sonoma County Integrated Waste Management Plan.
           Rohnert Park has       a responsibility to meet regional source reduction and recycling
           initiatives in order to achieve State-mandated waste reduction targets and extend the
           useful life of existing landfillfacilities.

 HS-13 As part of development review and environmental analysis, ensure that new multifamily
         residential and all non-residential development comply with the City's Source Reduction
         and Recycling Element (SRRE) and Household Hazardous Waste Element (HHWE),            as
         well as the Sonoma County Integrated Waste Management plan (CoIWMp).
        Multifamily residentíal development includes any residential structures with two or more
        dwelling units.
HS-14 As part of the City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP), the Parks, Recreation, and
        Open Space (PROS) Master Plan, and other programs, explore the feasibility of installing
        recycling receptacles for plastic and glass beverage containers and papers in parks and
       other public areas (for example, community recreational facilities, transit stops, and
       mixed-use districts).
       The City and SCWA should consider other recycling strategies, including expandíng
       recycling collection at commercial and multifamily housing.
HS-15 Require new multifamily residential and all non-residential development to incorporate
       attractive and convenient interior and exterior storage areas for recyclables into new or
      remodeled buildings, to make recycling activities more convenient for those who use the
      buildings.
      Existing commercial businesses and business parks should be encouraged to install
      recycling receptacles on their premises. Multifamily residential development includes any
      residential structures with two or more dwelling units.
                                                                                            7-r7

   7.4     HAZARDOUSMATERIALS
   Hazardous materials include a large number of substances that may be dangerous to the public    if
   improperly stored, handled, or disposed. These include toxic metals, chemicals, and gases;
   flammable and/or explosive liquids and solids; corrosive materials; infectious substances; and
   radioactive material. Hazardous materials, according to the State Health and Safety Code $
   25501(o), "include, but are not limited to, hazardous substances, hazardous waste, and any
  material which a handler or the administering agency has a reasonable basis for believing that it
  would be injurious to the health and safbty of persons or harmf'ul to the environment if released
  into the worþlace or the environment."
  WASTE MANAGEMENT AGENCY
  In accordance with local Households Hazardous Waste Elements (HHWE) and the CoIWMP, the
  Sonoma County Waste Management Agency (SCWMA) conducts a range of hazardous waste
  programs. SCV/MA conducts hazardous waste collection events at sites throughout Sonoma
  County. Over ten events are held each year, generally during dry weather months. At least one
 event is held in Rohnert Park. Rohnert Park businesses and residents may dispose of hazardous
 waste at any event in the County. Hazardous materials collected are packaged and taken to
 disposal sites outside Sonoma County.
 The Agency plans to establish a permanent hazardous waste collection and temporary storage
 facility at the Central Lamllill. 't'tre tàcility will be open [o collect hazartlous malerials on a
 weekly basis. Hazardous materials will be transported to disposal sites outside Sonoma County.
 SCWMA annually conducts hazardous waste education efforts. These education efforts include
 distribution of a recycling guide to nearly all households in Sonoma County. The guide lists how
 to avoid, store, and dispose of household hazardous materials. Ongoing public education
 campaigns are funded by the SCWMA and grant funds.
 Industrial and Commercial Hazardous Materials
 State law requires that communities form a Consolidated Unified Protection Agency (CUPA).
The CUPA manages the acquisition, maintenance, and control of hazardous waste by industrial
and commercial businesses. Rohnert Park contracts with Sonoma County for this service.
HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE
Hazardous waste is generated in homes and businesses alike, and includes products such as paint,
batteries, fertilizers, and used motor oil. These wastes are of concern because they are often
improperly managed, resulting in injuries to sanitation workers and damage to collection vehicles,
as well as possible toxics leaching from sanitary landfills. Management of hazardous waste in
Rohnert Park occurs under the 1992 HH\ME, which was incorporated into the Sonoma County
Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
The City's HHWE addresses the wastes that stem from a variety of common household products.
Rohnert Park's household hazardous waste management program, outlined in the HHWE,

                                                                         Chapter 7: Health and Safety
    emphasizes public education, source reduction and recycling, mobile and permanent collection
    facilities, and hazañous waste load checking. Household hazardous waste is collected and
    disposed of by licensed haulers. Furthermore, SCV/MA and the City created a network of private
    businesses that collect used oil in Rohnert Park. In 1990, it was estimated that Rohnert Park
   residents generated 20 tons of hazardous waste per year - of which 13 tons are estimated to be
   either illegally disposed of or stored in homes in Rohnert Park. Only four percent of Rohnert
   Park's households participated in the County Disposal Program in 1997.
   The City currently participates in a SCWMA hazardous waste disposal program, allowing
   Rohnert Park residents to dispose of hazardous waste in nearby cities. SCWMA plans to establish
   a permanent collection facility at the Central landfill and reduce the periodic collection events in
   urban areas.
  HAZARDOUS MATERIATS DISPOSAT STTES
  There are no hazardous material disposal sites in operation in the Rohnert Park area. All
  hazardous waste is placed in containers and shipped to sites outside the community.
  The Rohnert Park area does not contain any known historical hazardous material disposal sites.
  Underground tanks containing petroleum products at scattered sites in the community may have
  contaminated subsurface earth. Regular, highly detailed, laboratory testing of water from the
 city's wells, scattered throughout the community, has not detected contaminants from
 underground tanks or other hazardous materials.
 The City's Department of Public Safety investigates illegal hazardous waste dumping. Most
 illegal hazardous waste dumping in Rohnert Park consists of the disposal of oil and gasoline in
 storm drains. Signs discouraging hazardous waste dumping were installed in 1997 above all storm
 drain inlets in the city.
Hazardous Materials Transfer Station
The Safety Kleen Corporation operates a hazardous materials transfer station in Rohnert Park.
The total amount of hazardous materials stored at any given time is 2,000 gallons. Hazardous
materials are shipped to the company's plant in Reedley, California, for treatment. The primary
hazardous mateúal is 1,450 gallons per day, on average, of the mineral spirit Stoddard Solvent. In
addition, the transfer station stores approximately 40 gallons of Percloethylene (Perk), a cleaning
solvent used by dry cleaning businesses, and 40 gallons of lacquer thinner per day. Toxic
materials are obtained from an area extending from San Francisco to Eureka. The recycled
materials are sold back to the same businesses. The company does not treat or dispose of any
hazardous materials on the Safety Kleen site in Rohnert Park.
GOALS: HAZARDOUS MATERIATS
HS-E Minimize        the risk to life and property from the generation, storage, and transportation of
           hazardous materials and waste in Rohneft Palk and assure the proper disposal of all

     7.5     EMERGENCYMANAGEMENT
     EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
     The California Emergencies Services Act (State Government Code $ 8550-3668) requires each
    city to prepare and maintain an Emergency Plan for natural, manmade, or war-caused
    emergencies which result in conditions of disaster or in extreme peril to life. Peacetime
    emergencies that should be addressed by the Plan include earthquakes, fires, and floods. In 1995,
    the City adopted a Standardized Emergency Management Plan, which describes the principles
    and methods to be applied in carying out emergency operations or rendering mutual aid during
    emergencies. The Department of Public Safety (DPS) has developed the StandardizedEmergency
    Management System with Annexes, which is consistent with the requirements of the California
    Emergencies Services Act. The system is updated and revised on an annual basis.
   All City   departments play a role   in the plans and have specific assignments to perform in
   emergencies. The City coordinates its planning with the County Office of Emergency Services to
   keep the plans up to date. The City also participates in periodic city and countywlde àisaster drills
   that are held to evaluate and critique emergency service preparedness. The Public Safety
   Headquarters has been designed       to function as an Emergency         Operations Center  for  the
   community.
   City emergency preparedness planning focuses on immediate threat to life and property. One
   generally accepted rule-oÊthumb is that citizens and businesses should not expect assistance until
   T2hours after a disaster, unless there is an immediate threat to life or property. After a disaster,
   municipal resources may be limited and must be dispatched to the most serious emergencies.
   Earthquake Response
  The City is prepared to meet the emergency service needs after a ooworst case" earthquake. In
   1995,the City revised the "Threat Summary, Earthquake" section of the Stand ardizedEmergency
  Management Plan. This summary details the impacts of an earthquake of a magnitude of 8.3 on
  the northem San Andreas Fault.
  Response to Hazardous Materials Spilis
 The City currently maintains a hazardous materials response plan. The Plan builds upon the
 Sonoma County Operational AreaHazardous Materials Incident Response Plan. The goals of the
 City's hazardous materials planning are to contain and identiff hazardous materials spills and to
 implement evacuation, clean up, and disposal.
The DPS maintains ahazardous materials team. Members of this team have completed extensive
training and qualiff as Hazardous Materials Technicians or Specialists. Should a hazardous
materials event occur within the city, the hazardous materials team will take a leading role in
protecting the public. The team will follow general response guirlelines but must fit the response
to the specific incident.
                                                                                                  7-27

  Rohnert Park General Plan
  Numerous types of hazardous materials are transported on US 101. The California Highway
  Patrol is responsible for hazardous materials accidents on the Highway. The City maintains
  oommunication links with these agencies and participates, as necessary, in responses to hazarclous
 materials accidents.
 EMERGENCYMEDICAT CARE
 Sonomâ Ltfe Support provides ambulance service in Rohnert Park. Sonorna Life Suppurt is a
 ¡rrivate emergency medical provider that was granted the contract to providc emergency serviccs
 for the oentral Sonoma County Franchise area in 1991. The purpose of the franchise is to provide
 emergency medical services to all sectors of the population regardless of ability to pay, support
 the system through fees and minimize cost through public regulation of the service provider.
 Sonoma County monitors the service provider, ensuring that Sonoma Life Support maintains the
 requirecl service levels.
 A single ambulance station serves the City of Rohnert Park. The station is housed in leased   space
 generally located near the center of the city. Units located elsewhere in the county provide backup
 servico as noeded. A pcramedic and other necessary staff at all times staff the station. Emergency
 services are provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ambulance c.ontains full
 communications inoluding radio and phone linking the ambulance 'rvith the Santa Rosa and
 Petaluma hospitals.
 POLICE, FIRE, AND RIIATED SERVICES
DPS provides police, fire, and related services in the community according to the public safety
administrative concept. Cross-trained personnel under a single administrative umbrella furnish
police and fire services.
Key procedures help implement the public safety concept in Rohnert Park. First, DPS personnel
are issued personal pagers and home alert devices. This allows personnel to be contacted by
dispatchers in cases when additional staff is needed during an emergency. Second, public safèty
officers must live within a reasonable proximity to the community. Third, the City issues vehicles
to officers. The vehicles are parked at officers' homes during off-duty hours. Officers cary fire
turnout gear, water and dry chemical fire extinguishers, emergency medical, and other items in
their vchicle.

I        Noise
California Government Code $ 65302(Ð requires that each general plan have a noise element.
The purpose of the element is to identify existing noise problems in the community and to
provide guidance to planners and developers for avoiding future problems.
                                                                                      8-1

  8.1      NOISE CHARACTERISTICS
  Noise can be defined as a sountl or series of suuntls tlËt ars intrusive, irritating, olrjectionable
   and/or disruptive to sleep, speech, and other activity. The known effects of noise on humans
  include hearing loss, communication interference, sleep interference, physiological responses,
  and annoyance. Generally, residential and public uses are mote noise-sensitive than commercial
  and industrial uses.
  THRESHOLDS AND STANDARDS
 Reported noise levels are expressed as a function of time (because noise varies over time) and
 time of day (because people are more sensitive to nighttime than daytime noise). Community
 Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and Day-Night Noise Level (Ldn) both reflect noise exposure
 over an avetage day, with weighting to reflect nighttime sensitivity. Ldn is commonly uscd for
 measuring community noise levels, although CNEL is used to measure aircraft noise levels, in
 conjunction with State standards. The following are generally accepted thresholds of noise
 interference:
      .   Speech Interþrence. Thresholds for speech interference intloors a¡e about 45 dB if thc
          noise is stcady and above 55 dB if the noise is fluctuating. Otttdoors, the thresholcls are
          about 15 dB higher.
      .   Sleep Interference. Steady noise above 35 dB and fluctuating noise levels above about 45
          dB may affect sleep.
Interior residential standards for multi-family dwellings are set by the State of California at 45 dB
Ldn. The standard is designed for sleep and speech protection and most jurisdictions apply the
same criterion for all residential uses.
STRUCTURAL ATTENUATION
With open windows, typical structural attenuation is 12-17 dB; with closed windows, attenuation
is 20 dB for older structures and 25 dB for newer structures. Special glass or double-paned
windows can provide additional attenuation.

    8.2       NOISE IN ROHNERT PARK
   The major source of noise in Rohnert Park is traffic along major roadways. US 101, Rohnert Park
   Expressway, Snyder Lane, Southwest Boulevard, East Cotati Avenue, and Golf Course Drive
   have been identified as the major sources of roadway traffic noise. A secondary source of noise
   is the railroad which faverses the city.
   1997 CONDITIONS
   In 1997, trafftc noise levels in Rohnert Park were calculated using the Federal Highway
  Administration's noise prediction model (FHWA-RD-77-108) and the Califomia Vehicle Noise
  Emission Levels model, developed by Caltrans. The results are shown in Table 8.3-1. Only the
  roadways that would generate a 60 dB Ldn beyond a distance of 50 feet from the roadway
  centerline are listed. Because of minimal development in the city and few changes in traffic
 patterns or distribution, noise conditions did not go through any perceptible changes between
  1997 and1999.
 Regular rail service along the Northwestern Pacific (NP) Railroad right-of-way was intemrpted in
  1998 due to stormwater damage. As of 1999, limited rail service was resumed. The NP Railroad
 operates about one train per day and, one train every other night through Rohnert Park. Rail
 operations result in noise levels in excess of 69 dB Ldn up to 100 feet from the tracks and in
 excess of60 dB Ldn up to 300 feet from the tracks.
 The Sonoma Airport (12 miles northeast of Rohnert Park) and Petaluma Airport (8 miles
 southeast of Rohnert Park) impose no appreciable noise impacts on the city. Aircraft from the two
 airports reach an altitude of more than 1,000 feet when flying over Rohnert Park.

PROJECTED CONDITIONS UNDER GENERAL PLAN BUITDOUT
Estimates of roadway noise levels under General Plan buildout were based on projected traffic
volumes and speeds, as documented in Chapter 4: Transportation. The noise analysis also takes
into account the new roadways planned for the eastside, westside, Canon Manor, and southeast
areas, as shown in Figure 4.1-1. Perceptible noise increases (3 dB or more) resulting from traffic
under General Plan buildout are listed in Table 8.2-2. Noise contours are sho'trn in Figure 8.2-1.

   7. Only roadway segments that would have a noise level ofmore than 60 dB Ldn at  100 feet from the
   roadway centerlíne are shown. New roadways and extensíons (Labatlt Avenue, Sturdevant Dñve, New
   Linear Park Road, and Eleanor Avenue) would all have noise levels below 60 dB at 100 feet from the
   centerlíne.
   Source: lllingworth & Rodkin, Acoustical Engíneers
  Most new roadway segments are predicted to have noise levels less than 60 dB Ldn at a distance
  of about 100 feet, with the exception of the two new US 101 crossings at V/ilfred Avenue and
  State l.ann Drivc. Nuise levels lesultitrg fiour tlaffic along the two ne"¡¡ highway crossings will be
 dominated by noise generated by US 101. Areas along new roadways on the eastside would have
 noise levels between 60 and 65 dB Ldn, as shown on Figure 8.2-1.
 If train activìty along the NP Railroad right-of-way is increased, noise-sensitive land uses in
 proximity to the line could be exposed to excessive noise levels. Noise levcls along thc route
 would depend on the type of train vehicle and track improvements, the frequency of trains, and
 the location of stations. North of the Rohnert Park Expressway, residential uses are set back from
the rail line, but south of the Expressway, residential abut the right-ot'-way and would be subject
to noise impacts.

 8.3      NOISE GOATS AND POTICIES
 GOALS: NOISE
 NS-A     Protect public health and welfare by eliminating or minimizing excessive noise levels.
 NS-B Minimize       the exposure of noise-sensitive uses-including residences, schools, churches,
          hospitals, and other public uses-to excessive noise levels.
 POLICIES: NOISE
Standards
NS-1     During project review and approval, use Figure 8.3-1 to determine acceptable uses and
         analysis and insulation requirements in noise-impacted areas.
         Figure 8.3-1 ß based on land use ønd noise exposure compatibility levels in Appendix A
         of the State of Caliþrnia General PIan Guidelines. The table is consistent with the
        provision of State law that requires special noise insulation þr new multifamily housing
         units within 60 dB Ldn noise exposure contours.
         The table's land use categories do not correspond to the use classffications on the
         General Plan Land Use Diagram, but to øctual uses in development projects. The land
        use categories shall be consistent with use deJìnitions in the Ciþ's Zoning Ordinqnce.
        The General Plan Land Use Diagram was designed to locate noise-sensitive land uses,
        like residential, as far øway from major noise generators as possible. The city's largest
        noise generator is US I0I, where roadside noise levels exceed 70 dB Ldn.
NS-2    For all residential uses, establish 45 dB Ldn as the standard for interior noise levels and
        60 dB Ldn as the standard for exterior noise levels. Require appropriate siting of
       residential uses andlor mitigation measures to meet the standards.
      Figure 8.3-I requires special insulation þr residential qnd other uses within 60 dB Ldn
       noise contours. Residential uses shall be required to meet the 45 dB Ldn interior noise
       Ievel performønce standard as well.
      The policy þr exterior noise level is intended to protect the enjoyment of open space in
      residential areas. AIso, it helps protect interior noise levels when windows are open.
      Buildings with open windows attenuate øbout 12-17 dB CNEL. Tlithin 60 dB Ldn
      contours, residences wíth open windows would experience 43-48 dB Ldn interior noise
      levels, near the threshold ofspeech intederence (45 dB Ldn).
                                                                                                 8-7

  Rohnert Park General Plan
  Noise Reduction
 NS-3    Update the Noise Ordinance and the Zoning Ordinance to require control of noise at the
         source through site design, building design, buffering, hours of operation, and other
         regulations, for any noise-emitting use.
         The City's Noise Ordinance establishes noise støndards.for vørious noise-emitting land
         uses and for zoning districts. In addition, the ordinønce restricts noise emitted from
         temporaqt or intermittent uses.
 NS-4    Continue   to require control of noise or mitigation     measures   for any noise-emitting
         construction equipment or activity.
         The City's Nbise Ordinance establishes controls on construction-reiated noise.
 NS-5    Continue to work with County, State, ancl other agencies to recluce noise from sources
         outside the City's Sphere of Influence (SOI) and to minimize impacts on sites within the
         sor.
 Mitigation of Noise Impacts
 NS-6   Require buffers or site planning techniques for all new development within 65 dB Ldn
        noise contours. However, avoid visible sound walls except along US 101 and along the
        Northwcstcrn Pacific (NP) Railroad right-of-woy.
        Chapter 3: Community Design includes policies to minimize use of sound walls.
NS-7    Require new development within existing or projected 65 dB Ldn noise contours to
        undergo a technical acoustical analysis, which shall serve as the basis for designing
        mitigation measures. Require the technical analysis to be conducted by a professional
        acoustical engineer.
        This policy applies to both residential and non-residential uses. The technical analysis
        should determine the relative effectiveness of ølternøtive mitigation.
NS-8    Work with SCTA to identifu potential noise impacts resulting from commuter rail service
        along the Nofhwestern Pacific (NP) right-of-way and develop adequate mitigation
        measures.
        Policy TR-33 in the Transportation Element encourages SCTA to continue in its efforts to
        develop commuter røil service along the NP right-of-wøy.

     Section            9.1 lntroduction
    The City of Rohnert Park Housing Element identifies and analyzes housing needs of present and future
    residents through 2023, and provides the primary policy guidance for local decision-making as it relates
    to the preservation, conservation, improvement, and production of housing. The Housing Element has a
    shorter planning period than the other General Plan elements and is the only General Plan element that
    requires review and certification by the State ofCalifornia.
    The Housing Element provides a detailed analysis of the city's demographic, economic, and housing
    characteristics as required by State law. The Element also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the
   City's progress in implementing the past policies and programs related to housing production,
   preservation, and conservation. Based on the communify's housing needs, available resources,
   constraints, and opportunities for housing production and preservation, and its past performance, the
   Housing Element identifìes goals, policies, and programs that address the housing needs of present and
   future residents.
   This element contains
        r   An assessment of housing needs in the city;
        r   An inventory of resources available to the City to meet these needs;
        r   The identification of constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, and development of
           housing for all income levels;
        I A    statement   of the   community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies related     to  the
           maintenance, improvement, and development of housing; and
        ¡  An eight-year schedule of actions the City is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement
           the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing Element.
  State Law and Local Planning
 Consistency w¡th State Law
 The Housing Element is one of the required General Plan elements, as articulated in Govemment Code
 Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the California Government Code. State law requires that each jurisdiction's
 housing element consist of "an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a
 statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and programs for the preservation, improvement, and
 development of housing." The housing element plans for the provision of housing for all economic
 segments of the population.
As required by State law (Government Code Section 65583 (a)), the assessment and inventory for this
Element includes the following:
      t   An analysis of population and employment trends and projections, and a quantification of        the
          city's existing and projected housing needs for all income levels. This analysis of existing and
          projected needs includes the Cify of Rohnert Park's share of the regional housing need.
          An   analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of payment
          compared    to ability to pay; housing characteristics, including overcrowding; and housing stock
          condition.

 General Plan Consistency
 State law requires intemal consistency among the various elements of the General Plan. Government code
 section 65300.5 states that the General Plan's various elements shall provide an integrated and internally
 consistent and compatible statement of policy. Upon adoption, this Housing Element will become part of
 the City's General Plan. The City will maintain this consistency as future General Plan amendments are
 processed by evaluating proposed amendments for consistency with all elements of the General Plan.

programs that work to implement the goals and policies of the Housing Element. These include the City's
Municipal Code and Specific Plans.
Housing Element Time Frame
Unlike the other elements of the General Plan, the Housing Element time frame is tied to an eight-year
"housing needs process" schedule set by the State. The Califomia Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) determines each region's share of the state housing need. In 2014 the
State initiated a housing needs process for the San Francisco Bay Area communities; the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation Plan addresses the fifth housing element cycle, which covers an 8.75 year
RHNA projection period (January L, 2014, to October 31, 2022) and an eight-year planning period
(January 31,2015, to January 31,2023). Based on growth projections between the years of2014 and
2022, The City must adopt the updated Housing Element before January 31, 2015, demonstrating its
ability to accommodate its fair share of housing needs during the eight-year period.

i       Data Sources
       The most current housing data and information available was used during the preparation of the Housing
      Element. The most recent version of the United States Census, which is a primary source of housing
       information, is 2010. The Census Bureau also publishes the American Community Survey (ACS). The
      ACS is not a census, but a survey; about three million housing unit addresses are selected annually. In the
      past the Census Bureau only released an annual ACS for jurisdictions with populations of at least 65,000,
      but in 2008 the ACS released its first multi-year estimates based on ACS data collected from 2005-2007.
      These estimates are available for populations of 20,000 or more, including Rohnert Park. The most recent
      ACS period is 2010-2012. Department of Finance (DOF) and Association of Bay Area Governments
      (ABAG) data were also used along with various other sources of housing industry data. HCD will not
      comment on the 2014 ABAG preapproved data used in the Housing Element.
      Housing Element Organization
     The City of Rohnert Park Housing Element is organized into the following sections:
            .  Introduction. Explains the purpose, process, and content of the Housing Element.
            '  Population and Demographics: Describes current and projected demographic and economic
               characteristics of Rohnert Park.
            .  Housing Needs Analysis. Describes the housing characteristics of Rohnert Park, as well as the
              current and projected housing needs.
           .  Housing Resources. Analyzes the various land, financial, and administrative resources available
              to the City for meeting its housing needs.
           .  Housing Constraints. Analyzes the actual and potential governmental and non-govemmental
              constraints to the maintenanse, preservation, conservation, and development of housing.
    Given the detail and lengthy analysis in developing the Housing Element, supporting background material
    is included in the following appendices:

   Community lnvolvement
   As part of the Housing Element update process, the City implemented the State's public participation
   requirements in Housing Element law, set forth in Government Code Section 65583(c)(7), that
  jurisdictions "...shall make a diligent effort to achieve participation of all economic segments of the
   community in the development of the housing element." The City of Rohnert Park values public input in
  the development of its community development goals and objectives, including the provision of decent
  and adequate housing. The following section summarizes public outreach conducted by the City of
  Rohnert Park. The input provided at the workshops helped shape the policies and programs included in
  the Housing Element.

   On January 27. 2014, the City of Rohnert Park held a Stakeholder Workshop on the Housing Element
   Update. To advertise the workshop, the City sent an email notice and conducted follow-up phone calls to
   nearly 50 local agencies, communify organizations, and stakeholders, including non-profit and for-profit
   housing developers, affordable housing and homeless advocacy groups, senior advocates, farmworker
   advocates, realtors, and representatives from the school district, Sonoma State, fair housing counseling
   €troups, and faith-based organizations. The City also advefised the workshop as a public meeting in the
   Community Voice. Sixteen people, in addition to project staff and consultants, attended.
  At the worlishop City staff and the Ilousing Element consulting firm. Mirtticr Harnish, prcscntcd a brief
   overview of the Housing Element Update and facilitated an interactive discussion to solicit ideas from
  participants about the most critical housing issues facing Rohnert Park residents and new ways the City
  and community might address these issues. Appendix C contains a summary of the issues and ideas
  discussed at the workshop. The input provided at the workshop was used to shape the Housing Element
  policies ancl programs and the names of the individuals who attended.
  The City's team will continue to collect input from stakeholdcrs and the public, and complete morc
  research on relevant issues. This information will be used to help prepare a Housing Element draft

  Summary of Comments
 Participants from the stakeholder workshop raised issues that can be grouped into a number of themes;
 afforciabiiify concems, housing suppiy concerns, anci financiai cÍifficuities. Many of these concerns are
 being addressed by the existing and new policies and programs in this Housing Element, as well as other
 Cify programs and policies. Below is a representative sample of some of the concerns that were addressed
 in each category:
 Concerns:
 Participants pointed out that both sales and rental prices are increasing in Rohnert Park. The growing
 student population and influx of new casino employees have saturated the housing market, increasing
rental rates by approximately $200. Participants are concerned about the prospects of the availability of
affordable housing as well as nËw allurtiable huusing devclupilciit. Tlic partir,ipa¡¡ts ulaii¡i tl¡at the RHNA
underestimates the actual need and that ABAG did not consider the impacts of the casino.
According to the participants, a number of apartments are no longer accepting Section 8, forcing tenants
to move. Concerns were expressed about the lack of support for residents living on fixed incomes such as
seniors and disabled persons. Some participants reported that the disabled community of Rohnert Park has
experienced discrimination, as landlords are increasing rent on persons with disabilities. The residents
would like to see development of affordable housing for those individuals on fixed incomes; however,
affordable housing can be more expensive due to the additional labor costs associated with Federally-
funded projects. The loss of redevelopment funds will also hinder the development of new affordable
housing.

/     Solutions:
      Participants also shared ideas for improving the housing issues facing Rohnert Park. In regards to
      affordability, participants stressed that 15 percent ofall new development should continue to be required
      as affordable and that there should be increased political support for inclusionary zoning. The participants
      also suggested increased partnerships between non-profit organizations and the City, as non-profit
      organizations are typically solutions-oriented and good stewards of the public. Residents would like to see
      an increase in Section 8 vouchers as well as apartments accepting Section 8.
      The City currently requires that the equivalent of 15 percent of all new ownership units is affordable. The
      City is currently working with developers on diflerent affordable housing solutions including graded
     building pads complete with utilities ready-to-go for an affordable housing developer, as well as plans for
     affordable single family homes interspersed throughout project sites. Participants suggested land trusts be
     used to hold affordable housing projects in perpetuity. Lastly, participants suggest that the City should use
     the RDA "Boomerang" Fund, which would require a20 percent set-aside of land for housing.
     Community Workshop (May 29,20141
     On May 29, 2014, the City of Rohnert Park held a Communify V/orkshop on the Housing Element
     Update. To adveftise the workshop, the City sent an email notice to residents, noticed the workshop in
     Community Voice, and advertised the workshop on a digital freeway sign along Highway l0l. At the
    workshop City staff and the Housing Element consulting firm, Mintier Harnish, presented a brief
    overview of the Housing Element Update. Attendees were then allowed to review key parts of the
    Housing Element at stations located throughout the meeting room. Staff and consultants were on hand to
    ans\ryer questions, discuss issues, and solicit ideas from participants. The input provided at the workshop
    was used to refine the Public Review Draft Housing Element policies and programs.

   As shown in Table 9-1, after its incorporation in 1962, Rohnert Park's population gre\¡/ exponentially
   during the first several decades of its existence (l2l percent from 1962 fo 1970 and 274 percent from
    1970 to 1980). In the 1990s the city's population growth slowed to 16.8 percent, reaching a population of
   42,436 in 2000. Between the years of 2000 and 2010, growth declined by 1,465 (3.5 percent) to 40,971.
   These population declines can be attributed to the boom-and-bust technolory markets that impacted large
   employers and the 2008 housing crisis. Of the 101 cities in the nine-county Bay Area, Rohneft Park
   experienced the fourth largest population drop between 2000 and2010. From 2010 to2013 Rohnert Park
   experienced a slight population increase of0.15 percent.

 Housing Unit Growth Trends
Development in the city has been and continues to be largely based on a neighborhood concept that, in
accordance with adopted master plans, promotes the development of a city center with a more compact
urban core. Each neighborhood area includes both single family and multifamily housing types that are
typicaily consfructed in proximity to a school andlor park. Shopping centers have been designed and
located to be within convenient walking distance from local neighborhoods.

     ln 1962 there were only 903 housing units in Rohnert Park. Throughout the early 1960s and 1970s,
    housing produced in the city primarily consisted of single family detached housing units and mobile home
    parks. At that time such housing was affordable to a majority of residents and families moving into the
    area. During the 1970s the city's housing inventory gre\il to include apartments, townhouses,
    condominiums, and additional mobile homes, in order to provide lower-cost alternatives to increasingly
    more expensive single family housing.
    As shown in Table 9-3, the 1980s saw continued development of single family housing as well as
    multifamily projects. From 1980 to 1990 single family housing nearly doubled from 4,819 to 8,143 units,
    an averuge annual increase in development of 6.9 percent. Multifamily housing also saw a steady increase
   of about 5.2 percent per year between 1980 and 1990. During the 1990s the City saw its tallest residential
   building constructêd-a four-story elderly housing project, Altamont Apartments-and the development of
   numerous other housing units for lower-income households. Development of large custom homes
   occuned at the north end of the city. From 2000 to 2010 the city's single family and multifamily housing
   stock increased 10 percentandlT percent, respectively.
   Between 1990 and 2000 the housing stock continued to grow, however, at a much slower annual rate
   compared to the previous decade, dropping to 1.0 percent and 1.7 percent for single family and
  multifamily housing, respectively. Between 2000 and 2010 single family development decreased by 0.9
  percent, while multifamily units increased by 0.8 percent. Rohnert Park did not experience any new
  development between the years of 201 0 and 2013, as the housing market continued to lag in response to
  the 2008 housing crisis.

  Population by Age
  As shown in Figure 9-l and Table 9-4, the cify's combined pre-school and elementary (0-9 years old) and
  middle and high school (10-19 years old) population percentage remained about the same between 1990
  and 2000 (approximately 30 percent), but declinecl between 2000 and 2012 to about 22.8 percent. The
  youngadultpopulation(20-34 yearolds)hasbeenincreasingslowlysince 1990. Asof 2012 theyoung
  adultpopulation made up27.3 percent (11,230) of the city's population. This can be attributed in large
  part to the presence of the University, which has seen an average growth of approximately 60 students per
 year between the years of 1990 and2013, according to the Sonoma State University Academic Affairs. In
  1990 the estimated student enrollment was 7,643; today, the University brings in a student population of
 more than 9,000 undergraduate and graduate students. ln 2012 approximately 23 percent of Rohnert
 Park's population was 55 years and older (9,371), which accounts for the senior population. Based on the
 conventional count ofelderly persons (65 years and older), there are 2,735 persons ages 65 and older. The
 number of elderly persons is expected to increase due to the aging of the "Baby Boom" generation.

 According to the American Community Survey, the median age of the city's population was 34.9 in2012,
 an increase from 31.5 in2000. To put this in perspective, fhe median age for Sonoma Counfy in 2010 was
 39.9 years. Rohnert Park's population is much younger than that of the region in large part because of the
 presence of Sonoma State University.

 Table 9-5 summarizes the population by race and ethnicity in Rohnert Park and Sonoma County. [n2012
 it was estimated tlrat a majority of the city and counfy populations were White, 77.7 percen| and 80.1
percent, respectively. ln 2012 Rohnert Park had a higher percentage of Asian residents (6.5 percent)
compared to Sonoma County (4.6 percent) as well as Black residents (2-4 percent compared to 1.6
percent). Since 2000 the population of V/hite residents was the only group to decline in the city, whereas
the population of \ilhite and "two or more races" were the only groups to decline in the county. It is
important to note that Census data is selËreported; therefore, fewer persons may have identified as being
White or "two or more races" in 2012 as they did in 2000. Rohnert Park's Hispanic/Latino population
increased from 5,731 (22.1 percent) in 2000 to 10,018 (24.4 percent) in2012.In2012 the city had a
slightly lower percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents compared to the county as a whole (24.4 percent
for Rohnert Park compared to 25.2 percent for Sonoma Counfy). Rohnert Park's American
Indian/Alaskan Native population increased (from202to 337 between 2000 and 2012).

  Household and Job Growth Trends
 ABAG's /obs=Housíng eonnections Strategy report (20i2) estimates and projeets the distribution of
 population, households, employment, income, and labor t-orce for 2010 through 2040. The Jobs-Housing
 Connections Strategy forecasts are based on regional and county growth models, the local availability of
 land, local development policies, density assumptions, and travel demand.
 The Jobs-Housing Connections Strateglt provides estimates for the area within Rohnert Park's current
city limits, as well as a larger subregional study area that encompasses large areas outside of the city. The
Housing Element focuses on the fomer in order to provide consistency with ABAG's projected housing
needs discussed in the next section.
Table 9-9 compares household and job growth from 2010 to 2040 between Rohnert Park and the
neighboring cities of Cotati, Petaluma, and Santa Rosa. Within the 30-year period Rohnert Park's
household growth (24 percenl) is projected to be slightly lower than Santa Rosa's (27 percent), but higher
than Cotati's (18 percent) and Petaluma's (13 percent). This translates into an average annual growth rate
of 0.8 percent in Rohnert Park, 0.9 percent in Santa Rosa, 0.6 percent in Cotati, and 0.4 percent in
Petaluma. Rohncrt Park is forecasted to have the highest job growth of the four cities (39 percent)
compared to Santa Rosa (38 percent), Cotati (32 percent), and Petaluma (34 percent). Rohnert Park's
higher job growth is likely due to the construction of the Gratott Rancheria Casino located just off of
Highway l0l. Since its completionin2013, the casino has added about 2,000 jobs. The Casino is not
within the city limits of Rohnert Park, but it is immediately adjacent to the city boundary on lands
controlled by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria. More employment is expected as new
businesses are established or expanded to serve casino patrons. The average annual growth rate for
employment for both Rohnert Park and Santa Rosa over the 3O-year period is 1.3 percent, while the
average annual growth rate for both Cotati and Petaluma is 1.1 percent.

    According to employment projections provided in the ABAG Final Forecast of Jobs, Population and
    Housing (July 2013), the number of residents employed in Rohnert Park is anticipated to increase. As
    shown in Table 9-10, between 2010 and 2040 the city's employment is projected to increase by 39
    percent from I 1,730 to 16,320, respectively. It is estimated that the opening of the Graton Resort and

    Chapter 9: Housing Llenrcnl
    Graton Rancheria Gasino
   On November 5,2013, Graton Resort and Casino opened. The Casino is located off Highway l0l just
   outside the city limits to the west. The Casino has created more than 750 construction jobs and more than
   2,000 permanent jobs. The explosion in employment opportunities is expected to continue to bring more
   people to Rohnert Park creating greater demand for housing. Based on conversations with stakeholders at
   the Stakeholder Workshop, it seems that rents have been increasing significantly in the short time that the
   casino has been open. As demand for housing increases, cost of housing will likely continue to increase
   accordingly. This may pose a constraint on housing availability, especially affordable housing.
   Household Characteristics
  Although the characteristics of individual residents are important to understanding the growth and
  evolution of a city, the more useful unit for analysis concerning housing needs is the household. The U.S.
  Census Bureau considers all people living in the same dwelling unit to be a household. This includes
  individuals living alone, roommates sharing an apartment, a family of four in a single-family house, or a
  single-parent living in a multifamily apartment complex. A dwelling unit is defined as "a house, an
   apartment, a group of rooms, or a single room, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended
  for occupancy."
  Household Growth Trends
 According to the 2010-2012 American Community Survey, in2012 there were 15,875 households in
 Rohnert Park, reptesentinga24 percent increase in the number of households since 2000 (15,503). The
 number of households in Rohnert Park peaked in 2008 at 16,248 and then began to decline likely in
 response to the 2008 housing market crisis. The number of total households saw a brief increase in 201 I
 to 16,041, only to decline again in 2012.The DOF reflects a similar peak in occupied households in 2008,
 however, between 2010 and 2013 the number of households remained constant; no new housing units
 were built in this time period and vacancy rates were held constant. Although the ACS reports distinct
 changes in household occupancy, the data should be interpreted with caution as the margin of error
 averages +l- 534 households for the years 2008, 2012,and2013.

/      Household Types
      As reported by the 2010-2012 ACS, families made up more than half (56.8 percent) of Rohnert Park's
      households. Families, as defined by the U.S. Census, "consist of two or more people (one of whom is the
      householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption residing in the same housing unit," and includes
      married couples (71 percent of total family households) and other family types, such as single parents
      (13.8 percent of total family households). The number of family households has declined since 2000,
     while the number of non-family households has increased. This could be pafüally attributed to inøeased
     enrollment at Sonoma State University as well as an increase in the city's senior population living alone.
     According to the Sonoma State University Academic Affairs, since 1999 the student population has
     increased by a little over 1,900 students (a 30 percent increase). Non-family households made up about
     43.2 percent of the households in the city in2012. Most of the non-family households were single person
    households (73.9 percent of non-family households or about 31.9 percent of the total households). Similar
    to Rohnert Park, family households in the county decreased in numbers from 2000 to 2012.
    About 26.0 percent of Rohnert Park's total households included children age 18 or younger, which is a
    decrease from the 2000 estimate of 38.0 percent. The percentage of Rohnert Park's senior households
    (age 65 or older) has increased from 2,663 in2000 (17.2 percent of total households) to 3,982 (25.1
   percent of total households) in 2012 (a 49.5 percent increase). In the county 27.8 percent of households
   had children under 18 years old and 37.4 percent of households were senior households. While the
   percentage of senior households in the city was smaller than that of the count¡r, the city's senior
   population is expected to increase as more baby boomers continue to reach retirement age.

   Chapter 9: Housing Elçment
   Table 9-14 summarizes household tenure by age in the city and the county for 2000 and 2012. Units
  occupietl by persons between the ages of 35 and 54, us well us 55 und over, mutle up the highcst
  percentage of owner-occupied units in Rohnert Park (45.2 and 61.1 percent, respectively). The highest
  percentage ofunits rented was by persons between the ages of l5 and 34. The percentage ofhomeowners
  between the ages of35 and 54 decreased 9.6 percent from 54.8 percent Ío 45.2 percent. The percentage of
  rerrters between the age of l5 and 34 also decreased fron 47 .4 percent in 2000 to 40.4 perceff in 2012.ln
  2012 people age 55 and over owned approximately two-thirds as many units as they rented; however, the
 percentage    of renters 55 and older has increased significantly since 2000 (from 17 percent to 30.7
 ¡ercent).   This  can he attrihuted 1o a growing senior population as the more hahy hoomers reach
 retirement. The city and county exhibited similar ownership and rental trends, although young people
 renting in RohneÉ Park made rrp a higher percentage of total renters, whereas those hetween the ages of
 35 and 54 made up a higher percetrtage of total rerüers in the county. This is likely attributed to the
 presence of Sonoma State University. Also, of total senior households (age 55 and older), a higher
 percentage in the county owned (58.8 percent) than in Rohnerl Park (45.4 percent). The demand for
 senior rental units in Rohnert Park as a whole is likely to be higher than the county.

  Vacant Units
  Vacancy rate can be a good indicator ofhow effectively for-sale and rental units are meeting the current
  demand for housing in a community. Vacancy rates of 6 or 7 percent for rental housing and I to 2 percent
  for ownership housing are generally considered optimum when there is a balance between the demand
  and supply for housing.tA higher vacancy rate may indicate an excess supply of units and, therefore,
  price depreciation, while a low vacancy rate may indicate a shortage of units and escalation of housing
  prices.

   Chapter 9: Housing Elentent
   As shown in Table 9-17, according to the ACS five-year estimates in 2012, Rohnert Park had a total of
   16,801 housing units; 849 (or 5.1 percent) of which were vacant. In contrast to the city, Sonoma County's
   housing stock was 9.6 percent vacant; however, this higher vacancy rate in the counfy is due largely to the
  higher percentage ofhouses for seasonal and recreational use. In Rohnert Park approximately 2.5 percent
  (420 units) of vacant units were for rent, while less than I percent (109 units) was for sale. The 2012
  vacancy rates are far below what is considered optimum indicating a shortage ofboth rental and for-sale
  units; the shortage may negatively impact housing affordabilify for all income levels. Sonoma County, on
  the other hanel, experienced a I .9 percent vaeaney rate of rental units and a 1.0 percent vacancy rate of
  for-sale units in 2012.Borh the city ancl county vacancy rates are much lower than the optimum vacancy
  rates of6 or 7 peleent for rental housing and I to 2 pcreent for ownership housing.

 Housing Unit Gonditions and Rehabilitation Need
 Generally, housing older than 30 years of age will require minor repairs and modernization
 improvements. Housing units over 50 years of age are more likely to require major rehabilitation such as
roofing, plumbing, and electrical system repairs.
The City performed its last housing conditions suruey in November 1999. This survey consisted of the
visual inspection of the older neighborhoods in Rohnert Park, including Sections A, B, C, E, and L, as
well as all five of the mobile home parks. A total of 2,898 conventionally-constructed residences and
 1,466 mobile home units were visually surueyed. The overwhelming majority of units surveyed were
found to be in "sound" condition, with the appearance of regular maintenance of the home and
landscaping. The City's mobile homes were also found to be well-maintained.
Table 9-18 depicts the statistics on the age of the housing units in Rohnert Park based on the 2010-2012
American Communify Suruey. An estimated 51.4 percent of the housing units in the city are over 30
years of age and only 3.8 percent are over 50 years of age. In comparison, the ACS reports that 57.4
percent of Sonoma Counfy's housing stock is 30 years or older and 24.1 percent is 50 years or older.
Rohnert Park has a significantly smaller percent of housing units over 50 years of age compared to the
county because of its relatively recent deveiopment and incorporation in 1962.

   While the majority of the housing units within the city are in relatively good condition, as the existing
   stock ages, the number of housing units needing rehabilitation could increase without proper
   maintenance.
   Housing Costs and Affordability
  Housing affordabilþ is a major consideration in providing suitable housing. The cost of housing itself is
  not a problem, unless households in the area cannot find adequately sized units at an affordable price.
  Affordability is defined as paying 30 percent or less of gross monthly household income on housing costs,
  based on both State and Federal standards for households of lower income. The following section
  discusses current income levels and ability to pay for housing compared with housing costs. Since above
  moderate-income households do not generally have problems locating affordable units, affordable units
  are frequently defined as those reasonably priced for households that are very low- to moderate-income.
  Housing Costs and Wages
 Housing cost is generally the single, greatest expense item for households. For owner-occupied
 households housing expenses consist of mortgage and interest payments, insurance, maintenance, and
 property taxes. For renter-occupied households housing expenses consist of rent and utilities. Higher-
 income households may choose to spend greater portions of their income on housing expenses and still
have sufficient money left over for other expenses. However, many lower-income households must
involuntarily spend a large share of their income on housing leaving them with less money for other
expenses.

   Chapter 9: I'lousing Element
  Table 9-19 summarizes 2013 information about the relationship between wages and housing costs
  according to National Low Income Housing Coalition OTLIHC). In general, the Fair Market Rent (FMR)
  for an area is the amount that would be needed to pay the gross rent (shelter rent plus utilities) of privately
  owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest (nonJuxury) nature with suitable amenities.
  In 2013 the FMR for a two-bedroom apartment was $1,332. In order to afford this level of rent and
  utilities, without paying more than 30 percent of income on housing, a household must earn $4,440
  monthly or $53,280 annually. Assuming a 40-hour work week, approximately 49 weeks per year (based
  on the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average paid holidays, vacation, and sick leave combined is 24.2
  days or 48.5 weeks), this level of income Lranslates [u arr average huusing wage uf $27.18 pcr huur'.

 wage    will rise to $9.00 per hour in July 2014 and $10.00 by January 2016, well above the current Federal
 minimum wage of 57.25 an hour). In order to afford the FMR for a two-bedroom apartment, a minimum
 wage earner must work 129 hours per week, 52 weeks per year. Or a household must include 3.2
 minimum wage eamers working 40 hours per week year round to make the two-bedroom FMR
 affordable.
 In Sonoma County the estimated average wage for a renter is $14.91. In order to afford the FMR for a
 two-bedroom apartment at this wage, a household must include 1.7 workers working 40 hours a week
 ycar-round and earning the mean renter wage.

     Housing Affordability
     Table 9-20 shows the affordable housing cost guidelines established in Section 50052.5 and 50053 of the
     California Health and Safety Code. The guidelines are based on the median income calculated by the
     HCD income limits. As described earlier, the generally accepted definition of housing affordability is for
     a household Io pay no more than 30 percent of its gross an¡ual income on housing. It should be noted that
     moderate-income households and above typically spend greater than 30 percent on household expenses;
    therefore, the threshold for overpayment is higher at approximately 35 percent of their income.

   HCD establishes household income limits to define households as extremely low-, very low-, low-, or
   moderate-income level. These income levels vary throughout the state and are based on the area median
   income of the region and adjusted based on the number of persons per household. The income limits for
  Sonoma County are shown on Table 9-21 . As shown in the table, a family of three with an annual income
  of $58,500 or less would be considered a low-income household.

afford to spend up fo 524,780 a year, or $2,065 per month, on housing without being considered
"overpaying." For renters this is a straightforward calculation, but home ownership costs are less
transparent.

      A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is 2.5 to 3.0 times the annual income of that
      household, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such as a car loan),
      and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some households to quali$' for homes
      priced at more than three times their annual income, while other households may be limited to purchasing
      homes no more than two times their annual incomes. These factors - interest rates, insurance, and taxes -
      are held constant in the table below in order to determine maximum affordable rent and purchase price for
      households of each income category. The infomation provided in Table 9-22 realistically reflects the

     Figure 9-3 shows the median sales prices for homes in Rohnert Park between February 2004 and January
     2014. The median sales price significantly increased between early 2004 and late 2005. Similar to cities
     throughout Califomia, after 2005 the housing market slowdown and high foreclosure rates affected sales
     prices in Rohnert Park. Between late 2005 and early 201 l, the median sales price decreased by almost 60
     percent, making housing more affordable for new buyers, but trapping many homeowners with
     "underwater" mortgages. In 2012 prices began to increase only to decrease again in lafe Z}l3learly 2014.
    The median sales price of 5312,200 in October 2013 and $288,200 in January 2014 was out of reach for
    lower-income families, but within reach for most moderate-income families in Sonoma County. Despite
    the sudden drop in prices, it is expected that housing prices will increase during the Housing Element
    planning period.

   Table 9-23 shows the median housing price by number of bedrooms and price per square foot for homes
   in the city of Rohneft Park for 2008, 2072, and 2013. While the median sales price for homes of all sizes
   is affordable to moderate-income households, lower-income households are not able to afford any size
   home. A two-person moderate-income household can afford a two-bedroom home at $165,500 and a
   three-bedroom home af"$2'77,500. A tkee- to four-person moderate-income household with a maximum
   purchasing price ranging from 5365,991 to 5439,230 can afford all for-sale homes with sales price
   ranging from $165,500 for a two-bedroom unit to $328,000 for a four-bedroom unit. A low-income
   household of four with a maximum purchasing price of 5266,697, which -Nould generally need a three-
   bedroom home, could only afford the median sales price of a two-bedroom home ($ 165,5U0).

    Rental Housing
    Table 9-25 compares 2013 Fair Market Rents for Sonoma County with the average monthly rents by unit
   size in Rohnert Park according to the RealFacts Annual Report (2013). The average rental for a studio
   was $775; a one-bedroom, one bath unit was $1,109; a two-bedroom, one-bath unit was 51,334; a two-
   bedroom, two-bath unit was $1,558; and a three-bedroom, two-bath unit was 51,757. Three -bedroom,
   two-bath and efficiency units are the only unit sizes with an average monthly rent below the Fair Market
   Rent (lMR), all of the other monthly rents exceed the FMR rates.
  Based on the information displayed in Table 9-22, a family of four eaming 80 percent of the county
  meclinn ($65,000) can afforrt a $1,625 monthly rent, which is not enough to afford an average three-
   bedroom apartment ($1,757) in Rohnert Park without overpaying. A family of four earning the median
  income ($82,600) can afford a monthly rent of 52,065, enough to rent a three-bedroom unit atSl,757.
  While lower-income households would be hard-pressed to find affordable housing in Rohnert Park,
  moderate-income households (those earning 120 percent               of the median) and above would have a
  reasonable time finding affordable housing.

 Foreclosures
With low interest rates, "creative" financing (e.g., zero down, interest only, adjustable loans), and
predatory lending practices (e.g., aggressive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization), many
households nationwide purchased homes that were beyond their financial means during the peak of the
real estate market (2005 to 2006). Under the assumptions that refinancing to lower interest rates would
always be an opf.ion and horne prices would continue to rise at double-digit rates, rnany households were
unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration ofshort-term fixed rates, and decline in prices that set
off in 2006. Suddenly faced with significantly inflated mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that are
larger than the worth of the homes, foreclosure was the only option available to many households.

      The housing foreclosure crisis hit California particularly hard. In Rohnert Park the median home price in
      September 2008 was $295,000 (an over 40 percent drop from the 2007 median and about a32 percent
     drop from September 200î).2In February 2009 the median price had fallen still further to$252,150 @n
     over 30 percent drop from February 2008). In November 2013 42 houses were sold with a median price
     of 5347,600 (an over 30 percent increase from November 2012)3 .
     In 2008 the number of foreclosures (2,820 houses and condominiums) peaked in Sonoma County. In2013
     Sonoma County foreclosures dropped to their lowest level ín seven years; county homeowners lost 499
    properties at foreclosure auctions last year. In January 2014 RealtyTrac reported that there were 63
    properties in some stage of foreclosure in Rohnert Park: default (45 or 71.4 percent), auction (9 or 14.3
    percent), or bank owned (9 or 14.3 percent).4 This is equivalent to one home in every 2,413. The number
    of homes listed for sale on RealtyTrac was 1 0. The median sales price of a distressed home was $284,898,
    23 percent lower than a non-distressed home price ($370,000). A geographical comparison of
    foreclosures by area shows that Rohnert Park curuently (201$ has a 0.04 percent foreclosure rate, while
   Sonoma County had a slightly lower foreclosure rate of 0.02 percent. Both are lower than the California
   and national avera9e foreclosure rates of 0.09 percent.
   Housing Needs of Extremely Low-lncome Households
   Extremely low-income-households - those earning less than 30 percent of area median income - face the
   most significant housing needs. In Rohnert Park a four-person household with an income of $24,800 in
   2013 would be considered an extremely low-income household. According to 2007-201I CFIAS data,
  there were 1,940 extremely low-income households in Rohnert Park,75.7 percent of which were renters.
  Extremely-low income households made up 12.I percent of all households.
  Extremely low-income households are more likely to live in overcrowded and substandard housing condi-
  tions. 1,675 extremely low-income households (86.3 percent) had at least one of the following housing
  problems: incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than I person per room, or
  cost burden greater than 30 percent. As shown in Table 9-26, 84.6 percent of all extremely low-income
  households overpaid for housing and all extremely low-income large family renters (100 percent) faced a
  housing cost burden. 13.6 percent of elderly households were extremely low-income.
 Extremely low-income households typically consist of minimum wage workers, seniors on fixed incomes,
 persons with disabilities, and farmworkers. Housing types that could provide adequate housing for these
 households include single-room occupancy units, supportive housing, transitional housing, and other af-
 fordable or non-traditional housing types.
 Based on Rohnert Park's RHNA, there is a projected need for 90 extremely-low income housing units
 (which assumes 50 percent of the very low-income allocation) within the city.

  Overpayment
  Overpayment, also known as cost burden, is defined as households spending more than 30 percent of their
  gross household income on housing costs. Severe overpayment is defined as households spending more
  than 50 percent of their gross income on housing costs. HUD's Comprehensive Housing Affordability

   Overcrowdlng
  Qvercrowding is typically defined as a housing unit containing more than one person per room (including
  living and dining rooms, but excluding bathrooms and kitchens), and units with more than 1.5 persons per
  room are considered severely overcrowded. While these definitions do not take cultural and other
  considerations into account" they do provide a basic standard of analysis. High housing costs force lower-
  their homes, leading to crowded living conditions. Large household sizes, multi-generational households,
  high numbers of children per household, low incomes, and the limited availability of large rental units all
  arc rclated to overcrowding.
 As shown in Table 9-27, in 2012 4.1 percent of occupied units in the city were classifìed as overcrowded
 and l.l percent were severely overcrowded, as compared with 3.8 percent and 0.4 percent in 2007.
 Between 2ù07 and 2012 the number of severely overcrowded units increased from 6l to 179.
 Overcrowding in Sonoma County was slightly lower compared to Rohnert Park. In20l2 3.2 percent of
 households in the county were considered overcrowded. The county had a slightly higher percentage (1.4
 percent) of severely overcrowded households, compared to Rohnert Park ( I . I percent).

                 advertisements       on Craigslist that were flagged for discriminating against families with
                 children.
            2.   In 2009 FHOM sent three notification letters to housing providers in the city who placed
                 advertisements on Craigslist that were flagged for discriminating against families with
                 children. In addition, FHOM received a disability complaint from a resident in Rohnert Park.
                 FHOM wrote a reasonable accommodation letter on her behall which was granted.
           3.   In 2010 FHOM received one combined national origin/disability complaint from a resident in
                Rohnert Park. A potential housing provider told a client that an apartmcnt was no longer
                available after the client revealed her mental disability. In addition, after meeting the client's
                husband, the housing provider mentioned that the client's husband "crosscd the bordcr," when
                she met    him.IHOM counseled client.

 Gity Fair Housing Practices
 Existing fair housing practices of the City of Rohnert Park include:
          Arlopting the lJniform Housing Code standards for maximum occupancy of dwelling units, which
          has no limit on the number of residents in a dwelling unit, as long as minimum floor area
          requirements are met.
     I   Providing equitable public services throughout the city, including public transportation, crime
         prevention, police protection, street lighting, street cleaning, trash collection, recreational
         facilities and programs, and schools; and providing for the development of commercial centers in
         all neighborhoods.
         Publicizing ooenings on Cit-v boards and commissions through several newspapers.
         Ensuring that an over-concentration of lower-income housing does not occur in neighborhoods.
     ¡   Encouraging the provision             ofa full anay of banking services in convenient             locations throughout
         the city.
         Promoting the provision of housing affordable to lower-income households, which affirmatively
         furthers     fair    housing because minority families and persons                            with disabilities        are
         disproportionately represented among those that would benefit from low-cost housing.

   Potential Loss of Assisted Units At-Risk of Gonversion
   An affordable rental housing development is a development where all or a portion of the housing units
   must be rented at affordable levels to extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households. The units
   are made affordable for an extended period of time by subsidy contracts, deed restrictions, and/or
   development agreements. When the contracts, deed restrictions, and development agreements expire, the
   units can be rented at market rates to any household. State housing element law requires an analysis ofthe
  affordable housing developments that have been subsidizedby public funds to determine if there are aîy
  affordable units that are at risk of being converted to market rate units. The "at-risk" analysis must cover
  a period of l0 years. Table9-29 shows the number of housing units that have been subsidized by public
  funds as well as affordability contract expiration date. Once the affordabilify period has expired, the
  ov/ner has the option of opting out of the contract and converting units to market rate. HCD provides a list
  of entities lhaf may be ìnterested in participating in California's First Right of Refusal Program.
  California Government Code Section 65863.10 requires that owners of Federally-assisted properties
  provide notices of intent to convert their properties to market rate 12 months prior and again af 6 months
  prior to the expiration of their contract, opt-outs, or prepayment. Owners must provide notices of intent to
 public agencies, including HCD and the local public housing authority, as well as to all impacted tenant
 households. The six-month notice must include specific information on the owner's plans, timetables, and
 reasons for termination. Under Government Code Section 65863.1 l, owners of Federally-assisted projects
 must provide a Notice of Opportunity to Submit an Offer to Purchase to Qualified Entities, non-profit or
 for-profit organizations that agree to preserve the long-term affordability if they should acquire at-risk
 projects, at least one year before the sale or expiration of use restrictions. Qualified Entities have first
 right of refusal for acquiring at-risk units. The California Department of Housing and Community
 Development (HCD) keeps a current list of all of the qualifìed entities across the state. The qualified
 entities that HCD lists for Sonoma Counfy are found in Table 9-28.

     "At-Risk" Housing Units
     There are an estimated 1,701 assisted housing units in Rohnert Park, 1,059 of which are reserved for
     lower-income households. As shown in Table 9-29, of the total assisted housing units, 140 ate"at risk" of
     losing their affordability within the next 10 years from the Housing Element due date (i.e.,2025).
    Of the 1,701 assisted housingunits,29 are in HUD-financed properties and 718 units are subsidized by
    the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). The funding for the remaining 950 units is unknown.
    LIHTC properties were funded with tax credits in the i990s and were required by Fe<ieral iaw to remain
    affordable for 30 years. However, California law generally requires a 55-year extended use period for 9

   HUD-financed properfy, and one properly with deed restrictions subject to a City agreement in Rohrrert
   Park that are at risk of being converted to market rate. The risk of conversion for Aaron House Rehab (6
   units) is minimal because the properties are owned by non-profit organizations, while the Altamont

    Cost of Preservation vs. Acquisition vs. Replacement
    Preservation Strateg ies
    There are many options for preserving units, including providing financial incentives to project owners to
    extend low-income use restrictions, purchasing affordable housing units by a non-profit or public agency,
   or providing local subsidies to offset the difference befween the affordable and market rate. Scenarios for
   preservation will depend on the type ofproject at risk.
   Local Rent Subsidv
   Tenant-based subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability of housing. Similar to Housing Choice
   Vouchers (formerly Section 8), the City, through a variefy of potential funding sources, could provide a
  voucher to lower-income households. The level of subsidy required to presele at-risk affordable housing
  through rent subsidies is estimated to equal the Fair Market Rent for a unit minus the housing cost
  affordable by a lower-income household. As indicated in Table 9-30, approximately 516,704 monthly or
  5200,448 annually would be required to preserve the current at-risk inventory of 140 uniis. The subsidy
  for 10 years would be about $2.0 million, while a subsidy for 30 years would be about $6.0 million.

 Acquisition
According to a listing of multifamily rental apartments for sale on loopnet.com, the average cost to
purchase an apaÍmenl rental unit is approximately $ 187,250 per unit for similar projects to Aaron House
Rehab with at least four units. Based on this estimate, the cost to purchase the six-unit Aaron House
Rehab building would be $1.1 million. Because the 93 affordable units available at the Altamont
Apartments are a part of a larger senior housing project with 137 market rate units, acquisition of the
Altamont Apartments is not feasible. Because the 41 affordable units available at Oakview are also part of
a larger senior housing project with 1 66 market rate units, acquisition of Oakview is not feasible.

    Chapter 9: Houslng Element
    Replacement
    Burbank Housing Development Corporation is an affordable housing non-profit developer in Sonoma
    County. Recently, Burbank has found that development costs (including land acquisition, improvements,
   construction, and soft costs) for a typical studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom unit is between $325,000
   and $400,000, depending on a number of factors including local development impact fees and other local
   ordinances. In this case, replacement for the 140 total units would be between $45.5 million and $56
   million.
   Cost Compar¡son
   The most costly option is new construction of affordable units. With increased requirements in local,
   State, and Federal govel'rìrnent requirements, the time and costs involved in new construction are far more
   extensive than purchasing existing units and converting them into affordable housing, or than providing
  rent subsidies. Providing rental assistance generally requires the least upfront costs. However, a
  sustainable funding source must be identified for this option to be feasible.

    Special Needs Housing
    Certain groups have greater difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due                    to their  special
    circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one's employment and income, age, family
    characteristics, or disabilities. As a result, certain segments of Rohnert Park's population may experience
    a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, housing cost burden, or other housing problems.
   Housing Element law requires the consideration of the housing needs of "special needs" persons and
   households.
   State Housing Element law identifies the following "special needs" groups: elderly households, disabled
   persons including those with developmental disabilities, large households, female-headed households,
   families and persons in need of emergency shelter, and agricultural workers. Table 9-31 summarizes the
   special needs populations in Rohnert Park. The sections following this table provide a detailed discussion
   of the housing needs of each particular group as well as the major progrcms and services available to
   address their housing and supportive service needs.

   Chapter 9: Housing Element
  ïhe Elderly
  Elderly households, sometimes referred to as senior households, typically have special housing needs due
  to three primary concems-income, housing and health care costs, and physical disabilities. Elders are
  defined by HCD ¿ìs persons who are 65 years of age or older; however, it should be noted that some
  housing programs define seniors as age 55 and over. This section will include data on both elderly $oups
  and seniors age 55 and older. According to the 2010-2012 American Community Survey, 9,271 city
  resídents were 55 years and older (about 22.8 percent of the total population), while 4,024 city residents
  were age 65 and older (about 9.8 percent ofthe total population).
  The majorify of elderly households in Rohnert Park or'¡n their own home. In 2012 therc were 2,716
 households headed by persons 65 years and older, with 1,691 being owner-occupied units (62.3 percent of
 all elderly-occupied households) and 1,025 being renter-occupied households (37.7 percent ofall elderly-
 occupied households). Elderly homeowners, particularly elderly women, may require assistance in
 performing regular home maintenance or repair activities due to physical limitations. Some of the special
 needs ofseniors (65 years and older) are as follows:
      .   Disabilities: About 43.3 percent of Rohnert Park's elderly have a disability.
      .   Limited fncome: According to the 2006-2010 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
          (CI{AS). 28.0 percent ot eideriy renter househoicis and 9.7 percent of eicieriy homeowners in
          Rohnert Park earn extremely low incomes (less than 30 percent of AMI).

 Elderly homeowners often cannot afford maintenance and repairs because of their lower, fixed incomes.
 They also may not be able to afford modifications to their homes to ensure their safety and improve their
 mobility, such as grab bars and ramps.
 Existing Housing for the Elderly
 Of the tofal 4,024 elderly population in Rohneft Park, 1,952lived in non-family households in2012; of

     In 2012 approximately 20 percent of elderly households in Rohnert Park lived in housing specifically
     designed for elderly-elderly multifamily complexes or mobile home parks.6 Multifamily complexes in
     Rohnert Park that have been designed to meet the needs of the elderly include 162 market-rate units and
    45 affordable units located in Oak View Senior Apartments, 170 subsidized units in the Copeland Creek
    Apartments, and 137 market-rate units and 93 affordable units in the Altamont Apartments. There are
    approximately 10 facilities providing residential care for the elderly in Rohnert Park, with room for 137
    individuals.T
    Of the three mobile home parks in the city, one was designed and is operated to help meet the needs of
    seniors and has atotal of 235 spaces. The other two parks allow families, but the majority of residents are
    also elderly. Mobile homes meet the needs of many seniors because they provide an independent living
    environment with smaller yards and homes requiring lower levels of maintenance.
    Elderly Housing Needs
   As citizens get older, their housing needs change. Special housing needs of the elderly include smaller
   and more efficient housing to minimize maintenance and barrier-free designs to accommodate restricted
   functions.
   Many older persons own their homes and most prefer to remain there as they grow older.s Therefore,
  efforts are needed to help the elderly maintain independent life styles. In 2007 1,337 elderly Rohnert Park
  residents were identified as having a mobility limitation. By 2012 this number decreased to 1,227
  according to the 2008-2012 ACS. Housing locations near public transit are also needed for the elderly
  because they may not drive. The elderly need additional auxiliary services such as housecleaning, health
  care, and grocery delivery when illness and disability limit their capacily to provide for themselves.
  House sharing can provide older homeowners with revenue, as well as added security and companionship,
  and provides renters with affordable housing. Second unit apartments, which are separate units within a
  home, offer the same advantages plus privacy. Since May 2003 Rohnert Park has permitted second units
  administratively.
 As it becomes increasingly difÍicult for the elderly to live independently, there is a need for congregate or
 group housing that provides small individual units without kitchens or with minimal provision for
 cooking, and some common facilities and services, including shared arrangements for meals and
 housekeeping services. Congregate care housing is particularly attractive to older persons, as building
 design and services can be tailored to their specific needs.

  Life care facilities can also provide all levels of care on the                same site to meet the progressively greater
  needs of the elderly. These facilities often have apartments, congrcgate housing, an infirmary, and nursing
  home in the same or adjacent buildings. Elderly persons buy into a life care project with an initial fee, and
  then pay a monthly fee thereafter. The fee usually guarantees occupancy in a particular size of apartment
  and one meal a day. Tenants may also move into a "personal care" unit or nursing facility                             if health
  support needs change.
  The special needs of the elderly can be met through a range of servicei, includìng coñgreþate õãre, ient
  subsidies, shared housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the frail or disabled, housing with
  architectural design features that accommodate disabilities helps ensure continued independent living.
 Elderly persons with disabilities also benefit from transportation alternatives and shared housing options.
  Senior housing with supportive services can be provided to assist with independent living. Table 9-32
 summarizes the social and supportive services that are provided to assist with independent living.

i      Persons with Disabilities
      Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from workin5, ma! restrict
      one's mobilify, or make it difficult to care for oneself. Disabled persons often have special housing needs
      related to their potentially limited income-earning capacity, a lack of accessible and affordable housing,
     and the higher health costs associated with their disability. Some residents suffer from disabilities that
     require living in a supportive or institutional setting. Disabilities are defined by the American Community
     Survey as mental, physical, or health conditions that last over six months. The Census tracks the
     following disabilities:
            r  Sensory Disability: Conditions that include blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing
               impairment.
           .   Physical Disability: Conditions that substantially limit one or more basic physical activities such
              as walking,  climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
           '  Mental Disability: Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, a person has difficulty
              learning, remembering, or concentrating.
          r   Self-care Disability: Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, a person                 has
              diffrculty dressing, bathing or getting around inside the home.
          r   Go-outside-home Disability: Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, a person has
              diffìculty going outside the home alone to shop or visit a doctor's office.
          '   Employment Disability: Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, a person                has
              difficulty working at a job or business.
    About 4,445 residents in Rohnert Park have some form of disability, representing about 10.8 percent of
    the city's population (2012).      A large number of disabled persons either do not work, or are only
    marginally employed, resulting in a significant segment of the disabled population relying primarily on
    public assistance, equivalent to an extremely low-income level. The 2010-2012 ACS estimates that there
    are770 persons, or l7 percent of all disabled persons, with a disability living below the poverty line in
    Rohnert Park. Such households are particularly vulnerable to increasing housing costs and can easily
    become homeless without the necessary support services in place.
    The living arrangement of disabled persons depends on the severity of the disability. Many persons live at
   home in an independent fashion or with other family members. To maintain independent living, disabled
   persons may need special assistance. This can include special housing design features, income support for
   those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services, among others.
   Community care facilities are one housing option for persons with developmental, mental, and/or physical
   disabililies. As shown in Table 9-33, 17 licensed community care facilities are located in Rohnert Park,
   including six adult residential facilities, nine elderly residential facilities, and two adult day care facilities.
  Most of these care facilities are for the elderly, reflecting the special needs of senior residents, especially
  those with disabilities.

 Additional housing for the disabled, other than licensed community care facilities, is provided at The
 Gardens apartment project, constructed in 1996 with the assistance of the City's former Redevelopment
 Agency, the Community Development Commission of the City of Rohnert Park (CDCRP). The Gardens

    As shown in Table 9-34, the 2012 ACS reported 8,904 total disabilities in Rohnert Park; this number is
    different from the number of disabled residents (4,445) as one person could have more than one disabilify.
   The total disabilities tallied for persons 5 to 64 years old and 65 years and older was 4,445 and3,653,
   respectively. Of the total disabilities tallied, 24.1 percent were ambulatory, which is characterized by a
   serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs. Although not all disabled persons require special housing,
   those with severe mobility constraints need specially designed housing located near transportation and
   other services. A total of 1,149 seniors are immobile without the assistance of a wheelchair requiring
   special housing needs that include ramps, elevators, modifìed bathrooms, wider doorways, and lower
  shelves. The American Disabilities Act (ADA) requires all new multifamily residential projects
  containing four or more units to be accessible to persons with disabilities. According to the 2012 ACS,
   1,359 individuals (16.2 percent) between the ages of 5 and 64 experienced a cognitive disability. For
  disabled people requiring a degree of supervision, group homes are ideal. Convefted single family houses
  are often used for this purpose.

 State and Federal Requirements
In response to the serious lack of accessible housing in the United States, the Fair Housing Act requires
that all ground floor dwelling units in buildings of four or more units without elevators and all dwelling
units in elevator buildings of four or more units include the following basic feafures of accessible and
adaptive design:
          Public and common areas must be accessible to persons with disabilities; and
          Doors and hallways must be wide enough for wheelchairs.

 Besides the construction c.rf new accessible horrsing, the needs of individuals with limitations can
 sometimes be met by simply retrofitting existing housing to transform conventional units into suitable
 housing. This is perhaps the least costly way in which to provide housing specifically for individuals with
 special limitations.
 There is also a need to improve the "visitability" of housing to allow mobility-impaired residents to visit
 families and friends.ro A visitable home provides less accessibility than an accessible home, and is meant

     Developmental Disabilities
    SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to require an evaluation of
    the special housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. A "developmental disability" is
    defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues or can be
    expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. This includes
    Mental Retardation, Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, and Autism.
    According to the California Department of Developmental Seruices (CDDS), during Fiscal Year 20l2ll3
   the Regional Center of the North Bay served 375 residents with developmental disabilities in Rohnert
   Park. Ofthe total 30.9 percent ofdevelopmentally disabled persons are ages 0-14, 16 percent are ages l5-
   22,37.9 percent are ages 23-54, I 1.2 percent are ages 55-64, and 4 percent are ages 65 and over.
   As summarized in Table 9-35, most developmentally-disabled                  residents in Rohnert Park have an
   intellectual disability (222 or 66.9 percent) and many are autistic (75 or 22.6 percent).

 Few developmentally disabled individuals receiving services from the Regional Center of the North Bay
 live in a group home facility (11.7 percent of adults), according to the CDDS. Most developmentally-
 disabled individuals líved at home (57.3 percent). Many developmentally-disabled persons are able to live
 and work independently. However, more severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
with supervision, or an institutional environment with medical attention and physical therapy. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first housing issue for the developmentally-disabled
is the transition from living with a parenlguardian as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an
adult.

    Muirfield Apartments,        a   23-unit project completed      in   1999, provides housing    for people with
    developmental disabilities who are capable of living independently. The tenants will likely have jobs in
    the community and are mostly able to provide for themselves. Rent is subsidized through a project rental
    assistance contract      with HUD, protecting tenants from           overpayment.    The Aaron House     Rehab,
    constructed in 1991, providcs six units to developmentally disabled adults. The Califomia Department of
    Social Services reports that there are six adult residential facilities in Rohnert Park for developmentally
    disabled adults that can accommodate up to 42 individuals.rr
    Large Households
   Large households are defined by the Census as households with five or more members. These households
   constitute a special needs group because there is often a limited supply of adequately-sized, affordable
   housing units in a community to meet their needs.
   ln 2012 Rohnert Park had a total of 1,326 large households (8.4 percent of all households) of which 717
   were owner-occupied (54.1 percent) and 609 rvere renter-occupied (45.9 percent). Based on2006-2010
   CFIA.S data prepared by H{.JD, 25 percent of Rohnert Park's large households suffer from one or more
   housing problems, including housing overpayment, overcrowding, and/or substandard housing
   conditions; 70 percent of large households earn lower incomes.
  Lower-income, large households generally have difficulty locating appropriately-sized housing.
  According to the 2010-?012 ACS, in 2012 Rohneft Park had 5,991 three-bedroom units and 2,470 four-
  bedroom units. Only 46t uriiis had five ôr morc bedrooms, which suggesfs overcrowcÍing. The Garciens
  apaftment project (1995) included four three-bedroom units and four four-bedroom units to help address
  the housing needs of large households. The Arbors, Vida Nueva, Tower, and Redwood Creek Âpaftments
  also provide larger units. However, the rents associated with most of the large rental units are well beyond
 the reach of many lower-income large renter households.
 Female-Headed Households
 Single-parent households are usually one-income households and are, therefore, more likely to have
 difficulty finding affordable, decent, and safe housing. These households often require special
 consideration and assistance because of their gÍeater need for affordable housing, accessible day
 carelchildcare, health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed families with children are an
 especially vulnerablc group since they must balance the needs of their children with work responsibilities,
 often with only one source of income. The 2012 ACS estimated 1,941 female-headed households, or 12.2
percent of the city's households; 1,121 or 57.8 percent of female-headed households had childrenunder
 l8 years old. According to the 2010-2012 ACS,329 or 55 percent of all households in the city living
below the poverfy line, were female-headed-of those, 274had children (83.3 percent).

       Given the financial difficulties facing many single-parent (and especially single-mother) households, it is
      not uncommon for these families to move in with relatives to save money. Moreover, since incomes of
      female-headed households are proportionately lower, their primary housing need is housing affordable to
      Iower income households. The City helped fund The Gardens, a 1995 project that targets lower-income
      families and specifically accommodates single-parent households through a number of architectural
      features. The Cify also supported the Arbors, which provides larger units that can accommodate this type
      of arrangement. The three-bedroom units are designed to facilitate shared rentals so that a single parent
      could arrange for live-in assistance with childcare from a relative, friend, student, or senior.l'
     Farmworkers
     Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are eamed through seasonal
     agricultural labor. They have special housing needs because of their relatively low income and the
     unstable nature of their job (e.g., having to move tkoughout the year from one harvest to the next).
     The 2010-2012 ACS indicated thaL l02 people, approximately 0.5 percent of Rohnert Park's civilian labor
    force, were employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing occupations. This could reflect the fact that
    agricultural operations in the immediate vicinity of the city are generally limited to family-owned and
    operated farms centered on cattle grazing and hay growing that does not customarily require hired and
    temporary farm labor. Given that there are so few persons employed in agriculture-related industries,
    farmworker housing is not a significant issue.
    While no agricultural jobs exist in Rohnert Park, as an agricultural county, Sonoma County as a whole
   has a great need for farmworker housing. The County is a significant producer of wine grapes, which is an
   over $13 billion annual industry in the County.rt Farmworkers are often motivated to seek out the lowest
   cost housing so that they can send a large percentage of their earnings home to their families. The County
   tracks two USDA-financed farmworker apartment projects with 44 and l6 units, respectively as well as
  three individual agricultural employee units. Given that there are an estimated 1,500 migrant farmworkers
   countywide, a shortage of farmworker housing exists, resulting in overcrowded homes, apartments, and
  motel rooms. In addition, many migrant farmworkers are homeless.la Furthermore, a growing number of
  migrant farmworkers do not leave California during the non-farm season, but instead stay in the area and
  perform non-farm work such as construction and odd jobs. Since the agricultural community does not
  take responsibility for housing farmworkers during the off-season, the farmworkers that remain in the
  county year-round place an additional strain on County housing resources.

   The Homeless
   A person or family is considered homeless if they lack a fixed and regular night-time residence, or have a
   primary night-time residence that is a supervised, publicly-operated shelter designated for providing
   temporary living accommodations. Homelessness is also characterized by a person residing in a public or
   private place not designated for, or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human
   beings.r5
   The Sonoma County Community Development Commission (SCCDC), the staff of various homeless
  services programs, and a total of 76 homeless persons and 97 community volunteers conducted a point-in-
  time count of homeless in Sonoma County. The 2013 Sonoma County Hameless Census and Survey
  included both unsheltered homeless (those living on the streets and in open spaces in the county) and
  sheltered homeless (those receiving temporary shelter or services). Key findings of the homeless count
  include:
            There were 3,309 individuals identifìed as unsheltered homeless1' a 1.7 percent decrease from the
            201I count.
           There were 971 persons staying in shelters, transitional housing,        or receiving  services:  a
           significant 17.2 percent decrease since 201 1.
           There werc 152 familics homeless with children,277 unaccompanied homeless children, and 851
           unaccompanied homeless.
           Survey respondents most frequently cited loss of job or unemployment (34 percent) as the
           primary cvcnt or condition that led to their current episode of homelessness. Other comnrolì
           causcs of homelessncss r¡/crc alcohol or drug usc (16 percent), an argument with family or friends
           who asked them to leave (8 percent), and domestic violence (7 percent).
      I    Whites/Caucasians comprised 66 percent of Survey respondents. In comparison with the overall
           population of Sonoma County, there were a disproportionate number of Blaclc/African American
           and multi-ethnic persons experiencing homelessness. No Asian or Pacific Islander or Other Races
           were identified. The mean age was 39 years old.

     Within the city of Rohnert Park, the 2013 Homeless Count identified 44 homeless people,3l of which
     were unsheltered (79.5 percent), These 44 homeless in Rohnert Park represent I percent of the total 4,280
     homeless counfed coun$wide. The 2013 count is a significant drop from the 444 homeless people
    counted in Rohnert Park in 2011. According to conversations with service providers, the homeless
    population along the Highway l0l Conidor is very transient, moving from one part of the county to
    another. The Sonoma County Continuum of Care has determined that the mobility factor makes the trend
    line in smaller localities volatile, and it is, therefore, best to rely upon regional or countywide trends.
    Countylvide, the south Sonoma County region (up to Rohnert Park) saw an increase of 49 persons since
    the 2011 survey. The county as a whole saw a decrease of 259 persons. The largest drop occurred in the
    west county area. Furthermore, as the count report was being developed, several encampments in Rohnert
    Park went uncounted. The Continuum of Care would not cite as large a drop in Rohnert Park's homeless
    population as is cited in the 2013 count.
   Furthermore, service providers have reported that the shelter waitlists in the county are saturated with
   those waiting to get into shelter indicating that there is not enough bed space to accommodate the
   homeless individuals and families in Rohnert Park. The Community Action Partnership of Sonoma
   County runs a shelter that has a waitlist that currently (20IQ consists of eight single women and two
   families (single mothers). The Program Manager receives on average 10 to 15 calls per day from women
  seeking shelter. Transitional housing is also lacking in the county, as there are only a few agencies that
  currently offer transitional housing: Interfaith Shelter Network, COTS, and Catholic Charities.
  Three major types of facilities provide shelter for homeless individuals and families: emergency shelters,
  transitional housing, and permanent housing.
       ¡    Emergency Shelter: A facility that provides overnight shelter and fulfills a client's basic needs
            (i.e., food, clothing, and medical care) either on-site or through off-site services. The permitted
            lengfh of stay çanvary from one day at atime to six months.
       '    Transitional Housing: A residence that provides housing for up to two years. Residents of
           transitional housing are usually connected to supportive services designed to assist the homeless
            in achieving greater economic independence and a permanent, stable living situation. Seryices
           may include substance abuse treatment, mental and physical health care interventions, job
           training and employment services, individual and group counseling, and life skills training.
       r   Permanent Housing: Affordable permanent housing or service-enriched permanent housing that
           is linked with supportive seruices (on-site or off-site) and designed to allow formerly homeless
           clients to live at the facility on an indefinite basis.
 Emergency Shelters
Although there are no emergency shelters in Rohnert Park, emergency shelters are available nearby in
 Santa Rosa and Petaluma. In Santa Rosa Catholic Charities operates the Family Support Center, which
provides emergency, overnight shelter for families with children. The Homeless Services Center, a day-
seruice center for homeless individuals serves 75 to 100 persons during the spring and summer, and 100
to 150 individuals during the winter months.

    Other homeless facilities in the vicinity include the National Guard Armory in Santa Rosa that is operated
    during the winter months by Catholic Charities. The Armory shelter has a typical population of 120 men
   and women, and a capacity of approximately 170. It is open about 12 hours per day, opening each
   evening around 7:00 pm. Users of the shelter are allowed a shower, dinner, and breakfast. In 2004 the
   Committee on the Shelterless (COTS) completed construction of the Mary Isaak Center, which offers 100
   emergency shelter beds and 30 transitional housing beds for adults. COTS also runs the Center for
   Homeless Children and their Families, which provides 35 beds for adults and children. The Redwood
   Gospel Mission in Santa Rosa houses between 70 and 80 men each night; the Redwood Gospel Mission
   also operates "The Rosc," a women's shelter which houses about 12 women each night. The Manna
   Home, also run by Redwood Gospel Mission, provides emergency shelter for women and children. The
   women's emergency shelter (operated by the YWCA) provides emergency shelter for women and
   children fleeing domestic violence. See Appendix B for a full listing of emergency shelter services in
   Sonoma County.
  According to the 2013 Homeiess flensus and Strrvey, in Sonoma County 76 percent of homeless
  individuals reported receiving government assistance in2013. Use of other services and assistance also
  increased slightly, frorn 89 percent to 9l percent. The top services usetl in 2013 include free meals (91
  percent), shelter day services (63 percent), bus passes (36 percent), and health services (35 percent).
  Many local churches and charities provide funds for emergency shelter at local motels when families are
  displaced from their homes by fires or other circumstances.
  While no emergency shelter exists in the city currently (2014), the City allows çmergency shelters serving
  six ur fewel pelso¡ìs as a permitted used in conjunctioil with a place of worship and as stand-alone
  shelters in all commercial ancl residential zones. The City also allows emergency shelters serving seven or
  more persons as a permitted use tn conJunctron wlth a place of worshrp and as stand-alone shelters in all
  Commercial and in the High Density Residential district (i.e., the R-H, C-O, C-N, and C-R districts).
 Within these four zoning districts, there are currently (2014) 16.83 acres of vacant and underutilized land
 that have been identified as potential sites for the construction of emergency shelters. There are currently
 26 churches in Rohnert Park. Because ofthe 2003 zoning update, each ofthese churches could provide
 emergency shelter for to up to six people per night. This means that the churches alone can shelter 156
 people at any given time. This identified capacity, combined with the potential sites more than covers thc
 Rohnert Park emergency shelter need of 3l beds (based on the number of unsheltered homeless
 individuals in2013).
 City Assistance for the Homeless
The City participated in the development of the Vida Nueva housing project which provides housing for
persons and families that were recently homeless. Vida Nueva opened its doors in December 2008, and
provides 24 units of permanent supportive housing. Permanent supportive housing is affordable housing
with support services on-site that are designed to help the persistently homeless achieve long-term
stability. It is unlike many low-income housing projects in that it is not transitionql, and the support
services are voluntary and not required to live at Vida Nueva.
Populations at risk of becoming homeless also include those living in subsidized housing units         if their
subsidies are discontinued, and those who have fixed or low incomes facing rent increases.

    It is very difficult to reliably estimate the number of homeless. However, the Sonoma County Continuum
    of Care performs a homeless census every year. The homeless count at the city-level varies substantially
    from year to year. [n2009,97 homeless individuals were counted in Rohnert Park. The number increased
    to 446 in 201 1 and then decreased to only 44 individuals in 2013 (31 unsheltered). The variance can be
    explained by the inherently mobile nature of homeless encampments combined with the inconsistencies
    of counting only once every two years. Anecdotal reports also indicate a known large encampment in
   Rohnert Park may have gone unreported, and may be responsible for the sizeable decrease in the count.
   Housing experts have determined that, on average, about I percent of a community's population may be
   homeless at some time during the year. Based on a population of about 40,000, approximately 400 people
   in Rohnert Park may become homeless during ayear. These individuals and families may find temporary
   housing with friends and relatives, stay in a garage, camp out in their automobile, or stay in a shelter.
   The 201I Sonoma County Homeless Census and Survey, organized and published by the Sonoma County
   Continuum of Care, counted 3,247 homeless people in the county through a thorough street-by-street
  canvassing methodology. The methodology change accounts for this significant increase; in the pas!
  volunteers were sent out to interview the homeless only at certain target sites.l'ln2013 the homeless
  count in Sonoma County was 4,280. The methodology was similar to methodology used in 201l; it
  included a point-in-time count of the sheltered homeless population, a point-in-time count of the
  unsheltered homeless population through a street-by-street canvass of all 99 County census tracts, and a
  qualitative suruey of a representative sample of the homeless population.
  University Students
  Sonoma State University (SSU) is located adjacent to the Rohnert Park city limits and receives sewer
 service from the Cify. The university creates a need for student housing in the community. According to
 Sonoma State University Academic Affairs Historical Enrollments,in2013 the campus had about 9,120
 undergraduate and graduate students.
 The University's goal is to provide campus housing to those students who have lived on campus the least
 amount     of time with the majority of residents being first time freshman. Space is also available for
 continuing residents. Currently, campus housing provides accommodations for approximately 3, 100
 matriculated students. The University's housing service/staff is beginning to research and study the
 demand for campus housing for the next five years.tt

    Section             9.4 Housing                       Resources
   This section analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of
   housing in Rohnert Park. This analysis includes an evaluation of the availability of land resources for
   future housing developmcnt, the City's ability to satisfy its share of the region's future housing needs, the
   financial resources available fo supporl housiug activities, and the adnlínistrative resources availablc to
   assist in implementing the City's housing programs and policies.
   Regional Housing Needs Allocation
   Statc Housing Elcmcnt law rcquircs that a local jurisdiction accommodate a share of the region's
  projected housing needs for the planning period. This share is called the Regional Housing Needs
  Allocation (RHNA). HCD detemines the supply and affordabilit-v of housing that would, if met- make
  housing more accessible to current and future residents. This determination is based on a number of
  factors, including the level of overcrowding, potential loss of housing due to demolition, and projected
  regional growth rates (e.g., projected population, jobs, and households). The Association of Bay Area
  Covernments (ABAC), as the rcgioual planniltg agency, is responsihlc frrr alloualirrg flrc RHNA to
  inciiviciuai jurisriictions within rhe region. t;ompiiance with this requirement is measurecl by the
 jurisdiction's ability to provide adequate land to accommodate the RHNA. The allocation takes into
  account factors such as market demand for housing, employment opportunities, the availability of suitable
 sites and public facilities, commuting patterns, type and tenure of housing need, and other factors. In
 determining a jurisdiction's share of new housing needs by income category, the allocation is adjusted to
 avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any one jurisdiction. The allocation of
 projected housing demand is divided into four income categories:
           Very Low-Income       -  up to 50 percent of the median income;
           Low-Income      - 51 to 80 percent of the median income;
           Moderate-Income      -  81 to  120 percent of the median income; and
           Above Moderate-Income         - more than 120 percent of the median income
Based on the requirements of AB 2634 (Statutes of 2006), each jurisdiction must also address the
projected need of extremely low-income (ELI) households, defined as households earning less than 30
percent of the median income.

   The RHNA is distributed by income category and covers an eight-year planning period from January l,
   2014, to October 31, 2022. Table 9-36 summarizes the housing needs allocation as divided into four
  income categories. For the 2015-2023 Housing Element, the City of Rohnert Park was allocated a total
  RHNA of 899 units. The allocation is broken up into four income categories: very low, low, moderate,
  and above-moderate. Of the 181 very low-income units in the RHNA, HCD guidance states that it is fair
  to assume that half (or about 90) are for extremely low-income households (those earning less than 30
  percent of AMI, or under $24,800). This equals approximately l0 percent of the total RHNA. The
  allocation for very low- and low-income housing is 288 combined, or 32 percent of the total RHNA. The
  RHNA for moderate-income and above moderate-income housing is 127 (14.1 percent) and 484 (53.8
  percent), respectively.

   Housing Production under the Previous RHNA
  The previous Housing Element identified adequate sites to accommodate the 2007-2014 RHNA of 1,654.
  However, as shown in Table 9-37, total housing production in Rohnert Park (31 units) met only about 2
  percent of the RHNA during the previous planning period. There was a total capacity of 6,861 units on
  available sites, 1,313 of which were appropriate for very low- and low-income development and 5,548
  were appropriate for moderate- and above moderate-income development. The Cþ's efforts were largely
  directed at very low-income housing; however, only 6.4 percent of the very low-income housing goal was
  met. There were no low-income housing units created between 2007 and 2014. Overall, about 4 percent
  of the RHNA was met for lower-income housing units. Additionally, less than I percent of the above
  moderate-income housing goal was met. The limited number of houses constructed during this period can
  be attributed to the economic repercussions of the 2008 housing crisis.

 Because of the declining housing market, the Creekwood, Sonoma Mountain Village, Stadium Area, and
 University District Specific Plan developments were approved but not constructed, as shown in Table 9-
 38. Since these units were not constructed and the sites are still available, they can be counted towards the
 2014-2022 RHNA.
 Residential Sites lnventory
State law requires each jurisdiction in Califomia to demonstrate the availability of adequate sites thLrough
appropriate zoning and development standards and the availability of public services and facilities. These
available sites must provide the necessary policy and regulatory guidance to accommodate a variety of
housing types at a variely of income level.s. The City must demonstmte that the estimated capacity of
adequate sites will be able to accommodate the projected housing need for the2014-2022 RHNA.

       To enable the City of Rohnert Park to meet RHNA goals, the City must evaluate its capacity to provide
       available sites to meet projected future housing needs. The City must demonstrate it has or will make
       available adequate sites with appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and
      facilities to accommodate the RHNA. The following section shows how the City will meet this
      requirement through approved and potential projects within the current city limits. The City has also
      identified projects outside the cunent city limits and within the current Sphere of Influence that could
      provide potential long-term housing capacity, upon annexation. These projects are not counted towards
      the2014-2022 RHNA as they are currently under Sonoma County jurisdiction.
      Development Potentialwithin the Current City Limits
     As shown in Table 9-38, there are opportunities for approximately 4,656 new units within the current city
     limits, including 643 lower-income units, 1,601 moderate-income units, and 2,412 above moderate-
     income units. These projects are shown in Figure 9-4.
    Since the Housing Element planning period begins January 1, 2014, Rohnert Park's RHNA can be
    reducedbythenumberof newunitsapprovedorplannedasof January 1,2014. Citystaff compiledan
    inventory of all approved and potential (anticipated to be approved and built by the end of the current
    Housing Element plaruring period) residential projects with a housing component as of January 1,2014.
    The sites inventory is made up of two types of approved projects and potential projects. Approved
    projects have already received approval from the City in the form of a tentative map, development
    agreement, development area plan, or other entitlements. For approved projects deed-restricted affordable
   units were inventoried as lower-income. Sites that are designated Mixed-Use and High-Density
   Residential allow up to 24 dwelling units per net acre, and were inventoried as available to moderate-
   income residential development based on expected rents. Sites that are designated Medium-Density
  Residential allow up to 12 dwelling units per net acre, and were inventoried as available for moderate-
   income residential development based on expected rents. All other sites were inventoried as above
  moderate-income.
  Potential projects have not yet received entitlements from the City, but are expected to within the RHNA
  planning period. Potential projects were identified in accordance with the "default density standard" set
  forth in Government Code Section 65583.2(c) (3). The default density standard is the density "deemed
  appropriate" in State law to accommodate housing for lower-income households given the fype of the
jurisdiction. Rohnert Park is considered a "suburban jurisdiction" with a default density standard of 20
 units per acre. HCD is required to accept sites that allow for zoning at this density as appropriate for
 accommodating Rohnert Park's share of the regional housing need for lower-income households. For
 potential projects, deed-restricted affordable units were inventoried as lower-income. All other units were
 inventoried as above moderate-income units.

  Sonoma Mountain Villaqe Proiect
 Snntrrrra Mountain                                   Village (SMV) platured developttretrt, approved August 24,2010, is located at the
 southwest corner of Bodway Parkway and Camino Colegio. SMV is a sustainably designed contmunif.y
 based on the "One-Planet Living" ecological footprint principle. The development area is the former site
 of the Agilent Campus, and contains several existing buildings. In total the final development plan comes
 to approximately 175 acres. When it was approved, SMV was rezoned as a planned development (PD)
 that includes a combination of residential, retail, office/business, and commercial uses.
 In total 1,892 housing units are approved for development, including 1,694 residential units and 198
market-rate second dwelling units. Housing types include rowhouses, townhomes, live/work,
condominiums, single family detached, cottages, estate homes, lofts, apartments, family cohousing, senior
cohousing, and second dwelling units. As described in the Affordable Housing Plan, the project will meet
the City's Inclusionary Housing Ordinancc though thc provision of 254 affordablc dwclling units. If
operated as rental housing, 50 percent of the deed-restricted units must be rented to very low-income
households and 50 percent must be rented to low-income households. If the deed-restricted units are sold
as owner-occupied housing, 50 percent of the units must be sold to low-income households and 50
percent must be sold to moderate-income households. Since at least half (127) of the deed-restricted units
will be affordable to low-income households regardless of whether they are rented or owner-occupied, the
Housing Element counts 127 deed-restricted units as lower-income units and 127 deed-restricted units as
moderate-income units. Although densities will likely provide for more affordable housing, the remaining
1,638 units (including 198 second units) are inventoried as above moderate units.

       The University District Specific Plan was originally approved in May of 2006 and then amended in June
       2014. The Specific Plan divides future housing development into general plan designations. A total of
       1,645 units are approved for the University District Specific Plan area. A total of 1,454 of these units are
       entitled as a part of the Amended and Restated Development Agreement for the Vast Oak and University
       District LLC properties. These properties, described below, were inventoried as approved and entitled
       projects.

      In 2006 the UDLLC and Vast Oak Properties submitted a tentative map application with their intent to
      subdivide approximately 226.58 acres in the Vast Oak Properly and34.34 acres in the UDLLC property
      (APN 045-262-001 through -004, 047-13l-019, and 047-13l-024 through -027). A new map for the
      same area was submitted to correspond to the 2014 Specific Plan and was approved in June 2014. The
      project is approved with a mix of residential, park, open space, public/institutional, and mixed
      use/commercial uses. Housing would consist of single-family detached and attached dwellings as wells
      as multi-family stacked-flat, caniage, townhome, live/work condominium ownership, and rental
     homes.
     Vast Oak includes a mix of residential designations and densities. The project is approved for l2 acres
     of land designated Rural Estate density, resulting in 26 single family        homes inventoried as above
     moderate-income units. It also includes 58 acres of land designated Low-Density Residential, resulting
     in 331 single family homes inventoried as above moderate-income. There are 60 acres of land
     designated Medium-Density Residential, resulting in 526 attached dwellings, townhomes, and rental
     homes inventoried as moderate-income. There are also 24 acres of land designated Mixed-Use on the
    southeast corner ofthe specific plan adjacent to the land designated Open Space. This land is approved
    for 150 multifamily units and 100,000 square feet of commercial use. These units were inventoried as
    moderate-income. The UDLLC properfy, located south of Rohnert Park Expressway, will include22.34
    acres of a ne\M designation called Public/Institutional/N4edium-Density. This designation is anticipated
    to result in 203 units of small-lot single family and townhome units and was inventoried as moderate-
    income.
   Finally, there are nine acres of land designated High-Density Residential located on the northwest side of
   the Vast Oak Property. As described in the Affordable Housing Plan in the Development Agreement, the
   project    will meet the City's Inclusionary Housing Ordinance for both the Vast Oak and UDLLC
   properties through the provision of a 218-unit affbrdable apartment complex. This affordable apartment
   complex will be located on land designated High-Density Residential. These units were inventoried as
   lower-income.

     Potential Projects/Sites
     Potential projects/sites are vacant and underutilized sites that the City has identified as candidates for
     potential development, but do not yet have approved development applications. There are four potential
    project sites with capacity for 304 units, in the city of Rohnert Park that will be counted towards the
     2014-2022 RHNA. These sites are summarized in Table 9-39 andshown in Figure 9-4.
    Citv Hall
    The former City Hall site, combined with other parcels owned by the City along Awam Avenue, is zoned
    for  high-density residential. The surrounding parcels were acquired by the former Community
    Development Commission in 2007 for future affordable housing. The sites are designated as R-H by the
    General Plan Diagram, which will allow high-density (up ro 24 units per acre) residential development as
    a permitted use. Therefore, all 6l potential units were inventoried as lower-income units. Access and
    other infrastructure necessary to support residential uses on the sites are already in place.
    Gity Center Area
   There are two parcels in the City Center Area that are zoned for mixed-use development and could
   accommodate 16 units of housing, two of which would be deed restricted and inventoried as lower-
   income units. The mixed-use designatíon allows for an FAR of 1.5 for commercial and office and 2.0 for
   residential uses mixed with office or commercial. Stand-alone, multifamily residential is permitted on this
   site.
   Southwest Shoppinq Genter
  Portions of the seven-acre Southwest Boulevard Shopping Center are aging and it has lost viability as a
  neighborhood commercial center. V/hile specialty stores occupy some of the commercial space, other
  commercial space has remained vacar$. forseveral years. Ownership of the center is split among several
  owners and the site is divided among multiple parcels. The portion that is ripe for redevelopment is
  made up of seven parcels. Multifamily development of up to 143 units has been discussed for just the
  largest of the seven parcels (this parcel is 3.24 acres); 22 of these units would be deed-restricted and
  inventoried as lower-income units. Existing access and other infrastructure appears adequate to accommodate
 residential development on the site.
 Reserve at Dowdell
 Reserve at Dowdell includes the remaining capacity from the Stadium Area development plan (approved
 by City Council in 2008) excluding the 244 units from Fiori Estates apartment complex, which is
 included as an approved project. Reserve at Dowdell is designated Residential Hígh-Densify and is
planned for 84 units.

  Residential Sites Summary
  This sites inventory has relied on the City's Inulusiunary Huusing Ordinance to inventoty approved
  projects and potential projects/sites. However, if the City were to rely on the default density standard and
  general plan densities, all approved and potential projects that are designated mixed-use or high-density
  residential would be inventoried as lower-income units. This methodology would result in a total of 2,995
  units inventoried as lower-income and 1,671units inventoried as moderate and above moderate-income.
  Table 9-41summarizes all approved projects and potential projects/sites by genetal plan designation.

       However, the City has elected to rely on the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to inventory lower-income
       units. This much more conservative methodology still results in 516 units inventoried as lower-income,
       228 morc than the 288 lower-income units assigned to Rohnert Park for the 2014-2022 planning period.
      As shown in Table 9-42, after accounting for capacþ from approved projects and potential projects/sites,

     Long-Term Growth Areas
     The City's regional share of housing t'or the planning period is providcd within the current city limits.
    However, significant, long-term residential growth could occur in areas outside of the limits. Namel¡
    there are two specific plans and an existing subdivision. The largest of these areas are the Northeæt and
    Northwest Specific Plans (depicted in Figure 2.4-l of the Land Use and Growth Management Element).
    Except for the provisions of the Growth Management program, no phasing requirements have been
    imposed on these areas, and property owners of any specific plan area can submit a specific plan and
    annexation request to the City. The type and location of residential development for each of the specific
    plan areas is summarized below, as described in the Land Use and Growth Management Element. These
    areas are summarized in Table 9-43 below.

   Canon Manor
  The Canon Manor rural subdivision of 229 units, an unincorporated area located immediately south of
  Sonoma State University, was once accessed by graveled roads and supported by individual water wells
  and septic systems. In the past the subdivision was plagued by failing sewer systems and contaminated
  water supplies, however, roads have now been paved, and water and sewer lines have been installed.
  Potential development of the Canon Manor area as provided for by the General Plan Diagram includes
  approximately 113 Rural Estate Residential infill units and l9l Low-Density Residential units south of
  Alice Drive. This area is not expected to be annexed by the City of Rohnert Park at any time in the near
  future but it is within the City's Sphere of lnfluence.

    Northeast Specific Plan Area
    The General Plan Diagram provides      for23.l  acres of Rural Estate Residentialand 109.1 acresof Low-
    Density Residential along the east side of Snyder Lane, between Copeland Creek and the "G Section"
    Neighborhood; as well as 6.6 acres of Medium-Density Residential and 12.5 acres of High-Density
    Residential along the north and south sides of Eleanor Avenue. Community Design Element Policy CD-
    43 stipulates that the High-Density Residential development is to be located adjacent to open space and
    along the proposed north-south artefial and collector streets to maximize accessibility. A total of 1,090
    units are proposed for the Northeast area.
    Northwest Specific Plan Area
   The Northwest Specific Plan proposes development of approximately 363 units on either side of the
   rWilfred Avenue extension. The Specific Plan was first reviewed by the Planning Commission and City
   Council in 2008, both of which then provided comments to the applicant. The Specific Plan has been
   resubmitted and is currently (2U$ under review. Community Design Element Policies CD-44 and CD-
   47 are designed to ensure that residential developments are designed to capitalize on views of the
   surrounding separator to the west and north, and beyond, and that adjacent commercial areas are
  compatible with the residential uses.
  Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
  State law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available through appropriate
  zoning and development standards to encourage the development of a variety of housing types for all
  economic segments of the population. This includes single family homes, multifamily housing, second
  units, mobile homes, farmworker housing, homeless shelters, and transitional housing, among others.
  The housing types allowed within the City of Rohnert Park zoning districts are described below.
  Single Family
 A "single-family dwelling,     altached" is defined in the Rohnert Park Zoning Ordinance as two or more
 dwelling units situated on separate lots and having a common or party wall separating the dwelling units
 (duplex, townhouse, zero lot line developments). A "single family dwelling, detached" is defined as a
 detached building containing a single dwelling unit and surrounded by open space on the same lot. Single
 family dwellings are permitted in the R-R, R-E, R-L, and R-M zones. A Conditional Use Permit is
 required for single family units in the R-H zone.
 Multifamily
 Multifamily housing made up over 36 percent of the City's housing stock in 2013. Multifamily
developments are permitted in the R-M, R-H, and M-U zones. The maximum densities in these zones
range from 6 units per acre in the R-M to 30 units per acre in the R-H zone.

    Manufactured Housing and Mobile Homes
   Manufactured housing and mobile homes can be an affordable housing option for low- and moderate-
   income households. According to the California Department of Finance, in 2013 approximately 9 percent
   of Rohnert Park's housing stock was made up of mobile homes. Pursuant to State law, a mobile home
   built after June 15, 1976, certified under the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Act of
    1974, and built on a permanent foundation may be located in any residential zone where a conventional
   single family detached dwelling is permitted subject to the same restrictions on density and to the same
   property development regulatíons. Mobile home parks are conditionally permitted in the R-M and R-H
   districts.
  Second Units
  A "second dwelling or residential unit" is defined as an attached or detached dwelling unit that provides
  complete independent living facilities for one or more persons." It must include permanent provisions for
  living, slecpiug, eatiug, cookiug, and sanitation on the sarnu parcul wherc ths single larnily dwelling is
  situated. A second unit also includes an efficiency unit and a manufactured home. In Rohnert Park second
 units are allowed in all zones with a Certificate of Zoning Compliance and are subiect to the following
 standards:
       r     A second resiclential unit is allowed on any residential lot of at least 4,000 square feet in size;
       ,    A second residential unit must be architecturally compatible with the main unit and must maintain
            the appearance of a single family residence;
       r    Only one second unit is allowed per legal parcel;
       .    The total floor area of a second unit must not be more than 50 percent of the floor area of the
            existing or proposed main unit, nor can the total floor area exceed 700 square feet or contain more
            than one bedroom;
       r    One additional standard size off-street parking space must be provided in addition to the off-street
            parking requirements required for a single family dwelling; and
      ¡     Detached second units must meet the height and setback requirements for accessory structures.
 Farmworker Housing
Agricultural operations in the immediate vicinity of the cify are generally limited to family-owned-and
operated-farms centered on cattle grazing and hay growing that does not customarily require hired and
temporary farm labor. However, farmworker housing is permitted by right in the R-R, R-E, and R-H
districts. The City also complies with the Employee Housing Act, which requires local governments to
treat employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer employees the same way as a single-
family unit with a residential land use designation. The City does not require a conditional use permit or
other permit that is not required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same zone, and use of a
family dwelling for the purposes of employee housing for six or fewer occupants does not constitute a
change of occupancy.

      Residential Care Facilities
      Residential care facilities licensed or supervised by a Federal, State, or local health/welfare agency
     provide 24-how non-medical care of un¡elated persons who have a disability and are in need of personal
     services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the
     protection of the individual in a family-like environment.
     In Rohnert Park small residential care facilities, serving six or fewer clients, are regulated similar to a
    single family use and are permitted in the R-R, R-E, R-L, R-M, and R-H zones. Large group homes,
    serving seven or more clients, are conditionally permitted in the same five zones.
    LiveMlork Lofts
    A    live/work unit makes new and existing commercial buildings available for joint living and work
    quarters for individuals and families engaged in art-making, small-scale custom manufacturing, and
    similar creative endeavors. Live/work uses are conditionally permitted in commercial and mixed-use
    districts.
    Mixed-Use
   Mixed-use projects combine both nonresidential and residential uses on the same site. Mixed-use
   development can help reduce the effects of housing cost burden by increasing density and offering
   opportunities for reduced vehicular trips by walking, bicycling, or taking public transportation. The
   preferred pattern of development will be ground floor commercial uses with residenTial and/or office uses
   located on the upper floors; however, standalone residential uses are also allowed in the Mixed-Used
   district. Mixed-use is permitted in the M-U district as well as commercial zones so long as the residential
  development is located in the same building as a non-residential use. In the commercial zones residential
  uses as a part of a mixed-use project are only permitted when located in the same building as a
  nonresidential use.
  Emergency Shelters
  State law requires that local jurisdictions strengthen provisions for addressing the housing needs of the
  homeless, including the identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a
 permitted use without a conditional use permit. The stafute permits the City to apply limited conditions to
 the approval of ministerial permits for emergency shelters. The identified zone must have sufficient
  capacity to accommodate at least one year-round shelter and accommodate the City's share of the
 regional unsheltered homeless population. Section 50801(e) of the California Health and Safefy Code
 defines emergency shelters as housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is
 limited to occupancy of six months or fewer by a homeless person.
The City's Zoning Ordinance permits large emergency shelters (seven or more persons) in the R-H, C-O,
C-N, and C-R zones and conditionally permits shelters in the PI zone.
Pursuant to State law, the City established standards for the following:
       .     Minimum square foot floor area;
       .    Proximity to other shelters (300 ft.);
       .    Lenglh of stay (minimum-28 days, maximum-lO0 days);

   Transitional Housing
  Transitional housing is a type of housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless individuals and
  families to permanent housing. Residents of transitional housing are usually connected to supportive
  services designed to assist the homeless in achieving greater economic independence and a permanent,
  stable living situation. Transitional housing can take several forms, including group quarters with beds,
  single family homes, and multifamily apartments, and typically offers case management and support

 Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
 SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct from a
 studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen and bathroom.
 Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many SROs have one or the other.
 SROs are permitted in the R-R, R-E, R-H, and M-U districts with an administrative permit. The City has
two names for its SRO units: the single room occupancy living unit facility, which is permitted strictly in
the City's residential zoning districts, and the single room occupancy residential hotel, which is permitted
strictly in the City's commercial zoning districts. Both are permitted in the M-U district.
 Financial Resources
Since the dissolution of Rohnert Park's redevelopment agency in 2012, the Community Development
Commission (CDC), the City has lost its main source of funding for housing and, therefore, coordinates
with other agencies and organizations to provide housing programs. As the successor agency to the CDC,
the City currently owns a few parcels of vacant land as well as three properties.

    The City contracts with SCCDC for administrative services for its rehabilitation programs. The SCCDC
   employs staff with training and experience in conducting such programs. Its services include marketing
   rehabilitation loan funds, taking applications and obtaining third-pary verifications of application
   information, employing underwriting standards in the approval of loans, obtaining appraisals, verifying
   payment oftaxes, ordering credit reports, obtaining title reports, verifying insurance coverage, procuring
   pest reports, preparing rehabilitation work programs, procuring contractors for rehabilitation work,

   Housing Rehabilitation Program
   The Sonoma County Communify Development Commission (SCCDC) administers the                         Housing
   Rehabilitatíon Program to all cities in the county with the exception of the cities of Petaluma and Santa
  Rosa. The program assists low- and moderate-income households with incomes of up to 120 percent of
  area median income.
  SCCDC uses CDBG funding in addition to funds and program incomes that have rolled over from
  previous years. The program received about $231,000 in CDBG funds for the FY of 2ol3ll4 plus an
  additional $400,000 from roll over funds. The maximum loan amount is $50,000 for single family homes,
  $25,000 for multifamily units, and $24,000 for mobile homes. Deferred, forgivable loans are available to
  very low- and low-income households, and amortized loans are available at below-market interest rates to
  moderate-income households.
  The purpose of the progam is to provide loans to low-income households to maintain owner-occupied
 residential properties located within the County, including Rohnert Park. The primary objective of the
 program is to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing for low-income residents of the city through the
 correction of actual or potential health and safety problems in existing structures. The secondary
 objectives ofthe program are to preserve the city's affordable housing stock and to assist in the process of
 neighborhood revitalization. In fìscal year 2013114, nine houses \ilere rehabilitated in Rohnefi Park. An
 additional five are in the process of being rehabilitated and should be completed by the end of the fiscal
 year.
 SCCDC staff developed brochures, flyers, and press releases to market the program. Advertising and
 outreach includes newspaper articles and press releases, direct mailings to property owners, and
 neighborhood informational meetings.

)     Section    I Housing Choice Vouchers
      The Federal Séction I program provides rental assistance to very low-income households in need of
      affordable housing. The Section 8 program assists a very low-income household by paying the difference
      between 30 percent of the gross household income and the cost of rent. Section 8 assistance is structured
      as vouchers; this allows the voucher recipients to choose housing that may cost above the fair market rent
      as long as the recipients pay for the additional cost.
     The SCCDC acts as the Sonoma County Housing Authority, which operates the Section 8 program; the
     Housing Authority assists 679 households in Rohnert Park through its rental assistance programs.
     Specifically, 665 households are assisted through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program.
     Of these households 426 include a disabled family member, 269 include children under the age of 18, and
     215 include a senior, age 65 or older. The head of household in 584 of the HCV households is identified
     as white, 46 asBlacU{frican American, 15 as American Indiar/AlaskanNative, 17 as Asian, and 3 as
     Native Hawaüan/Pacific Islander; 85 HCV heads of household identiff as Hispanic.
     The Sonoma County Housing Authority currently (2014) has 9,290 households countywide on its Section
     8 Housing Choice Voucher Program waiting list. Preliminary screening of the people on the waiting list
    indicates thaf 4,310 are families with children, 3,406 are families that include a member with a disability,
     and 1,157 are families with an elderly head of households. Over 80 percent (7,498) of the households on
    the waiting list fall into the extremely low-income category; the remaining households on the waiting list
    include 1,792 very low-income households. Currently the populations with the most urgent special
    housing needs are seniors, persons with disabilities, persons and families leaving emergency homeless
    shelters, youth transitioning from foster care, and persons with HIV/AIDS. These are among the groups
    most vulnerable to unaffordable and substandard housing conditions.20

 Opportunities for Energy Conservation
 Energy efficiency is directly related to affordability of housing especially for low-income households, as
 money spent on utilities can substantially reduce the amount that can be spent on food. shelter. and other
 basic needs.
 Rohnert Park has taken many actions         to reduce  its impact on the environment by becoming       more
 sustainable. Highlights of recent efforts include:

       On November 26, 2013, the City adopted the 2013 California Building Code which requires new
       residential buildings to meet a comprehensive set of standards for energy conselation. Builders of these
       units may achieve compliance by calculating enerry performance in a prescribed manner or by selecting
      from altemative component packages that prescribe a fixed method of compliance. All proposed
      residential units are checked by the Building Department to ensure that their design and construction
      complies with Title 24 energy standards. Additions and alterations must also meet these standards        if they
      increase the heated or cooled floor space ofa building.
     Opporfunities for improving energy conservation in the design of residential development include
     ensuring the consistency of tentative tract maps with Section 66473.1of the Subdivision Map Act, which
     requires the designs        of   subdivisions   to provide for future     passive or natural heating or  cooling
     opportunities, and requires the planting oftrees along streets and in parking lots to reduce heat.
    In February 2012 the Regional Climate Protection Authority (RCPA) partnered with the County of
    Sonoma Permit and Resource Management Deparlment (PRMD) to secure a Sustainable Communities
    Planning grant from the Strategic Growth Council for $1 million. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction

    collaborative effort among all nine cities and the County of Sonoma to take fl¡rther actions in reducing
   GHG emissions community-wide.
   Through the implementation of this program, participating jurisdictions will achieve compliance with Bay
   Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) guidelines and other related policies that establish
   reduction targets for GHG emissions, including AB 32, CEQA, and local GHG reduction goals. Building
  upon the climate protection efforts and goals established in the 2008 Community Climate Action Plan
  created by the Climate Protection Campaign, the goal of the GRIP is to update all municipal and
  communitywide GHG inventories, evaluate emissíon targets, and create an implementation plan to reach
  those targets. The updated climate action plans that are developed for each jurisdiction will be tailored to
  specific circumstances, while at the same time benefiting from a countywide perspective.
 The County will develop a comprehensive indicator monitoring program to measure the GRIP's success
 toward achieving outcomes related to more sustainable communities and reduced GHG emissions.ttThe
 County will measure the decreased energy use by sector in accordance with the Sonoma County
 Community Action Plan through programs such as the Sonoma County Energy Independence Program to
 provide educational resources and a financing mechanism for enerry retrofits. Additional measured
 outcomes include decreased municipal energy use through efforts of the Sonoma Counfy Water Agency
 (SCWA) and General Services programs such as the construction of solar energy systems, fuel cells,
 geothermal heat exchange, and an increased local renewable energy portfolio through the existing
 Renewable Energy Secure Communities (RESCO) grant to SCWA.

  rebates inclutle cool rooß, insulation, zurd water heaters. Residents are granted befween $100 and $200
  per 1,000 square feet for installed cool roofs and up to $500 for attic and wall insulation. Installing new
  energy-efficient water heaters qualifies residents for a $30 rebate.
 PG&E also offers energy-efficiency tax credits under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 for both
 homeowners and builders. Existing homeowners are eligible for tax credits up to a maximum of $500 for
 cncrgy-cfficient improvements. Ân additional tax credit is available for solar energy systems. Builders of
 energy-cfficicnt new homes are eligible for tax credits up to a maximum of $2,000.
 PG&E provides a r¡arieÐ¡ of energy consen¿ation services for resiclents as well as offers a wealth of
 financial and energy-related assistance programs for low-income customers:
           The Balanced Payment Plan (BPP). Designed to eliminate big swings in a customer's monthly
           payments by averaging energy costs over the year. On enrollment PG&E averages the amount of
           energy used by the household in the past year to derive the monthly BPP amount. PG&E checks
           the househoici's aucounl every four nurnlhs to lrake sure tirat its estiurated average is on talget.                 if
           the household's energy use has increased or decreased dramatically, PG&E will change the
           u¡rount of monthly payment so tlut the household does not overpay or underpay [oo much over
          the course ofa year.

     Chapter 9: Housing Element
    Section             9.5 Housing                Constraints
    A number of factors may constrain the development of housing, particularly housing affordable to lower-
    income households. Constraints to the provision of adequate and affordable housing are created by
   market, governmental, infrastructure, and environmental factors, among others. These constraints may
   increase the cost of housing, or may render residential construction economically infeasible for
   developers. Housing production constraints can also significantly impact households with low and
   moderate incomes and special needs.
   An analysis of these factors can help in the development of programs that lessen both govemmental and
   non-governmental constraints that afl-êct suppiy and cost of housing.
   Governmental Gonstra ints
   Governmental regulations and exactions are designed to achieve desirable land use patterns, coordinate
   clevelopment with infrastructure expansion, finance capital improvements, equitably distribute the cost of
  public sclviccs, maintain thc ambiancc of cxisting ncighborhoods, improvc the urban environment, and
  preserve open space and unique ecosystems. Local policies and regulations, however, can impact the
  price and availability ofhousing and, in particular, the provision ofaffordable housing. Land use controls,
  site improvement requirements, fees and exactions, and permit processing procedures, among other
  issues, may constrain the maintenance, development, and improvement of housing. This section discusses
 potential governmental constraints in Rohnert Park.

 General Plan Policies
 In addition to the Housing Element, the Land Use and Growth Management Element and the Community
 Design Element of the General Plan directly affect the location and type of housing that may be
 developed as well as the timing of development.
 Land Use and Growth Management Element
 The Land Use and Growth Management Element provides for a variety of housing Lypes, particularly
higher-density housing, in order to meet the needs of a growing population and lower-income households.

   As shown in Table 9-44, the Element includes five residential land use designations with a density range
   from 2 units per acre to 24 units per acre. The density and FAR provisions are suffìciently high to allow

    Urban Growth Boundary and Growth Management
    The Land flse and Crowth Mauageureltt Element provides for the establislurtettt of all flrban Grt¡wth
    Boundary ruGB). The UGB delineates the ultimate edge of urban activity within the Rohnert Park
    Planning Area through 2020. If includes the area within the current city limits as well as annexed and
    specific plan areas identified in the General Plan. ln November 2000 a 20-year Urban Growth Boundary
   ballot measure was approved by the voters replacing Policy GM-2 in the General Plan. It may be
   modified only by public vote, except in certain circumstances. The City then adopted a Growth
   Management Ordinance that is consistent with General Plan policies.
   The UGB promotes a compact urban form that ensures the efficient provision of services and preserves
   agricultural and open space oufside of the boundary. The Cily's growth management provisions are
   intended to ensure that growth within the UGB is paced to achieve General Plan buildout over a Z}-year
  period, representing an annual average population growth rate of 1 percent. The provisions also ensure the
  necessary infrastructure and public facilities are provided for new development.
  The growth managernent program anticipates an average of approximately 225 new housing units per
  year and only applies a development cap if residential building permits in any two successive calendar
  years exceed 560 units. Housing that is affordable to vcry low- and low-incomc houscholds is not
  included in the total housing counts. The program also allows the cap to be adjusted up or down by as
  much as 10 percent by the City Council on an annual basis to accommodate changes in land use program
  assumptions (e.g., vacancy rate factors and household size)-
  When applications for residential approvals exceed the ggowth management program's annual limits, a

 management program is also reviewed arurually to determine, inpart, whether priority should be given to
 specific housing types to achieve a balanced land use and housing program (Policy GM-4).
 During this planning period the City's RHNA allocation is 899 units, of which 288, or 32 percent, are to
 be affordable to very low- and low-income households. The growth management program's provisions
 for annual growth (225) exceed the 69-unit annual average needed to meet the moderate and above
 moderate regional housing need allocated to the City for the 2014-2022 period.zz
"Given that 288 of the City's 899-unit RHNA is made up of units affordable to very low- and low-income households, 611 units
  remain that a¡e affected by the growth management progl'am; affordable units do not count toward the trigger cap calculations.
  Dividing the 6l I units by 8.83 years (the length of time remaining in this planning period), an average of 69 per year would
  need to be built to fulfill the RHNA. This is well below the 225 vnitper year limit imposed by the growh management
  program.

     Balance of Housíng Types
    The General Plan encourages a balance of housing types. It requires that specific plans and implementing
    ordinances construct planned housing types at buildout. Based on this evaluation, it can be concluded that
    the provisions of the Land Use and Growth Management Element do not represent a constraint on the
    development of housing for all income levels.
    Communitv Desiqn Element
   The Community Design Element is intended to protect and enhance Rohnert Park's physical and visual
   character. Several of its policies promote a diverse and affordable housing base, including the integration
   of townhomes and multifamily dwellings with single family residences (Policy CD-17). Policies can also
   facilitate the reduction of parking requirements for high-density and senior housing (Policy CD-29).
   The following is a list of several other policies in the Community Design Element:
        '    Ensure that the University District is developed   in a manner that is sensitive to the existing
             residential developments to the west (CD-31);
       r    Ensure that development in existing neighborhoods is respectful of the character of existing uses
            and causes minimal design intrusion (CD-53);
       ,    Develop linkages within and between neighborhoods through linear parks, interconnected
            networks of streets (CD-2);
       r    Promote connections with adjacent neighborhoods (CD-B and CD-2);
       r    Ensure   a   fine-grained and integrated pattern   of  streets that provide continuity between
            neighborhoods, have a human scale, and enhance the character ofneighborhoods (CD-24); and
       r    Minimize the visual dominance of garages (CD-21).
  None of the Community Design Element's goals or policies negatively impacts the affordability or design
  of new residential development.
  Specific Plans
  Universitv District Specific Plan
 The University District Specific Plan was originally approved in May 2006 and was updated in2014,but
 is not yet constructed. It encompasses approximately 297 acres specifically for mixed-use, pedestrian-
 oriented development. The development will provide diverse residential opportunities as well as a
 commercial center to accommodate the needs of the residents of new and existing neighborhoods and
 SSU students, faculty, and staff.

 The Northeast Specilic Plan is located within unincorporated Sonoma County. l'he dratt pian cails tor the
 development of a residential community of approximately l,ll4 units in a variety of housing densities
 and types, 16.5 acres ofparks and bikeways, and nearly 38 acres ofother open space on an approximate
 27S-acre site adjacent to the northeastern edge ofthe city.
 Northwest Specific Plan
 The proposed Specific Plan Area is located just outside the northwest City Limits, west of Highway l0l.
 The planning process will be aimed at identifying a community-based vision for the area. Based on a
defined vision, a framework will be developed to guide future land uses, development. and public
improvements in the area.
A specific plan or specific plan amendment provides the framework to phase and pace growth within the
Specific Plan area so as to ensure the completion of all necessary public facilities concurrently with
completion of the Specific Plan. A specific plan identifies adequate financing mechanisms for the
infrastructure and public facilities required to support the development.

')     Zon¡ng Ordinance
       The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily through the
       Zoning Ordinance. In general the City's zoning regulations are designed to balance the goal of providing
       affordable housing opportunities for all income groups, while protecting the health and safety of residents
       and preserving the character of existing neighborhoods. The provisions of the City's Zoning Ordinance
      directly control the approval process for residential development and affect the type and design of
      housing thaf may be constructed. A complete revision of the Zoning Ordinance was undeftaken and a new
      Zoning Ordinance was adopted in 2003 following the adoption of the General Plan in 2003. The Zoning
      Ordinance reflects General Plan policies and programs and incorporates State-mandated provisions. It is
      designed to protect and promote public health, safety, and welfare, as well as to promote quality design
      and quality of life.
      The City's Zoning Ordinance specifies the zoning districts in which residential development may occur
      and under what circumstances. There are four basic residential zones and one mixed-use zone:
           '   R-R/R-E District allows single family dwellings as a permitted use. Manufactured housing
               requires a certificafe of zoning compliance as do second units. This is done as a ministerial act.
               SRO units are allowed with an administrative permit.23
           '   R-L District allows single family dwellings as a permitted use. This district is comprised of four
              sub-districts: R-L-5,000, R-L-6,000, R-L-8,000, and R-L-10,000. As in the R-R/R-E district,
              Manufactured housing and second units require a certificate of zoning compliance.
           I  R-M District allows single family dwellings as well as side-by-side duplexes as permitted uses.
              Manufactured housing and second units require a certificate of zoning compliance. Multifamily
              projects are not permitted.
          .   R-H District allows multifamily housing as a permifted use. This district is comprised of two sub-
              districts: R-H-2,000 and R-H-1,800. Single family dwellings are allowed with a conditional use
              permit. SRO units are allowed with an administrative permit. As with the other districts,
              manufactured housing and second units require a ceftificate òf zoning compliance.
          .   M-II District allows live/work, multifamily,              and townhor¡se housing as a permitted use. SRO
              units are also permitted by right.
    Table 9-45 summarizes residential uses permitted in residential and commercial districts. Single family
    residential zoning includes three districts: R-R/R-E, R-L, and R-M. Single family units are permitted right
    in all single family residential districts. Emergency shelters and residential care facilities with fewer than
    six people are allowed in single family zoning districts.
   23An
         Administrative Permit is a permit that is conditionally approved by Community Development stafÈa faster process than a
     Conditional Use Permit, which is approved by the Planning Commission.

   Residential Development Standards
   Table 9-46 summarizes fhe Zoning Ordinance minimum standards for residential lot sizes, yards, open
  space per unit, and maximum lot coverage. Development standards specific to each zone district are
  desÍgned to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents, as well as implement
  the policies of the General Plan. These standards also serve to preserve the character and integrþ of
  existing neighborhoods. Generally, development standards can limit the number of units that may be
  constructed on a particular piece of properfy. Limiting the number of units would mean higher per-unit
  land costs and, all other factors being equal, result in higher development costs that could impact housing
  afI'ordability.

  Modifications to minimum standards are allowed under many circumstances as described below:
      r    A minimum lot size of 4,500 square feet may be allowed in the Rl-District for projects that use
           design features such as clustering and common open space areas. Tlris is done tluough specific
           plan, planned development, and/or subdivision review.
      ¡    In the M-U District front, rear, and/or side yard setbacks may be reduced or eliminated if
           approved by the Planning Commission and if struetures remain outside of an easement and
           comply with City-approved design guidelines. This is done through design review.
      .    The interior side yard setback may be eliminated for attached dwelling units in the R-M and R-H
           districts, provided the applicable building code requirements can be met. This is done through
          specific plan, planned development, and/or subdivision review.
  Maximum height limitations on residential development are as follows: 35 feet in R-R, R-E, R-L, and R-
  M districts, 45 feet in the R-H and M-U districts for primary strt¡ctt¡res.
 None of these development standards have been identified by applicants as prohibitively restrictive.
 Developers report that meeting the minimum open space and maximum lot coverage provisions has not
 been an obstacle to the development of housing. Furthermore, non-profit housing gror¡ps seeking to
 provide housing affordable to lower-income households have found the densities allowed in the higher-

     Parking Standards
     Table 9-47 summarizes the residential parking requirements in Rohnert Park. Parking requirements do not
     constrain the development of housing directly. However, parking requirements may reduce the amount of
     available lot areas for residential development. The City requires one parking space per dwelling be in a
     Qarpoft or gaîage (except for multifamily units), allowing greater flexibility in site design and building
    configuration.

  The Zoning Ordinance recently reduced parking requirements for residential care facilities, senior
  housing, and off-campus student housing.
  The Development Services Director may grant exceptions to parking requirements through an
  administrative permit. This provision has been used in the past to allow the conversion of garages to
 living space without      a requirement for any new covered parking to offset the loss of parking.
 Design Review
 The Zoning Ordinance requires architectural and design review for any new residential building other
 than a single family home on a single lot. The site plans, elevation drawings, and landscaping plans of
Iarger projects are typically reviewed by the Planning Commission.
The City adopted a new set of design guidelines in 2012. These guidelines include general principles
relating to site design, scale of buildings, and the orientation of structure as well as street and path access
to creeks to promote neighborhood and open space connectivity. Guidelines associated with residential
design include:

 Density Bonus
 State law requires the provision ofceúain incentives for residential development projects that set aside a
 ceftain portion of the units to be affordable to lower- and moderate-income households and for senior
 citizen housing developments. The City implements State law through its density bonus for affordable
 housing ordinance. Under current State law jurisdictions are required to provide density bonuses and
 development incentives on a sliding scale, where the amount of density bonus and number of incentives

density bonus consistent with State law to developers who agree to construct any of the following:
             At least     10 percent of the total units are designated                              for low-income households;
             At least 5 percent of the total units are designated for very low-income households;

            At least l0 percent of the total in a condominium project for moderate-income households.
The amount ofdensity bonus granted varies depending on the percentage ofaffordable units provided and
ranges from 5 percent to 35 percent. To obtain a density bonus in Rohnert Park, the developer must
submit a preliminary proposal for staff review prior to the submittal of any formal request for approval of
a density bonus. The purpose of the preliminary proposal is to determine whether the proposed housing
development is in compliance with applicable planning regulations. Confirmation of compliance of the
preliminary proposal does not constitute approval of the housing development. Rather it indicates that the
housing development nominally complies with the City's applicable plaruring and zoning regulations.

ì       Project Review
        Delays in processing housing development applications through a City's review and approval process can
        add to housing costs. Ifthe developer buys the land outright, there are interest costs, and ifthey obtain an
       option to purchase, there are option costs to hold the land.
       Length of Review
       In  recent years varying amounts of time were taken to consider and approve housing construction
       proposals. However, in general, typical entitlements take three to six months and larger projects-such as a
      specific plan-take one to two years. As in other cities, CEQA adds considerable time to the process.
      Generally, the greater the public controversy regarding a proposal, the longer the time spent in the review
      process. Controversy and resulting delays are often prompted by a zoning change-in other words, if sites
      are already zoned for residential use, expected delays are minimal. Public hearing continuances have
      resulted from requests by project opponents for additional information, studies, and project re-designs.
      Each change in the project design can have associated architect and engineering fees, which grow with
      each revision.
     Processing delays can also result from incomplete submittals by project applicants, inadequate responses
     to staff requests for additional information and exhibits, and failure to design projects to City standards.
     Appeal Process
     The review process can also be delayed by provisions of the Municipal Code. A prior provision in the
     Zoning Ordinance (Section 17.62.070 D.) used to allow the Council to decide whether it wanted to hear
    an appeal. In 2003 the City Council revised fhe Zoning Ordinance, eliminating the step of having the City
    Council first determine if it will hear an appeal before actually hearing the appeal itself.
    Specific Plan Requirement
    The Land Use Element requires the preparation of specific plans prior to development in any of the
    growth areas. While this requirement will lengthen the review and approval process, it is necessary to
    ensure that development occurs in a manner consistent with land use and design criTeria, environmentally-
   sensitive areas are conserved, and adequate infrastructure is provided. Furthermore, the Sonoma Local
    Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) requires a"plan for services," which may be in the form of a
   specific plan, depending on the size and nature of the project. Under the current General Plan, the City
   has chosen to use specific plans in relation to future annexations; especially for large, complex projects, a
   specific plan is an effective tool to meet a variety of agency needs as well as conform to legal mandates.
   Prior to the Commission's consideration of a change of organizafion involving annexation of territory to a
   cily,the applicant must provide a plan for services including written evidence from the affected city that it
   has the physical and fiscal capacity to adequately serve the subject teritory. The plan for providing
   services must include all of the following information and any additional information required by the
  Commission or the Executive Officer:
         r   An enumeration and description ofthe services to be extended to the affected territory;
         .   The level and range ofthose services;
         r   An indication of when those services can feasibly be extended to the affected territory;

  Adopted Godes
  The City has adoptecl the 2013 Califomia Builcling Code incorporating the National Electrical Code,
  Uniform Plumbing Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, the Uniform Housing Code, and the California Fire
  Code. The City has amcndcd thcsc codcs in a fcw instanccs whcn nccessary to protect the health, safety,
  and welfare of its residents. For example, the City has amended the Building Code with additional
  requirements f'or concrete slab floors to mitigate local expansive soil conditions. Lighted address numbers
  are required to improve identification of homes by emergency personnel. Smoke detectors are required in
  single family homes and automatic fire alarm systems must be provided in multifamily complexes and
  condominium complexes. Automatic fire suppression systems must be installed in new residential
  stluctures and substantially-remodeled dwelling units. While these measures result in higher initial
  housing costs, they are ofßet over the long run by savings on homeowners insurance and properly
 damage.
 In January 2013 the Califomia Building Standards Commission (CBSC) adopted the 2013 California
 Green Building Standards Code, otherwise known as "CALGreen," which became effective January l,
 2tJl4. CALGreen is California's first green building code and a first-in-the-nation State-mandated green
 buiiciing code. it is ibrmaiiy known as the Califomia Green Buiiding Standarcis Cocie, Titie 24, Part i i, of
 the California Cocle of Regr.rlations. CAf,Green establishes mandatory minimum green building standards
 and includes more stringent optional provisions known as Tier I and Tier 2. Cities and counties, at their
 discretion, may adopt Tier I or Tier 2 as mandatory or adopt and enforce other standards that are more
 stringent than the CALGreen Code. The City              of Rohnert Park has adopted       CALGreen, including
 voluntary residential and nonresidential Tier I measures for all new construction except for the Energy
 Efficiency Provisions contained in Appendix A4 Division A4.2 and Appendix A5 Division 45.2.
 CALGreen requirements for new buildings include:
       r     Reduce water consumption by 20 percent;
       .     Diveft 50 percent of construction v/aste from landfills;
       .     Install low pollutant-emitting materials;
       .     Separate water meters tbr nonresidential building indoor and outdoor water use;
       .     Moisture-sensíng irrigation systems for larger landscape projects; and
       '     Mandatory inspections of energy systems (e.g., heat fumace, air conditioner, mechanical
             equipment) for nonresidential buildings over 10,000 square feet to ensure that all are working at
            their maximum capacity and according to their design efficiencies.
The City's building code requirements do not adversely impact the cost of construction. The requirements
address basic health and safety considerations.
On average five residential code enforcement actions occur each month. Given that buildings constructed
in Rohnert Park are aging, the need for building code enforcement activity has increased in recent years.

¡      Site lmprovements
       The City has residential development requirements for landscaping, street width, fences, and walls. The
       City adopted these standards to ensure that minimum levels of design and construction quality are
       maintained and adequate levels of street and facility improvements are provided. While the City's
       development standards are similar to those in otherjurisdictions, there may be some standards that exceed
      the level necessary to ensure adequate circulation and parking, drainage, environmental protection, and
      protection from visual nuisances. The City's standards are summarized below. The standards included in
      this summary are those which typically have a potential to affect housing costs, but are necessary to
      provide a minimum level of design and construction quality in the city's neighborhoods.
      Landscaping: Landscape plans should demonstrate a recognizable theme for the overall development by
      choice and location of materials. Street trees (minimum l5 gallon size) are required, as is the installation
     of utility lines underground to enhance the appearance of residential neighborhoods. Planters must be
     installed and maintained adjacent to every street frontage for the fi-rll length.
     Residential Streets: The Community Design Element calls for a 52-foot wide local neighborhood street
     section (CD Figure 3.2-5)that provides two travel lanes, fwo parking lanes, sidewalks, and curbs and
     gutters on either side. This design is intended to adequately accommodate traffi,c, parking, pedestrians,
     and drainage.
     These requirements are standard and reasonable; most architects would regularly incorporate them into
    their plans and are not seen as particularly onerous for developers.
    Water Availability
    Issues related to water supply are complex in Sonoma County. Rohnert Park has been party to multiple
   water supply-related lawsuits, including one on the 1999 General Plan EIR that the City settled and a
   Water Supply Assessment (WSA) prepãred by the City in 2005.24 As the culmination of several years of
   litigation, in November 2008 a State Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the City of Rohnerl Park,
   upholding the validity of the City's 2005 WSA, which states that the City has adequate and sufficient
   water supplies to irnplement its General Plan. The General Plan provides the framework for all of the
   specific plans described in the Residential Sites Inventory chapter of this Housing Element along with the
   number of housing units they are to contain. The City will have adequate water supply to fulfill fhe 2014-
   2022 RHNA.

     Chapter 9: Housing Element
    The City of Rohnert Park curently derives its drinking water supply from 26 active municipal wells, the
    Sonoma County Water Agency (SC\ryA) Petaluma Aqueduct, and recycled water. The sources of the
    oqueduct water are from the Dry Creek, Eel River, and Russian River watersheds. The City is able to
    achieve a balance of these supplies as necessary to rneet demands and limit impacts. For instance,
    between June and September, in accordance with the Temporary Impairment MOU, the City may reduce
    its use of SCWA water and make up for this reduction with groundwater and recycleci water.
   In 2003 the City installed residential water meters. Water demand has dropped as a result of meter
   installation and commodity pricing. The 2005 WSA assumed a l0 percent reduction in single family

   with the City's water conservation policy, which seeks to achieve a voluntary 10 percent reduction
   through eonservation efforts.
   Recycled water is supplied by the Cify of Santa Rosa Subregional Systcm. The Subregional System
   maintains a contract with each individual user on the Rohnert Park Urban Reuse system, incltrding the
   City. Rohnert Park is one of the largest users of reclaimed water in the county. Sites in Rohnert Park that
  use reclaimed water include all parks and school grounds south of Golf Course Drive, the North and
  South Rohnert Park Municipal Golf Courses, Roberts Lake, and various commercial and industrial sites.
  According to the Cilv's 2010 Urban Water Management Plan, "combined projected water supplies are
  sufficient to meet projcctcd demands." While new development extending to the 2020 Urban Growth
  boundary would necessitate the installation of additional distribution lines to serve growth outside of the
  existing city limits, specific plan developers are aware of this additional cost and are prepared to incur it.
  lmpact Fees and Exactions
 The Çity charges a variety of development impact fees. While in the past the City chargcd fccs for capital
 outlay, water and sewer connections, water reclamation, trafftc impacts, and parks/open space/recreation,
 these were simplified in2O04 with the adoption of the Public Facilities Financing Plan (PFFP), wtich was
 last updated in 2012. The PFFP outlines a comprehensive strategy for managing the costs of capital
 facilities, maintenance, and services that are impacted by new development. Fees are adjusted for
 inflation annually, and vary by unit type and location. For example, fees charged per single family
 dwelling unit are higher than those charged per multifamily dwelling unit and fees charged to greenfield
development are higher than those charged to infill development.
While development impact fees may affect housing prices, the only altematives would be their payment
by the existing taxpayers of the Cify of Rohnert Park or no further residential development, either of
which is infeasible.

       Park and School Dedications
      Rohnert Park has developed according to the neighborhood concept. Residential neighborhoods are
      constructed around a park andlor school site, the dedication of which is required by the City's subdivision
      regulations. The required area is approved by the City Council upon approval of the tentative map with
     the City's Parks and Recreation Commission providing input regarding the proposed park site and its
     improvements. Standards in the General Plan provide guidance as to how much land needs to be
     dedicafed.
     lnclusionary Housing Program
     The inclusionary housing requirement is a critical component of the City's housing program and an active
    means of providing affordable units to households typically excluded from of the housing market. In
    2009,the case of Palmer/Sixth Street Properties, L.P. vs. City of Los Angeles, 175 CaL App 4th 1396
    (2009), held that the City of Los Angeles Inclusionary Housing Ordinance was invalid for rental
    properties under the Costa Hawkins Act. Since that time there have been no contrary court decisions to
    Palmer, and there have been no legislative changes to alter the holding of Palmer. In light of this court
    case, Rohnert Park no longer requires market rate rental projects to provide affordable units. The City
    only applies the inclusionary requirements to ownership projects. Developerc of residential ownership
   projects over five units are required to sell 15 percent of the units at prices affordable to low- and
   moderate-income households. It is City practice to require that affordable units are comparable in number
   of bedrooms, exterior appearance, and overall quality of construction to market rate units in the same
   prqect-26 Homes must remain affordable for 45 yòars.
   Furthermore, the inclusionary program is intended to promote the economic integration of lower-income
   households in neighborhoods and the dispersion of such units throughout the city. The requircment may
   also provide an incentive for developers to take the next step and increase their project's share ofunits
  affordable to lower- income households to 35 percent in order to qualify for a housing density bonus.27
  The inclusionary requirement is also intended to ofßet the negative effects of new market-rate housing on
  the provision of non-market rate housing. The construction of above moderate-income housing depletes
  the antou¡rt of available resitlential land, while contributing to rising land prices because of a greater
  scarcity of developable sites, although given that the Rohnert Park General Plan can accommodate a
  much greater population than projected by ABAG or housing units required by the RHNA, housing sites
  are not scarce. Market-rate housing development also exacerbates the affordable housing problem by
 creating greater needs for goods and services typically provided by employees earning lower wages.
 26Any
        differences in size or interior features ofaffordable units compared to those ofmarket-r'ate units requires written approval
  of the Planning Manager and the City Manager, and requires that construction be of similar quality to market-rate units and
  consistent with contemporary housing standards.
'1In way of futher explanation, there is nothing in either the density bonus or inclusionary housing provisions from preventing a
  developer from taking advantage of the density bonus option as well as complying with the inclusionary housing requirements,
  creating more flexibility for the developer.

     Chapter 9: Housing Element
    Since 2003, when the Inclusionary Housing Program (as well as the In-Lieu Fee requirements and
    Housing Trust Fund) was adopted by City Council, 599 affordable units have been constructed and an
    additional 3 14 affordable units approved.
    lnclusionary Housing Options
   Instead ofbuilding at least          l5  percent affordable units, developers have two options: (1) pay in-lieu fees
   that   will be used to       creatc affordable housing, or (2) commit to one                 of three "alternative equivalent
   actions."
   ln-Lieu Fees
  ln   cerl.ain uiruurlstances developem ltave the option             of paying inJieu fees into thc Housing Trust Fund,
  which      is solely   dedicated    to  assisting  in  the development       of affordable housing. In June 24, 2012, the
  Housing Trust         Fund   had  a  balance   of $240,000.    Two    developers     have taken advantage of the inJieu tèe
  option so far. In        the  case  of   one developer,    in-lieu  fees   were    calculated   based on the maximum HUD
  aisistance for low- and         very   low-income     one-, two-,   and  three-bedroom       units  in Sonoma County.28 In the
  case of the other developer, the required            affordable   units  were   built, but  the  moderate-income        units would
  not sell (given current market conditions) so an             agreement     was   negotiated    with   the  City to pay  inJieu fees
  for those units to enable them to be marketed without restrictions.                  The  City  has    not adopted   an  in-lieu fee,
 but this option is available to future clevelopers subject to the completion                  of an   inJieu   study.
 InJieu fees can be made for fractions of required units or when a project is located on less than one acre
 of land or if it contains l0 or fewer units" However, in-lieu fees will only be accepted to meet the
 inclusionary housing requirement if the developer can produce tìnancial data showing that it is not
 feasible to'buiici afforcÍabie units (i.e., the-array of incentives oiTereci by the City do noi mitigate
 additional costs incured by the developer).2e In the case of demonstrated infeasibility, the ctlmr¡lative
 impact on development costs is eased by the ability to pay in-lieu fees instead of requiring the on-site
 building of affordable units.3o
 There has been extensive debate over the question ofwho bçars the cost ofan inclusionary requirement.
 Depending on the relative strength of the housing market, the costs may be incured by:
28ln
      case the developer decided to build the l5 percent required low-income units (35 units-the entire project has 200 units) and
   pay into the Housing Trust Fund to help facilitate a future affordable project which would include 17 very low-income units.
   The unit size proportions ofthe development were used to calculate that the 17 units should be broken down as follows: 8 one-
   bedroom, 8 two-bedroom, and I three-bedroom unit. The subsidies per unit were $14,500 (per one-bedroom unit), $17,500 (per
  two bedroom), and $23,000 (per three bedroom unit).
t'To prove financial infeasibility, developers must submit a report identifuing: (l) all overriding conditions impacting the project
  that prevent tle developer from meeting the inclusionary requirement, (2) sufficient independent date, including appropriate
  financial information, that supports the developer's claim that it is not feasible to constructed the required affordable units, and
  (3) a detailed analysis ofwhy the concessions and incentives provided will not mitigate the identified overriding conditions
  preventing the construction of the affordable units.

            '    Landowners who may receive a lower price for their land        if developers are expecting a lower
                profit margin from the inclusionary requirement;
           '    Developers who may have to accept lower profits if housing prices cannot be raised; and/or
           '    The purchasers of market-rate units who may have to pay higher housing prices if the local and
                regional housing supply is limited and prices are at least as high in areas outside the city.
      The fact that landowners, developers, and/or the purchasers of market-rate units may incur a portion of
     the cost of providing affordable units, may be construed to act as a constraint to the overall development
     of housing in a community. Rohnert Park's inclusionary ordinance, however, mitigates this prospect by
    providing a wide range         of  incentives  to developers who provide affordable housing units. These
     incentives include:
          .    Expedited processing for development applications;
          .    Deferment of fee payment;
          r    An additional density bonus (to the maximum 35 percent already granted by the City, subject to
               City Council review and approval);
         r    Development standard reductions/modifications (i.e., minimum           lot size, open space, parking
               andl or setback requirements);
         '    Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with a housing project if non-residential uses will
              reduce the cost of residential development and if non-residential uses are compatible with
              residential uses and surrounding development; and
        .     Direct financial assistance in the form of a loan or grant (money from the trust ñrnd).
   These incentives are meant to ofßet developrnent costs by, for example, providing a density bonus above
   that currently allowed in the City (a maximum of 35 percent). In the case of the developer that elected to
   pay in-lieu fees, a parking reduction was also granted, helping ofßet costs-
  Alternate Equivalent Actions
  Insteacl of bttikling affordable units or paying in-lieu fees, developers can choose to propose among three
  other options: donate land; transfer inclusionary credits; or create second units. An applicant may donate
  land to a nonprofit housing developer in place of acfual construction of required affordable units upon
  approval by the City Council. The dedicated land must be appropriately zoned, buildable, free of toxic
 substances and contaminated soils, and large enough to accommodate the number of required affordable
 units. An applicant may also transfer inclusionary unit credits from one residential development project to
 another, upon approval of the City Council. Credit certificates are issued for specific income categories
 and may only be used to satisfy the requirements for affordable units within the same category. Finally,
 an applicant may develop second uníts to meet not more than 50 percent of the inclusionary housing
 requirement af a ratio of two second units per required affordable unit. Furthermore, these second units
must meet the City's continued affordability requirements for affordable housing.

    Conclusion
    The inclusionary housing requirements have not had a negative effect on housing production in the city
    since they were instituted in 2003. A substantial number of housing units have been built in the city since
    2003, and property owners have initiated and completed specific plans for virtually all growth areas. The
    inclusionary requirements do not have the effect of divertirrg residential development to uiher St¡noma
    County jurisdictions, since inclusionary requirements have been adopted by neighboring Santa Rosa,
   Petaluma, and Cotati, as wcll as Healdsburg, Sonoma, Sebastopol, and Windsor. r\lso, given that the

   Limiting the inclusionary requirement to 15 percent, providing alternative means of compliance, as well
   as vafious incentives, the program is not seen as an unduc or onerous cottstraitrt on the provision of
   market-rate housing.
   Constraints to Housing for Persons with Disabilities
   Given that persons with disabilities frequently have difficulty finding housing that meets their needs, the
   State requires special analysis of governmental constraints to housing for persons with disabilities.
  Zoning and Land Use Policies and Practices
  The City complies with State and Federal fair housing laws and has a number of its own fair housing
  practices (See 9.3). The Zoning Orclinance's clefinition of "family" complies with applicable statutory and
 case law and does not restrict the number of individuals who may reside in a unit that otherwise complies
 with the Building Code. The Land Use Eiement does not require any minimum ciistance f'or the siting of
 community care facilities housing disabled persons. The City works with affordable housing developers
 to provide housing tailored to those with physical and mental disabilities. There are approximately 6 adult
 residential facilities in Rohnert Park for developmentally disabled adults that can accornmodate up to 36
 individuals.3r

    Evaluation of the Permit and Processing Procedures for Reasonable Accommodations
    The City has adopted a reasonable accommodation ordinance, which provides a procedure to request
   reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal
   Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. A request may be made by any
   person with a disability, their representative, or any entity. A request may include a modification or
   exception to the rules, standards, and practices for the siting, development, and use ofhousing or housing-
   related facilities. These modifications would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a
   disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. Requests will be reviewed by the development
   services director, who will make a written determination within 45 days and either grant, grant with
   modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation. In granting a request, the reviewing
   authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary.
   The Cify complies with all State laws regulating licensed residential care facilities. Facilities with fewer
  than six persons in single-family zones are treated the same as any other single-family home. The City
  also complies with State laws regarding facilities with seven or more people (a conditional use permit is
  required in High Density Residential zones). The public comment period for group homes is no different
  from that for other types of residential development.
  Building Code Review
  The City has adopted the 2013 California Building Standards Code
  Non governmental Gonstrai nts
  Nongovernmental constraints are those that are not created by local governments, but may be lessened
 through their actions.
 Construction Costs
 Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with multifamily housing being
 somewhat less expensive to construct than single-family honres, on a per square loot basis. They are also
 influenced by market demands and market-based changes in the cost of materials.

  The cost of lumber and wood products accounts for one-third of the costs of materials used to build a
  home. A typical 2,000-square foot home uses nearly 16,000 board feet of lumber and 6,000 square feet of
  structural panels, such as plywood.33 The composite price for lumber has increased with the increase in
  housing prices from under $300 per 1,000 board feet for much o12007 and 2008 to $394 per 1,000 board
  feet in 2013 and $400 per 1,000 board feet in 2014.\n 2014 RS Means (a reliable published source for
 construction industry costs) estimated that the hard construction costs in the Santa Rosa area was Sl86 per
 square foot for a typical one- [u tlree-sl.ury nrulti-farnily rcsitlerrtial prujcct with wood siding and fì'arnes
 and a floor area of 22,500. Based on the International Code Council Building Valuation DaÍa, a one- and
 tlvo family residential construction rvould cost approximately $ll8 per square foot. This equals a rough
 estimate of $186,000 for a 1,000 square foot apartment and $236,000 for a 2,000 square foot single-
 family home.
 The average home in the U.S. in August and September 2013 was built on 14,359 square feet,had2,607

 in20l3. On average, lot sizes are shrinking, but both the cost and the size of the home are on the rise.
 Land Costs
Land costs have a demonstrable influence on the cost and availability of affordable housing. As land
becomes less available, the price of land increases. Approximately 25 percent of housing costs are
attributable to land costs in most real estate markets. Land costs are also affected by such factors as
 zoning density, the availability of infrastructure, the existence or absence of environmental constraints,
and the relative amount of similar land available for development.

     According to online listings from Zillow.com, in March 2014 three vacant residential parcels were listed
     for sale in the city. These vacant parcels ranged in price from $99,000 to $980,000. The prices of land
    vary depending on a number of factors, including size, location, the number of units allowed on the
    property, and access to utilities. The asking price for land available ranged from $8.11 to $19.80 per
    square foot, with an average price of$14.90 per square foot (or 5650,000 per acre).
    Developed residential, commercial, and industrial properties that are zoned for residential uses can also be
    redeveloped with new housing developments. The cost to clear an acre of land for redevelopment
   signifìcantly increases the cost of development, as do the local, State, and Federal policies relating to
   relocation and replacement of low-income housing residents. Depending on the existing improvements
   that must be removed to redevelop a site, the total cost to acquire a parcel, relocate occupants, and
   possibly mitigate hazardous materials can be quite expensive. This can pose a problem for development if
   Rohnert Park rents or sales prices cannot support the higher cost development.
   Financing Costs
   Mortgage lnterest Rates
  Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher interest rates
  increase a homebuyer's monthly payment and decrease the range of housing that a household can afford.
  Lower interest rates result in a lower cost and lower monthly payments for the homebuyer. Besides
  lowering monthly interest payments for new buyers, lower interest rates allow existing homeowners to
  refinance their homes, thereby lowering monthly housing costs and perhaps preserving their ownership
 status.
 When interest rates rise, the market typically compensates by decreasing housing prices. Similarly, when
 interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. There is often a lag in the market, causing housing
 prices to remain high when interest rates rise until the market catches up. Lower-income households often
 find it most difficult to purchase a home during this time period.

   As shown in Figure 9-T,mortgage rates decreased from2007, hitting a historic low in 2013 of 3.41
   percent for a 3O-ycar fixcd-ratc mofigagc. In 2013 intcrcst ratcs startcd to increase; but still remain
   historically low as of 2014. The mortgage banlcing crisis that began in 2008 affected the availability of
  construction financing and mortgage loans. Lenders that had once offered mortgage loans more freely
  became much more restrictive after 2008. Lenders required down payments of 20 percent and credit
  scores irigher than 680 to receive competitive interest rates. These restrictions placeci homeownership out
  of reach for many, though in 2013 lenders began to ease the qualifications required for a competitive
  mortgage rate. As the economy continues its slow recovery, lenders may continue to make mortgage
  loans more accessible, although thcy may never bc as easy to obtain as they wcrc prior to 2008.

 Construction F¡nanc¡ng
Financing costs for construction are affected partly by how early in the development process loans must
be taken out and how long the loans must be carriecl. Project delays can increase total ínterest payments,
and create greater fìnancial risk for a project. Overall, construction fìnancing usually represents a small
contribution to total housing costs.
V/hile there is more scrutiny of developer credentials and banks are requiring a higher loan-to-value ratio,
the cost of construction financing is historically low, with prime rates below 5 percent in 2014. Faced
with a lagging housing market, the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates since laTe 2007,
enabling many projects to pencil out that would not otherwise. Where financing is available, construction
capital seems to be directed at the best transactions-those with large, established, and well-capitalized
sponsors. Given recent trends, the availability of financing is likely to be less of a constraint on new
housing construction during this Housing Element planning period than it has been in the recent past. The
City is already noticing increased interest in new projects andan increase in stalled projects restarting.

      Down Payments and Move-ln Costs
     The ability to accumulate a down payment remains a formidable banier to many potential homebuyers.
     Low-income households find it difficult to make the transition from rental to ownership units because
     they cannot accumulate a down payment while renting.to In December 2013 a 5317,750 home (the
    median price in Rohnert Parþ would require a20 percentdown payment of $63,350.3s
    Similarly, low-income households may find it difficult to obtain rental housing because they may have
    problems accruing the necessary down payment in the form of security deposits and first and last months'
    rents.
    Environmental Gonstraints
   In its 2010 Draft Local Hazard Mitigation PIan, the City assessed Rohnert Park's vulnerability to natural
   disasters based on information provided by ABAG. The ABAG multi-jurisdictional Local Hazard
   Mitigation Plan lists nine hazards that impact the Bay Area, including five related to earthquakes
   (faultíng, shaking, earthquake-induced landslides, liquefaction, and tsunamis) and four related to weather
  (flooding, landslides, wildfires, and drought). Of the five earthquake-related hazards listed, surface
  faulting, landslides, and tsunamis are not considered hazardous to the city. Rohnert Park is also not
  subject to dam inundation, as there are no dam structures that would pose a threat within the vicinity.

     The City was impacted by the 2005 and 2006 winter storms, with general ramifications ranging from
     flooding events to power outages.36 The City's public works crews assessed the flooded areas and were
     able to clean out blocked drainage trash gates, remove debris from ditches and culverts, and place
     flooded, road closed ahead, and road closed signs, as needed, to wam the public offlooded areas. Today,
    public works has some provisions for sandbags thaL are primarily available to areas where living space is
    at risk of being flooded or impacted. Vehicles, properties, and buildings sustained damage from flood
    waters particularly on Martin Avenue and Heartwood Court. The City's 2010 Draft Local Hazard
    Mitigation Plan has policies to reduce the flood risk by ensuring new development pays its fair share of
    improvements to the storm drainage system, providing sandbags and plastic sheeting to residents
    (delivering if necessary), and ensuring the design of new subdivisions to reduce or eliminate flood
    damage. Additionally, when trees fall in the roadway, fhey are moved out of the roadway, and when the
    storm clears, the trees are cut up and removed.
    Rohnerl Park is subj ect to periodic drought conditions as part of the climacteric cycle for the region. The
    City's adopted Water Supply Assessment (WSA) examines the city's future development under its
    General Plan and the ability of the current and projected water supply to accommodate the existing
   population as well as future growth. Potential drought problems have been examined in the City's WSA
   and are accompanied by measures recommended to help address these problems. Furthermore, the Cþ
   expects to work with ABAG, the Sonoma County Vy'ater Agency, and any applicable water supply agency
   on this issue. The City also plans to work with ABAG to develop specific infomation about the kind and
   level of damage to buildings, infrastructure, and critical facilities, which might result from any of the
   hazards previously noted. The City has reviewed the hazards identified and ranked the hazards based on
  past disasters and expected future impacts. The conclusion is that earthquakes (particularly shaking), pose
  the greatest risk for potential loss ofproperties.
  Since 1855 more than 140 earthquakes have been felt in the Santa Rosa area. The 1906 earthquake caused
  61 deaths and major damage in Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Healdsburg, and other communities. The last
  major earthquake felt by Sonoma County was a S.7-magnitude seismic event on the Healdsburg Fault in
  Santa Rosa in 1969. Since 1965 nine major earthquakes have resulted in significant physical and
  structural damage in Sonoma County. Analysis of seismic data indicates that 8.5 and 7.5 magnitude
  earthquakes can be expected for the San Andreas and the Healdsburg-Rodgers Creek Faults respectively.
  Earthquakes of magnitudes 8.0 or more on the San Andreas Fault can be expected every 50 to 200 years.
 The City of Rohnerl Park would be subjected to very high levels of shaking in the event of a 7.1
 earthquake on the Healdsburg-Rodgers Creek Fault. In such an event the Association of Bay Area
 Governments estimated in 1996 Lhaf af. least 13,669 dwelling units in Sonoma County would be
 uninhabitable." ABAG estimated that 1,821 acres of existing residential land would have high potential
 for shaking based on 2009 hazard mapping estimates.

   Chapter 9: Houslng Element
  More than half of the "red-tagged" units, deemed unlivable in its cunent condition, are anticipated to be
  mobile homes, which tend to sustain greater damage from equivalent intensities of shaking than wood-
  frame buildings. During an earthquake the jacks on which a coach is typically placed will tip, causing the
  coach to fall off some or all of its supports. Although the jacks may punch holes through thc lloor of the
  coach, it is usually relatively undamaged. Despite the minimal damage, however, the mobile home
  becomes uninha'oitable, as it must be retumed to its foundation, leveled again, and reconnected to uiiiities.
  The City's Draft Local Hazard Mitigation Plan in 2010 stated that the housing department should identify
  and work toward tying down mobile homes used as year round pennanent residents an appropriate cost-
  sharing busis.
  Although single family, wood-framed homes are less likely to be red-tagged, significant damage can
  occur from falling hot water heaters, failed cripple walls, falling unreinforced masonry chimneys, and
  dislocation of structures from their foundations. Two-story homes with living space over garages are
  particularly wlnerable to damage.
  Similarly, multifamily wood-framed buildings may have living areas above parking areas, supported only
 by posts. The "soft" first story may also be constructed of concrete masonry unit bearing walls. These
 designs offer little resistance to lateral seismic forces. [n200112002 the City's building official identified
 30 to 40 multifamily units in four buildings with ground floor parking that could be highly susceptible to
 seismic damage. A consultant was retained by the Cit_v in 2005 to collect data on the susceptibility of all
 resídences in Rohnert Park to seismic activity with thc goal of producing a scismic retrofit ordinance. Thc
 Building Division is in the process of preparing such an ordinance based on the data that was collected.
 The Cify's Drafr Local Hazatd Mitigation Plan in 2010 required engineering plan sets for retrofitting of
 hcavy two story homes with living areas over garages, split level homes, and soft story retrofits, until
 standard plan sets and construction details become available. It also mentioned that the Building
 Department is responsible for providing technical assistance in seismically strengthening soft-story
 structures.
 During the previous Housing Element planning period, the Rohnert Park Community Development
 Commission (CDCRP) completed the installation of earthquake-resistant bracing systems in more than
 474 mobile homes, which represent nearly one-third of the 1,466 mobile homes within thc city.
 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, which are allocated through the County, are
periodically used to install Mobile home bracing systems.3s

    This Section contains the City's Housing Plan for the 2015-2023 Housing Element planning period. State
    law rccognizes the vital role local govemments play in the supply and affordability of housing. Each local
    government in Califomia is required to adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical
    development of the city or county. In order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all
   economic segments of the community, the Housing Element must do all ofthe following:
         .  Identify the agencies and officials responsible for the implementation of the various actions and
            the means by which consistency         will be achieved with other general plan elements and
            community goals.
        '   Identiû adequate sites which will be made available through appropriate zoning and development
            standards and with the public services and facilities needed to meet the needs of all income levels.
            This shall include rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, and
           transitional housing.
       .   Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income
           households.
       .   Address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the
           maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
       r   Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock.
       I   Promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, marital status,
           ancestry, national origin, or color.
 The following goals, policies, and programs are designed to address the existing and projected housing
 needs of the City of Rohnert Park. Each program has one or more individuals, bodies, or agencies
 responsible for its implementation, along with a potential or committed funding source, and a schedule for

   QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
   One of the requirements of State law (California Govemment Code Section 65583(b)) is that the Housing
   Element contain quantified objectives for the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development
   ofhousing. The quantified objectives set a goal for Rohnert Park to achieve based on needs, resources,
   and constraints. State law recognizes that the total housing needs identified by a community may exceed
   available resources and the community's ability to satisfy this need. Under these circumstances the
   quantified objectives need not be, and are not intended to be, identical to the total housing needs.
  The quantified objectives shown in Table 9-51 represent goals. They are estimates based on past
  experience, anticipated funding levels, and anticipated housing market conditions. The quantified
  objectives are not designed to be minimum requirements. Rather they are based largely upon
  implementation programs that have measurable outcomes. However, the Housing Element contains
  several policies and implementation programs that reduce barriers and create opportunities for affordable
  housing. These policies and programs are essential in meeting the City's housing needs, but are more
  qualitative in nature and are difficult to quantify.
                                                                                                        Above

   This section contains an evaluation of past performance and an assessment of the continr¡ed relevance of
   the previous Housing Element programs in addressing Rohnert Park's existing and projected housing
   needs.
   Comparison of 2007-2014 RHNA w¡th Units Built
  The 2007-2014 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) by income category, which was
  established for Rohnert Park by ABAC in 2008, is shown in Table A-l and compared with actual
  construction. Between 2007 and2014,3l units were constructed, or 1.9 percent of the City's RHNA
  ullocation. When the allocation was caluulaf.etl, the housing market was going through a boom period, but
  the subsequent economic downtum made the allocation difficult to achieve. The market is only now
  starting to recover.

 Review of 2009-2014 Housing Element Policies and Programs
 Table A-2 on the following pages provides an assessment of the City's progress in implementing the
policies and programs contained in the 2009 Housing Element. It is evident that the City of Rohnert Park
has been successful in implementing the policies and programs of the 2009 Housing Element, even during
the recession and with the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency. Available affordable housing
funding has been used effectively to assist with new construction of affordable housing, to assist first-
time homebuyers, to rehabilitate affordable housing, and to provide a variety of housing and services to
special necds populations. However, the review of past accomplishments rcveals that additional measures
are warranted.

Major Housing lssues and Barr¡ers to Affordable Housing
The issues and barriers listed below were identified by workshop participants based on the experience
with housing issues throughout thc rcgion. Many of thc issucs and barriers verbalized at the meeting are
opinions of workshop participants and do not necessarily represent the opinions of City of Rohnert Park
staff or City policy. The following list is not aranged in any particular order of importance or sequence:
         The loss of redevelopment.
         Need workforce and faculty housing.
         .       Need faculty housing for different generations and lifestyles (smaller rental units for young
                 faculty).

                    ¡   Increase owner-occupied home ownership for low- to moderate-income families. This will
                        give renters a place to movc to and keep the workforce in Rohnert Park, allowing people whg
                        are the fabric of the community to live and work locally. This model is used by the UC's and
                        can be applied for SSU staffand faculfy.
            I      Housing element should describe seniors as 55 and over (vs. 65 and over).
           I       Most seniors are on fixed incomes.
           t       Need to have housing for students and others close to new SMART station.
           t       Rental prices are driven up by students causing other residents to compete for housing.
          I        Due to the influx of new casino employees, rental rates have increased (now approximately
                   $1,300 vs. $1, 100-1,200).
         I        Apartments previously accepting Section 8 are declining in number and some tenants are forced
                  to move.
         t        A lot of people are doubling up in Rohnert Park and countywide.
         ¡        People are moving     to Santa Rosa making it harder for Rohnert Park service providers to     serve
                  residents.
                 Rental increases are very recent (within the past few months).
                 Sales prices of housing are increasing.
                 The RHNA underestimates the actual need.
                The RHNA for 2007-2014 was not met (units were not built).
                ABAG didn't consider the impacts of the casino.
                The City is considering selling City-owned sites that could be used for affordable housing.
                Landlords are not maintaining properties; there is less incentive because demand is so high.
                '     Housing stock is old, leading to maintenance issues.
                The School District needs more students-need single-family homes to attract more families.
       I       Need all housing types (small and largelowner and renter).
               One of the mobile home parks went through a condo conversion recently-impacting rental rates
               in the park. State law now allows the City to consider resident views.
      !        The City has a rent control ordinance that sets a maximum price that landlords can charge within
               mobile home parks.
     I        There is no market for new mobile home parks-requires low land costs.
    r         There is community opposition to affordable housing.
    I         Only about 50 percent of the needed childcare is provided in the city.
    I         Landlords are increasing rent on people with disabilities.
              r      People are  living on fixed incomes.
              '      Discrimination against people with disabilities disallows them to compete in the market.
              Need to create affordable housing for people on fixed incomes.
              The City's inability to waive or defer development fees can be seen as a barrier.

  Chapter 9: Housing Element
              r    Limited capacity of the local govemment.
        I    The cost of provirling irfrastructure and utilities for new housing is expensive (even when land is
             donated).
             Need to make     it attractive to builders to build homes in Rohnerl Park-incentives. The demand
             exists, as there is a lot of pressure on the rental market; prices are being tlrivcn up by people who
             can afford a mortgage and would purchase single-family homes if they were available.
 Opportunities and Potential Solutions for Providing Housing
 The opportunities and solutions listed below represent ideas for how to overcome the challenges listed
 above and help provide needed housing within the communify. The ideas are from workshop participants
 and do not necessarily represent the perspective of City oi Rohnert Park staff or City policy. The
 following list is not arranged in any particular order of importance or sequence:
            'l'he City needs political support for inclusionary zoning and it needs to rernove the ln-lieu fee
       '
            option (although the City has not seen any developers use this option).
       .    The City should continue to require 15 percent affordable housing for all new development.
       .    Integrating affordable units into market rate projects is the best way            to provide affordable

                'c
      ,    Redevelop properties for affordable senior housing.
      .    Need more Section 8 vouchers and apartments that accept Section 8.
      r    A greater supply of single-faurily hornes would take pressure off rerfal uuits; now is a good
           time for buyers to qualify.
      .    RDA "Boourerang" Fu¡rd{ities sliould set aside 20 percent for housing (Cities in the County are
           not doing this).
      r    Former RDA sites are opportunities for affordable senior housing (the City could sell to
           Burbank Housing).
     .    Need to provide a variety of housing types to allow residents tt¡ move up and stay.
     '    Need affordable senior housing (studio and one-bedroom units).
          Amend the condo conversion ordinance to allow the City to take the views of mobile home
          residents into account.
     '    Improve "community" development with senior housing built integrated with family
          housing (but many seniors want a quiet place to live like the Altamont).
     .    Builcl mrrlti-generational family housing (e.g., second units, units for seniors, and sfudents).
     r    In an eight-year stretch, the Council can provide rent control for seniors.
     .    Integrate childcare into housing (e.g., home day care, on-site day care, etc.).
     .    Cify could adopt policies to facilitate day care.
     .    Need community investment in child care (e.g., Boys        & Girls Club).

         r     Density Bonus for affordable housing (up to 35 percent density increase with additional three
              concessions).
              r   If the developer provides on-site child care, State law also allows density bonus.

        .    Need land for new mobile home parks.
             '   Provide affordable housing, good management, and well-maintained parks.
       '    Increase non-profit partnerships with the City-adjunct City staff on particular issues
            r    Non-profìts are solutions-oriented and good stewards of the public.
            I    The City could facilitate partnerships between the developers and local non-profits (e.g.,
                 partnership at Sonoma Mountain Village and University).
       .    The City has done a lot for the homeless (Vida Nueva is a national model).
      '     The City helped fund operating expenses for housing for people with disabilities (24 units).
      '     Committee on the Shelterless (COTS) provides permanent supportive housing.
      .    There is a lot of affordable housing in the works in Rohnert Park.
      r    Need land trusts to hold affordable housing projects in perpetuity. When housing is created, the
           land is held in trust to make the land a community asset while still allowing persons to own
           locally and build equity.
 The City and non-profits should partner to create more effective affordable housing solutions. The City is
 curently working with developers on different affordable housing solutions including graded building
 pads complete with utilities ready to go for an affordable housing developer, as well as plans for
 affordable single family homes interspersed throughout project sites.
