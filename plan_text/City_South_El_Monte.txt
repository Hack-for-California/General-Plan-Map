  City of South El Monte Housing Element
                 SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
1.1 BACKGROUND FOR PLANNING
This Housing Element establishes housing policy for the City of South El Monte. South El Monte is located in
the west San Gabriel Valley approximately 11.5 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The City is located just
west of the major freeway interchange of the I-605 and SR-60 freeways. Major physiographic features in the
area include the Rio Hondo River (on the north) and the San Gabriel River (on the south). A regional location
map is provided in Exhibit 1 and a citywide map is provided in Exhibit 2.
South El Monte was incorporated in 1958 and at that time, the City’s population was only 3,900 persons. In
the five decades that followed, the City’s population grew to over 20,000 persons. Much of this early
population growth was due to both annexations and new subdivision development. The majority of the
residential neighborhoods are found in the eastern and central portion of the City. In addition, a substantial
number of housing units are interspersed among the industrial and manufacturing establishments in the
westerly portion of the City. At the present time, residential development accounts for approximately 650
acres or approximately 31% of the City’s total land area. A generalized land use map is provided in Exhibit 3.
1.2 STATUTORY AUTHORITY
The State of California requires that all local governments (both cities and counties) prepare and maintain
housing elements to identify strategies to conserve, rehabilitate, and provide housing to meet the existing and
projected needs of the community. Specific requirements concerning the scope and content of housing
elements have been established by the State Legislature. The Legislature, in turn, has delegated the
responsibility of implementing its directives to the California Department of Housing and Community
Development or HCD. HCD is responsible for ensuring that the State housing law will be implemented at the
local level. To monitor compliance with these requirements and the State’s overall housing policies, all housing
elements must be reviewed by HCD prior to and following their adoption. This Housing Element fulfills the
State of California Planning and Zoning Laws and the regulations of Sections 65580 through 65589.5 of the
California Government Code. The policies and implementing programs contained in this Element will serve as
the City’s blueprint in defining how the existing housing stock in South El Monte is to be maintained and
conserved, while at the same time, how new residential development will be accommodated in the future.
1.3 HOUSING ELEMENT OBJECTIVE
The focus of this Housing Element is to continue a comprehensive and long-range planning strategy that
specifically addresses housing. This Element’s primary objective is to indicate how the City intends to
accommodate its designated Regional Housing Needs Assessment or RHNA allocation. All of the cities and
counties in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area have been allocated certain housing growth objectives
that will enable the region to meet its projected housing need in the coming years. The Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) has been delegated with the responsibility in developing regional growth
forecasts and then assigning new housing objectives for each city and county under SCAG’s jurisdiction.
SECTION 1 ● INTRODUCTION                                                                                  PAGE 5

  City of South El Monte Housing Element
In addition to establishing an overall objective for new housing units for the defined planning period (2014-
2021), the SCAG RHNA also indicated the proportion of future housing units that should be accessible to
households with varying incomes. The RHNA that is applicable to the City is summarized below:
     ●    The RHNA calls for the City to facilitate the development of 169 housing units during the 2014-2021
          planning period.
     ●    The RHNA calls for 43 new units to be provided for those households with extremely low and very
          low incomes (an extremely low income and very low income household is one with an income of 30%
          or less and 50% of the County median income level, respectively).
     ●    The RHNA calls for 25 new units to be provided for those households with low incomes (a low income
          household is defined as one having an annual income of between 51% and 80% of the County median
          income level).
     ●    The RHNA calls for 28 new units to be provided for those moderate income households (a moderate
          income household is defined as one having an annual income of between 81% and 120% of the County
          median income level).
     ●    Finally, the RHNA objectives call for 76 new units to be provided for the above moderate income
          households (an above moderate income household is defined as one having an annual income over
          120% of the County median income level).
The State recognizes that local governments typically lack the financial and physical resources to undertake the
housing construction that is contemplated in the RHNA. What the State is saying to local governments
through the RHNA is that concerted efforts need to be undertaken to ensure that sufficient land is designated
in local general plans and zoning ordinances to accommodate new housing and that other City regulations and
ordinances support this new housing development.
The City has been very proactive in meeting its housing obligation. The RHNA calls for a total of 169 units to
be provided during the planning period. Since 2008, a total of 177 housing units have been provided. For the
2014-2021 planning period, the total number of units provided actually exceeds the 5th Cycle RHNA.
The challenge in the coming years will be to identify ways the City can meet its RHNA obligation for very low
income and extremely low income units. A total of 21 units are required to meet the City’s extremely low
income RHNA requirements and 22 units are required to meet the very low income RHNA requirement. The
City of South El Monte has initiated this Housing Element update prior to an update of remaining general plan
elements. As a result, the policy framework outlined in this Housing Element will be reflected in the
remaining elements, especially in the Land Use Element that will be revised in the forthcoming update.

1.4 SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The California Government Code requires that a general plan prepared by a local government contain an
integrated, internally consistent set of goals, policies, and programs. This Housing Element is most directly
related to the Land Use Element since it is the latter element that designates the location and extent of
residential development throughout the City. However, conformity with the remaining elements is also
mandatory.
The focus of this Housing Element is to identify strategies for both conserving the existing housing and to
investigate opportunities for new housing development as indicated in the previous section. The City,
following this Element’s adoption, will undertake a comprehensive review and update of the remaining
General Plan Elements to ensure they are consistent and in conformance with this Housing Element. This
Element consists of the following four sections:
     ●   The Introduction provides an overview of the housing element and describes the statutory authority
         related to its implementation.
     ●   The Housing Needs Assessment describes the population, housing, and economic characteristics of
         the City. This section also discusses the special housing needs groups as defined by HCD.
     ●   The Housing Constraints section describes the market, governmental, and environmental constraints
         that may affect housing production in the City during the planning period.
     ●   The Housing Plan indicates those citywide goals and programs that will conserve and maintain
         existing housing in South El Monte in addition to promoting new housing. This section also indicates
         the new housing objectives that have been developed for South El Monte by SCAG and describes the
         City’s ability to accommodate the projected demand.
The appendices include supplemental information that is also required pursuant to State Law.
1.5 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The key groups that were contacted as part of the Housing Element public participation process included the
following:
     ●   Catholic Charities (San Gabriel Valley Region);
     ●   The Southern California Rehabilitation Services;
     ●   The Southeast Area Counseling;
     ●   The Southeast Area Social Services Funding Authority;
     ●   The Whittier Area First Day Coalitions; and,
     ●   The Women’s and Children’s Crisis Shelter.

Following the preparation of the draft Housing Element, a community workshop was conducted at City Hall in
December 2013 and the Planning Commission conducted public hearings.                   Following the Planning
Commission action, further public hearings were held at the City Council level. All public hearings were
advertised in the local newspaper, with additional notices mailed to interested citizens and community groups.
 Once the public hearings and the related public review were completed, the City Council adopted the Element.
1.6 HOUSING ELEMENT CONSISTENCY                                 WITH THE           SOUTH EL MONTE
       GENERAL PLAN
This Housing Element is an integral component of the City of South El Monte General Plan. As a result, the
Element is required to be both internally consistent as well as consistent with the other elements that comprise
the South El Monte General Plan. This Housing Element is most directly related to the Land Use Element
since it is the latter that designates the location and extent of residential development throughout the City.
However, conformity with the remaining elements is also mandatory. City staff is currently in the process of
updating the remaining elements. This Housing Element includes a number of initiatives that will require
amendments to the existing General Plan:
     ●    The Housing Element continues to promote the development of a mixed use area along Santa Anita
          Avenue. The Land Use Element has been amended to reflect these changes.
     ●    The Housing Element continues to designate an area in the northwestern portion of the City where
          emergency shelters will be permitted by right. Again the Land Use Element will be amended to reflect
          the location and extent of this area.
     ●    A new Mixed-Use designation has been added to the Land Use Element. In addition, a corresponding
          change to the Zoning Ordinance has been completed.
     ●    There are a number of amendments to the Zoning Ordinance that have been adopted to implement
          specific provisions of this Housing Element. A program is being implemented that details the nature
          and extent of the required Zoning Ordinance changes.
     ●    The Land Use Map and Zoning Maps have been revised to reflect the new land use designations that
          are a component of this Housing Element’s programs.
As part of this Housing Element’s implementation, the City will undertake an annual review of its General Plan
as required by State law. The General Plan will be amended within 12 months of the adoption of the Housing
Element to reflect the land use changes that will be required to implement the Element.

                        SECTION 2 - HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
2.1 INTRODUCTION
This section of the Housing Element provides an overview of the demographic, housing, and socioeconomic
characteristics of South El Monte. This section considers the following:
     ●    Population Characteristics describes population growth trends in the City, the age characteristics of
          the City’s residents, and their ethnicity.
     ●    Housing Characteristics focuses on trends related to residential development, housing unit types, and
          housing tenure.
     ●    Socioeconomic Characteristics provides an overview of the key socioeconomic indicators germane to
          housing policy including household income and poverty characteristics.
     ●    Special Needs Groups characterizes the need for housing to accommodate households with special
          needs (i.e., handicapped, elderly, etc.).
The information used in this analysis was obtained from a variety of sources, including the United States
Bureau of the Census, the State of California Department of Finance (DOF), and the State Employment
Development Department (EDD). The U.S. Bureau of the Census undertakes a census every ten years.1)
The most recent comprehensive U. S. Census was completed in 2010. However, more recent statistical
estimates completed as part of the American Community Survey’s three year estimates (2011) were also
referred to. The DOF provides population and housing estimates for individual cities and counties throughout
California on an annual basis. The DOF data provides useful and generally accurate population and housing
estimates for those intervening years between the census surveys. Finally, the EDD provided employment
information used in this analysis.
2.2 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
2.2.1 POPULATION GROWTH TRENDS
At the time the City was incorporated in 1958, there were 3,900 residents in the City. According to the most
recent DOF estimates, the City’s population as of January 1, 2013, was 20,197 residents. Table 1 charts the
City’s growth from 1970 to 2010. Much of the growth that occurred during the 1970s and 1980s was due to
both annexations that occurred during that period as well as new residential development. Population growth
has declined in recent years as is noted in Table 1 and illustrated in Exhibit 4.
1) The City of South El Monte is located in the Los Angeles-Long Beach Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area or SMSA. The
   SMSA’s geographic boundaries correspond to those of Los Angeles County. Statistical data is collected for individual cities and
   unincorporated communities that make up the SMSA.

Two key variables generally influence the growth of a population: immigration and natural increase. Local
population growth resulting from immigration is typically influenced by new housing construction (new
residents move in to the City to occupy the recently constructed owner-occupied and rental units). Population
growth due to natural increases is a function of a local population’s birth, death, and fertility rates. This latter
population growth variable affects the average household size. Either variable, or a combination of both, can
contribute to a community’s population growth. The average household size in the City was just 2.3 persons
per unit in 1970. According to the most recent 2010 Census figures, the average household size in the City was
4.48 persons per unit. According to the most recent DOF figures, the City’s average household size slightly
declined to 4.4 persons per unit. Overall, the number of persons in a typical South El Monte household has
nearly doubled since 1970.
The tremendous growth in the average household size has been a major variable in the City’s overall
population growth during the past several decades. Table 2 compares trends in the City’s average household
size with comparable data for Los Angeles County. As indicated in Table 2, the average household size for the
City has experienced continued increases since 1990 and a slight decline in population since 2010. The
average household size for the City is substantially greater than that for the County as indicated in Table 2.

2.2.2 POPULATION AGE CHARACTERISTICS
One of the more significant indicators of population growth trends is a population’s age characteristics. Table
3 summarizes the age characteristics of the City’s population according to the most recent Census figures.
According to the Census, nearly 33.5% of the City’s population is under 20 years of age. This is significant in
that the high proportion of younger persons may explain the relatively large average household size figures
cited in the previous section. The median age of the City’s population is 30.4 years compared to 34.6 years for
the County as a whole.

2.3.1 HOUSING TYPES
According to estimates prepared by the Census, there were 4,633 housing units in the City in 2010. Of this
total, 3,295 units (71.1%) were single-family detached units. Single-family attached units (town homes and

multiple-family units containing between 2 to 4 units in a single structure, totaled 270 units (5.8%) of the total
units in the City. The most recent Department of Finance data (January 1, 2013), there were 4,716 housing
units in the City. Larger multiple-family developments consisting of 5 or more units in a structure totaled 433
units or 9.3% of the total units in the City. Finally, the Census identified 463 mobile homes in the City (10.0%
of the total units). Mobile homes are regulated by the State of California. The most recent Census data for the
City is summarized in Table 6 and illustrated in Exhibit 6.

Table 7 compares data obtained from the most recent (2010) Census with housing estimates from the most
recent Census figures. As indicated in the table, the number of units in the City has remained relatively
unchanged with a net decrease of 70 units recorded over the ten years between the 2000 and 2010 Censuses.
This translates into a decrease of 1.5%. This may be due to an error in the data since the City has not recorded
any decline in the number of housing units. Since 2008, a total of 177 units have been constructed. The
location and extent of housing in the City are illustrated in Exhibit 7.

2.3.3 HOUSING VACANCY RATES
According to the most recent Census, there were a total of 128 units in South El Monte that were unoccupied,
accounting for approximately 2.8% of the total number of units in the City. According to the most recent DOF
estimates, there were 142 vacant units in the City as of January 2013 with a vacancy rate of 3.0%. The vacancy
rate for Los Angeles County for the same period was 5.9%.
2.3.4 HOUSING CONDITION, AGE, AND OVERCROWDING
A Citywide field survey was conducted to ascertain the condition of housing in the local neighborhoods.
Housing condition was evaluated according to the following criteria:
    ●    Good condition. Units that did not appear to require significant rehabilitation were included in this
         category. Typically, improvements can be and are usually done by the property owner.
    ●    Moderate Repairs. This category includes those units where more substantial maintenance and
         rehabilitation is required. Typically, such repairs would be performed by a contractor.
    ●    Major Repairs. Units placed in this category typically require extensive repair and renovation.
         Housing units in this category often require repairs where the cost of the rehabilitation may actually
         exceed the assessed value of the unit.
The results of the survey recently completed are summarized in Table 9. The great majority of the units that
were identified as requiring major rehabilitation included units that were legal non-conforming units that were
located in non-residential zones. Overall, the condition of the City’s housing stock appeared to be in good
condition. The relatively sound quality of the City’s housing stocks may be attributed to the significant
increase in housing values in recent years. It was apparent during the surveys that many property owners had

reinvested substantial sums of money into their properties. The increase in home values did have a beneficial
impact in housing quality. The challenge in coming years will be to maintain the quality of the housing stock
in light of the decreasing home values, loss of equity, and a general decline in economic conditions.

In addition to the field investigations, the U. S. Census data is another source that may be referred to in
interpolating the condition of the local housing stock. The most widely referred to variable is “age of housing
unit.” The use of this information is based on the premise that the older the units, the more likely they are to
require some form of repair or maintenance. This is not always the case since many older units have
undergone extensive renovation and/or remodeling.
As a result, the housing unit age data should not be exclusively used to determine the overall condition of
housing in the City. Table 10 summarizes the 2010 U. S. Census statistics indicating the age of the housing
units in South El Monte. As indicated in Table 11, 2,833 units or 61.1% of the total units in the City were
constructed prior to 1960.

There are a number of other Census indicators that are useful in identifying potential dilapidated units. These
indicators include units without heating, units lacking conventional plumbing, or units lacking complete
kitchen facilities. The latter variable may also be an indicator of bootleg units constructed illegally or legal
second units. According to the most recent 2010 Census, 1,348 units (29.9% of the total number of occupied
housing units in the City) did not use any form of heating fuel. The data also indicated that 33 units ( 0.7% of
the total number of housing units) lacked complete plumbing facilities. Finally, 32 units (0.7% of the total
housing units in the City) lacked complete kitchen facilities.
Table 11 provides a breakdown in the number of overcrowded units that were identified in the most recent
2010 Census. Of the 4,505 occupied housing units identified in the 2010 Census, 637 units were identified as
being overcrowded (14.1% of the City’s total number of occupied units) and 391 units (8.7% of the total
occupied units in the City) were identified as being severely overcrowded.

                    Note: 1. This figure refers to the percentage of units in this category compared to the total
                                                           units in the City.

Overcrowding may also be a contributor to the deterioration of housing units. A household is considered to be
overcrowded if the number of residents living in the unit exceeded 1.01 persons per room. A household is
severely overcrowded if the number of residents living in the unit exceeded 1.51 persons per room.
A previous section indicated that the City’s average household size is quite large when comparing these
statistics with the regional norm. In addition, the average household size appears to have declined when
comparing Census data collected only eight years ago with the more current DOF figures. The overcrowding
statistics underscore the relationship between the large average household size figures and overcrowding. The
overcrowding appears to be more pronounced in the owner-occupied units.

2.4 HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
2.4.1 HOUSEHOLD INCOME
According to the 2010 Census, the overall median household income was $47,537 in 2010. According to the
same Census data, the median family income was $45,858. Finally, the per-capita income in 2009 was
$14,013. The HCD has required local governments to identify those households that are considered to be
extremely low income. Extremely low income households are those households that have incomes of 30% of
the County median (the Los Angeles County Median in 2010 according to the U.S. Census was $56,266).
Households included in this category typically represent the lowest wage earners in a community with wages
corresponding to the current annual minimum wage of $10.00 per hour (as of January 1, 2014). The annual
wage figure cited previously assumes full-time employment.
According to the 2010 Census, there were an estimated 657 households that had incomes that fell into the
extremely low income category. In 2009 the median household income for Los Angeles County was $45,858.
The income threshold for extremely low income households for that year would be $18,567. Table 12
summarizes the annual household income statistics for the City based on the 2010 Census statistics.

2.4.2 POVERTY IN THE CITY
According to the 2010 Census, 17.7% of the total number of families living in the City) had household incomes
in 2009 that were below the Federal poverty level. Of this total number, the great majority of the families
living under the poverty level (24.5%) included dependent children less than 18 years of age. Finally, 24.3%
were fmale-headed with no husband present.
The Census Bureau does collect poverty data for States, Countries, and School districts that are complied on an
annual basis. Two local school districts, the El Monte City Elementary and the El Monte Union High were
evaluated. According to the Census data for the El Monte City Elementary School District, of the total of
13,930 students, 3,642 students (26.1%) were living in households that had incomes under the Federal Poverty
thresholds for 2005. The same data for the El Monte Union High School District, of the 9,880 total numbered
students, 2,984 students (30.2%) were living in households that had incomes below the poverty level. It
should be pointed out that these school districts include large numbers of students that reside outside of the
City in other areas that are served by the school districts. The annual income levels that are considered to be
below the poverty threshold are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau and other Federal Agencies. In the
threshold limits for varying households sizes are summarized below in Table 13.

2.5 SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
Local housing elements must include an analysis of special housing needs. Special needs refer to those
households that contain the elderly, handicapped, large families, and overcrowded households.
2.5.1 ELDERLY
Elderly households include those family householders containing persons 65 years of age or older as well as
non-family householders (persons living alone) where the individual is 65 years of age or older. The 2010 U.
S. Census indicated that there were 1,341 households in the City (approximately 29.3% of the total number of
households in the City) that had a household member 65 years of age or older.

The same Census figures also identified 179 (3.9%) non-family households with a resident 65 years of age or
older. The Census also indicate that 624 households (27.5%) in the City contained at least one person over 65
years of age lived in owner-occupied units while 246 (5.9%) rental households included persons over 65 years
of age lived in rental housing.
Typically, retired elderly persons have fixed incomes and, as a result, experienced greater difficulty in
maintaining adequate living arrangements due to increasing housing costs. Even senior citizen homeowners,
who are at an advantage because their housing payments are fixed, are still subject to increasing utility rates
and other living expenses. Moreover, many elderly residents may elect to remain in their own homes that are
not designed to accommodate their special needs.
2.5.2 DISABLED
Disabled persons have special needs when it comes to housing. Often, households in this category are also
occupied by elderly persons discussed in the previous section. Special interior improvements are often needed
to accommodate a disabled tenant or homeowner. For example, door frames must be wider to accommodate
wheel chairs, ramps instead of stairs are needed, hand rails in bathrooms need to be installed, cabinet doors
must be accessible, and light switches and other devices also need to be within easy reach.
The cost for retrofitting an existing structure may cost thousands of dollars and be well beyond the reach of
those households with lower incomes. The lack of such housing is even more pronounced when it comes to
market-rate rental units. Unless such provisions are made for disabled persons during original construction,
such facilities will not likely be provided in a typical rental unit. Senior housing (both owner and rental)
typically have many of the features outlined above. The real constraints are associated with the housing for
families and working-aged adults. Table 14 indicates the number of disabled persons in the City arranged
according to key age groupings.

While the disability figures shown in Table 15 may seem excessive, the disability categories include sensory
disabilities (such as hearing impaired persons), mental disabilities, and physical disabilities. Of the working
aged adults identified in the 2010 Census, 2.8% were identified as having a disability. A Reasonable
Accommodation Program will be continued during this Housing Element planning period (refer to Section 4 of
this Housing Element.

2.5.3 LARGE FAMILIES
The term "large family" refers to a family of five or more persons. According to the most recent Census, there
were 448 units (9.9%% of the total number of units in the City) that contained 1.5 persons or more per room
which is considered to be overcrowded. This figure is consistent with what would be expected when
considering the City’s large average household size, the demographic characteristics of the local population
(more than 40% of the City’s population is under 19 years of age), and the overcrowding in the City discussed
previously.
2.5.4 FEMALE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD
According to the 2010 Census figures, there were 4,505 households in the City that were identified in the U.S.
Census. Of this total, 4,016 households (89.1%) were classified as family households. The most recent Census
indicated that 859 of these family households (21.4%) were headed by a female with no husband present in the
home. For those households that are headed by females, 311 female-headed households contained dependent
children less than 18 years of age. In addition, a total of 219 female-headed households had incomes below the
designated level of poverty.
The same Census figures indicate that 457 households (19.1% of the total number of households residing in
owner-occupied units) were female headed. A total of 404 households were female headed living in rental
units (19.1% of the total number of households residing in rental units). This number is important when
considering social service needs, such as child care, recreation programs, and health care, which are of special
concern to these households.
2.5.5 PERSONS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTER
A City-wide parcel-specific survey was undertaken to identify housing condition in the winter of 2008. These
surveys were conducted during the day-time weekday periods. No homeless individuals were observed during
these local land use surveys.
There are two categories of need that should be considered in discussing the homeless: 1) transient housing
providing shelter, and usually on a nightly basis; and, 2) short-term housing, usually including a more
comprehensive array of social services to enable families to re-integrate themselves into a stable housing
environment. The issue of homelessness emerged as a major issue in the 1990’s during the severe economic
recession that Southern California was undergoing at that time. Homelessness was further exacerbated by the
closing of mental institutions and the recent housing dislocation associated with the great recession that began
in 2008. While the Southern California economy is improving, housing costs are once again rising in response
to the growing demand. As a result, homelessness within the larger Southern California region continues to be
a problem. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development defines homeless persons as those in
the following situations:
     ●   Persons residing in spaces not meant for human habitation such as boxes, cars, abandoned buildings,
         and sidewalks;
     ●   Persons residing in transitional housing or emergency shelters; and

        City of South El Monte Housing Element
    ●    Persons being evicted or is leaving an institution and lacks the funding and support network to obtain
         housing.
Data provided by the Shelter Partnership estimated that there were 236,400 homeless persons in Los Angeles
County over the course of a year. On any given night in Los Angeles County, there are more than 84,000
homeless persons. Various circumstances that may lead to homelessness include the following:
    ●    Single adult transients passing through the City on the way to some other destination;
    ●    Seasonal and/or migrant homeless individuals seeking seasonal employment in the City;
    ●    The chronically homeless, single adults, including non-institutionalized, mentally disabled
         individuals, alcohol and drug abusers, elderly individuals with insufficient incomes, and others who
         voluntarily, or are forced, due to financial circumstances, to live on the streets.
    ●    Minors who have run away from home;
    ●    Low-income families that are temporarily homeless due to financial circumstances or are in the
         process of searching for a home (single-parent families, mostly female-headed, are especially
         prevalent in this group); and,
    ●    Women (with or without children) that are escaping domestic violence.
The City of South El Monte was included in the East Los Angeles County Survey Area (SPA 7). The 2013
survey identified 2,430 homeless persons which was a significant decline from the 2011 number of 4,759
homeless persons. This decline in observed homeless persons was 2,329 or 48.9%. There are various shelters
available to the homeless in the city and surrounding area. Table 15 indicates those shelters that provided
emergency shelter services to the City.

housing needs. This new program indicates that areas of the City where emergency shelters will be permitted
by right. Specific properties that may accommodate such uses are identified in Appendix C. The Zoning
Ordinance and map will be amended so that emergency shelters will become a permitted use in the designated
areas.
2.5.6 FARM WORKER HOUSING
The City of South El Monte is an urbanized community with no active agricultural activities. According to the
most recent 2010 Census, there were no farm worker households found in the City.
2.6 UNITS AT RISK
Section 65583 of the California Government Code was amended in 1991, requiring an analysis of subsidized
units and a description of programs to preserve assisted housing developments. One of the foremost housing
problems in the State involves the loss of affordability restrictions on a substantial portion of the government-
assisted rental housing stock. Much of this housing is “at-risk” of conversion from affordable housing stock
reserved predominantly for lower-income households, to market-rate housing. Several government programs,
with different regulatory standards, were used to finance these properties, and thus, the nature of the risk of
conversion differs. HUD maintains a list of notices (6 and 12 month) received by the Department pursuant to
California’s notice requirements (Government Code 65863.10 and 65863.11). Private owners of assisted
multifamily rental housing units who are considering no longer providing rental restrictions and converting
restricted units to market-rate units must notice to HUD.
According to information provided by HUD, no conversion notices have been filed on behalf of the affordable
housing providers in South El Monte. According to information complied by the California Housing
Partnership Corporation (CHPC), there are no at-risk housing developments that are located in South El
Monte. Should future at risk units be identified in the City, there are a number of housing providers that have
been identified by the State HCD as candidate entities that could assume responsibility for the replacement at-
risk housing units. Examples of these candidate service providers in the area include the following:
     ●   The Community Development and Preservation, LLC;
     ●   The Community Rehabilitation Services, Inc;
     ●   The East Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU).
     ●   FAME Housing Corporation;
     ●   Los Angeles Center for Affordable Tenant Housing;
     ●   Los Angeles Housing Partnership, Inc.; and,
     ●   Los Angeles Low Income Housing Corp. (LALIH).
The replacement costs for the subsidized at risk developments in the area are prohibitive. In general, the cost
for new land in the area ranges from $10 per square foot up to $55 per square foot. The actual construction
cost for residential development ranges from $100 per square foot up to $130 per square foot.

2.7 HOUSING COSTS
2.7.1 HOUSING COSTS IN THE CITY
Housing costs in the City, while lower when compared to some other Southern California communities,
are still relatively high when considering the prevailing wages that local residents typically earn. Table 16
summarizes the housing values in the City according to the 2010 Census.

More recent home sales data for the City is provided by Zillow.com. According to home sales data collected in
January 2010, a total of 12 units were sold. The average home asking price was 351,167.
Table 18 indicates the Fair Market Rent (FMR) data for Los Angeles County between 1980 and 2007. The data
shown in Table 17 indicates that rents for two, three and four bedroom units steadily increased through the
mid-1990s where a one year decline was registered. Rents in the latter 1990s and the early 2000s continued to
increase. The HUD-formulated FMR schedule serves as a guide for the maximum rents allowable for those
units receiving Section 8 assistance. HUD uses the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Census Bureau
housing survey data to calculate the FMRs for each area.

2.7.2 OVERPAYMENT FOR HOUSING IN SOUTH EL MONTE
Table 20 summarizes 2000 Census figures that indicate the percentage a household paid for housing in 1999.
As indicated previously, those households that paid more than 30% of their monthly gross income for rent or a
mortgage is considered to be overpaying for housing.

Table 21 provides a breakdown of the housing cost affordability standards for various housing unit types based
on the number of bedrooms. The housing cost affordability standards are identified according to the following
income categories:
    ● Very-Low incomes refer to those household incomes that are 50% of the Los Angeles County median;
    ● Low incomes refer to those household incomes that are between 50% and 80% of the Los Angeles
         County median; and,
    ● Moderate incomes refer to those households that are between 80% and 120% of the Los Angeles
         County median household income.
The figures shown in Table 21 indicate the rents and mortgage payment thresholds for various housing unit
sizes for the aforementioned income categories.

Table 22 indicates the household income ranges for the various income categories (very low, low, and
moderate) as well as the median household income. These figures are arranged according to the number of
persons that comprise a household. As is evident from examination of Table 22, the income limits increase as
the number of persons living in a household increase. For example, a household with one person is considered
to be low income if the annual household income is $29,200 while a household containing five persons is
considered to be low income if its annual household income is $45,000. The information include in Table 22
may be used to determine what percentage of a household’s income will be expended on a monthly basis for
housing. For example, a household consisting of 3 persons with an annual income of $23,450 ideally should
not spend more than $645 per month. This figure represents 30 percent of that household’s annual income.

Table 23 indicates the number of households that paid more than 30 percent of their income for rent or
mortgage payments by income and tenure. Households that pay in excess of 30% of their monthly incomes
towards housing are generally considered to be “overpaying” for housing. As indicated in Table 23, a total of
867 owner households and 1,229 renter households pay in excess of 30% of their monthly household income
for housing.

The CHAS data concerning overpayment for housing in the City of South El Monte is summarized in Table 24.
 The table indicates the overpayment for extremely low income households (<30% of the County median), very
low income households (30% to 50% of the County median), low income households (50% to 80% of the
County median), and all of the households in the City. The households that are overpaying for housing are
further identified by tenure (owner-occupied and renter households). Finally, the table indicates senior
households and large-family households that are overpaying for housing.

        1. The four housing problems are: incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than 1
        person per room, and cost burden greater than 30%.
        2. The four severe housing problems are: incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than
        1.5 persons per room, and cost burden greater than 50%.
        3. Cost burden is the ratio of housing costs to household income. For renters, housing cost is gross rent (contract
        rent plus utilities). For owners, housing cost is "select monthly owner costs", which includes mortgage payment,
        utilities, association fees, insurance, and real estate taxes.

         City of South El Monte Housing Element
                         SECTION 3 - HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
This section of the Housing Element is concerned with the identification of constraints that may affect the
development of housing, especially affordable housing. This analysis of housing constraints considers the
following:
  ● Governmental Constraints refers to those regulations, ordinances, and/or controls that may impede the
     development of new housing or otherwise increase the cost of housing;
  ● Market Constraints refers to those economic and market factors that may affect the cost of new housing
     development; and,
  ● Environmental Constraints refers to those aspects of the environment (vacant land, utilities, natural
     hazards, etc.) that may affect the cost and/or feasibility of development.
Where a constraint to development is identified, a policy response is identified that indicates the actions the
City is pursuing, or intends to pursue, as a means to eliminate or reduce the effects of the particular constraint
on housing development.
3.1 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Local governments may unintentionally affect the cost of housing through land use controls, building codes
and their enforcement, fee processing requirements, required on-and off-site improvements, and taxes and
insurance. For this reason, it is important for the City to review and provide measures to alleviate these
constraints in terms of their potential to interfere with the supply, distribution, and cost of housing.
3.1.1 LAND USE CONTROLS
The State of California planning law requires local governments to indicate the location and extent of
permitted development in their general plans. In addition, standards of development intensity and population
intensity must be indicated. The location and types of housing in the City are limited to some extent by density
limitations contained in the general plan.
The City of South El Monte General Plan includes three residential land use designations and a mixed-use
designation. The majority of the City’s land area (449 acres) where residential uses are permitted by right is
designated as Low Density Residential that permits up to 8 units per acre. The Medium Density Residential
land use designation (117 acres) permits up to 16 units per acre. Finally, the Land Use Element does contain a
High Density Residential land use designation that permits up to 29 units per acre though no areas of the City
have been so designated.
The residential land use designations contained in the South El Monte General Plan, and the associated
density standards, are summarized in Table 26. Key elements of the City’s General Plan as it relates housing
are summarized below:
     ●   A total of 5,696 units are theoretically possible under full implementation of the general plan. This
         figure exceeds the existing number of housing units (4,759 units as of January 1, 2008) by more 937
         units.
SECTION 3 ● HOUSING CONSTRAINTS                                                                           PAGE 43

        City of South El Monte Housing Element
     ●   The RHNA calls for the City of South El Monte to facilitate the development of 169 housing units
         during the 2014-2021 planning period.
     ●   The remaining build-out capacity of 937 units is more than sufficient to accommodate the RHNA. In
         addition, a total of 177 units have been constructed during the planning period.
     ●   The unmet need is applicable to very low and extremely low income households.
The City will update the General Plan following the preparation of the Housing Element.

An important tool used by the City in the implementation of its General Plan, is the Zoning Ordinance. Like
the General Plan, the Zoning Ordinance (and zoning map) indicates the location and extent of permitted uses.
The Zoning Ordinance, however, establishes additional development standards that further define the type,
size, and orientation of development.
As indicated in Table 27, the City of South El Monte Zoning Ordinance contains three zone districts that are
specifically residential. The table also indicates the key development standards for each of the residential zone
districts.

The majority of the residentially zoned areas of the City are designated as Single-Family Residential (R-1).
Under this zone district, the minimum lot size is 6,500 square feet. The (Multiple Residential (R-2) zone
district has a variable density scale, also based on parcel size. The minimum density is 9 to 12 dwelling units
per acre for parcels of at least 5,000 square feet. The Multiple Residential Zone (R-3) permits a variety of
residential developments at densities of up to 16 units per acre. Under this land use designation, senior
housing, mobile home parks, and single room occupancy (SRO) developments are also permitted.
Manufactured housing units are permitted in all residential zones as long as the unit is anchored on a
permanent foundation.
The Housing Plan (refer to Section 4) calls for the establishment of a new mixed use designation that would be
applicable to the Santa Anita Avenue Overlay Zone. The City will amend Zoning Ordinance and General Plan
to permit mixed use projects as infill development. This amendment would permit a conventional mixed use
development that would potentially include ground level commercial uses with residential units in the above
ground levels, infill developments consisting of entirely residential land uses, and developments where
residential units and commercial uses would share the same parcel. In addition, single room occupancy (SRO)
developments would also be permitted. The area that will be subject to this rezoning is identified in Appendix
B.
The precise development standards have yet to be developed though the minimum development density would
be 30 units per acre. The ultimate development density would depend on the parcel size, the number of
affordable units, and the unit type. The total land area within the Mixed Use Zone has a total land area of
60.42 acres. This area could theoretically support over 1,227 units assuming 30 units per acre.

         City of South El Monte Housing Element
The City has been successful in completing a number of projects for a variety of housing types including single-
family detached, condominiums, and mixed-use developments. The following projects illustrate the City’s
ability to implement a variety of development types:
     ●   Santa Anita & Merced Ave. Phase I of this project is located along Lerma Avenue and involved the
         construction of 13 new single family homes. This project has been completed. To assist in providing
         for affordable housing, the City has designated one of these homes for a low/moderate income buyer,
         and the remaining 12 units are market-rate.
     ●   Mixed Use Development. This two-phase mixed-use development site will be located on Peck Road
         and Michael Hunt Drive. Phase I features the construction of ten market-rate single family detached
         homes. Phase II includes the development of 21,000 square feet of retail space and a minimum three-
         story 60-unit senior housing development.
     ●   South El Monte Villas. The project consisted of 2.5 acres and involves the development of 30
         detached, two-story condominium home. The development also included a tot-lot children's corner
         and picnic area for the new neighborhood.
     ●   Baldwin Park Homes Development. The project is a 116-townhome residential development within a
         6.02-acre site located on the north side of Durfee Avenue between the SR-60 Durfee Avenue off-ramp
         and the El Monte High School.
3.1.2 DEVELOPMENT FEES
Case processing fees in South El Monte are among the lowest in the region. The City has resisted attempts to
derive full compensation for staff hours through filing fees, with the result that front-end expenses for
developers have been kept low over the years. Building permit and plan check fees are in line with those
currently charged by other jurisdictions in the area. The City’s current fee schedule for development
discretionary review is summarized below in Table 28.

Table 29 estimates the building fees for a typical single-family home and multiple-family development. The
fees shown in Table 29 are applicable to both single-family and multiple family development. The processing
fees are well under one percent of the total development cost. Assuming a 1,000 square foot unit, the total
development fees (including school district fees) would be approximately $5, 470 per unit. This assumes 20
electrical fixtures, 5 plumbing fixtures, one sewer connections, and one thousand square feet of floor area. The
permit fees account for less than 3% of a residential units costing $225,000.

As indicated in Table 30, the City’s fees are compared to those of El Monte, La Puente, and Baldwin Park as
well. The fees charged by the City of South El Monte are well below those of the neighboring communities
surveyed. At the present time, the development fees for single-family development are relatively low with the
costs for site plan review being under $1,000. The cost would be higher in the event Zone Variance, Zone
Change, or General Plan Amendment is required. Assuming a total development cost of a single family unit of
$100,000 per unit, the typical processing fees would account for approximately one percent of the total
development cost.

3.1.3 PROCESSING PROCEDURES
Site plan review and zoning case processing can be an unnecessarily lengthy, cumbersome process which
delays the development of housing and increases costs. The City's policy is to discourage the backlog of such
cases. Other than legally required public hearing notice periods, developers are not hindered with "dead time"
in case processing. Only those project’s that require some form of discretionary review (variances, Zone
Changes, General Plan Amendments) which is a requirement of the State’s Planning Zoning and Development
Laws. The City’s building plan check for new construction averages approximately 3-4 weeks.
The City currently has a policy that calls for the application of a conditional use permit (CUP) for residential
developments that have more than five units. The CUP process is used instead of a design review board to
ensure the development meets all applicable requirements. The City is currently updating it Zoning Ordinance
and intends to use performance and/or form based zoning that would replace the CUP review. If a
development adhered to all pertinent development requirements and standards, no discretionary review would
be required. The City will eliminate the CUP policy currently applicable to new multiple-family developments
containing five or more units. As a result, the City will no longer use the CUP process as a means to review
multiple-family developments that would otherwise be permitted by right.

         City of South El Monte Housing Element
3.1.4 BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS
The City has adopted the State Uniform Building Code (UBC), which establishes minimum construction
standards as applied to all residential buildings. The City is located within a seismically active region that
required additional development standards and requirements to mitigate the damaging effects of ground-
shaking. As these standards are State minimums, the City cannot reduce construction costs by revising the
applicable building code.
The City uses Code Enforcement Officers to assist in the identification of substandard housing, blighted
conditions, and to promote property maintenance in accordance with the City Zoning and Building ordinances
and State and County Health Codes. The code enforcement division receives and investigates complaints
regarding alleged violations of the municipal code such as property maintenance violations, private property
parking violations, zoning violations, illegal vendors, yard sales, commercial and industrial violations,
licensing and permit compliance issues, sign codes, etc. Because of budgetary limitations, the Code
Enforcement efforts largely react to complaints it receives.
Individual homeowners or property owners that have been cited for Code violations are typically referred to
the Home Improvement Program consists of a $10,000, zero percent interest loan secured through a Deed of
Trust, that becomes a grant at a rate of 10% per year for ten years. The entire loan will be forgiven in ten years.
 Some of the repairs that are permitted under this program include, but are not limited to, roof replacement,
exterior painting, new windows, landscaping and plumbing repairs and replacement.
3.1.5 SCHOOL FEES
The State adopted legislation authorizing local school districts to levy fees on new residential construction and
on additions to existing residential development which increase the habitable space of a structure and exceed a
value of $20,000. While such fees are collected to finance the construction, and reconstruction of school
facilities, they do add to the cost of housing in the community. The school district fee charged for new
residential development in South El Monte is $2.97 per square foot.
3.1.6 CONSTRAINTS ON PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Disabled persons have special needs when it comes to housing. Often, households containing one or more
disabled person are also occupied by elderly persons discussed in the previous section. Special interior
improvements are often needed to accommodate a disabled tenant or homeowner. For example, door frames
must be wider to accommodate wheel chairs, ramps instead of stairs are needed, hand rails in bathrooms need
to be installed, cabinet doors must be accessible, and light switches and other devices also need to be within
easy reach. Unless provisions are made for disabled persons during original construction, such facilities will
not likely be provided in a typical rental unit. Senior housing (both owner and rental) typically has many of
the features outlined above. The real constraints are typically associated with the housing for families and
working-aged adults. The City’s Zoning Ordinance and other regulations governing housing do not preclude
or discourage housing that promotes reasonable accommodation.
     ●    The City adheres to all equal housing requirements and promotes adherence to such laws in the City.
SECTION 3 ● HOUSING CONSTRAINTS                                                                            PAGE 49

         City of South El Monte Housing Element
     ●   The City abides by State requirements that govern group homes and supportive housing. Group
         homes and supportive housing are permitted in all residential zone districts.              There are no
         development standards or other requirements beyond those that may be required for any State
         licensing.
     ●   The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not restrict occupancy of housing units through a restriction of
         occupancy to family members. As indicated previously, the City adheres to all equal housing
         requirements and promotes adherence to such laws in the City.
     ●   The City is compliance with all pertinent State laws regulating a “permitted-by-right” designation of
         licensed residential care facilities with fewer than six persons in all residential zones. The State has
         removed any City discretion for review of small State-licensed group homes for persons with
         disabilities (six or fewer residents). For this type of use, the City does not impose additional zoning,
         building code, or permitting procedures other than those allowed by State law.
     ●   The City has adopted the State Uniform Building Code (UBC), which establishes minimum
         construction standards as applied to all residential buildings. No local amendment has been made to
         that Code. The City also allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for persons
         with disabilities in compliance with accessibility requirements. Such retrofitting is permitted under
         the 2013 California Building Code. Further, the City works with applicants who need special
         accommodations in their homes to ensure that application of building code requirements do not
         create a constraint.
Section 4 of this Housing Element includes a new program that will be implemented during the current
planning period. Under this new program, the City will adopt a reasonable accommodation ordinance to
provide exception in zoning and land-use regulations for housing for persons with disabilities. Currently, the
City’s Zoning Ordinance contains no specific provisions.             The procedures related to the program’s
implementation will be ministerial in nature with minimal or no processing fee. As indicated in Section 2,
there are a large number of households in the City that include at least one member that has a disability. Not
all of the disability categories require physical alterations to the housing unit to better accommodate the
disabled resident. However, many residents will benefit from specific improvements that would better
accommodate a disabled person. The improvements may be approved by the Community Development
Director as long as a number of findings may be made.
     ●   The request for reasonable accommodation must be used by an individual with a disability protected
         under fair housing laws.
     ●   The requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with a
         disability protected under fair housing laws.
     ●   The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the
         City.
     ●   The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the City's
         General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.

3.2 NON-GOVERNMENTAL MARKET CONSTRAINTS
There is little land in the City available for new construction. Also, in most instances, parcels are divided into
small lots or have irregular-shaped lots that make residential development difficult. This section indicates
those “market” and other financial factors that may affect the cost of new housing.
3.2.1 COST OF HOUSING
As in other areas of the Los Angeles Basin, housing costs are quite high, though relative to surrounding
communities (Whittier, South El Monte, and El Monte), the overall cost for housing in South El Monte is
lower. This is related in part to the increasing cost of land. Even with a return to smaller size dwelling units, it
can be seen that the cost of housing prices a large part of the population out of the homeowner market. This is
reflected in recent statistics that indicate that the Southern California area is now the most expensive housing
market in the country. The City has been unable to identify any factors subject to local control related to land,
fees, labor, materials, and/or financing that would significantly reduce the cost for housing. However, the cost
for housing in the City has experienced significant declines during the past year. As indicated previously,
overall housing cost has declined by 13.6%.
A significant cost factor associated with residential building involves the cost for building materials. These
costs can account for more than half of the total construction cost. Typical construction costs in the area
range from the following:
     ●   Type I or II, Multi-Family: $125 to $150 per square foot;
     ●   Type V Wood Frame, Multi-Family: $100 to $125 per square foot; and,
     ●   Type V Wood Frame, One and Two Family Dwelling: $140 to $180 per sq. ft.
Depending on location and desirability of the site, the cost for land in the area ranges from a low of $10 per
square foot to a high of approximately $55 per square foot. The Redevelopment Agency, prior to it being
disbanded, purchased a 4.8-acre site within the Santa Anita Avenue Mixed Use area for $31.08 per square
foot.
3.2.2 AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING
In the past, local banks and other lending institutions in the community provide a ready source of available
financing for constructing new housing and rehabilitating and conserving existing housing stock. South El
Monte, like other communities in the region has recently experienced significant difficulties in the lending
market due to the lack of financing. Prior to September 2008, the housing units constructed in the newer
residential developments in the City have been sold very quickly, indicating that the lending institutions were
not withholding loans to those individuals seeking to purchase housing in the South El Monte.
3.2.3 LOW VACANCY RATES
The proximity of South El Monte to the center of the Los Angeles Basin has resulted in a low housing vacancy
rate. This reduces the mobility of both potential homebuyers and renters, and allows sellers and landlords the
luxury of pricing housing to take advantage of this high demand-low supply ratio. This in turn ultimately
SECTION 3 ● HOUSING CONSTRAINTS                                                                            PAGE 51

         City of South El Monte Housing Element
affects both the availability and price of the units. According to the most recent State DOF estimates, the
vacancy rate in the City was 3.0%, compared to a 5.9% vacancy rate for the County.
3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
The residential infill development sites in the City will take place on properties that were previously developed.
 As part of the lending process, financial institutions typically require environmental assessments be
completed to ensure that properties are free of contamination or that any potential contamination can be
remediated. The Housing Plan described in the Section that follows (Section 4) identifies the following three
strategies that will enable the City to accommodate its remaining RHNA.
     ●    Strategy #1 Affordable Housing Overlay calls for the City to continue to implement its Affordable
          Housing Overlay designation along Garvey Avenue that will continue to permit new infill development
          at densities of up to 29 units per acre (this program is identified in Section 4.4.1). The geographic
          area that applies to this overlay extends along Garvey Avenue and includes properties that were
          previously commercial in nature.
     ●    Strategy #2 Scattered Infill Development promotes ongoing implementation of the City of South El
          Monte General Plan as a means to promote scattered sites infill development. The sites includes in
          this strategy are located throughout the City and include residentially zoned properties that are
          underutilized (currently occupied by lower density housing) or are vacant.
     ●    Strategy #3 Santa Anita Avenue Mixed Use and SRO Housing Program. The City will create a new
          overlay zone that will be applied to a geographic area located in the vicinity of the Civic Center. This
          new overlay zone would permit various types of residential development. The total land area within
          the Mixed Use Zone has a total land area of 60.42 acres. The majority of these parcels extend along a
          ½ mile segment of Santa Anita Avenue located near the Civic Center. The majority of these parcels
          are developed in industrial or commercial uses.
3.3.1 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The sites that were developed prior to the 1970s may include trace amounts of lead and/or asbestos in the soils
and any remaining structures. Lead based paint was commonly used prior to 1970 and is the predominant
source of lead contamination in the soils. Asbestos was commonly used as insulation and floor tiles during this
same period. As a result, any demolition associated with redevelopment of sites containing older structures
will likely need some form of investigation.
The sites located within the Santa Anita Overlay Zone are currently developed in commercial and smaller
manufacturing uses. The future redevelopment of these sites located along the ½ mile segment of Santa Anita
Avenue will likely require an environmental assessment similar to that completed for the properties recently
acquired by the Redevelopment Agency. No Cortese site (Hazardous Waste and Substance listing from the
Department of Toxic Substances Control) s is identified within the City.

          City of South El Monte Housing Element
3.3.2 SEISMIC HAZARDS
Major faults in the region include the Whittier/Elsinore, Norwalk, Newport/Inglewood, Santa Monica, Sierra
Madre, Palos Verdes, and San Andreas faults. According to the Los Angeles County Safety Element, no known
or suspected active fault traces pass through or are located near the City. There are no designated Alquist-
Priolo Special Studies Zones found within the City. The nearest Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone is the
Whittier Fault, located approximately two miles to the northeast. The Norwalk Fault is located approximately
six miles to the south. The City is, and will continue to be, subject to ground shaking hazards associated with
earthquakes in the region. The level of risk within the City is no greater than that anticipated for the region.
3.3.3 WILDFIRE RISK
No areas of native or natural vegetation are found within the vicinity of the candidate sites selected for the
infill initiatives. All of the sites are located outside of any Zone 4 designation, according to maps prepared by
the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The Zone 4 designation applies to those areas of the County where
the natural vegetation represents a significant wildfire risk.
3.3.4 FLOODING
With the exception of the Rio Hondo River and San Gabriel River, there are no lakes or streams within the
City. The majority of the potential development sites have undergone previous development. No natural
stream channels remain within any of the candidate development sites.
The majority of the City of South El Monte was previously located within a designated flood hazard area as
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The majority of the City had been included in an
“AR zone” that was assigned to areas where potential flooding may occur until upstream flood control
improvements are completed. The AR zone was proposed and adopted after the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers
(ACOE) determined that flood control systems serving the Los Angeles area are no longer sufficient in terms of
protecting nearby areas from inundation by the base flood scenario. The ACOE has completed the upstream
flood control improvements and the AR flood zone designation has been removed.
3.4 INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
As indicated in the previous section, the residential infill development sites will occur on properties that were
previously developed. The larger development projects are anticipated to occur along the ½ mile segment of
Santa Anita Boulevard and Garvey Avenue. Both areas are well served by infrastructure located within the
respective roadways.
3.4.1 WATER
Water service in the City is provided by the City of South El Monte Water Department. Approximately 80
percent of the City's water supply is provided by groundwater resources pumped through wells and distributed
throughout the City. The remaining 20 percent is purchased through agreements with the Metropolitan Water
District. The average water consumption in the City is approximately 8 million gallons per day. The
additional housing units contemplated under the draft Housing Element will result in increased water
consumption. Approximately 213,750 gallons of water per day will be consumed by this additional residential
SECTION 3 ● HOUSING CONSTRAINTS                                                                           PAGE 53

        City of South El Monte Housing Element
development. This consumption is not considered a substantial amount of the citywide daily consumption of 8
mgd.    The water mains in both Santa Anita Avenue and Garvey Avenue have sufficient capacity to
accommodate the projected demand. It should also be pointed out that the water master plan considered the
residential build out associated with the General Plan’s implementation.
3.4.2 SEWERS
The County Sanitation Districts maintains and operates the sewer system in the City. The City is served by the
Los Angeles County Sanitation District No. 2. Sewer lines are maintained by the County Department of Public
Works, with sewage from the area conveyed through sewer mains into the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant
(JWPCP) in Carson. The JWPCP has a design capacity of 385 million gallons per day (mgd) and currently
treats 330 mgd. Given the projected demand and the existing remaining treatment capacity, future
developments’ treatment demand can be met by the service provider.
3.4.3 STORM WATER
The City is served by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District which operates and maintains regional
and municipal storm drainage facilities. The City works with the Flood Control District in making local
drainage plans and improvements. The projected runoff from the potential infill sites may be accommodated
by existing storm drain infrastructure. The projected storm water runoff is not anticipated to significantly
increase with future residential development given the nature and extent of existing impervious surfaces along
both the Santa Anita corridor and Garvey Avenue.

                               SECTION 4 - HOUSING PLAN
4.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSING PLAN
This section of the City of South El Monte Housing Element addresses the State’s housing element
requirements for a statement of the community goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to the
maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing. This Housing Plan consists of the
following components:
     ●   Regional Housing Needs Assessment provides a discussion of the Regional Housing Needs
         Assessment and how the City intends to accommodate its identified housing need.
     ●   Housing Element Policies indicates those policies that will be applicable over the course of the
         planning period governed by this Element;
     ●   Housing Element Programs indicates those specific programs that will be effective in assisting in the
         conservation of affordable housing, the development of new affordable housing, the identification and
         provision of new sites for residential development, and the removal of governmental constraints.
4.2 REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The authority to determine housing needs for the various income groups for cities within the Southern
California region has been delegated to the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), pursuant
to Section 65584 of the Government Code. The housing needs are categorized according to the following
income groups:
     ●   The Very Low Income households are those whose income does not exceed 50% of the median
         household income for the greater Los Angeles area;
     ●   The Low Income households earn from 51% to 80% of the median;
     ●   The Moderate Income groups earn from 81% to 120% of the median; and,
     ●   The Above Moderate households earn over 120% of the median income.
The various housing categories and the income thresholds for each are discussed above. SCAG’s Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) estimated the seven-year future housing construction need for South El
Monte at 169 units (refer to Table 31). The housing needs for the selected income groups are also shown in
Table 31.

The State Legislature also requires local governments to consider the projected needs for extremely low
income households. As indicated previously, those households that have incomes of 30% of the County
Median would fall into this category. The HCD indicates that the projected need for extremely low income
households may be calculated by assuming that such households represent 50% of the very low income
households. In other words, the future house need for extremely low income households in South El Monte is
projected to be 41 households. The planning period governed by the RHNA extends from 2014-2021. As a
result, the City may receive credit towards the RHNA for the new housing that has been entitled, under
construction, or built during the past two years. When considering the development that has occurred during
the past two years, an additional 177 units have been added.

          housing to utilize the City's first-time home buyer assistance program to qualify low and moderate
          income applicants.
4.3.2 ISSUE – CONSERVATION OF EXISTING HOUSING
A significant portion of the City's housing stock is more than 30 years old, requiring preventive maintenance.
Housing deterioration in the City's mobile home parks and among residences located in the industrial areas.
While the City has established a Housing Improvement Grant Program to provide assistance for minor repairs,
there is currently no active program offering assistance for substantial rehabilitation. For rental properties, the
City is eligible for programs through the County. Community Development Commission for projects

4.3.3 ISSUE – LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
As the industrial base in South El Monte continues to grow, the City faces the challenge of balancing economic
growth in the City and meeting the housing needs of its existing and future residents. Re-zoning the western
half of the City for the industrial uses in the past had fostered economic growth in the City but had also
rendered many existing residential uses incompatible with the surrounding industrial development. The land
use compatibility issue of residential development and non-residential uses has been a source of community
concern for over 20 years. Current regulation permits legally established residential uses in industrial zones to
continue and not be subject to removal.
    ●    Housing Goal No. 3. The City of South El Monte shall improve compatibility between residential and
         industrial/commercial land uses.
    ●    Housing Element Policy 3.1. The City of South El Monte shall facilitate the transition of residential
         uses out of industrial zones.

4.3.4 ISSUE – FAIR HOUSING
Fair housing is a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the same housing market have a
like range of choice available to them regardless of race, marital status, color, religion, ancestry, gender,
disability, national origin, or arbitrary age. Actively furthering fair housing choice is a housing goal of the City
of South El Monte, as well a Federal mandate.
     ●   Housing Goal No.4. The City of South El Monte shall promote equal opportunity for all residents to
         reside in the housing of their choice.
     ●   Housing Element Policy 4.1. The City of South El Monte shall continue to enforce fair housing laws
         prohibiting arbitrary discrimination in the building, financing, selling or renting of housing on the
         basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual preference, age, disability, family status, AIDS, or
         other such characteristics.
4.4 HOUSING PROGRAMS
This section of the South El Monte Housing Element includes those programs that will enable the City to
implement the Housing Element policies identified in the previous section (Section 4.3). The programs
included in this section are arranged according to those housing issue categories identified in the policies
section. These categories include the following:
     ●   New Housing Development. The City is required to provide 169 units pursuant to the applicable
         RHNA. This RHNA has been partially meet with the construction of a number of new units during the
         past 24 months. More importantly, the City desires to provide new housing for those generations
         currently living in the City that may desire to continue to reside in South El Monte.
     ●   Emergency, Transitional, & Supportive Housing. As part of the recent State requirements that
         address emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing, the City is implementing
         three new re-Zoning initiatives so that these uses (emergency shelters, transitional housing, and
         supportive housing) may be accommodated by right.
     ●   Conservation of Existing Housing and Affordable Housing. A significant portion of the City's
         housing stock is more than 30 years old, requiring preventive maintenance. Housing deterioration in
         the City's mobile home parks and among residences located in the industrial areas.
     ●   Land Use Compatibility. The land use compatibility issue of residential development and non-
         residential uses has been a source of community concern for over 20 years. Current regulation
         permits legally established residential uses in industrial zones to continue and not be subject to
         removal.
     ●   Energy Conservation. The State of California requires that housing elements consider energy
         conservation opportunities. The City of South El Monte will continue to practice a range of programs
         and techniques that will be effective in reducing residential energy consumption.

     ●     Fair Housing. Fair housing is a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the same
           housing market have a range of choice available to them regardless of race, marital status, color,
           religion, ancestry, gender, disability, national origin, or arbitrary age.
4.4.1 AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The City will continue to implement the Affordable Housing Overlay that was adopted as part of the previous
housing element. This Affordable Housing Overlay establishes specific incentives for the development of
affordable housing. The Overlay will provide a range of potential regulatory concessions for affordable
projects, including flexibility in height limits, reduced parking, minimal setbacks, and/or reduced open space
requirements. Another incentive may be to waive some or all of the development fees. The General Plan
designates Garvey Avenue as Residential/Commercial Mixed Use, permitting residential densities of up to 29
units per acre. Residential development within mixed use areas is permitted both as stand alone residential
infill, as well as within integrated mixed use projects. Application of the Affordable Housing Overlay to Garvey
Avenue will provide further flexibility in development standards for projects with an affordable unit
component. The Affordable Housing Overlay may also be used on a project-by-project basis in R-3
neighborhoods for quality affordable developments which blend well with the surrounding neighborhood.
The Affordable Housing Overlay will continue to be publicized through development of a brochure for
distribution to affected property owners, the local Board of Realtors and local developers, and through the
City's newsletter. In addition, the City intends to pursue different funding sources for affordable housing
development. In order to bring the sites and funding together as a package before the development
community, the City proposes to conduct a workshop for both developers and the public regarding residential
development opportunities and available funding sources for housing.
     ●     Source of Funding: Department budget
     ●     2014-2021 Program Objectives: Adopt an Affordable Housing Overlay, develop informational
           brochure, and distribute to affected property owners, active residential developers and realtors in the
           area.
     ●     Agency Responsible for Implementation: South El Monte Planning Department.
     ●     Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.
4.4.2 ZONING ORDINANCE REVISION (REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR RESIDENTIAL
           DEVELOPMENT) NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The City will periodically review and where necessary, revise planning, zoning, and development regulations,
assessments, and fees to ensure that they support development of a variety of housing types and prices. The
City is currently amending its Zoning Ordinance to ensure it is consist with the City’s current planning policy.
As part of this review, the City will amend the ordinance to implement a number of land use and development
programs included in this Housing Element. Key elements of the Zoning Ordinance revision will include the
following:
     ●     The City recently amended the Zoning Ordinance to permit mixed use development within the Santa
           Anita Mixed Use Overlay area. The new mixed use overlay designation will permit both stand-alone
SECTION 4 ● HOUSING PLAN                                                                                  PAGE 60

        City of South El Monte Housing Element
         infill residential development as well as traditional mixed use development where commercial uses
         and residential uses are located in the same structure. The concept will enable the City to oversee a
         transition of underutilized commercial and industrial properties that are a direct result of the “over-
         zoning” that resulted in extensive amounts of strip development. The City will ensure the mixed use
         overlay zone and development standards will enhance the certainty and feasibility of mixed use
         developments. The zone will promote a variety of housing types, including housing for lower income
         households and special needs populations. The development standards (at least 16 units per acre),
         parking, height (at least 3-4 stories), and lot coverage requirements will facilitate the maximum
         allowable densities. Upon adoption of the mixed use overlay, the City will annually evaluate the
         effectiveness of the mixed use overlay zone in encouraging the maximum allowable densities along
         with a variety of housing types.
    ●    The City will eliminate the CUP policy calling for new multiple-family developments containing five or
         more units.
    ●    The City will review its R-3 development standards, and evaluate potential modification to these
         standards to better facilitate development, while ensuring the overall quality of development. The
         City will provide for modified standards for affordable projects in R-3 areas on a project-by-project
         basis through use of the Affordable Housing Overlay.
    ●    The cost of constructing parking can be a constraint to new housing development. In 2010, the City
         will analyze and consider parking needs and costs of constructing parking for housing projects, and
         especially affordable housing projects. Subsequent to the analysis and as part of the zoning ordinance
         revision, the City will amend and reduce parking standards for studio and one-bedroom units and for
         affordable housing.
    ●    The City will review its definition and use of “family” in the Zoning Ordinance and eliminate this
         terminology as required under current state law.
These land use initiatives will be undertaken as part of the City’s current comprehensive General Plan Update
and Zoning Ordinance revision.
    ●    Source of Funding: Department budget
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: To update the City’s Zoning Ordinance so that it effectively
         implements this Housing Element’s land use and development standards.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: South El Monte Planning Department
    ●    Implementation Schedule: The Zoning Ordinance revision is currently underway and the revision will
         be completed by the second quarter of 2014.

4.4.3 EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSING PROGRAM NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
This program reflects a number existing initiatives that support the provision of housing for households with
very-low and low incomes. The City’s RHNA calls for 21 new extremely low income housing units to be
provided during the current planning period. A primary objective of this program is to promote the
development of housing units for households earning 30 percent or less of the Median Family Income for Los
Angeles County. Specific emphasis shall be placed on the provision of family housing and non-traditional
housing types such as single-room occupancy units, transitional housing, and mixed use development. The
Santa Anita Overlay provides for the development of SRO and mixed use development.
The first element of this program involves the continued use of a zoning provision that will continue to permit
the development of an additional housing unit on any R-1 Zoned lot with a minimum land area of 10,000
square feet. These units, not to be confused with second units as provided under State law, involve the
construction of a second single-family home within a R-1 lot that meets the minimum land area requirements.
 The additional housing units are permitted by right as long as they conform to the development standards for
the R-1 Zone. During the past year alone, more than five applications have been submitted and approved. A
substantial number of these units are provided to extended family members at very little cost. An expanded
component of this existing program will permit the City to waive application fees if the property owner agrees
to an affordability covenant that would place an affordability restriction on the new units for a given period.
City staff will take a proactive role in advancing this policy to existing property owners through information
outreach utilizing the City’s website.
    ●    Responsibility: City of South El Monte Planning and Housing Divisions.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objective: 6 extremely low income housing units over the planning period.
    ●    Timing: The ongoing program element will be continued. The City will prepare the procedures
         regarding the affordability covenant no later the end of the second quarter of 2014. The information
         will be posted on the City’s website by the end of the first quarter of 2014.
    ●    Funding: General Fund
A second element of this program is the Housing Choice Voucher Program, a federally funded rental program
that assists very low-income families, elderly, and disabled households. This program will be an important
element in the City’s Extremely Low Income Housing Program. Decent, safe, and sanitary housing units are
provided to households through rental vouchers. Participants may find their own housing including single-
family homes, townhouse, and apartments. The Baldwin Park Housing Authority administers the Housing
Vouchers for five jurisdictions in the region including South El Monte. Participants are able to select any
housing that meets the requirements of the program, and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing
projects. The City of South El Monte has approximately 40 residents who currently participate in this
program.
      ● Responsibility: Baldwin Park Housing Authority.
      ● 2014-2021 Program Objective: Continue to support the provision of 40 vouchers.

      ● Timing: Program is on-going and will be continued during the planning periods as funding is made
         available.
      ● Funding: Section 8 (for the Vouchers)
A third element calls for the City to proactively pursue available funding sources to assist in the development
of extremely low-income housing. The City will continue to apply for state and federal assistance including,
but not limited to, CDBG and Home funding. Other funding sources will be explored including Prop 1-C and
Local Housing Trust Funds. The City shall promote the benefits of these programs on the City’s website and
through the preparation of a handout that will be made available to developers at pre-application meetings.
     ●   Responsibility: City of South Element Planning and Housing Divisions.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objective: NA
     ●   Timing: On-going depending on the availability of funds. Promotional materials and the web-site
         information will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2014.
     ●   Funding: General Funds for the staff time (grant applications and preparation of promotional
         materials).
4.4.4 LOT CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
This program is an ongoing program that recognizes the importance of public-private partnerships in
assembling and redeveloping infill parcels. The City’s redevelopment agency has been very proactive in
finding and assembling properties for the development of new affordable housing projects. The key elements
of this program include the following:
     ●   The City will continue to provide appropriate land use designations consistent with regional housing
         needs for mixed use and infill development.
     ●   The City will maintain an inventory of potential sites to provide developers with information
         regarding development incentives for affordable units.
     ●   The City will identify development opportunities, explore and establish concessions and incentives
         beyond density bonus law as part of the zoning code update, and allocate financial resources to
         facilitate lot consolidation with a goal of constructing approximately 100 new units of affordable
         housing during this planning period.
     ●   The City will facilitate the assembly and recycling of underutilized properties for new affordable
         housing construction through technical assistance to developers and property owners. Technical
         assistance includes land development counseling by City planners and a marketing brochure that
         provides information on available development incentives.
The key elements of this program’s implementation are described below.

4.4.5 EMERGENCY HOUSING PROGRAM EMERGENCY, TRANSITIONAL, & SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
          PROGRAM
The City intends to undertake a Zoning Ordinance Amendment (including both text and the Zoning Map) that
indicates the location and extent of geographic areas in the City where emergency shelters would be permitted
by right, without discretionary review. Appendix B indicates those 10 areas where the new overlay would be
located. These 11 properties have a total land area of 370,227 square feet (8.5-acres) with ample opportunities
for at least one emergency shelter and sufficient capacity to accommodate the City’s unmet need for emergency
shelters. While no homeless each site could feasibly accommodate at least 20 individuals. The 11 properties
identified in Appendix C include industrial zoned parcels occupied by either industrial buildings or non-
conforming residential uses. At the time the housing condition survey was undertaken, three of the industrial
building were vacant (unoccupied) and “For Rent” signs were posted on a single parcel occupied by medium
density residential uses.
The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit emergency shelters in an area located in the northwestern
portion of the City just south of Garvey Avenue and west of Rosemead Boulevard. The City’s Zoning
Ordinance will be amended to permit such uses by right, without discretionary review within this zone and
ensure emergency shelters are only subject to the same development and management standards that apply to
other allowed uses within the overlay area. This zone was specifically selected because of its proximity to
transportation, public services, and the underlying uses that could more easily accommodate the use.
     ●    Source of Funding: Department budget
     ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: To update the City’s Zoning Ordinance so that it effectively
          implements this Housing Element’s land use and development standards.
     ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: South El Monte Planning Department
     ●    Implementation Schedule: The Zoning Ordinance revision is currently underway and the revision will
          be completed by the second quarter of 2014.
4.4.6 TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM EMERGENCY, TRANSITIONAL, & SUPPORTIVE
           HOUSING PROGRAM
Transitional housing is a type of supportive housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless individuals
and families to permanent housing. A person may live in a transitional housing unit for up to two-years while
receiving supportive services that enable independent living. To comply with State law, the City of South El
Monte will amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit transitional housing as a residential use and only subject to
those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The program’s
implementation will consist of the following elements:

4.4.7 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS EMERGENCY, TRANSITIONAL, & SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
          PROGRAM
Supportive housing refers to permanent rental housing that also provides a wide array of support services that
are designed to enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead more productive lives. Supportive
housing is most often targeted to persons that have greater risk factors such as mental illness or drug
dependence that could ultimately lead to prolonged homelessness. The types of support services that may be
provided include medical and mental health care, vocational and employment training, substance abuse
counseling, childcare, and independent living skills training.
Most supportive housing is constructed and managed by non-profit housing developers in partnership with
non-profit service providers. The City of South El Monte will also be amending the Zoning Ordinance to
permit supportive housing as a residential use and only subject to those restrictions that apply to other
residential uses of the same type in the same zone.

4.4.8 SANTA ANITA AVENUE MIXED USE AND SRO HOUSING PROGRAM NEW HOUSING
          DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The City is currently initiating a comprehensive planning program to upgrade and revitalize it central core.
This area is anchored by the civic center complex, a library, school, and park. The area is centrally located
within the greatest concentration of the City’s residential neighborhoods. Unfortunately, many of the
commercial and manufacturing uses located along both sides of Santa Anita Avenue are vacant or
underutilized. As a result, the City is contemplating an amendment to the City’s Zoning Ordinance and
General Plan that would permit mixed use projects as infill development. The amendment would permit a
conventional mixed use development that would involve ground level commercial uses with residential units in
the above ground levels, infill developments consisting of entirely residential land uses, and developments
where residential units and commercial uses would share the same parcel. In addition, single room occupancy

The total land area within the Mixed Use Zone has a total land area of 60.42 acres. This area could
theoretically support over 1,227 units assuming 30 units per acre. To ensure the availability of adequate sites
to accommodate estimated future construction need by income category, the City shall ensure the mixed use
overlay provides adequate sites to meet projected need by income category for the 2006-2014 planning period.
 Specifically, the City’s mixed use overlay will provide adequate sites to accommodate the remaining regional
housing need of 35 units for extremely low income, very low income, and low income households-
The amended General Plan land use designations and associated zoning district classifications will permit
multifamily uses as a matter of right, not subject to a conditional use permit, planned unit development or
other non-design related discretionary review. To accommodate units that will be affordable to lower income
households, a minimum standard of 20 units per acre shall be applied. The development standards and other
regulatory provisions associated with the revised land use designations/classifications shall maximize
development capacity and promote a variety of housing types at various levels of affordability. The unmet
projected regional share of lower-Income need of 35 units shall be accommodated on sites with densities and
development standards that permit at least 16 units per site.
To ensure the accommodation of 50% of the unmet RHNA lower income need on sites zoned for residential
only use, the revised Zoning Ordinance will include a mixed use overlay zone permitting exclusive residential
use. The housing overlay zone will encompass a minimum of 5 acres of land within the Santa Anita area. Non-
residential uses within the overlay zone shall not be a permitted use. Any applications for non-residential
uses within the housing overlay zone shall be required to obtain a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) to ensure the
City’s unmet regional share of lower-Income need can be met on sites zoned for residential only sites. Prior to
any discretionary conditional approvals for non-residential development projects within the overlay zone,
specific findings shall be made demonstrating the conditional approval of non-residential development within
the overlay zone will not reduce or eliminate the capacity to accommodate 50% of the unmet RHNA lower
income need on sites zoned for residential only use. The City will undertake the Zoning Ordinance revision
immediately following the adoption of this Housing Element.

4.4.9 COUNTYWIDE AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM NEW
           HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
This program is administered by the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission (CDC). This
program provides financial assistance to developments located in cities participating in the Urban County
Program, which includes South El Monte. Financial assistance is provided through the provision of "gap"
financing in the form of both short- and long-term loans for construction and permanent financing, as well as
funds for nonprofit housing developers and HOME-designated Community Housing Development
Organization (CHDO) activities. Technical assistance and funding for pre-development activities may also be

provided for nonprofit housing developers participating in specific projects.
Housing development projects are required to have a minimum of 20%of units set aside for households
earning at or less than 50%of the median area income; however, the CDC's policy is to provide the maximum
number of affordable units suited to the development and area. The CDC's housing development policy
requires that conventional construction and/or permanent financing be incorporated into a project whenever
possible, with a recommended one-to-four leveraging ratio. In addition, federal low income housing tax
credits will be applied whenever appropriate. The CDC attempts to utilize all available public/private housing
development resources.
  ● Source of Funding: Los Angeles Urban County HOME and CDBG allocations.
  ● 2014-2021 Program Objectives: As part of the Developer's Workshop, the City will advertise the
    availability of this additional source of funds available to support in development of rental housing, and
    explain how Industry funds can be used to fulfill leverage requirements. Program availability will be
    advertised at the public counter; on the City's website; and through the City's newsletter.

         AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM
The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) is a way for the City to further leverage home ownership assistance.
MCCs are certificates issued to income qualified first time home buyers authorizing the household to take a
credit against federal income taxes of up to 20%of the annual mortgage interest paid. The mortgage payments
are used to repay the bonds; there is no City guarantee required. A maximum purchase price is established for
homes purchased with the MCC - the vast majority of homes in South El Monte fall well within this price
ceiling. The County of Los Angeles administers the MCC program on behalf of 30 cities and throughout the
unincorporated areas of the County. By paying a one-time fee and hosting an annual lender training session,
South El Monte can become a participating City with the County in implementation of the MCC program.
     ●   Source of Funding: Los Angeles County MCCs.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: Establish the City's participation in the County's program. The

4.4.15 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROGRAM CONSERVATION                                OF  EXISTING HOUSING
          PROGRAM
This program is a new program that will be implemented during the current planning period. As indicated in
Section 2, there are a large number of households in the City that include at least one member that has a
disability. Not all of the disability categories require physical alterations to the housing unit to better
accommodate the disabled resident. However, many residents will benefit from specific improvements that
would better accommodate a disabled person.
Under this program, the City will adopt a reasonable accommodation ordinance to provide exception in
zoning and land-use regulations for housing for persons with disabilities. Currently, the City’s Zoning
Ordinance contains no such provisions. The procedures related to the program’s implementation will be
ministerial in nature with minimal or no processing fee.
Improvements may be approved by the Community Development Director as long as a number of findings
may be made. First, the request for reasonable accommodation must be used by an individual with a disability
protected under fair housing laws. Second, the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing
available to an individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws. Third, the requested
accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City. Finally, the
requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the City's General Plan
and Zoning Ordinance.

4.4.16 GREEN CITY PROGRAM ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM
The City of South El Monte will adopt a “Green City” ordinance in conformance to State requirements in June
2009. The City’s website will be expanded to include a “Green City” section that will refer users to a wide
range of initiatives designed to improve the local environment. Key elements will include energy conservation
measures, recycling, water conservation, and the use of alternative transit. The programs will include rebates
for energy conserving refrigerators, water heaters, and other household appliances. The key elements of this
program include the following:
     ●   The City of South El Monte will encourage and support cost-effective energy technologies (passive
         solar space heating and cooling and water conservation) in the review of new residential development.
          The City shall permit the installation of photovoltaic/solar and solar water heating systems on new
         residential construction. The City will establish an information kiosk in Civic Center near the
         planning counter that will include brochures and handouts promoting energy conservation from local
         utility providers. In addition, the City’s website will be updated to publicize the availability of the
         various rebate programs and tax incentives that will reduce the cost of installing energy-saving
         devices.
     ●   City of South El Monte will update the zoning code and subdivision requirements and other applicable
         codes to promote energy conservation in housing rehabilitation and in the construction of new
         housing. The City is currently updating the Zoning Ordinance and its completion is expected before
         the end of 2009.
     ●   The City of South El Monte shall support ongoing programs from SCE and Sempra Energy that
         promote energy conservation. The programs sponsored by the utility providers include rebates for
         energy conserving refrigerators, water heaters, and other household appliances. The City will
         establish an information kiosk in the Civic Center near the planning counter that includes brochures
         and handouts promoting energy conservation from local utility providers.
     ●   The City will review the Zoning Ordinance to ensure that there are no requirements that are overly
         restrictive concerning the installation of solar panels. The City will then amend the Zoning Ordinance
         to ensure that solar panels are permitted in all Zone Districts. Finally, the City will consider reducing
         processing fees for those building improvements that involve the installation of solar panels.
The implementation of this program will include the following.
     ●   Responsible Agency. South El Monte Planning Department.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives. To provide housing for extremely-low income households.

          twice in the planning period.
4.4.17 WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM
The San Gabriel Valley Water Company is the local water purveyor that serves the City. The City of South El
Monte shall promote water conservation (drought-tolerant landscaping, water conserving plumbing fixtures,
etc.) in the review of new development. The City adopted a water conservation ordinance in conformance with
State law. The City will also continue to provide areas for handouts and the posting of information on the
City’s website concerning the plant materials and techniques for xeriscape landscaping.
     ●    The City website will be expanded to indicate ways residents may reduce water consumption. This
          website will be maintained throughout the planning period.
     ●    The local water purveyors publish a variety of brochures and information guides to help residents
          conserve water. The guide and brochures will continue to be distributed at City Hall.
     ●    Title 24 of the California Building Code requires phasing out older less energy efficient toilets by
          replacing them with toilets that use only 1.6 gallons per flush. The City will continue to ensure that
          this requirement is being implemented.
This program is an existing program and is being continued on into the current planning period. This
program will supplement existing City efforts in the enforcement of the State’s construction codes requiring
water conservation/efficiency in new construction.
4.4.18 FAIR/EQUAL HOUSING PROGRAM FAIR HOUSING PROGRAM
The following City program will promote equal housing opportunities in South El Monte. This program is an
existing program and is being continued into the current planning period. The City recognizes the effect that
discrimination has in limiting housing choice and equal opportunity in renting, selling and financing housing.
As a means to promote equal housing, the City maintains the following information on the City’s website:
     ●    Landlord/Tenant Rights and Responsibilities. The City’s Housing website provides information
          regarding landlord/tenant rights and responsibilities. The City’s website also provides information as
          to how a person may obtain a copy of the California Department of Consumer Affairs Guide and
          provides the website address.
     ●    Landlord/Tenant Disputes. For assistance in mediating disputes between landlords and tenants, the
          City’s website refers individuals to the Inland Valleys Justice Center, located at 300 S. Park Avenue,
          Suite 745, in the City of Pomona. The City’s website indicates the contact phone number, website, and
          the address of this service provider.
     ●    Discrimination. To report discrimination, contact the Southern California Housing Rights Center
          (formerly the Fair Housing Council of San Gabriel Valley) in Pasadena. The website indicates the
          agency’s phone number, website, and the date and time for walk-in clinics.

4.5 NEW HOUSING (AVAILABLE SITES) STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES
As indicated elsewhere in this Housing Element, the City’s housing strategy to effectively accommodate its
housing need is largely concerned with the following:
    ●    Strategy #1 Affordable Housing Overlay. The City will continue to implement its Affordable Housing
         Overlay designation along Garvey Avenue which will permit new infill development at densities of up
         to 29 units per acre. This program is identified in Section 4.4.1.
    ●    Strategy #2 Scattered Infill Development. The City will continue to implement the General Plan as a
         means to promote scattered sites infill development. A total of 8.13 acres of land were identified as
         candidate sites. Assuming a density of 30 units per acre, a total of 327 units are theoretically possible.
    ●    Strategy #3 Santa Anita Avenue Mixed Use and SRO Housing Program. The City will create a new
         overlay zone that will be applied to a geographic area located in the vicinity of the Civic Center. This
         new overlay zone would permit various types of residential development. The area that will be subject
         to this rezoning is identified in Appendix A. The total land area within the Mixed Use Zone has a total
         land area of 60.42 acres. This area could theoretically support over 1,227 units assuming 30 units per
         acre. The City will undertake the Zoning Ordinance revision immediately following the adoption of
         this Housing Element. The implementing program is described in Section 4.4.8.
    ●    Strategy #4. Emergency Housing. The City intends to undertake a Zoning Ordinance Amendment
         (including both text and the Zoning Map) that indicates the location and extent of geographic areas in
         the City where emergency shelters and/or housing would be permitted by right. Appendix C indicates
         those 10 areas where the new overlay would be located. These 10 properties have a total land area of
         370,227 square feet (8.5-acres) would accommodate over 242 units. The implementing program is
         described in Section 4.4.7.
Appendix B indicates those sites that are available to accommodate new housing development. These housing
opportunity sites are located along the Santa Anita Avenue corridor and consist of larger parcels that are
occupied by vacant building or older commercial and industrial uses. Appendix B includes aerial photographs
and parcel maps of the properties and indicates those that are presently owned by the redevelopment agency.
The development densities for these larger parcels were assumed to be 30-units per acre.
SECTION 4 ● HOUSING PLAN                                                                                   PAGE 72

         City of South El Monte Housing Element
When considering the potential development densities for future development, the development densities for
development that has occurred during the past two years was evaluated. The largest development that has
occurred during the past two years is a mixed-use project that consists of two phases. This development
consists of 72 units within a 3.0-acre parcel. The resulting density is 30 units per acre. In addition, the Santa
Anita Avenue corridor will be rezoned to require a minimum density of 30-units per acre for mixed use
residential development within the overlay zone.
Table 33 indicates the quantified objective for new housing development in the City intends to accomplish as
part of its Housing Element program and strategy implementation. The upper portion indicates the housing
that will be provided as part of the four housing strategies and the lower portion summarized the quantified
objectives for the housing programs in Section 4.4.

The City will retain the current general plan and zoning land use designations that are applicable to the
residential neighborhoods as a means to accommodate the unmet RHNA of 68 units for very low and low
income households. As indicated in Section 3.1.1, a total of 5,696 units are theoretically possible under full
implementation of the general plan. This figure exceeds the existing number of housing units. As indicated
previously, the RHNA calls for the City of South El Monte to facilitate the development of 169 housing units
during the 2014-2021 planning period. In addition, a total of 77 units have been constructed during the
planning period leaving a remaining unmet need for 92 units. The remaining General Plan build-out capacity
is more than sufficient to accommodate the unmet RHNA. The total potential development possible from the
aforementioned strategies will more than accommodate the identified RHNA need.
Table 34 provides a breakdown of the quantified housing objectives that relate to new housing construction,
housing rehabilitation, and the conservation of housing by income category. The new housing construction
objectives were drawn from those quantified objectives identified in Table 34. The quantified objectives for
housing rehabilitation and housing construction were drawn from the quantified housing objectives identified
under the housing programs (refer to Section 4.4).

4.6.2 EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT PROGRAMS
The aforementioned Policies and Programs Report, prepared as part of the 2001 Housing Element update, also
reviewed the City’s housing programs to ascertain their effectiveness. This review resulted in the elimination
and/or revision of a number of housing-related programs.
Those programs that were eliminated are indicated in Table 36. The rational for a program’s elimination is
also noted in Table 37.

PROJECT NAME:               South El Monte Draft Housing Element Update.
PROJECT LOCATION:           City of South El Monte (Citywide).
PROJECT:                    The City of South El Monte (referred to hereinafter as the Lead Agency) is
                            circulating the Draft Housing Element for public review and comment. The State
                            of California requires that all local governments (both cities and counties)
                            prepare and maintain housing elements to identify strategies to conserve,
                            rehabilitate, and provide housing to meet the existing and projected needs of the
                            community. The City of South El Monte Draft Housing Element fulfills the
                            requirements of the State of California Planning, Zoning, and Development Laws
                            (PZDL) and the regulations of Sections 65580 through 65589.5 of the California
                            Government Code. The Housing Element is considered to be a project pursuant
                            to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
FINDINGS:                   The environmental analysis provided in the attached Draft Initial Study indicates
                            that the Draft Housing Element will not result in any significant adverse
                            unmitigable impacts. For this reason, the City of South El Monte determined
                            that a Negative Declaration is the appropriate CEQA document for the proposed
                            project. The following findings may be made based on the analysis contained in
                            the attached Draft Initial Study:
                               ● The adoption and subsequent implementation of the Draft Housing
                                   Element will not have the potential to degrade the quality of the
                                   environment.
                               ● The adoption and subsequent implementation of the Draft Housing
                                   Element will not have the potential to achieve short-term goals to the
                                   disadvantage of long-term environmental goals.
                               ● The adoption and subsequent implementation of the Draft Housing
                                   Element will not have impacts that are individually limited, but
                                   cumulatively considerable, when considering planned or proposed
                                   development in the City.
                               ● The adoption and subsequent implementation of the Draft Housing
                                   Element will not have environmental effects that will adversely affect
                                   humans, either directly or indirectly.
                            The environmental analysis is provided in the attached Draft Initial Study
                            prepared for the proposed project. The project is also described in greater detail
                            in the attached Draft Initial Study.

                                        SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION
1.1 PURPOSE OF THE DRAFT INITIAL STUDY
This Draft Initial Study (hereinafter referred to as the “Initial Study”) evaluates the environmental
impacts associated with the adoption and subsequent implementation of the City of South El Monte Draft
Housing Element (referred to hereinafter as the “Housing Element”). The State of California requires that
all local governments (both cities and counties) prepare and maintain housing elements to identify
strategies to conserve, rehabilitate, and provide housing to meet the existing and projected needs of the
community. The South El Monte Housing Element fulfills the requirements of the State of California
Planning and Zoning Laws (PZDL) and the regulations of Sections 65580 through 65589.5 of the
California Government Code. The Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation are also
considered to be a project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).1
As part of the Housing Element’s environmental review, the City of South El Monte authorized the
preparation of this Initial Study. The primary purpose of CEQA is to ensure that decision-makers and the
public understand the environmental implications of a specific action or project. An additional purpose of
this Initial Study is to ascertain whether the Housing Element will have the potential for significant
adverse impacts on the environment once it is implemented. Pursuant to the CEQA Guidelines,
additional purposes of this Initial Study include the following:
     ●     To provide the City of South El Monte with information to use as the basis for deciding whether to
           prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), Mitigated Negative Declaration, or Negative
           Declaration for a project;
     ●     To facilitate the project’s environmental assessment early in the design and development of a
           project;
     ●     To eliminate unnecessary EIRs; and,
     ●     To determine the nature and extent of any new impacts associated the proposed project.2

                        SECTION 2 - PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1 LOCATION OF THE CITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This Housing Element establishes housing policy for the City of South El Monte. South El Monte is
located in the west San Gabriel Valley approximately 11.5 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The City is
located just west of the major freeway interchange of the I-605 and SR-60 freeways. Major physiographic
features in the area include the Rio Hondo River (on the north) and the San Gabriel River (on the south).
A regional location map is provided in Exhibit 1 and a citywide map is provided in Exhibit 2.
South El Monte was incorporated in 1958 and at that time, the City’s population was only 3,900 persons.
In the five decades that followed, the City’s population grew to over 20,000 persons. Much of this early
population growth was due to both annexations and new subdivision development. The majority of the
residential neighborhoods are found in the eastern and central portion of the City. In addition, a
substantial number of housing units are interspersed among the industrial and manufacturing
establishments in the westerly portion of the City. Existing residential development in the City is shown
in Exhibit 3.
2.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The State of California requires that all local governments (both cities and counties) prepare and maintain
housing elements to identify strategies to conserve, rehabilitate, and provide housing to meet the existing
and projected needs of the community. Specific requirements concerning the scope and content of
housing elements have been established by the State Legislature. The Legislature, in turn, has delegated
the responsibility of implementing its directives to the California Department of Housing and Community
Development or HCD. HCD is responsible for ensuring that the State housing law will be implemented at
the local level. To monitor compliance with these requirements and the State’s overall housing policies,
all housing elements must be reviewed by HCD prior to and following their adoption.
The focus of the Housing Element is to continue a comprehensive and long-range planning strategy that
specifically addresses housing. This Element’s primary objective is to indicate how the City intends to
accommodate its designated Regional Housing Needs Assessment or RHNA allocation. All of the cities
and counties in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area have been allocated certain housing growth
objectives that will enable the region to meet its projected housing need in the coming years. The
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has been delegated with the responsibility in
developing regional growth forecasts and then assigning new housing objectives for each city and county
under SCAG’s jurisdiction.
The State recognizes that local governments typically lack the financial and physical resources to
undertake the housing construction that is contemplated in the RHNA. What the State is saying to local
governments through the RHNA is that concerted efforts need to be undertaken to ensure that sufficient

  City of South El Monte Housing Element
land is designated in local general plans and zoning ordinances to accommodate new housing and that
other City regulations and ordinances support this new housing development.
In addition to establishing an overall objective for new housing units for the defined planning period
(2014-2021), the SCAG RHNA also indicated the proportion of future housing units that should be
accessible to households with varying incomes. The RHNA that is applicable to the City is summarized
below:
    ●    The RHNA calls for the City to facilitate the development of 169 housing units during the 2014-
         2021 planning period.
    ●    The RHNA calls for 43 new units to be provided for those households with extremely low and
         very low incomes (an extremely low income and very low income household is one with an
         income of 30% or less and 50% of the County median income level, respectively).
    ●    The RHNA calls for 25 new units to be provided for those households with low incomes (a low
         income household is defined as one having an annual income of between 51% and 80% of the
         County median income level).
    ●    The RHNA calls for 28 new units to be provided for those moderate income households (a
         moderate income household is defined as one having an annual income of between 81% and 120%
         of the County median income level).
    ●    Finally, the RHNA objectives call for 76 new units to be provided for the above moderate income
         households (an above moderate income household is defined as one having an annual income
         over 120% of the County median income level).
The City has been very proactive in meeting its housing obligation. The RHNA calls for a total of 169 units
to be provided during the planning period. Since 2008, a total of 177 housing units have been provided.
For the 2014-2021 planning period, the total number of units provided actually exceeds the 5th Cycle
RHNA.
The challenge in the coming years will be to identify ways the City can meet its RHNA obligation for very
low income and extremely low income units. A total of 21 units are required to meet the City’s extremely
low income RHNA requirements and 169 units are required to meet the very low income RHNA
requirement. The City of South El Monte has initiated this Housing Element update prior to an update of
remaining general plan elements. As a result, the policy framework outlined in this Housing Element will
be reflected in the remaining elements, especially in the Land Use Element that will be revised in the
forthcoming update.

A significant portion of the City's housing stock is more than 30 years old, requiring preventive
maintenance. Housing deterioration in the City's mobile home parks and among residences located in the
industrial areas.
    ●    Housing Element Goal No. 2. The City of South El Monte shall maintain and enhance the quality
         of existing residential neighborhoods in South El Monte.
    ●    Housing Element Policy 2.1. The City of South El Monte shall promote the rehabilitation of

         conversions of garages and patios, and subdivision of single-family units with code enforcement,
         supported by rehabilitation assistance.
As the industrial base in South El Monte continues to grow, the City faces the challenge of balancing
economic growth in the City and meeting the housing needs of its existing and future residents. Re-
zoning the western half of the City for the industrial uses in the past had fostered economic growth in the
City but had also rendered many existing residential uses incompatible with the surrounding industrial
development. The land use compatibility issue of residential development and non-residential uses has
SECTION 2 ● PROJECT DESCRIPTION                                                                      PAGE 23

  City of South El Monte Housing Element
been a source of community concern for over 20 years. Current regulation permits legally established
residential uses in industrial zones to continue and not be subject to removal.
     ●   Housing Goal No. 3. The City of South El Monte shall improve compatibility between residential
         and industrial/commercial land uses.
     ●   Housing Element Policy 3.1. The City of South El Monte shall facilitate the transition of
         residential uses out of industrial zones.
     ●   Housing Element Policy 3.2. The City of South El Monte shall provide new opportunities for
         housing in South El Monte, such as through intensification in designated neighborhoods, as a
         means of offsetting the loss of units in industrial zones (see Goal 1).
     ●   Housing Element Policy 3.3. The City of South El Monte shall require mobile home and mobile
         home park owners proposing park closures to adhere to State relocation requirements.
Fair housing is a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the same housing market have
a range of choice available to them regardless of race, marital status, color, religion, ancestry, gender,
disability, national origin, or arbitrary age. Actively furthering fair housing choice is a housing goal of the
City of South El Monte, as well a Federal mandate.
     ●   Housing Goal No.4. The City of South El Monte shall promote equal opportunity for all residents
         to reside in the housing of their choice.
     ●   Housing Element Policy 4.1. The City of South El Monte shall continue to enforce fair housing
         laws prohibiting arbitrary discrimination in the building, financing, selling or renting of housing
         on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual preference, age, disability, family status,
         AIDS, or other such characteristics.
The South El Monte Housing Element includes those programs that will enable the City to implement the
Housing Element policies identified previously. The programs included in Element are arranged
according to those housing issue categories identified in the policies section. These categories include the
following:
     ●   New Housing Development. The City is required to provide 169 units pursuant to the applicable
         RHNA. This RHNA has been partially meet with the construction of a number of new units
         during the past 24 months. More importantly, the City desires to provide new housing for those
         generations currently living in the City that may desire to continue to reside in South El Monte.
     ●   Emergency, Transitional, & Supportive Housing. As part of the recent State requirements that
         address emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing, the City is

         implementing three new re-Zoning initiatives so that these uses (emergency shelters, transitional
         housing, and supportive housing) may be accommodated by right.
     ●   Conservation of Existing Housing and Affordable Housing. A significant portion of the City's
         housing stock is more than 30 years old, requiring preventive maintenance. Housing
         deterioration in the City's mobile home parks and among residences located in the industrial
         areas.
     ●   Land Use Compatibility. The land use compatibility issue of residential development and non-
         residential uses has been a source of community concern for over 20 years. Current regulation
         permits legally established residential uses in industrial zones to continue and not be subject to
         removal.
     ●   Energy Conservation. The State of California requires that housing elements consider energy
         conservation opportunities. The City of South El Monte will continue to practice a range of
         programs and techniques that will be effective in reducing residential energy consumption.
     ●   Fair Housing. Fair housing is a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the
         same housing market have a range of choice available to them regardless of race, marital status,
         color, religion, ancestry, gender, disability, national origin, or arbitrary age.
2.3 DISCRETIONARY ACTIONS
A Discretionary Decision is an action taken by a government agency (for this project, the government
agency is the City of South El Monte) that calls for an exercise of judgment in deciding whether to approve
a potential development. As part of the proposed project’s implementation, the City will consider the
following:
     ●   The approval of the Negative Declaration; and,
     ●   The adoption of the Housing Element.
Other permits required for the projects identified in this element include issuance of grading, building,
and occupancy permits from the City of South El Monte and utility connection permits from the utility
providers.

                     SECTION 3 - ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
This section of the Initial Study analyzes the potential environmental impacts that may result from the
proposed project’s implementation. The issue areas evaluated in this Initial Study include:
  ●  Aesthetics (Section 3.1);                               ● Land Use and Planning (Section 3.10);
  ●  Agricultural/Forestry (Section 3.2);                    ● Mineral Resources (Section 3.11);
  ●  Air Quality (Section 3.3);                              ● Noise (Section 3.12);
  ●  Biological Resources (Section 3.4);                     ● Population and Housing (Section 3.13);
  ●  Cultural Resources (Section 3.5);                       ● Public Services (Section 3.14);
  ●  Geology and Soils (Section 3.6);                        ● Recreation (Section 3.15);
  ●  Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Section 3.7);                 ● Transportation and Traffic (Section 3.16);
  ●  Hazards/Hazardous Materials (Section 3.8);              ● Utilities (Section 3.17).
  ●  Hydrology and Water Quality (Section 3.9);
Under each issue area, an assessment of impacts is provided in the form of questions and answers. The
analysis contained herein serves as a response to the individual questions. For the evaluation of potential
impacts, questions are stated and an answer is provided according to the analysis undertaken as part of
this Initial Study's preparation. To each question, there are four possible responses:
     ●   No Impact. The adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element will not have
         any measurable environmental impact on the environment.
     ●   Less Than Significant Impact. The adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing
         Element may have the potential for affecting the environment, although these impacts will be
         below levels or thresholds that the City of South El Monte or other responsible agencies consider
         to be significant.
     ●   Less Than Significant Impact with Mitigation. The adoption and subsequent implementation of
         the Housing Element may have the potential to generate impacts that will have a significant
         impact on the environment. However, the level of impact may be reduced to levels that are less
         than significant with the implementation of mitigation measures.
     ●   Potentially Significant Impact. The adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing
         Element may result in environmental impacts that are significant.

3.1 AESTHETICS
3.1.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant adverse aesthetic
impact if it results in any of the following:
    ●    An adverse effect on a scenic vista;
    ●    Substantial damage to scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings,
         and historic buildings within a State scenic highway; or,
    ●    A new source of substantial light and glare that would adversely affect day- or night-time views in
         the area.
3.1.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project affect a scenic vista? No Impact.
No scenic vistas are present in the City that could be affected by this potential new residential
development. As a result, the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation will not result
in any significant adverse impacts.
B. Would the project substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock
    outcroppings, and historic buildings within a State scenic highway? No Impact.
The potential residential development sites are located within areas that are urbanized. No natural
undeveloped areas remain within any of the candidate development sites. Future residential development
contemplated under the Housing Element’s implementation will result in the replacement of older,
deteriorating improvements with newer homes. As a result, the Housing Element’s adoption and
subsequent implementation will not result in any significant adverse impacts on scenic resources.
C. Would the project create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect day-
    or night-time views in the area? Less Than Significant Impact.
The potential for light and glare will be limited given the type of development promoted as part of the
Housing Element’s implementation. Residential development is considered to be a light sensitive
receptor and, as a result, City development standards will assist in mitigating light trespass and spill over.
As a result, the impacts of the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation are
considered to be less than significant.
SECTION 3 ● ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS                                                                   PAGE 28

3.1.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The potential aesthetic impact related to views, aesthetics, and light and glare is site specific.
Furthermore, the analysis determined that future residential development arising from the
implementation of the Housing Element would not result in any significant adverse impacts. As a result,
no cumulative aesthetic impacts are anticipated.
3.1.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
The analysis determined that the Housings Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation would
not result in any significant adverse aesthetic or light and glare impacts. As a result, no mitigation
measures are required.
3.2 AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY RESOURCES
3.2.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant impact on
agriculture and forestry resources if it results in any of the following:
     ●    The conversion of prime farmland, unique farmland or farmland of Statewide importance;
     ●    A conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use or a Williamson Act Contract;
     ●    A conflict with existing zoning for or cause rezoning of, forest land (as defined in Public Resources
          Code §4526), or zoned timberland production (as defined by Government Code §51104[g]);
     ●    The loss of forest land or the conversion of forest land to a non-forest use; or
     ●    Changes to the existing environment that due to their location or nature may result in the
          conversion of farmland to non-agricultural uses.
3.2.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide
     Importance, as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring
     Program of the California Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use? No Impact.
There are no soils in the City designated as Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland or Soils of Statewide
Importance.3 This soils that underlie the City are not considered to be a “Prime Farmland Soil.” These
soils are associated with the alluvial deposition that occurred prior to the area’s urbanization. In addition,

all of the candidate sites identified for future residential development have previously undergone
development. Since the City and the candidate development sites are presently developed and no
agricultural activities are being conducted, no significant impacts will occur with the adoption and
subsequent implementation of the Housing Element.
B. Would the project conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use or a Williamson Act Contract?
     No Impact.
No agricultural activities are located within the candidate development sites.4 The City’s applicable
General Plan and Zoning designations for the candidate housing development sites do not contemplate
agricultural land uses within the affected residential infill sites. In addition, no properties within the City
are subject to a Williamson Act Contract. As a result, no impacts on existing or future Williamson Act
Contracts will result from the implementation of the Housing Element.
C. Would the project conflict with existing zoning for or cause rezoning of, forest land (as defined in
     Public Resources Code Section 4526), or zoned timberland production (as defined by Government
     Code § 51104[g])? No Impact.
The City of South El Monte is located in the midst of a larger urban area and no forest lands are located
within the City or in the surrounding area. The City of South El Monte General Plan does not specifically
provide for any forest land protection since it is not required. As a result, no impacts on forest land or
timber resources will result from the proposed project’s implementation.
D. Would the project result in the loss of forest land or the conversion of forest land to a non-forest use?
     No Impact.
The City and the candidate residential infill development sites are located in the midst of an urban area.
No forest land is located within the City nor does the General Plan provide for any forest land protection.
As a result, no loss or conversion of forest lands will result from the adoption and subsequent
implementation of the Housing Element.
E. Would the project involve other changes in the existing environment that, due to their location or
     nature, may result in conversion of farmland to non-agricultural use? No Impact.
As indicated previously, the potential infill sites are currently developed and no agricultural activities are
located within the potential infill sites or in the surrounding area. As a result, the proposed adoption and
subsequent implementation of the Housing Element will not involve the conversion of any existing
farmland area to urban uses.

The analysis of agriculture resources indicated that no significant adverse impacts would result from the
Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation. As a result, no mitigation measures are
required.
3.3 AIR QUALITY
3.3.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project will normally be deemed to have a significant adverse
environmental impact on air quality, if it results in any of the following:
    ●    A conflict with the obstruction of the implementation of the applicable air quality plan;
    ●    A violation of an air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air
         quality violation;
    ●    A cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project region is in
         non-attainment under an applicable Federal or State ambient air quality standard;
    ●    The exposure of sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations; or
    ●    The creation of objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) has established quantitative thresholds for
both short-term (construction) emissions and long-term (operational) emissions for criteria pollutants.
These criteria pollutants include the following:
    ●    Ozone (O3) is a nearly colorless gas that irritates the lungs and damages materials and vegetation.
         O3 is formed by photochemical reaction (when nitrogen dioxide is broken down by sunlight).
         Although O3 concentrations have declined since 1991 to the lowest levels since monitoring began,
         Southern California continues to experience some of the highest recorded levels in the nation. In
         portions of Southern California, the O3 levels are more than two times higher than the National
         standard and nearly three times higher than the more stringent State standard. Los Angeles and
         the surrounding South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) are designated by the Environmental Protection
SECTION 3 ● ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS                                                                   PAGE 31

         Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as an extreme ozone non-
         attainment area.
    ●    Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless toxic gas that interferes with the transfer of oxygen
         to the brain that is produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels emitted as
         vehicle exhaust. The SCAB is designated as an attainment area for carbon monoxide by the EPA.
    ●    Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a yellowish-brown gas that, at high levels, can cause breathing
         difficulties. NO2 is formed when nitric oxide (a pollutant from burning processes) combines with
         oxygen. Although NO2 concentrations have not exceeded National standards since 1991, NO2
         emissions remain a concern because of their contribution to the formation of O3 and particulate
         matter. The SCAB is designated as an attainment area for NO2 by the EPA.
    ●    Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a colorless, pungent gas formed primarily by the combustion of sulfur-
         containing fossil fuels. Health effects include acute respiratory symptoms and difficulty in
         breathing for children. Though SO2 concentrations have been reduced to levels that are well
         below State and Federal standards, further reductions in SO2 emissions are desirable since SO2 is
         a precursor to sulfate and PM10. The SCAB is designated as an attainment area for SO2 by the
         EPA.
    ●    PM10 refers to particulate matter less than ten microns in diameter. PM10 particulates cause a
         greater health risk than larger-sized particles since fine particles can more easily cause respiratory
         irritation. The Federal standards for PM10 have been met in most areas within the SCAB, though
         standards were exceeded in portions of Riverside County. However, there were widespread
         exceedances of the more stringent State standards throughout the SCAB.
    ●    PM2.5 refers to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter. PM2.5 also represents a
         significant health risk because particulate matter of this size may be more easily inhaled causing
         respiratory irritation. The annual average concentrations of PM2.5 exceeded Federal standards in
         some areas of the SCAB. As a result, PM2.5 continues to be designated non-attainment.
Daily and quarterly emissions thresholds for construction activities and the operation of a project have
been established by the SCAQMD. Projects in the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) generating construction-
related emissions that exceed any of the following emissions thresholds are considered to be significant
under CEQA:
    ●    75 pounds per day of reactive organic compounds;
    ●    100 pounds per day of nitrogen dioxide;
    ●    550 pounds per day of carbon monoxide;
    ●    150 pounds per day of PM10;
    ●    55 pounds per day of PM2.5; or,
    ●    150 pounds per day of sulfur oxides.
SECTION 3 ● ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS                                                                     PAGE 32

    City of South El Monte Housing Element
A project would have a significant effect on air quality if any of the following operational emissions
thresholds for criteria pollutants are exceeded:
     ●     55 pounds per day of reactive organic compounds;
     ●     55 pounds per day of nitrogen dioxide;
     ●     550 pounds per day of carbon monoxide;
     ●     150 pounds per day of PM10;
     ●     55 pounds per day of PM2.5; or,
     ●     150 pounds per day of sulfur oxides.
3.3.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan? No
     Impact.
The City of South El Monte is located within the South Coast Air Basin which covers a 6,600-square-mile
area within Orange County, non-desert portions of Los Angeles County, Riverside County, and San
Bernardino County. Air quality in the basin is monitored by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District (SCAQMD) at various monitoring stations located throughout the area.5 Measures to improve
regional air quality are outlined in the SCAQMD’s Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). The Final 2012
AQMP was jointly prepared with the CARB and the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG).6 The plan will help AQMD maintain focus on the air quality impacts of major projects associated
with goods movement, land use, energy efficiency and other key areas of growth. Key elements of the
2012 AQMP include enhancements to existing programs to meet the 24-hour PM2.5 Federal health
standard and a proposed plan of action to reduce ground-level ozone. The SCAB has experienced poor air
quality due in large part to the area’s topography as well as meteorological influences that often lead to the
creation of inversion layers that prevent the dispersal of pollutants. The primary criteria pollutants that
remain non-attainment in the local area include PM2.5 and Ozone. Specific criteria for determining a
project’s conformity with the AQMP is defined in Section 12.3 of the SCAQMD’s CEQA. The Air Quality
Handbook refers to the following criteria as a means to determine a project’s conformity with the AQMP:7
     ●     Consistency Criteria 1 refers to a proposed project’s potential for resulting in an increase in the
           frequency or severity of an existing air quality violation or its potential for contributing to the
           continuation of an existing air quality violation.

    Negative Declaration & Initial Study
    City of South El Monte Housing Element
     ●   Consistency Criteria 2 refers to a proposed project’s potential for exceeding the assumptions
         included in the AQMP or other regional growth projections relevant to the AQMP’s
         implementation.8
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) represents a mandate required by the State of
California as part of the RHNA’s implementation. The City is obligated under State law, to fulfill the
RHNA requirements that have been assigned to the City. As part of the RHNA's development, SCAG
relied on growth projections developed as part of the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). These growth
projections were evaluated in the environmental studies prepared for both the RHNA and RTP. The
South Coast Air Basin has experienced poor air quality due in large part to the area’s topography as well as
meteorological influences that often lead to the creation of inversion layers that prevent the dispersal of
pollutants. The implementation of the Housing Element will not result in any exceedance of any
employment or population projections. Therefore, the Housing Element is considered to be in
conformance with the AQMP. The General Plan was used in formulating the AQMP (the AQMP relied on
growth projections that were based on the City’s General Plan). As a result, the proposed project will not
result in any significant adverse impact related to the implementation of the AQMP.
B. Would the project violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or
     projected air quality violation? Less than Significant Impact.
Future residential development contemplated under the Housing Element will generate short-term
(construction-related) emissions and long-term (operational) emissions. New construction activities will
be limited to the demolition and construction phases of development. The analysis of daily construction
emission has been prepared utilizing the California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod V. 2011.1.1).
Daily construction emissions for the proposed 169 units are not anticipated to exceed the SCAQMD
significance thresholds. Therefore, the mass daily construction-related impacts associated with the
proposed project would be less than significant.
Long-term emissions refer to those air quality impacts that will occur once the proposed project has been
constructed and is operational. These impacts will continue over the operational life of the project. The
long-term air quality impacts associated with the proposed project include the following: mobile
emissions associated with vehicular traffic and off-site stationary emissions associated with the
generation of energy (natural gas and electrical). The analysis of long-term operational impacts also used
the CalEEMod computer model. The projected long-term emissions for 169 units will also be below
thresholds considered to be a significant impact.
C. Would the project result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for
     which the project region is in non-attainment under an applicable Federal or State ambient air
     quality standard (including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
     precursors)? Less than Significant Impact.

    City of South El Monte Housing Element
The development contemplated as part of the Housing Element’s implementation will result in limited
short-term (construction) emissions. The project emissions for each potential development are below the
SCAQMD’s thresholds (refer to Table 2 and Table 3) that are considered to represent a significant adverse
impact. As a result, the cumulative air quality impacts are considered to be less than significant.
D. Would the project expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations? Less Than
      Significant Impact.
Sensitive receptors refer to land uses and/or activities that are especially sensitive to poor air quality and
typically include homes, schools, playgrounds, hospitals, convalescent homes, and other facilities where
children or the elderly may congregate.9 The residential uses contemplated as part of the Housing
Element’s implementation are sensitive receptors. As a result, no significant adverse impacts on sensitive
receptors are anticipated to result from the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation.
E. Would the project create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people? No Impact.
The SCAQMD has identified land uses that are typically associated with odor complaints. These uses
include activities involving livestock, rendering facilities, food processing plants, chemical plants,
composting activities, refineries, landfills, and businesses involved in fiberglass molding.10 The
residential uses associated with the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element will
not result in any significant adverse odor impacts. As a result, no impacts are anticipated.
3.3.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation would not result in any new exceedance
of air pollution standards nor contribute significantly to an existing air quality violation. Furthermore,
the analysis determined that potential future residential development arising from the implementation of
the Housing Element would not result in any significant adverse impacts. As a result, no significant
adverse cumulative impacts will occur.
3.3.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
The analysis of potential air quality impacts indicated that no significant adverse impacts would result
from the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation. As a result, no mitigation
measures are required.

3.4 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
3.4.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant adverse impact on
biological resources if it results in any of the following:
     ●   A substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species
         identified as a candidate, sensitive or special status species in local or regional plans, policies, or
         regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Game or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
         Service;
     ●   A substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural plant community
         identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or by the California Department of Fish
         and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service;
     ●   A substantial adverse effect on Federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the
         Clean Water Act through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means;
     ●   A substantial interference with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife
         species or with established native resident or migratory life corridors, or impede the use of native
         wildlife nursery sites;
     ●   A conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a tree
         preservation policy or ordinance; or,
     ●   A conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community
         Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional, or State habitat conservation plan.
3.4.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications,
     on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional
     plans, policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and
     Wildlife Service? No Impact.
As indicated in the preceding sections, the City is located in an urbanized area. Native habitat in South El
Monte and the surrounding area have been disturbed as part of past development. The infill areas where
new residential development is contemplated do not contain sensitive species or unique habitats. There
are no sensitive or unique biological resources located within those areas identified as candidate housing
sites. As a result, no impacts on any candidate, sensitive, or special status species will result from the
adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element.

B. Would the project have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive
      natural community identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or by the California
      Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service? No Impact.
There are no native or natural riparian plant habitats found within the City. The only designated “blue-
line” streams include the Los Angeles River channel that extends along the City’s northern and easterly
side.11 Both water channels are concrete lined for flood control. As a result, no significant adverse
impacts on natural or riparian habitats will result from the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent
implementation.
C. Would the project have a substantial adverse effect on Federally protected wetlands as defined by
      Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.)
      through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means? No Impact.
The City does not contain any natural wetland habitat. No natural blue line streams are identified within
the City other than the Los Angeles River channel that extends along the City’s northern and easterly
side.12 No other natural surface water bodies are located near the potential residential development
sites.13 As a result, adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element will not impact any
protected wetland area or designated blue-line stream.
D. Would the project interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory
      fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory life corridors, or impede the
      use of native wildlife nursery sites? No Impact.
As indicated in the preceding section, the City is developed with no natural or native vegetation
remaining. No natural open space areas are located in the City that serves as animal migration corridors.
In addition, the City of South El Monte is surrounded by urban development. As a result, no significant
adverse impacts are anticipated.
E. Would the project conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such
      as a tree preservation policy or ordinance? No Impact.
Potential future residential development will not affect any designated Heritage Trees. All new
development contemplated as part of the Housing Element’s implementation will be required to conform
to all pertinent protocols concerning tree removal and preservation. Any existing specimen trees that may
be displaced as part of any future residential development must be preserved on-site or boxed and
relocated. As a result, no significant adverse impacts are anticipated.

F. Would the project conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural
    Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional, or State Habitat Conservation
    Plan? No Impact.
As indicated previously, the City is located within an urbanized setting, and no natural habitat is found
within South El Monte or in adjacent areas. The City is not located within an area governed by a habitat
conservation or community conservation plan. As a result, no adverse impacts on local, regional, or State
habitat conservation plans will result from the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing
Element.
3.4.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The impacts on biological resources are typically site specific. Future development envisioned in the
Housing Element would not involve any loss of protected habitat. Furthermore, the analysis determined
that future residential development arising from the implementation of the Housing Element would not
result in any significant adverse impacts. As result, the Housing Element’s implementation would not
result in an incremental loss or degradation of those protected habitats found in the Southern California
region. As a result, no cumulative impacts on biological resources will be associated with the proposed
project’s implementation.
3.4.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
The analysis indicated that the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element would
not result in any significant adverse impacts on biological resources. As a result, no mitigation measures
are required.
3.5 CULTURAL RESOURCES
3.5.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project will normally have a significant adverse impact on
cultural resources if it results in any of the following:
    ●    A substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in §15064.5 of
         the State CEQA Guidelines;
    ●    A substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to
         §15064.5 of the State CEQA Guidelines;
    ●    The destruction of a unique paleontological resource, site or unique geologic feature; or
    ●    The disturbance of any human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries.

3.5.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as
      defined in §15064.5 of the State CEQA Guidelines? No Impact.
The State, through the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) maintains an inventory of those sites
and structures that are considered to be historically significant. Finally, the U. S. Department of Interior
has established specific guidelines and criteria that indicates the manner in which a site, structure, or
district is to be defined as having historic significance and in the determination of its eligibility for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places. There are no historic structures or significant sites within the
City boundaries listed on the Federal Register.14 Thus, the implementation of the Housing Element will
not result in any significant adverse impacts on any historic site or other historic structures.
B. Would the project cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological
      resource pursuant to §15064.5 of the State CEQA Guidelines? No Impact.
The majority of the potential development sites in the City were previously disturbed and no
archaeological resources were reported during previous grading and excavation activities in the area.15 In
addition, the potential residential development sites have undergone extensive disturbances as part of
past construction activities. In addition, no significant archaeological sites are likely to be discovered
during grading activities due to the degree of disturbance. No known sites are known or suspected to be
present in the City.16 As a result, no impacts on archaeological resources are anticipated from the
proposed project.
C. Would the project directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource, site or unique
      geologic feature? No Impact.
The entire City is completely urbanized. The potential for paleontological resources in the area is
considered low due to the character of subsurface soils (recent alluvium) and the amount of disturbance
associated with the aforementioned past development.17 As a result, no significant adverse impacts are
anticipated.

3.5.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The potential environmental impacts related to cultural resources are site specific. Furthermore, the
analysis herein also determined that the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing
Element would not result in any impacts on cultural resources. As a result, no cumulative impacts will
occur as part of the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element.

result from the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation and no mitigation measures
are required.
3.6 GEOLOGY
3.6.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant adverse impact on
the environment if it results in the following:
    ●    The exposure of people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of
         loss, injury, or death involving rupture of a known earthquake fault (as delineated on the most
         recent Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or
         based on other substantial evidence of a known fault), ground–shaking, liquefaction, or
         landslides;
    ●    Substantial soil erosion resulting in the loss of topsoil;
    ●    The exposure of people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including location on
         a geologic unit or a soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of the project,
         and potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction, or
         collapse;
    ●    Locating a project on an expansive soil, as defined in the California Building Code (2012), creating
         substantial risks to life or property; or,

      ●   Locating a project in, or exposing people to potential impacts, including soils incapable of
          adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems where
          sewers are not available for the disposal of wastewater.
3.6.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the
      risk of loss, injury, or death involving rupture of a known earthquake fault (as delineated on the
      most recent Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area
      or based on other substantial evidence of a known fault), ground–shaking, liquefaction, or
      landslides? No Impact.
There are no active or potentially active earthquake faults known to traverse the City of South El Monte,
thus, no ground rupture hazards are expected in the City. The City is, however, located within a
seismically active region and is subject to ground-shaking hazards associated with earthquake events in
the region. Seismicity, in the Los Angeles area historically has been defined by earthquake events along
the Newport-Inglewood, San Fernando, San Jacinto and San Andreas faults. Other faults of concern in the
area include the Whittier Fault, the Elysian Park Thrust, and Santa Monica-Hollywood Fault. The level of
risk for the seven candidate housing sites is no greater than that of the remainder of the City. As a result,
no significant adverse impacts are anticipated to result from the adoption and subsequent
implementation of the Housing Element.
B. Would the project expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including
      substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil? No Impact.
The City’s topography is generally level.18 Future residential development arising as part of the Housing
Element’s implementation will not result in any additional soil erosion or loss of topsoil. The candidate
housing sites are currently developed or were previously developed. Future development will involve the
continued covering of a portion of the sites with impervious surfaces (buildings, parking areas, etc.). As a
result, no significant adverse impacts related to soil erosion are anticipated.
C.     Would the project expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including
      location on a geologic unit or a soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of the
      project, and potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction,
      or collapse? No Impact.

codes. As a result no additional significant adverse impacts are anticipated.
D. Would the project result in or expose people to potential impacts, including location on expansive
      soil, as defined in Uniform Building Code (2012), creating substantial risks to life or property? No
      Impact.
South El Monte is located in the midst of a larger existing urban area. The potential development sites
have undergone previous development and all of the sites are surrounded by existing development. The
soils in the City are suitable for development as demonstrated by existing development. Thus, no
expansive soil impacts will occur as part of the proposed project’s implementation.20
E. Would the project result in or expose people to potential impacts, including soils incapable of
      adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems where
      sewers are not available for the disposal of wastewater? No Impact.
No septic tanks will be used as part of any future residential development. Future residential
development will be required to connect with the nearby sanitary sewer system. As a result, no impacts
associated with the use of septic tanks will occur as part of the Housing Element’s adoption and
subsequent implementation.
3.6.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The potential cumulative impacts related to earth and geology is typically site specific. Furthermore, the
analysis herein determined that the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element
would not result in significant adverse impacts related to landform modification, grading, or the
destruction of a geologically significant landform or feature. As a result, no cumulative earth and geology
impacts will occur as part of the Housing Element’s implementation.
3.6.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
The analysis determined that the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element
would not result in any significant adverse impacts related to earth and geology. As a result, no mitigation

3.7 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
3.7.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant adverse impact on
greenhouse gas emissions if it results in any of the following:
      ●    The generation of greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a
           significant impact on the environment; and,
      ●    The potential for conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of
           reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
3.7.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A.     Would the project generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a
      significant impact on the environment? No Impact.
The State of California requires CEQA documents to include an evaluation of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions or gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. GHG are emitted by both natural processes and
human activities. Examples of GHG that are produced both by natural and industrial processes include
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The accumulation of GHG in the
atmosphere regulates the earth's temperature. Without these natural GHG, the Earth's surface would be
about 61°F cooler.21 However, emissions from fossil fuel combustion by humans have elevated the
concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere to above-natural levels. Scientific evidence indicates there is a
correlation between increasing global temperatures/climate change over the past century and human
induced levels of GHG.                 These and other environmental changes have potentially negative
environmental, economic, and social consequences around the globe.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the South El Monte
Housing Element. The RHNA housing need represents a mandate required by the State of California as
part of the RHNA’s implementation. The City is obligated under State law, to fulfill the RHNA
requirements that have been assigned to the City. As part of the RHNA's development, SCAG relied on
growth projections developed as part of the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). These growth
projections were evaluated in the environmental studies prepared for both the RHNA and RTP. As a
result, no significant additional greenhouse gas emissions are anticipated as part of the Housing
Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation.

B. Would the project conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of
     reducing emissions of greenhouse gases? No Impact.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the City of South El Monte
Housing Element. The RHNA housing need represents a mandate required by the State of California as
part of the RHNA’s implementation. As stated previously, the City is required to fulfill the RHNA
requirements that have been assigned to the City. As part of the RHNA's development, SCAG relied on
growth projections developed as part of the RTP. These growth projections were evaluated in the
environmental studies prepared for both the RHNA and RTP. The proposed project will not involve or
require any variance from an adopted plan, policy, or regulation governing GHG emissions. As a result,
no significant additional greenhouse gas emissions are anticipated with the adoption and subsequent
implementation of the Housing Element.
3.7.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The analysis herein also determined that the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing
Element would not result in any significant adverse impacts related to the emissions of greenhouse gases.
Furthermore, the analysis determined that future residential development arising from the
implementation of the Housing Element would not result in any significant adverse impacts. As a result,
no significant adverse cumulative impacts will result from the proposed project’s implementation.
3.7.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
The analysis of potential impacts related to greenhouse gas emissions indicated that no significant
adverse impacts would result from the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation. As
a result, no mitigation measures are required.

         response plan or emergency evacuation plan; or,
    ●    The exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wild
         land fire, including where wild lands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are
         intermixed with wild lands.
3.8.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine
    transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials? No Impact.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element. For
purposes of a total build-out analysis, it is assumed that up to 169 additional units would be constructed
as part of the Element’s implementation. The hazardous materials that may potentially be associated with
any future residential development will be limited to those used for routine maintenance and cleaning. As
a result, no significant adverse impacts are anticipated.
B. Would the project create a significant hazard to the public or the environment, or result in
    reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials
    into the environment? No Impact.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element. The
use of any hazardous materials as part of any new housing development will be limited to those that are
commercially available and typically used in a household setting. As a result, no significant adverse
impacts concerning a release of hazardous materials are anticipated.
C. Would the project emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or acutely hazardous materials,
    substances, or waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school? No impact.
The use of any hazardous materials in any future residential development will be limited to those that are
commercially available and typically used in a household setting. Because of the nature of the residential

uses, no hazardous or acutely hazardous materials will be emitted that may affect a school site. As a
result, no significant impacts on area schools are anticipated as part of the proposed improvements.
D. Would the project be located on a site, which is included on a list of hazardous material sites
     compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5, and, as a result, would it create a
     significant hazard to the public or the environment? No Impact.
The candidate infill sites are not included on the Cortese list.22 As a result, no impacts will occur with
respect to locating the project on a site included on a hazardous list pursuant to the Government Code.
E. Would the project be located within an airport land use plan, or where such a plan has not been
     adopted, within two miles of a public airport or a public use airport, would the project result in a
     safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area? No Impact.
The City of South El Monte is not located within two miles of an operational public airport. The nearest
airport is El Monte Airport, located approximately two miles to the northeast of the City. Los Angeles
International Airport (LAX) is located approximately 20 miles to the northwest. As a result, the draft
Housing Element and its subsequent implementation will not present a safety hazard related to aircraft or
airport operations. As a result, any future development arising as part of the Housing Element’s
implementation will not present a safety hazard to aircraft and/or airport operations at a public use
airport.
F. For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, would the project result in a safety hazard for
     people residing or working in the project area? No Impact.
The City of South El Monte is not located within two miles of an operational private airport or airstrip. As
a result, future residential development will not present a safety hazard related to aircraft and/or airport
operations at a private use airstrip.
G. Would the project impair implementation of, or physically interfere with, an adopted emergency
     response plan or emergency evacuation plan? No Impact.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element. At
no time will any designated emergency evacuation routes be completely closed to vehicular traffic as a
result of the proposed construction activities. Thus, no impacts on emergency response or evacuation
plans will result from the project’s construction.

      intermixed with wild lands? No Impact.
The entire City is urbanized and the majority of the parcels are developed.23 There are no areas of native
vegetation found within the candidate residential development sites or in the surrounding properties. As
a result, there is no wildfire risk from off-site locations.
3.8.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The potential impact related to hazardous materials is site specific. Furthermore, the analysis herein also
determined that the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element would not result in
any significant unmitigable impacts related to hazards and/or hazardous materials. As a result, no
significant adverse cumulative impacts related to hazards or hazardous materials will result from the
proposed project’s implementation.
3.8.4 MITIGATION MEASURES

impacts would result from the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation. As a result,
no mitigation measures are required.
3.9 HYDROLOGY & WATER QUALITY
3.9.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant adverse
environmental impact on water resources or water quality if it results in any of the following:
      ●    A violation of any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements;
      ●    A substantial depletion of groundwater supplies or interference with groundwater recharge such
           that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table
           level;
      ●    A substantial alteration of the existing drainage pattern of the site or area through the alteration
           of the course of a stream or river in a manner that would result in substantial erosion or siltation
           on or off-site;

     ●   A substantial alteration of the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including the alteration
         of the course of a stream or river, in a manner that would result in flooding on or off-site;
     ●   The creation or contribution of water runoff that would exceed the capacity of existing or planned
         storm water drainage systems or the generation of substantial additional sources of polluted
         runoff;
     ●   The substantial degradation of water quality;
     ●   The placement of housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a Federal Flood
         Hazard Boundary, Flood Insurance Rate Map, or other flood hazard delineation map;
     ●   The placement of structures within 100-year flood hazard areas that would impede or redirect
         flood flows;
     ●   The exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of flooding as a result of dam or levee
         failure;
     ●   The exposure of a project to inundation by seiche, tsunami or mudflow.
3.9.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements? No
     Impact.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element. For
purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that up to 169 additional units would be constructed as part of the
Element’s implementation. Given the nature and extent of the existing site coverage in impervious
surfaces and the nature of the on-site improvements, there will not be a significant increase in the
quantity of storm water runoff.
B. Would the project substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with
     groundwater recharge in such a way that would cause a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering
     of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the production rate of a pre-existing nearby well would
     drop to a level which would not support existing land uses or planned uses for which permits have
     been granted)? Less Than Significant Impact.
Water supply in the City is derived from local groundwater wells operated and maintained by the water
purveyors that serve the City, as well as imported water from the Metropolitan Water District (MWD).
The majority of the City is served by the South El Monte Water Department. The potential development
sites are scattered throughout the City and the majority of the sites are served by existing infrastructure.
Once specific development sites are slated for development, the City will determine the nature and extent
of the required infrastructure as part of the development review and plan check process.

Future water consumption will be limited to that used for landscaping, restroom use, and routine
maintenance and cleaning. The new building will also involve the installation of water-conserving
plumbing in conformance with local ordinances that require water-conserving equipment and plumbing
fixtures as a means to reduce water consumption. While no significant adverse impacts on water quality
are anticipated as part of the proposed project’s construction and subsequent operation, the following
standard conditions may be required:
     ●    The plans and specifications shall require the contractors to implement the Best Management
          Practices (BMP’s) identified in Section IV of the Water Quality Management Plan, as well as be
          the responsible party for inspection and maintenance as identified in Section V of the Water
          Quality Management Plan.
     ●    During construction, disposal of refuse and other materials should occur in a specified and
          controlled temporary area on-site physically separated from potential storm water runoff, with
          ultimate disposal in accordance with local, State and Federal requirements.
     ●    Sediment from areas disturbed by construction shall be retained on-site using structural controls
          to the maximum extent practicable.
     ●    Stockpiles of soil shall be properly contained to eliminate or reduce sediment transport from the
          site to the streets, drainage of facilities or adjacent properties via runoff, vehicle tracking, or wind.
The implementation of the aforementioned mitigation measures will ensure that the potential water
quality impacts are reduced to levels that are less than significant.
C. Would the project substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including the
     alteration of the course of a stream or river, in a manner, which would result in substantial erosion
     or siltation on- or off-site? No Impact.
No natural drainage or riparian areas remain within the project site or surrounding area due to earlier
development.24 In addition, no streams or rivers are located within the candidate infill sites or in the
immediate area. As a result, no impacts on streams or natural hydrology will occur with the adoption and
subsequent implementation of the Housing Element.
D. Would the project substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including the
     alteration of the course of a stream or river, in a manner, which would result in flooding on- or off-
     site? No Impact.

     City of South El Monte Housing Element
There are no natural lakes or streams within or adjacent to the planning area. The City is currently
developed and no natural drainage features are found within the planning area boundaries.25 The
adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element will not impact any natural drainage.
As a result, no impacts are anticipated.
E. Would the project create or contribute runoff water that would exceed the capacity of existing or
      planned storm water drainage systems or provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff?
      No Impact.
No significant change in the amount of surface runoff volumes is anticipated due to the nature and extent
of the proposed residential development. No surface water bodies are found within the proposed infill
development sites, or in the immediate vicinity, that would be affected by future residential
development.26 As a result, no significant adverse impacts are anticipated.
F. Would the project otherwise substantially degrade water quality? No Impact.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element. For
purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that up to 169 additional units would be constructed as part of the
Element’s implementation. Given the developed character of the candidate housing infill sites, no water
quality impacts are anticipated. In addition, future construction activities would be required to adhere to
all development standards governing water runoff.
G. Would the project place housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a Federal Flood
      Hazard Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map, or other flood hazard delineation map? No
      Impact.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element. The
affected area is not located within a flood zone designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). As a result, no impacts are anticipated to occur. Therefore, no flood-related impacts with
respect to housing are associated with the proposed project’s implementation.
H. Would the project place within a 100-year flood hazard area, structures that would impede or
      redirect flood flows? No Impact.
As indicated previously, the City is not located within a designated 100-year flood hazard area as defined
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).27 As a result, the future development
contemplated as part of the Housing Element’s implementation will not impede or redirect the flows of

flood-related impacts are anticipated.
I.   Would the project expose people or structures to a significant risk of flooding as a result of dam or
     levee failure? Less Than Significant Impact.
The majority of the City is located within an area that may be subject to flows resulting from a dam or
levee failure. Potential flows from the Santa Fe Dam may impact the City. However, extensive
improvements have been installed by the ACOE to reduce the likelihood of flooding. Emergency response
and evacuation plans for the affected areas have been established by the County Sheriff's Department and
the U.S. Corps of Engineers, to facilitate emergency operations in the event of dam failure or river
overflow. Therefore, the impacts related to flood flows are anticipated to be less than significant.
J. Would the project result in inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow? No Impact.
The project site will not be exposed to a tsunami since the site is located approximately 17 miles inland
from the Pacific Ocean.28 There are no hillsides located in the area that would result in mudslides. In
addition, there are no surface water bodies located in the immediate area that would result in a seiche.29
As a result, no significant adverse impacts are expected.
3.9.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The potential impacts related to hydrology and storm water runoff are typically site specific. The Housing
Element will not result in any significant adverse impacts related to hydrology.
3.9.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
The analysis indicated that no significant adverse impacts related to hydrology and water would result
from the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation. As a result, no mitigation
measures are required.
   28 Earthquake-generated tsunamis are long wave trains generated by seismic activity in ocean waters and their formation is

3.10 LAND USE
3.10.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant impact on land use
and development if it results in any of the following:
    ● The disruption or division of the physical arrangement of an established community;
    ● A conflict with an applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of the agency with jurisdiction
         over the project; or
    ● A conflict with any applicable conservation plan or natural community conservation plan.
3.10.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project physically divide or disrupt an established community or otherwise result in an
    incompatible land use? No Impact.
The sites that have been identified for new residential development would potentially result in a
maximum of 169 (RHNA) units. The implementation of the Housing Element will not lead to any division
of an established residential community or neighborhood. As a result, no significant adverse impacts are
anticipated.
B. Would the project conflict with an applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with
    jurisdiction over the project (including but not limited to, a general plan, specific plan, local coastal
    program, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental
    effect? Less Than Significant Impact.
No land areas within South El Monte are subject to a Habitat Conservation Plan or a Coastal Plan. As a
result, no significant adverse impacts are anticipated. The sites selected for new residential development
would result in a potential development of 169 units. For those sites that are not currently zoned for
residential development and are more than one acre in land area, the City intends to develop an Area
Development Plan for each. As a result, the impacts will be less than significant.
C. Will the project conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community
    conservation plan? No Impact.
No natural open space areas are located within the candidate development sites or the adjacent parcels.
In addition, no adjacent properties are subject to habitat conservation plans. The planning area is neither
subject to a habitat conservation plan nor a coastal plan. Finally, there are no designated Significant
Ecological Areas (SEA’s) located within one mile of the City. As a result, the Housing Element’s adoption

3.11.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that would be of
    value to the region and the residents or the State? No Impact.
There are no active oil wells within the residential areas of the City. Furthermore, the planning area is not
located within a Significant Mineral Aggregate Resource Area (SMARA), nor is it located in an area with
active mineral extraction activities. As a result, no impacts on existing mineral resources will result from
the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element.

B. Would the project result in the loss of availability of a locally important mineral resource recovery
      site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan or other land use plan? No Impact.
There are no mineral, oil or energy extraction and/or generation activities located within the residential
neighborhoods of the City.30 Review of maps provided by the State Department of Conservation indicated
that there are no oil wells located within the vicinity of the candidate development sites. The resources
and materials used in the limited construction will not include any materials that are considered rare or
unique. Thus, the proposed project will not result in any significant adverse effects on mineral resources
in the region.
3.11.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The potential impacts on mineral resources are site specific. Furthermore, the analysis determined that
the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element would not result in any impacts on
mineral resources and no cumulative impacts will occur.
3.11.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
The analysis of potential impacts related to mineral resources indicated that no significant adverse
impacts would result from the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation. As a result,
no mitigation measures are required.
3.12 NOISE
3.12.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant impact on the
environment if it results in any of the following:
      ●     The exposure of persons to, or the generation of, noise levels in excess of standards established in
            the local general plan, noise ordinance or applicable standards of other agencies;
      ●     The exposure of people to, or generation of, excessive ground-borne noise levels;
      ●     A substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the vicinity of the project above levels
            existing without the project;
      ●     A substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above
            levels existing without the project;

     ●   Locating within the vicinity of a private airstrip that would result in the exposure of people
         residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels.
3.12.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project result in exposure of persons to, or the generation of, noise levels in excess of
     standards established in the local general plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other
     agencies? Less than Significant Impact.
Future residential development will be required to adhere to the City’s Noise Control Ordinance which
will further reduce the potential for an adverse impact. A change of 5.0 dBA is generally considered to
represent a significant adverse impact for purposes of environmental review. This figure is generally
accepted by acoustics experts as the lower-range where a person with normal hearing could perceive a
noticeable change. As part of future development of multiple-family residential development, insulation
and other design measures will be required to reduce the interior ambient noise levels to 45 CNEL or less.
The additional vehicle trips that will be generated on a daily basis will be distributed throughout the City.
The cumulative traffic will not be great enough to result in a measurable or perceptible increase in traffic
noise (it typically requires a doubling of traffic volumes to increase the ambient noise levels to 5.0 dBA or
greater).
A majority of the potential infill sites are located in close proximity to mobile noise sources (arterial
roadways, etc.). New residential development that may occur within the candidate infill sites must adhere
to the applicable building code requirements that are designed to attenuate noise. In addition, the
construction of these units and their subsequent occupancy must adhere to the City’s noise control
regulations. As a result, the impacts related to the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent
implementation will be less than significant.
B. Would the project result in exposure of people to, or the generation of, excessive ground-borne noise
     levels? No Impact.
Future construction activities could lead to noise impacts on the adjacent residential uses in the absence
of mitigation. Construction machinery will be capable of generating periodic peak noise levels ranging
from 70 to 95 dBA at a distance of 50 feet from the source. These impacts will be short-term and cease
once construction has been completed. All construction activities must conform to the City’s Noise
Control regulations. As part of future multiple-family residential development, insulation and other
design measures will be required to reduce the interior ambient noise levels to 45 CNEL or less. The
additional vehicle trips that will be generated by up to a maximum of 169 units on a daily basis will be
distributed throughout the City.

New residential development that may occur within the candidate infill sites must adhere to the
applicable Building Code requirements that are designed to attenuate noise. In addition, the construction
of these units and their subsequent occupancy must adhere to the City’s noise control regulations. As a
result, the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation will not result in any significant
adverse impacts.
C. Would the project result in a substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project
     vicinity above levels existing without the project? Less than Significant Impact.
Future residential development will involve uses and activities which are not likely to generate significant
increases in the ambient noise levels. Traffic noise generated by future development will not result in a
measurable or discernable increase in the ambient noise levels. The additional traffic on area roadways
will result in noise level increases of less than 5.0 dBA, as indicated previously. As a result, the Housing
Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation impacts on this issue will be less than significant.
D. Would the project result in a substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in
     the project vicinity above levels existing without the project? Less than Significant Impact.
The construction activities related to site preparation and building construction may lead to relatively
high noise levels during the construction period. Composite construction noise is best characterized by
Bolt, Beranek, and Newman.31 In this study, the noisiest phases of construction are anticipated to be 89
dBA as measured at a distance of 50 feet from the construction activity. This value takes into account
both the number of pieces and spacing of the heavy equipment typically used in a construction effort. In
later phases during building erection, noise levels are typically reduced from these values and the physical
structures further break up line-of-sight noise. However, for a total build-out scenario, the 89 dBA value
was used as an average noise level for the construction activities. Based on typical spreading loss, noise
levels could exceed 70 dBA at the property line. These impacts will be short-term and cease once
construction has been completed. All construction activities must conform to the City’s Noise Ordinance.
As a result, the potential impacts are less than significant.
E. For a project located within an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted,
     within two miles of a public airport or public use airport, would the project expose people residing
     or working in the project area to excessive noise levels? No Impact.
The City is not located within two miles of an operational public airport. The City of South El Monte is not
located within two miles of an operational public airport. The nearest airport is El Monte Airport, located
approximately two miles to the northeast of the City. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is located
approximately 20 miles to the northwest. As a result, no significant adverse impacts related to the
exposure of persons to aircraft noise from a public use airport are anticipated.

The City is not located within two miles of an operational private airport. As a result, no impacts related
to the exposure of persons to aircraft noise from a private airstrip will result from the proposed project.
3.12.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The analysis indicated that the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element would
not result in any significant adverse cumulative noise impacts. Furthermore, the analysis determined that
future residential development arising from the implementation of the Housing Element would not result
in any significant adverse impacts. As a result, no significant adverse cumulative noise impacts will occur.

The analysis of potential noise impacts indicated that no significant adverse impacts would result from the
Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation. As a result, no mitigation measures are
required.
3.13 POPULATION & HOUSING
3.13.1 THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE
According to the City of South El Monte, a project may be deemed to have a significant impact on housing
and population if it results in any of the following:
     ●   A substantial growth in the population within an area, either directly or indirectly related to a
         project;
     ●   The displacement of a substantial number of existing housing units, necessitating the
         construction of replacement housing; or,
     ●   The displacement of substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement
         housing.
3.13.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project induce substantial population growth in an area, either directly or indirectly
     (e.g., through projects in an undeveloped area or extension of major infrastructure)? No Impact.
Growth-inducing impacts are generally associated with the provision of urban services to an undeveloped
or rural area, such as utilities, improved roadways, and expanded public services. The addition of a
maximum of 169 units would result in a potential population of 757 persons assuming an average

household size of 4.48 persons per unit. The utility connections and other infrastructure will continue to
serve the infill sites only. As a result, no significant adverse impacts are anticipated.
B. Would the project displace substantial numbers of existing housing, necessitating the construction of
    replacement housing elsewhere? No Impact.
The RHNA housing need represents a mandate required by the State of California as part of the RHNA’s
implementation. The City is obligated under State law to fulfill the RHNA requirements that have been
assigned to the City. As part of the RHNA's development, SCAG relied on growth projections developed
as part of the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). These growth projections were evaluated in the
environmental studies prepared for both the RHNA and RTP. The City, as part of this Housing Element’s
implementation will accommodate its remaining RHNA housing need of 169 units during the current
planning period. As a result, no impacts are anticipated to result from the Housing Element’s adoption
and subsequent implementation.
C. Would the project displace substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of
    replacement housing elsewhere? No Impact.
The proposed project involves the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Housing Element. No
affordable housing units will be removed as part of the project’s implementation. As a result, no
significant adverse displacement impacts will occur with the proposed project’s implementation.
3.13.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The analysis of potential noise impacts indicated that no significant adverse impacts would result from the
Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent implementation. As a result, no significant adverse
cumulative population and housing impacts will occur.

    ●    A substantial adverse physical impact associated with the provision of new or physically altered
         governmental facilities, the construction of which would cause significant environmental impacts
         in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives
         relative to fire protection services;
    ●    A substantial adverse physical impact associated with the provision of new or physically altered
         governmental facilities, the construction of which would cause significant environmental impacts
         in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives
         relative to police protection services;
    ●    A substantial adverse physical impact associated with the provision of new or physically altered
         governmental facilities, the construction of which would cause significant environmental impacts
         in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives
         relative to school services; or,
    ●    A substantial adverse physical impact associated with the provision of new or physically altered
         governmental facilities, the construction of which would cause significant environmental impacts
         in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives
         relative to other government services.

A. Would the project result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of
    new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which would cause significant
    environmental impacts in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other
    performance objectives relative to fire protection services? Less than Significant Impact.
The City of South El Monte contracts with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, which provides fire
protection service to a number of incorporated cities and all unincorporated areas. Station No. 90 is
located within the City. The addition of up to a maximum of 169 new residential units will result in an
incremental increase in the demand for emergency services. However, any new development will be
reviewed by the Fire Department to ensure compliance with applicable building and safety codes. The
incremental increase in demand is not anticipated to require any modifications to any existing fire
department facilities or involve the need for any new facilities. The potential residential development
applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. As a result, the impacts are less than significant.

The City of South El Monte contracts with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for police
protection and law enforcement services. The main sheriff's station serving the area is located in the City
of South El Monte Civic Center. The Sheriff's Department also provides canine services, an arson-
explosives unit, hazardous materials unit, an aero bureau, and an emergency operations bureau. The
addition of up to a maximum of 169 units will result in a potential increase in the calls for law
enforcement services. The City is obligated under State law to fulfill the RHNA requirements that have
been assigned to the City. The incremental increase in demand is not anticipated to require any
modifications to any existing law enforcement facilities or involve the need for any new facilities. The
potential residential development applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. As part of this
development review process, the City may require the payment of a community benefit fee and/or a
development agreement to finance any public improvements that may be needed to accommodate the
proposed development. As a result, the impacts are less than significant.
C. Would the project result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of
    new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which would cause significant

The addition of a maximum of 169 housing units will result in approximately 1,352 vehicle trips on a daily
basis (8 daily trips per unit). Of this total traffic generation, 8% of the total daily trip generation (108
trips) would occur during the morning (AM) peak hour and 10% (135 trips) would occur during the
evening (PM) peak hour. As indicated in the previous sections, the City is obligated under State law to
fulfill the RHNA requirements that have been assigned to the City. As part of the RHNA's development,
SCAG relied on growth projections developed as part of the RTP. These growth projections were
evaluated in the environmental studies prepared for both the RHNA and RTP. Furthermore, the
residential development envisioned as part of the Housing Element’s implementation is consistent with
that contemplated under the City of South El Monte General Plan. The potential residential development
applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. As a result, impacts are less than significant.

    dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment)? No Impact.
The infill development sites that may accommodate the projected new housing need of a maximum of 169
units are located near arterial roadways that serve as emergency evacuation routes. The development of
these sites contemplated under the implementation of the Housing Element may involve limited
disruption of the roadways for utility connections. However, at no time will any of these arterial
roadways, or any other designated emergency evacuation routes, be closed to traffic due to future
construction activities within the project site. As a result, the Housing Element’s adoption and
subsequent implementation will not result in any significant adverse impacts.
E. Would the project result in inadequate emergency access? No Impact.
Future residential development anticipated as part of the Housing Element’s implementation will be
required to conform to the City’s parking standards. No on-street parking overflow is expected as a result
of future residential development. As a result, the Housing Element’s adoption and subsequent
implementation will not result in any significant adverse impacts.
F. Would the project result in a conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public
    transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such

3.17.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
A. Would the project exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the applicable Regional Water
     Quality Control Board? No Impact.
The Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts (LACSD) No. 1 and 2 provide sewer service to the City. The
City is located within the service area of Sanitation District No. 1. Wastewater collected by the LACSD is
conveyed to the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant located at 24501 Figueroa Street in Carson. This
treatment plant has a design capacity of 385 million gallons per day (mgd) and currently treats 330 mgd.
Thus, a remaining capacity of 55 mgd is available for future development in the region. The potential to
develop up to 169 units contemplated under the Housing Element will result in increased water
consumption and wastewater effluent generation. Future residential development is anticipated to
generate approximately 27,040 gallons of effluent daily assuming 160 gallons of effluent per day for each
unit. As indicated in the previous sections, the City is obligated under State law to fulfill the RHNA
requirements that have been assigned to the City. These RHNA growth projections were evaluated in the
environmental studies prepared for both the RHNA and RTP. Furthermore, the residential development
envisioned as part of the Housing Element’s implementation is consistent with that contemplated under
the City of South El Monte General Plan. As a result, no significant adverse impacts are anticipated.
B. Would the project require or result in the construction of new water or wastewater treatment
     facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant
     environmental impacts? No Impact.
The Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts (LACSD) No. 1 and 2 provide sewer service to the City. The
Central City portion is located within the service area of Sanitation District No. 1. Wastewater collected by
the LACSD is conveyed to the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant located at 24501 Figueroa Street in
Carson. This treatment plant has a design capacity of 385 million gallons per day (mgd) and currently
treats 330 mgd. Thus, a remaining capacity of 55 mgd is available for future development. The potential
169 residential units are projected to generate 27,040 gallons of effluent on a daily basis (assuming 160
gallons of effluent per unit, per day) and is projected to consume 32,000 gallons of water on a daily basis
(assuming 200 gallons per day for each unit).32 In addition, the more modern and up-to-date plumbing
fixtures in the new building will likely result in a further reduction in effluent generation. As a result, no
significant adverse impacts are anticipated.
C. Would the project require or result in the construction of new storm water drainage facilities or
     expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental
     effects? No Impact.
The City is served by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District which operates and maintains
regional and municipal storm drainage facilities. The City works with the Flood Control District in
making local drainage plans and improvements. The projected runoff from the potential infill sites may
     32 Derived from Orange County Sanitation District rates.
SECTION 3 ● ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS                                                                    PAGE 66

   City of South El Monte Housing Element
be accommodated by existing storm drain infrastructure. The projected storm water runoff is not
anticipated to significantly increase with future residential development given the nature and extent of
existing impervious surfaces along both the Santa Anita corridor and Garvey Avenue. The projected
storm water runoff is not anticipated to significantly increase with future residential development. As a
result, no significant adverse impacts are anticipated.
D. Would the project have sufficient water supplies available to serve the project from existing
    entitlements and resources, or are new or expanded entitlements needed? No Impact.
The potential to develop up to 169 units contemplated under the Housing Element will result in increased
water consumption. Approximately 32,000 gallons of water per day will be consumed by the 169 units.
As indicated in the previous sections, the City is obligated under State law to fulfill the RHNA
requirements that have been assigned to the City. As part of the RHNA's development, SCAG relied on
growth projections developed as part of the RTP. These growth projections were evaluated in the
environmental studies prepared for both the RHNA and RTP. Furthermore, the residential development
envisioned as part of the Housing Element’s implementation is consistent with that contemplated under
the City of South El Monte General Plan. As a result, no significant adverse impacts on water supplies or
services are anticipated.
E. Would the project result in a determination by the provider that serves or may serve the project that
    it has inadequate capacity to serve the project’s projected demand in addition to the provider’s
    existing commitments? No Impact.
The potential to develop up to 169 units are projected to consume 32,000 gallons of water and generate
27,040 gallons of effluent on a daily basis. Given the projected demand and the existing remaining
treatment capacity, future developments’ treatment demand can be met by the service providers. The
majority of the potential residential uses will occupy parcels currently in use by commercial and
industrial uses that are significant utility consumers. As a result, no significant adverse impacts on
existing wastewater treatment infrastructure will result from the proposed improvements.
F. Would the project be served by a landfill with sufficient permitted capacity to accommodate the
    project’s solid waste disposal needs? No Impact.
The potential to develop up to 169 residential units possible under the Housing Element’s implementation
are projected to generate 676 pounds of solid waste on a daily basis assuming 4 pounds of waste
generated on a daily basis by each unit. The majority of the potential residential uses will occupy parcels
currently in use by commercial and industrial uses that are significant utility consumers. As a result, no
significant adverse impacts are identified.

G. Would the project comply with Federal, State, and local statutes and regulations related to solid
     waste? No Impact.
Future residential development, like all other development in the City, will be required to adhere to all
pertinent ordinances related to waste reduction and recycling. The majority of the potential residential
uses will occupy parcels currently in use by commercial and industrial uses that are significant utility
consumers. As a result, no adverse waste impact on regulations pertaining to solid waste generation will
result from the proposed project’s implementation.
H. Would the project result in a need for new systems, or substantial alterations in power or natural
     gas facilities? No Impact.
SCE and SCG provide service upon demand, and early coordination with these utility companies will
ensure adequate and timely service to the project. Both utilities currently serve the planning area. Thus,
no impacts on power and natural gas services will result from the adoption and subsequent
implementation of the Housing Element.
I.   Would the project result in a need for new systems, or substantial alterations in communications
     systems? No Impact.
Future residential development will require continued telephone service from various local and long-
distance providers. The existing telephone lines will be utilized to provide service to future residential
development. Thus, no impacts on communication systems are anticipated.
3.17.3 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The potential impacts related to water and sewer line capacities are site specific. Furthermore, the
analysis herein also determined that the proposed project would not result in any significant adverse
utility impact. The ability of the existing sewer and water lines to accommodate the projected demand
from future related projects will require evaluation on a case-by-case basis. As a result, no cumulative
impacts on utilities will occur.
3.17.4 MITIGATION MEASURES
The analysis of utilities impacts indicated that no unmitigable significant adverse impacts would result
from the proposed project’s implementation. The potential residential development applications will be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis. As part of this development review process, the City may require the
installation of certain public improvements that may be needed to accommodate a potential residential
development. As a result, no additional mitigation is required.
