Road Type    Definition
Arterial     Arterial streets provide the major travel corridors through Yreka, linking Collector
             streets with regional roadways. Arterials connect with both Residential Local and
             Collector streets. Arterials are designed to carry the greatest traffic volumes. Right
             of Way requirements for Arterials range between 80 and 100 feet with 84 feet
             being typical.
Collector/   Collector streets provide a linkage between Local streets and Arterial streets.
Industrial   Collector streets serve a variety of functions, providing access to residential and
             non-residential properties and allowing movement to and from Local streets.
             Collectors carry light to moderate traffic volumes. Right of Way requirements for
             this type of street range between 60 and 80 feet with 64 feet being typical.
Significant  Significant local streets are those streets that do not have high enough traffic
Local Street volumes to be considered a collector, but are typically the shortest route to an
             arterial, collector, schools or businesses. These streets may have little to distinguish
             them from other Local Streets except fewer stop signs and controlled intersections.
             A few north-south streets have these characteristics, but have shorter lengths,
             making north-south trips in westerly Yreka more time consuming. Right of way for
             Significant Local Streets is typically 60 feet.
Local        Residential Local streets provide direct access to adjacent properties and are not
             intended to serve through traffic. Local streets provide access to Collector streets
             and carry low traffic volumes.
Cul-de-sac   Cul-de-sac streets are popular with homeowners for a variety of reasons, such as
             privacy and low traffic. With only one way in and out, the number of homes on the
             cul-de-sac is a safety concern for fire and police should evacuation be necessary.
             There are a number of design solutions that can address the access and safety issue,
             these include larger entries, emergency secondary access, design of homes, etc.
             Because topography and design differs in each project, the City will need review
             each project individually. The right of way width for a cul-de-sac is typically a 50-
             foot radius, although the width may be changed to meet safety or access concerns.
             Maximum length of a cul-de-sac is typically 600 feet.
Private      These roads are not owned or maintained by the City, and are usually part of a
             large development project. While these roads may be very low volume, in large
             projects they may be of any size as needed to meet traffic demand. Each road width
             is reviewed with the specific project requesting the roadway.

Proposed Zoning
       (1) Vacant acreage for zone districts is generated from the GIS zone district map.
       (2) Maximum allowed density is reduced to reflect current trends and accommodate streets which can account for
           approximately 20 to 25 percent of land in subdivisions. Since multifamily sites will typically be developed as a single unit and
           will not require division into lots with street frontage, the density reduction only applies to single family developments, as a
           means to convert gross acreage to net developable acreage.
       (3) Standard density is lowered to reflect constraints of topography. Much of the available land for residential development is
           located on hillsides in either east or west Yreka.
       (4) Maximum density is 10 units per acre. However, duplexes have been popular in the past, resulting in a density much nearer
           8 units per acre.
       (5) This density is based on the average density of the “at risk” apartments (13.8 units per acre) listed in Table 3-16

HOUSING INVENTORY
On March 26 and 27, 2002, a “windshield” housing survey was completed for that portion of Yreka with
houses typically 40 years old or older. The surveyed area is basically bounded by Blake and Pioneer
Streets on the north; Fairchild Street and Shasta Avenue on the west; French and Jackson Streets on the
south; and Foothill Drive on the east. The survey included portions of South Oregon and Fourth
Streets south of the above described area, as well as the residential area south of Raymond Street
between Main Street and the Interstate 5. Additionally, the older north and east area of the Campbell
Tract was also surveyed. While some deteriorated housing exists outside of this study area, it is very
limited and scattered and would fall into the less serious A and C categories noted below.
The survey intended to identify housing and residential building sites where signs of deterioration were
obvious. Specifically, houses and sites were noted when they fit one or more of the following criteria:
     A. Needs painting evidenced by peeling or extensive weathering. Everything else is adequate.
     B. Needs painting along with a minor repair such as new screens, shutters or siding is broken
         (minor), or some cosmetic feature is in bad state of disrepair.
     C. Junk in yard (debris, building materials, dismantled autos, no landscaping, etc.)
     D. Junky/dilapidated out buildings (in a bad state of disrepair)
     E. Major repairs needed…. foundation badly cracked, partly missing or sagging; roof in disrepair or
         sagging; broken windows; sagging porch or other feature requiring major repair.
It was observed that housing, even though aging within the study area, is generally in a good condition.
Many houses are small, and even though they showed signs of aging, are reasonably maintained, some of
them very well maintained. Those houses showing signs of deterioration are typically scattered. While
there are some clusters of houses meeting the above criteria, the clusters are small. A summary of the
survey findings follow:
     A.  Needs painting                   49
     B.  Needs minor repairs              25
     C.  Excessive junk in yard           11
     D.  Dilapidated out buildings         5
     E.  Requires major repairs            2
A survey of this type is subjective and would likely vary if taken by a different person. A conservative
approach was taken. For example, the need for painting appeared obvious on many more buildings.
What may be judged as a “need” for paint versus the “necessity” to paint to prevent deterioration,
while in many instances is obvious, in others it is a fine line and depends on a judgment call of the
surveyor. On many homes paint was faded, but not peeling. They were not included as needing paint.
Additionally, many of the older homes have a hard asphalt shingle type of siding. These were frequently
faded or showed signs of staining. Except in real bad cases, homes with these conditions were not
considered to need painting.
The most frequently observed situations needing minor repair were badly deteriorated roof shingles and
                                              Page 3-47

rotting fascia boards along the edge of roofs. Other problems noted were broken siding and torn
screens.
Some observers may have been more critical on those properties having excessive junk in the yard.
While only 11 have been identified, this category could have been viewed more critically and resulted in
3 to 4 times the number actually recorded. Ideally, little or no junk should be viewable from the street.
In Campbell Tract area for example, lots are larger and it was more common to have extra vehicles,
recreation vehicles, firewood and other material in the yard. In this area it was only recorded when the
accumulation stood out from the rest of the neighborhood. To some extent the same criteria was
applied in the rest of the study area. However with smaller lots, it would take less accumulation to
meet the criteria for excessive junk in the yard.
Very few dilapidated out buildings were noted. This number would likely increase if rear yards were
closely observed. Those noted in the survey were clearly visible from the street.
Only two buildings fell into the category needing major repair. Both of these structures are small
houses that have not been maintained, and should probably be demolished instead of repaired. The fact
there were only two indicates that the housing supply in Yreka has been reasonably maintained over the
years. This is one of the harder categories to judge. A house could look reasonably sound on the
outside, but could have major structural, electrical, and plumbing problems that just are not readily
noticed with a windshield survey. (Note: Since the survey was taken, one of these structures has been
demolished.)
It was interesting to note that two houses meeting the criteria for minor repairs due to bad roofs,
where in the process of having the entire roof replaced. Additionally, one house with pealing paint was
in the process of being repainted. Since work was in process, they were not included in the totals
above.
Note: Not included in the survey were three mobile home parks, two of which are located on Main
Street, and the other on Sharps Road. Each of these parks have numerous old trailers, estimated to be
20 to 40 years old that are in bad condition. Being trailers, (mostly old recreational vehicles), needed
repairs are generally not practical.

 Notes:
 1.   For traffic noise within the City of Yreka, Ldn and peak-hour Leq values are estimated to be approximately similar. Interior noise level
      standards are applied within noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors in the closed positions.
 2.   Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as back yards. For large parcels or residences with no clearly
      defined outdoor activity area, the standard shall be applicable within a 100 foot radius of the residence.
 3.   For multi-family residential uses, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor recreation area, such as at
      pools, play areas or tennis courts. Where such areas are not provided, the standards shall be applied at individual patios and balconies
      of the development.
 4.   Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn or less using a practical application of the best-
      available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn may be allowed provided that available exterior noise
      level reduction measures have been implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.
 5.   Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas.
 6.   Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at clearly identified areas
      designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
 7.   Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation have any degree of sensitivity to noise.

A common measure of transmission loss is the
Sound Transmission Class (STC). STC ratings are
not directly comparable to A-weighted noise
reduction, and must be corrected for the spectral
content of the noise source. Requirements for
transmission loss analyses are outlined by Title 24
of the California Code of Regulations.
USE OF VEGETATION
Trees and other vegetation are often thought to
provide significant noise attenuation. However,
approximately 100 feet of dense foliage (so that
no visual path extends through the foliage) is
required to achieve a 5 dB attenuation of traffic
noise. Thus the use of vegetation as a noise
barrier should not be considered a practical
method of noise control unless large tracts of
dense foliage are part of the existing landscape.
Vegetation can be used to acoustically "soften"
intervening ground between a noise source and
receiver, increasing ground absorption of sound
and thus increasing the attenuation of sound with
distance. Planting of trees and shrubs is also of
aesthetic and psychological value, and may reduce
adverse public reaction to a noise source by
removing the source from view, even though
noise levels will be largely unaffected. It should be
noted, however, that trees planted on the top of
a noise control berm can actually slightly degrade
the acoustical performance of the barrier. This
effect can occur when high frequency sounds are

developers design and install many public
improvements, it is important that any over-
sizing be discussed early in the project stage to
avoid unnecessary changes in design. It is also
important that the size of the infrastructure be
clearly defined so that each project can
contribute its fair share of responsibility for
providing adequate services to the community.

Objective: Provide the encouragement and

facility that can accommodate growth
throughout the period of the General Plan. The
permitting and operating of a new landfill is so
expensive that the City should continue with its
recycling and diversion programs to further
prolong the life of the landfill.

HOUSING ELEMENT POLICY SECTIO

HOUSING ELEMENT POLICY SECTION
The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of Yreka of its
current and future housing needs and proposed actions to facilitate the provision of housing to meet
those needs at all income levels. The policies contained in this element are an expression of the
statewide housing priority to allow for the “attainment of decent housing and a suitable living
environment for every Californian,” as well as a reflection of the unique concerns of the community.
The purpose of the Housing Element is to establish specific goals, policies, and objectives relative to the
provision of housing and to adopt an action plan toward this end. In addition, the element identifies and
analyzes housing needs and resources and constraints to meeting those needs.
The Yreka Housing Element is based on six strategic goals:
    1) Provide a range of housing that varies sufficiently in terms of cost, design, size, location, and
        tenure to meet the housing needs of all economic segments of the community at a level no
        greater than that which can be supported by the infrastructure.
    2) Continue to promote housing for special needs groups.
    3) Initiate all reasonable efforts to preserve, conserve, and enhance the quality of existing dwelling
        units and residential neighborhoods to ensure full utilization of the city’s existing housing
        resources for as long as physically and economically feasible.
    4) Ensure that all persons, regardless of race, sex, cultural origin, age, marital status, or physical
        handicaps, are provided a choice of housing locations within the community.
    5) Pursue public and private resources available to promote diverse housing opportunities, and
        particularly to assist in the creation and retention of affordable housing.
    6) Pursue sustainable development and energy efficiency for new residential development and
        existing housing stock.
In accordance with state law, the Housing Element is to be consistent and compatible with other
General Plan elements. Additionally, the Housing Element is to provide clear policy and direction for
making decisions pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital
improvements. State law (Government Code Sections 65580 through 65589) mandates the contents of
the Housing Element. By law, the Housing Element must contain:
    •   An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to
        meeting those needs (Appendix A);
    •   A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relevant to the
        maintenance, improvement, and development of housing (included in this section); and
    •   Programs that set forth a five-year schedule of actions that the local government is undertaking
        or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the
        Housing Element (included in this section).
    •   An evaluation of the schedule of actions from the previous Housing Element (included in this
        section).
                                                      1

The housing program must also identify adequate residential sites available for a variety of housing types
for all income levels; assist in developing adequate housing to meet the needs of extremely low-, very
low-, low-, and moderate-income households; address governmental constraints to housing
maintenance, improvement, and development; conserve and improve the condition of the existing
affordable housing stock; and promote housing opportunities for all persons.
Even though the focus of the Housing Element will be on lower- and moderate-income households, the
element must also address the housing needs and policy issues for the entire community and be
consistent with the adopted policies of the rest of the General Plan. Thus, the Housing Element’s focus
is to balance the desires of residents, maintain neighborhood character, utilize available public services,
manage traffic, and minimize visual and other impacts of new development, while addressing the needs of
low- and moderate-income households and special needs groups (such as seniors and individuals with
disabilities).
                                                     2

ANALYSIS OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
An important aspect of the Housing Element is an evaluation of achievements under the implementation programs included in the previously
adopted Housing Element. The evaluation provides valuable information on the extent to which programs have been successful in achieving
stated objectives and addressing local needs and to which these programs continue to be relevant in addressing current and future housing
needs in Yreka. The evaluation also provides the basis for recommended modifications to programs and the establishment of new objectives in
the Housing Element. While many of the City’s former programs were continued in this update, some were removed due to lack of effectiveness
or redundancy with other programs and others were added to respond to changes in state law and local conditions.
                                                                               Table 1

GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Goal HE.1. Provide a range of housing that varies sufficiently in terms of cost, design, size, location, and
tenure to meet the housing needs of all economic segments of the community at a level no greater than
that which can be supported by the infrastructure.
Policy HE.1.1. Review the General Plan and zoning map on an annual basis to determine the availability
of suitable vacant land to accommodate a variety of housing types. To reduce the impact that availability
may have on the cost of vacant single-family and multi-family land, an adequate inventory of these lands
shall be available at any time to serve five years of projected growth.
         Program HE.1.1.1: Every year, as part of the annual Housing Element review, the Planning
         Commission will review the City’s vacant land inventory with the objective of ensuring that
         Yreka can accommodate a variety of housing types. If a deficiency is found, steps shall be taken
         to change the General Plan and zoning as needed to increase the amount of available land. The
         inventory will be made available to the public, especially the development community, for their
         information and use.
         City staff will also update the Planning Commission on the City’s current fee schedule to ensure
         that the City’s fees are not adding an additional constraint to the development of housing.
         In order to increase public input and support of the City’s housing programs, the City will
         encourage the participation of groups interested in housing in the annual Planning Commission
         review of the Housing Element. This will occur through public notice and normal contact and
         solicitation of participation with local agencies and interest groups.
              Responsibility: Planning Department
              Financing: General Fund
              Timing: Annually
Policy HE.1.2. The City will encourage housing suitable for a variety of income levels and household
sizes and types.
         Program HE.1.2.1: Upon discussions with developers and submittal of residential
         development plans (included but not limited to developers of large residential subdivisions i.e.,
         50 or more units), the City will encourage and support those plans which include lower-income
         housing in areas appropriate to the needs and desires of the population it would house and at
         the same time be convenient to public services. “Encourage and support” as used herein means:
         •    Consider spreading development fee costs over a 3- to 5-year payment period to help
              reduce initial impact, at time of project review;
         •    Provide density bonus or other concessions in accordance with Government Code Section
              65915;
         •    Allow phasing of infrastructure whenever possible at time of project review; and
                                                       17

        •    Any other action on the part of the City which will help to keep development costs to a
             minimum.

        Program HE.1.2.2: The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to state that the City allows
        density bonuses in accordance with the requirements of state density bonus law (Government
        Code Section 65915). The City will also amend the definition of density bonus to comply with
        the Government Code requirements.

        Program HE.1.2.3: The City will continue efforts to mitigate the potential loss of extremely
        low-, very low-, and low-income housing units through the conversion of subsidized rental
        housing projects to market-rate housing through the following actions:
        1. The City will provide information to the property owner of the 46 deed-restricted units
             that are at risk of converting to market-rate housing on methods for preserving the lower-
             income housing by providing incentives or resources, such as working with the Shasta
             County Housing Authority to target Section 8 vouchers for the units or assist in seeking
             other funds for improvements.
        2. Additionally, when units become at risk, the City shall require that property owners comply
             with all noticing requirements related to at-risk units, educate tenants about their rights, and
             contact all potentially interested nonprofits to develop a preservation strategy for the at-risk
             units.

             Timing: Contact property owners of Shadows Garden Apartments during the second half of
             2014 to determine future ownership plans; implement preservation strategy if owners
             indicate desire to sell or convert their properties.
Policy HE.1.3. Ensure that the City’s development standards and/or processing requirements are not a
constraint to the development of affordable housing.
        Program HE.1.3.1: Continue to review the effectiveness of the Zoning Ordinance and make
        revisions if it is found the ordinance is creating unusual constraints on affordability and housing
        availability.
                                                      18

         This will included a review of the conditional use permit process on multi-family applications to
         determine whether the process is a deterrent to construction of affordable multi-family housing.
         During the annual report to the Planning Commission, an assessment shall be made of multi-
         family projects considered during the year. If it is determined that requiring the conditional use
         permit process is in fact acting as a deterrent to providing affordable housing, the City will
         reconsider its position on this matter and take the steps necessary to remove any constraints
         the process may be causing.

Policy HE.2.1. Encourage programs that will address the needs for housing and programs for senior
citizens, large families, physically and developmentally disabled persons, single-parent families, extremely
low-income persons, and the homeless.
         Program HE.2.1.1: Review the Reasonable Accommodation procedure and make revisions to
         provide exceptions in zoning and land use for housing for persons with disabilities. This
         procedure will be a ministerial process, with a minimal processing fee, subject to approval by the
         City Manager or his designee applying the following decision-making criteria:
                  •    The request for reasonable accommodation will be used by an individual with a
                       disability protected under fair housing laws.
                  •    The requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an
                       individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws.
                  •    The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or
                       administrative burden on the City.
                  •    The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the
                       nature of the City’s land use and zoning program.

Health and Safety Code. Further, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency
shelters of 15 beds or fewer by right in the Light Industrial (M1) zone. The Light Industrial zone
has sufficient capacity with 50 vacant parcels totaling approximately 460 acres with adjacent
sewer and water infrastructure, which is sufficient capacity to address Yreka’s homeless needs.
In addition, the City will evaluate adopting development and managerial standards that will be
consistent with Government Code Section 65583(a)(4). These standards may include such items
as:
•   Lighting
•   On-site management
•   Maximum number of beds or persons to be served nightly by the facility
•   Off-street parking based on demonstrated need
•   Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation

separate definitions of “supportive housing” and “transitional housing” consistent with Sections
50675.14 and 50675.2 of the California Health and Safety Code. The City will also amend the
Zoning Ordinance to allow transitional and supportive housing as a residential use subject only
to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone
without undue special regulatory requirements.

Program HE.2.1.5: In order to help meet the needs of extremely low-income households,
the City will prioritize funding and/or offer financial incentives or regulatory concessions to
encourage the development of single-room occupancy units or other units affordable to
households with extremely low income. Further, the City will contact qualified developers of
low income housing to discuss existing extremely low income housing needs in the City, as well
as possible incentives for development of housing.
     Objective: Facilitate the development of single room occupancy units or other units deemed
     affordable to those with extremely low incomes.
     Responsibility: City Manager, Planning Department, Planning Commission, City Council
     Financing: Grant funding
     Timing: Meet with housing developers at least twice during the planning period, with

addressed for seniors, large families, female-headed households, single-parent households with
children, persons with disabilities and developmental disabilities, and homeless individuals and
families. The City will seek to meet these special housing needs through a combination of
regulatory incentives, zoning standards, new housing construction programs, and supportive
services programs. In addition, the City may seek funding under the federal Housing
Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, California Child Care Facilities Finance Program, and
other state and federal programs designated specifically for special needs groups such as
seniors, persons with disabilities, and persons at risk for homelessness.
     Objective: Work with housing providers by meeting at least twice during the planning
     period to discuss special housing needs. Assist, when feasible with funding applications.
     Responsibility: City Manager, Planning Department
     Financing: Grant funding
     Timing: The City will begin researching funding opportunities this year and will meet with
     housing providers annually beginning in 2015.
Program HE.2.1.7: Continue to allow group care facilities for six or fewer persons in all
residential zones including single-family zones in compliance with Health and Safety Code
Sections 1267.8, 1566.3, and 1568.08. Amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow group care
facilities for more than six persons by conditional use permit in the Medium Density Residential
(R-2), High Density Residential (R-3), Commercial Downtown (C-2), and Commercial Highway
(CH) zones. This will allow for the development of a range of assisted care housing for adults
who have limited self-care abilities by ensuring appropriate zoning for all ranges of housing from
group housing to independent living with services on-site for institutional care facilities. Also to
ensure compliance with Health and Safety Code Sections 1267.8, 1566.3, and 1568.08, the
amendment will clarify the definitions of “group residential” and “group care facility.” The
definition of group care facility must distinguish between facilities for six or fewer persons and
for larger facilities for more than six persons. Facilities for six and fewer persons must not be
treated differently than other by-right single-family housing uses and may not be required to
obtain conditional use permits or variances that are not required of other family dwellings.

        Program HE.2.1.8: To comply with the state Employee Housing Act (Health and Safety Code
        Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6), the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to treat employee
        housing that serves six or fewer persons as a single-family structure and permitted in the same
        manner as other single-family structures of the same type in the same zone (Section 17021.5) in
        all zones allowing single-family residential uses. The Zoning Ordinance will also be amended to
        treat employee housing consisting of no more than 12 units or 36 beds as an agricultural use
        and permitted in the same manner as other agricultural uses in the same zone (Section
        17021.6) in all zones allowing agricultural uses.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
State law requires jurisdictions to make a diligent effort to achieve participation by all segments of the
community in preparing a Housing Element. The Housing Element was developed through the combined
efforts of City staff, the Planning Commission, the City Council, and the City’s consultant.
                                                                    24

PUBLIC WORKSHOP
Public input was solicited during a public workshop with the Planning Commission on June 26, 2013.
Two weeks prior to the workshop, a public notice was mailed to a number of special interest groups,
including affordable housing developments in the city, senior housing in the city, two regional homeless
shelters, local tribal authorities, local school districts, nonprofit organizations that represent housing
interests and special needs populations, local realtors, and various County government departments that
provide social services. The notice was also published in the newspaper and posted at City Hall at least
ten days prior to the workshop. Despite these efforts, there was no public attendance at the workshop,
and no comments were received.
PUBLIC HEARINGS
The City held a public hearing with the Planning Commission on December 18, 2013. The purpose of
the meeting was to provide an overview of the Draft Housing Element and receive input from the
Commission and the community. Two weeks prior to the meeting, a public notice was mailed to a
number of special interest groups, including affordable housing developments in the city, senior housing
in the city, two regional homeless shelters, local tribal authorities, local school districts, nonprofit
organizations that represent housing interests and special needs populations, local realtors, and various
County government departments that provide social services. The notice was also published in the
newspaper and posted at City Hall at least ten days prior to the workshop. Despite these efforts, there
was no public attendance at the workshop, and no comments were received.
The City held a hearing with the City Council on January 16, 2014. The purpose of the meeting was to
provide an overview of the Draft Housing Element, receive input from the Council and community and
request that the Council recommend submittal of the Draft Housing Element to HCD for review. Two
weeks prior to the meeting, a public notice was mailed to a number of special interest groups, including
affordable housing developments in the city, senior housing in the city, two regional homeless shelters,
local tribal authorities, local school districts, nonprofit organizations that represent housing interests and
special needs populations, local realtors, and various County government departments that provide
social services. The notice was also published in the newspaper and posted at City Hall at least ten days
prior to the workshop. Approximately eight members of the community attended the meeting.
The City held hearings with the Planning Commission on April 16, 2014 to review the adoption draft
Housing Element and the City Council on May 1, 2014 for their review and adoption of the Housing
Element. The City Council approved adoption of the Housing Element at the May 1st meeting.
INPUT RECEIVED
Planning Commission input and questions received included:
              1. What year was SB2 approved?
              2. Can you define what a single-room occupancy unit is and what an emergency shelter is?
                 What happens if these types of uses don’t get built?
              3. Why didn’t the City do the code amendments (e.g. emergency shelters, density bonus)
                 identified in the last Element?
                                                       25

One community member who attended the January 16th City Council meeting felt the Housing Element
was an onerous requirement placed on the City by the state without any local decision-making
authority. No written comments were received on the Draft Housing Element.
One comment was made at the April 16th Planning Commission hearing from Teri Gabriel, Executive
Director Area Agency on Aging, she stated that with the aging of the baby boomer generation, we need
to keep in mind the need for senior housing.
GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
State law requires that the Housing Element contain a statement of “the means by which consistency
will be achieved with other general plan elements and community goals” (California Government Code,
Section 65583[c] [6] [B]). This requires an evaluation of two primary characteristics: (1) an identification
of other General Plan goals, policies, and programs that could affect implementation of the Housing
Element or that could be affected by the implementation of the Housing Element; and (2) an
identification of actions to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and affected parts of other
General Plan elements. The 2002–2022 General Plan (adopted 2003) contains several elements with
policies related to housing. A review of the other General Plan elements demonstrates consistency with
all other policies and programs. The City will maintain this consistency in the future by ensuring General
Plan amendments are evaluated for consistency with all General Plan elements. Due to the passage of
AB 162 relating to flood protection in 2007, the City may be required to amend the Safety and
Conservation elements of the General Plan. If amendments are needed, the Housing Element will be
amended to be consistent with the Safety and Conservation elements. If any disadvantaged
unincorporated communities are identified in the City’s Sphere of Influence due to analysis required to
comply with SB 244, the City will amend the Land Use element per SB 244 requirements.

      APPENDIX A
HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT

APPENDIX A – HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The Housing Needs Assessment provides a demographic profile of the city by analyzing the following
types of information: population trends, household income and poverty, special housing needs, housing
characteristics, costs and conditions, constraints to development, and resources and opportunities.
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) developed a data packet
for jurisdictions in Siskiyou County that contains much of the information required for the Housing
Needs Assessment of this Housing Element and is the primary source of data for this document. Where
additional information is required, the US Census, which is completed every ten years, is the preferred
data source, as it provides the most reliable and in-depth data for demographic characteristics of a
locality. This report uses the 2010 US Census for current information and the 2000 US Census to track
changes since the year 2000. The California Department of Finance (DOF) is another source of valuable
data that is more current than the Census. However, the DOF does not provide the depth of
information that can be found in the 2010 US Census. Whenever possible, the Siskiyou County data
packet, DOF data, and other local sources were used in the Housing Needs Assessment in order to
provide the most current profile of the community.
The 2010 US Census did not collect information in several categories that are required for the Housing
Needs Assessment. Where this is the case, historical DOF data is used. Where DOF data is not
available, information from the 2000 US Census is retained. In cases where this is not feasible or useful,
this assessment references US Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) data. The ACS
provides estimates of numerous housing-related indictors based on samples averaged over a five-year
period. Where the US Census provides complete counts of various demographic indicators, the ACS
provides estimates based on statistically significant samples. Due to the small size of the sample taken in
Yreka, the estimates reported by the ACS have large margins of error. Where ACS data is used, the
numbers should not be interpreted as absolute fact, but rather as a tool to illustrate general proportion
or scale.
The data presented in the Housing Needs Assessment will not only guide the development of housing
goals and policies but will also be integrated into the body of the Housing Element to present the
current status of housing and housing-related issues in Yreka. Definitions of the various US Census
Bureau terms that are used throughout this document have been included in Appendix C for
clarification.
The Housing Needs Assessment is organized into three main sections. The first section focuses on
demographic information, such as population trends, ethnicity, age, household composition, income,
employment, housing characteristics, general housing needs by income, and housing needs for special
segments of the population. This first section outlines the characteristics of the community and identifies
those characteristics that may have significant impacts on housing needs in the community.
The second section identifies possible governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing
development in Yreka. The City has planning, zoning, and building standards that guide and affect
residential development patterns and influence housing availability and affordability. Environmental and
housing market conditions also affect the location, availability, affordability, and type of housing that is
constructed. The “non-governmental” influences include such factors as the availability and cost of
financing, land, and materials for building homes; natural conditions that affect the cost of preparing and
                                                      A-1

developing land for housing; and the business decisions of individuals and organizations in home building,
finance, real estate, and rental housing that impact housing cost and availability.
The third section identifies the resources and opportunities for affordable housing in the city, which
includes an inventory of adequate sites for affordable housing, funding resources, and a description of
the current housing programs that work to provide affordable housing to the residents of Yreka.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
POPULATION AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Yreka’s population increased by approximately 7 percent between 2000 and 2010 and grew by less than
1 percent between 2010 and 2013 (2010 US Census, 2000 US Census; DOF 2013). The city is expected
to grow at a slow rate for the duration of the current planning period. According to the 2010 US
Census, Caucasians comprise the majority of the city’s residents (78 percent), followed by Hispanic or
Latino (10 percent).
According to the 2000 US Census and 2007–2011 ACS Five-Year Estimates, the city’s median income for
homeowners increased by approximately 25 percent between 2000 and 2010, though that growth closely
matched inflation. Income for renter-occupied households remained stagnant, indicating a decline in real
income. In 2010, more than two-thirds of households had incomes below the low-income ceiling (67
percent) (2007–2011 ACS Five-Year Estimates; HCD 2013). As of April 2013, the unemployment rate was
11.4 percent, which is lower than Siskiyou County’s rate (12.9 percent) but higher than the state’s overall
rate (8.5 percent) (California Employment Development Department 2013).
SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING
Between 2000 and 2010, the 65 to 74 and 74 and older age groups experienced minor growth (2000 US
Census, 2010 US Census). As of 2010, the majority of seniors in Yreka own their homes (64 percent).
Most people living with a disability in the city have a physical disability. Female-headed households make
up 14 percent of all households. Ownership rates appear to have decreased since 2000 for larger
families, which have an ownership rate of 43 percent, down from 56 percent (2000 US Census, 2010 US
Census).
HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
The city’s housing stock is mostly single-family and owner-occupied. According to the City’s building
permit database, 11 single-family units were built between 2008 and 2013; no multi-family units were
built during this time frame. Approximately 47 percent of the city’s housing stock was built prior to
1970 (2007–2011 ACS Five-Year Estimates). Therefore, based on age alone, it is likely that roughly half
of the city’s housing stock is in need of some form of rehabilitation. However, at the time of the 2013
Housing Conditions Survey, only 41 units were noted as needing more than minor repairs. Since 2000,
the number of total housing units has increased by about 11 percent, while the vacancy rate has
increased by approximately 2 percent (2000 US Census, 2010 US Census). Nearly all of these units were
affordable multi-family (City of Yreka, 2013). Most single-family residential construction has been two-,
three-, and four-bedroom units. Most of the overcrowded conditions in the city occur among renter-
occupied households, with 7 percent of renter households being overcrowded compared to 1 percent
of owner-occupied households (2000 US Census; 2007–2011 ACS Five-Year Estimates).
                                                     A-2

The California Association of Realtors reports that the Siskiyou County median home sales price in
March 2013 was $123,320. At the time of the April 2013 rental housing costs survey, less than 30 rental
units were available in the city. There were three two-bedroom apartments available for rent for $625
to $950 per month and three two-bedroom houses available for rent for $725 to $1,100 per month. As
of October 2013, approximately 10 spaces in the city’s five mobile home parks were available for rent.
The rents for these spaces varied considerably, from $235 to $275 at the low end to $400 to $550 at
the high end.
HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Governmental Constraints
Development standards in the city do not necessarily constrain development, but higher-density multi-
family housing types are not allowed without a conditional use permit. Processing times are
approximately one day to one month and can be as long as three or four months when discretionary
review is needed. Projects requiring California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review may take
longer than three months. These requirements are not considered constraints, as they ensure the
maintenance of health and safety standards and the integrity of existing neighborhoods.
Non-Governmental Constraints
According to an Internet survey conducted in May 2013 (survey included www.sellingsiskiyou.com,
www.realtor.net, and www.richterscalere.com), land prices ranged from $20,541 to $93,396 per acre
for land zoned for single-family uses and $8,906 per acre to $120,000 per acre for land zoned for multi-
family use. The average construction cost for a 1,500-square-foot single-family home is estimated to be
approximately $192,200 (www.building-cost.net 2013).
REGIONAL CONTEXT
Yreka is located 25 miles from the Oregon border in central Siskiyou County. It straddles Interstate 5
and is serviced by State Routes 3 and 263. The city is both a rural community and the County seat. The
city was founded with the discovery of gold in March 1851, and during the initial eight to nine years of
mining, grew from 375 to more than 5,000 persons. Today it is the most populous city in the county
with approximately 7,750 persons. The population has fluctuated over the years, but overall growth has
been relatively slow and steady. Since 1980, the city has experienced an average annual growth rate of
approximately one-half of 1 percent. However, between 2010 and 2013, the population remained nearly
static, growing approximately one-tenth of 1 percent (see Table A-1). The decline of the timber
industry and lack of replacement jobs has been the principal and perpetual cause for the slower growth
rate during the last decade.

POPULATION TRENDS
The population of Yreka increased 7 percent from 7,290 in 2000 to 7,750 in 2010. The DOF estimates
the city’s 2013 population to be 7,771 persons, which represents an annual growth rate of less than 1
percent since 2000. Although this growth is considerably lower than is typical of California’s more
urbanized centers, it is fairly common for rural Siskiyou County, where a shortage of economic
opportunities deters growth.
Population projections for Yreka are not currently available. The DOF provides projections for all
counties through 2060. Table A-2 shows the expected population for both the incorporated and
unincorporated portions of Siskiyou County from 2010 to 2060. Based on DOF projections, the county
is expected to experience an annual growth rate of less than three-tenths of 1 percent through 2060.
Based on the city’s historic growth rate and the current economic downturn, it is likely that Yreka’s
future growth rate will resemble the growth rate projected for Siskiyou County.

The distribution of Yreka’s population by age group is shown in Table A-3. Although the absolute
number of residents changed for each category between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of each category
remained relatively static, with no category changing by more than 4 percent. Table A-4 reports age by
householder, which is another way of illustrating how age is distributed in the city. The majority of renters
are between 25 and 34 years old, while most owners are between 45 and 54 years old.

Table A-6 illustrates the number of households in each income group based on 2007–2011 ACS Five-
Year Estimates. Over one quarter (27 percent) of all households fall into the extremely low-income
category. Approximately 66 percent of the city’s households have incomes at or below the low-income
limit. The remaining 34 percent of households have incomes above the low-income limit (14 percent of
households earn incomes that fall into the moderate-income category; 20 percent of households fall
into the above moderate-income category).

Table A-7 illustrates the tenure by housing unit type in the year 2000. No 2010 US Census data, DOF
data, or reliable ACS data were available at the time of this report. The majority of owner-occupied
households occupied single-family housing units; the majority of renter-occupied households occupied
multi-family housing units.

COMMUTE
Commute distance is an important factor in housing availability and affordability and is also an indicator
of jobs/housing balance. Communities with extended commute distances generally have a poor
jobs/housing balance, while those with short average commutes tend to have a strong jobs/housing
balance. The burden of the additional costs associated with extended commuting disproportionately
affects lower-income households who must spend a larger portion of their overall income on fuel. This
in turn affects a household’s ability to occupy decent housing without being overburdened by cost. Table
A-8 indicates that the vast majority of Yreka residents travel less than 30 minutes from home to work.
                                                                 A-7

This figure indicates that many of the jobs are within 20 miles of the city and that there is a strong
jobs/housing balance, meaning that the available jobs are within relatively close distance to the
employees’ places of residence.

INCOME LIMITS AND POVERTY
The State of California publishes annual income limits for each county that are used to determine
eligibility for assisted housing programs within that county. The California Health and Safety Code
requires that the state limits for the low-, very low-, and extremely low-income categories will be the
same as those in the equivalent levels established by the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) for its Section 8 program. The income limits by household size are shown in
Table A-9.

EMPLOYMENT
The region’s fastest growing occupations are listed in Table A-10. This information is only available for
the Northern Counties Region, not for Yreka, but is applicable because Yreka residents work both
inside and outside of the city. According to HCD, the 2013 Siskiyou County median income for a family
of four is $57,900. Of the ten fastest growing occupations, only two have a median hourly wage that is
on par with the county’s median hourly wage: physical therapists and management analysts. Table A-11
notes the county’s largest employers by city and Table A-12 presents employment and median income
by industry, which is an aggregated version of the finer scaled occupation data presented in Table A-10.

PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Table A-15 illustrates the population of persons with disabilities who may require housing with special
features such as wheelchair ramps, special doorbells, roll-in showers, high-set toilets, or other adaptive
devices or medical equipment. The majority of the population with disabilities is in the working age
group (16 to 64). Most of the disabilities in this group (26.5 percent) are physical. Since there are no
DOF, 2010 US Census, or reliable ACS data, 2000 US Census information is used for this analysis. Table
A-16 reports employment status for persons between the ages of 16 and 54 with a disability. Program
HE.2.1.1 is proposed to implement revisions to the City’s existing reasonable accommodation
procedure to allow exceptions in zoning and land use to facilitate access for those with disabilities.

PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires the City to include the needs of individuals with a developmental disability
within the community in the special housing needs analysis. According to Section 4512 of the Welfare
and Institutions Code, a “developmental disability” means a disability that originates before an individual
attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a conventional housing
environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is
provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical
attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood,
                                                                  A-12

the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a
statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based
facilities. The Far Northern Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers in California that provides
point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, nonprofit
community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals
with developmental disabilities and their families. Table A-17 provides information about Yreka’s
population of developmentally disabled persons; Table A-18 provides information about those persons’
place of residence.

A number of housing types are appropriate for people living with a development disability: rent-
subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing, Section 8 vouchers,
special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-
accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living
opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this need
group. Incorporating “barrier-free” design in all new multi-family housing (as required by California and
federal fair housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled
residents. Special consideration should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with
disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the City will
implement programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with the Far North Regional Center
and encourage housing providers to designate a portion of new affordable housing developments for
persons with disabilities, especially persons with developmental disabilities, and pursue funding sources
designated for persons with special needs and disabilities. Program HE.2.1.6 is proposed to specifically
address the needs of the developmentally disabled.
                                                                A-13

FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Female-headed single-parent households experience numerous housing problems, including affordability
(the individuals are often on public assistance), overcrowding (the individuals often cannot afford units
large enough to accommodate their families), insufficient housing choices, and discrimination. The City
of Yreka recognizes these problems and has included policies and programs in this document to address
affordability, overcrowding, and discrimination for all segments of the population.
Table A-19 illustrates the number of family households that are headed by a female with no husband
present. Female-headed households with no husband present account for 14 percent of all households in
the city. Of these households, the majority are renter-occupied. Table A-20 reports the presence of
children in female-headed households, as well as poverty indicators for female-headed households.
Female-headed households with their own children make up approximately 9 percent of all households
in the city and 68 percent of all female-headed households. Female-headed households under the
poverty level make up 59 percent of all female-headed households and 8 percent of total city
households.

LARGE FAMILIES
A large family is one with five or more family members. Large families are considered a special needs
group because they require larger homes, but don’t necessarily make enough money to afford many of
the larger homes available. Those homes may be luxury or newer homes out of the range of affordability
for lower-income families. Thus, a large family may struggle to find suitable affordable housing. The
number of large families in the city is shown in Table A-21. The proportion of renter households as a
percentage of all large households increased and now makes up the majority of all large family
households.

HOMELESS PERSONS AND FAMILIES
Individuals and families may find themselves homeless for a variety of economic, social and/or personal
reasons,. Their homelessness can be a temporary situation or a semi-permanent way-of-life. Each
situation in which people become homeless is different, requiring different housing needs. Whatever the
situation, the most immediate housing needs can be satisfied with three basic shelter types: emergency,
transitional and temporary. According to the prior Housing Element, the city has not had a large
presence of homeless residents in the past. A recent inquiry with the City of Yreka Police Department
indicates that this is still the case. According to the Police Chief, five or so transients may be passing
through the city at any given time, with another five or so homeless persons residing along Yreka Creek
during the summer months. Informal estimates by others may be high. During the winter months,
however, it is believed that the homeless persons living along Yreka Creek move indoors. With one
transitional shelter located on Lane Street and another shelter in Montague six miles to the east, there
appears to be adequate housing for the homeless population at present. Regardless, the City will amend
its Zoning Ordinance to facilitate the development of additional shelters should there be an increased
need for these facilities at some point in the future (Program HE.2.1.3).
Services for homeless individuals and families are available in the city and elsewhere in the county.
Table A-22 illustrates the programs in the city and surrounding area that offer assistance.

FARMWORKERS
Farmworkers are defined as those households whose wage-earners make their living through seasonal
agricultural work and who move with the seasons to different farming communities, or those who find
tree planting jobs and who also move throughout the forested regions on a seasonal basis.
As evidenced by the 2000 US Census (the most recent reliable source for this data), which reports only
14 farmworkers living in the city, the agricultural area in which Yreka is centered is primarily a ranching
area with little need for seasonal farmworkers. According to representatives of the Modoc-Siskiyou
Community Action Agency, silvicultural workers are mostly found in those Siskiyou County communities
that are closer to planting sites. The nearest community employing seasonal farmworkers is Macdoel,
which is approximately 50 miles east of Yreka. This is the closest area where intensive farming of
strawberry and potato crops occurs. Intensive farming of this nature does not occur anywhere near
Yreka. Soils in the Yreka area are considered to be too heavy for regular tillage, so they are used almost
entirely for hay and pasture. Consequently, there is little need for seasonal or transient farmworker
housing in Yreka. Permanent farmworkers are paid wages similar to other skilled and semi-skilled
                                                      A-16

workers in the region and need not be considered separately. Permanent farmworker housing is allowed
in all residential zones subject to the standards therein. Due to the lack of local farming activity,
countywide farm worker data provided in the Siskiyou County 5th Cycle Housing Element Data Packet
have not been included in this Housing Element.
Although there is little need, in order to comply with the state Employee Housing Act that ensures local
zoning can accommodate employee housing for farmworkers and other employees, the City has added
Program HE.2.1.8. Further, the City has added Program HE.2.1.2 to facilitate the development of single-
room occupancy units. Often converted hotels and motels, these are one of the most appropriate types
of temporary housing for low-income persons.
HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
HOUSING COMPOSITION
The composition of housing units in Yreka is mostly single-family. Table A-23 displays the estimated
number of each type of housing unit for 2007, 2010, and 2013 as reported by the DOF. Between 2007
and 2013, most of the housing unit growth was the result of increased single-family attached units and
development with 5 or more units. The actual number of units issued building permits for new
construction between 2008 and 2013 was 11 single-family and 0 multi-family.

HOUSING CONDITIONS
AGE OF HOUSING STOCK
Housing element law requires an estimate of substandard housing in the community. Determining the
percentage of units built prior to 1970 provides an estimate of major rehabilitation or replacement
need. Table A-24 indicates that approximately 47 percent of the units in the city were constructed
prior to 1970. Therefore, based on age alone, it would appear that approximately 47 percent of homes
in the city may require rehabilitation or replacement, depending on the level of maintenance these units
have received. However, at the time of the City’s 2013 Housing Condition Survey (detailed below), only
41 units, or just over 9 percent of surveyed units, were identified as needing more than minor repairs. It
is important to note that the survey did not include mobile home parks and was performed as a
“windshield survey.” Inclusion of the mobile home parks and a closer inspection would be expected to
result in an increase in the number of units requiring rehabilitation or replacement.

OCCUPANCY & TENURE
Tables A-25 and A-26 illustrate the tenure and occupancy of housing in Yreka. The most recent
tenure information comes from the 2010 US Census. According to this information, the majority of
households are owner-occupied (52 percent). Occupancy information is also available from the Census
Bureau for 2010. The number of housing units increased by 372 between 2000 and 2010. The vacancy
rate increased slightly during this time period from approximately 6 to 8 percent.

HOUSING CONDITIONS SURVEY
In June 2013, the City of Yreka conducted a windshield survey of housing conditions in the community.
Of the 3,673 units in Yreka, 444, or 12 percent, were surveyed. The condition of housing was assessed
by an exterior survey of the quality and condition of the building and what improvements (if any) were
needed. Each structure was scored according to criteria established by HCD in five categories:
foundation, roofing, siding, windows, and electrical. Based on scores assigned to the five categories, each
structure was classified as being in sound or dilapidated condition, or in need of minor, moderate, or
substantial repairs (as defined in Table A-27). The survey did not assess interior conditions.

              or major rehabilitation will be required at a minimum.
Of the units surveyed, 70 percent (309 units) were in sound condition, with the remaining 30 percent
(135 units) requiring at least some repairs. Of the surveyed units, 21 percent (94 units) needed only
minor repairs, with 8 percent (35 units) requiring moderate repairs. Two units surveyed needed
substantial repairs, and four were considered dilapidated. If the units surveyed are a representative
sample of housing units in Yreka, it means that of the community’s 3,673 units, 2,556 (70 percent) are in
sound condition, 778 (21 percent) need only minor repairs, 290 (8 percent) housing units require
moderate repairs, 17 (less than 1 percent) are in need of substantial repairs, and 33 (less than 1 percent)
are considered dilapidated.
The results of the housing conditions survey suggest the need to continue Program HE.3.1.3 to
prioritize code enforcement. The City will track other opportunities and programs to improve the
condition of the housing stock during the upcoming planning period.

HOUSEHOLD SIZE
Household size by tenure is shown in Table A-28. In 2000 and 2010, the majority of owner-occupied
households were inhabited by two residents, while most renter-occupied households were inhabited by
one resident. Although the absolute number of households changed for each category between 2000
and 2010, the proportion of each category remained relatively static, with no category changing by more
than 2 percent.

OVERCROWDED HOUSING
The US Census Bureau defines overcrowding as more than 1.01 persons per room. Severe
overcrowding occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per room. Tables A-29 and A-30
illustrate the number and percentage of units in the city according to occupants per room. Less than 1
percent of owner-occupied housing units and 3 percent of renter-occupied units were either
overcrowded or severely overcrowded in 2000. The 2000 overcrowding figures are supported by ACS
estimates for 2011. Due to uncertainty in the ACS estimates, trends between the years cannot be
accurately compared; however, the 2011 data confirms that the housing stock in the city generally has
less than one occupant per room, with the exception of renter-occupied households, which might have
a small number of overcrowded units. Severe overcrowding does not appear to be an issue in the city.

Housing cost information is supplemented by Table A-32, which notes that the median home sales
price in March 2012 was approximately $110,000 and in March 2013 was approximately $123,320.
There was a slight home value increase between 2012 and 2013, which mirrors state trends, although
with only two data points, no definitive trend can be drawn from that increase.
A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is two and one-half to three times its annual
income, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such as a car loan),
and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some households to qualify for
homes priced at more than three times their annual income, while other households may be limited to
purchasing homes no more than two times their annual income. The median home price in Yreka is not
affordable to extremely low-income or very low-income households.

The qualifying annual income identified in Table A-32 is based on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an
annual percentage rate (APR) of 5.5 percent and a down payment of 10 percent. The qualifying income
for the average sales price of a home would require an approximate income of $41,100, which based on
the 2013 HCD income limits, is affordable to the low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income
categories.

MOBILE HOUSING COSTS
The Department of Finance’s 2012 Estimate of Population and Housing shows a total of 172 mobile
homes in Yreka, which represents 5 percent of the total housing stock. As of October 2013,
approximately 10 spaces in the city’s five mobile home parks were available for rent. The rents for these
spaces varied considerably, from $235 to $275 at the low end to $400 to $550 at the high end.
OVERPAYMENT
Definitions of housing affordability can vary, but in general a household should pay no more than 30
percent of its monthly income on housing costs. Households that pay more than this are considered
“cost-burdened” and households that pay more than 50 percent are considered “severely cost-
burdened.” Measuring the number of households paying more than these percentages helps define an
area’s affordability problem. Overpayment data for all Yreka households by tenure is reported by the
2007–2011 ACS Five-Year Estimates. Table A-34 provides this information for each income category as
well as for all households with lower incomes (extremely low, very low and low-income households).
Approximately 82 percent of households earning 30 percent or less of the area mean income (AMI)
spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs; approximately 61 percent of households
earning between 30 and 50 percent AMI were also burdened by the cost of housing. Renter households
experienced a much higher rate of overpayment than owner households.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Various interrelated factors may constrain the ability of the private and public sectors to provide
adequate housing that meets the needs of all economic segments of the community. These constraints
can be divided into two categories: governmental and non-governmental. Governmental constraints
consist of land use controls, development standards, processing fees, development impact fees, code
enforcement, site improvement costs, development permit and approval processing, and provision for a
variety of housing. Non-governmental constraints include land availability, land cost, construction costs,
and availability of financing.
Governmental Constraints
Land Use Controls
The City of Yreka’s General Plan establishes policies that guide all new development, including
residential land uses. These policies, along with zoning regulations, control the amount and distribution
of land allocated for different land uses in the city. Table A-36 shows the residential land use
designations established by the General Plan.

Residential Development Standards
Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents as well as to implement the policies of the General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance also serves to
preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods. Table A-37 shows the residential zone
districts and permitted densities.

The minimum residential lot sizes range from 7,000 square feet to 1 acre. The maximum height limit for
residential units is 25 feet in the R-A and R-1 districts and 35 feet in the R-2 and R-3 districts. In the
past, this height restriction has not inhibited multi-family development as showcased by the 61-unit
Shasta Courtyards development that has four two-story buildings on 5.4 acres, the 81-unit Emerald
Pointe Apartments that has five two-story buildings on 6.1 acres, and the 31-unit Sierra Vista Retirement
Center that has a single three-story building on 2.5 acres.
Parking standards require a minimum of 2 parking spaces per unit in the R-A, R-1, and R-2 districts and
1.5 spaces in the R-3 district. The requirements are minimal, and none of these are considered a
constraint to development.
Yreka’s two high-density multi-family zones are the Medium Density Residential (R-2) and High Density
Residential (R-3) zones. The zones are fairly similar in the type of housing units allowed. The primary
difference is the allowable densities in each. The R-2 zone allows a maximum of 13 units per acre, while
the R-3 zone allows a maximum of 16 units per acre. The R-2 zone allows up to three-unit multi-family
projects and does not allow projects with more than three units. For a project of four units or more to
be built in the R-3 zone, approval of a conditional use permit is required.
While approval of a use permit does require more effort on the part of the applicant than a permit
approved by staff, history has not shown this process to be a constraint to development of affordable
housing. A conditional use permit for a multi-family housing project entails a public hearing before the
Planning Commission, as well as notification of property owners within 300 feet of the project. An
environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (typically a negative
declaration) is conducted, and staff reviews the project for compliance with City and CEQA standards.
There are no design standards, architectural review, or other criteria applied except normal setbacks,
building height, lot coverage, density, and parking requirements. The Planning Commission primarily
considers potential environmental impacts, as well as public improvements (e.g., curb, gutter, sidewalk,
and drainage improvements) that may be necessary to support the project. The entire process from
submittal to public hearing and project approval is typically about three to four months. Should a project
be appealed to the City Council, another three to four weeks could be added to the processing time,
but this has not occurred on the few projects processed in recent years.
While on the surface the conditional use permit process as an extra application step may seem to be a
constraint, actual practice has shown that projects have not been denied, nor have projects been altered
in a manner which would affect project feasibility. Since processing fees are low, as shown herein, the
only real constraint is the approximately three- to four-month period necessary to process the
application before the Planning Commission. This processing time is minimal and has little to no effect
on the cost or feasibility of a multi-family housing project.

The City of Yreka has adopted and follows the 2007 City of Redding Construction Standards, including
exceptions and modifications adopted from time to time by the Director of Public Works of the City of
Yreka regarding specific standards as needed. Although subject to change, these standards are
summarized below.
    •    Local Streets:
         Right-of-way: 50–70 feet, 60 feet typical
         Pavement width: 36 feet
         Curb, gutter, and 4-foot sidewalk required
     •   Minor Arterial:
         Right-of-way: 66–80 feet
         Pavement width: 40 feet
         Curb, gutter, and 4-foot sidewalk required
     •   Streetlights required on public streets, but not within Planned Developments or on acre or
         larger lots
     •   Water, sewer, and fire hydrants are to be provided as required by the Director of Public
         Works.
     •   Manholes: 460-foot spacing with 12–30-inch pipe, 50-foot spacing with 33—59-inch pipe
     •   Curb, gutter, and a 4-foot sidewalk are required for any new building and/or improvement
         amounting to $20,000 or more in value. Sidewalks are 4-foot minimum in residential districts.
While all development-related improvements add to the cost of housing, the City’s adopted standards
have yet to serve as a constraint to the construction of affordable housing, as evidenced by the number
of affordable units that have been added to the city’s housing stock over the past ten years.
Water and Sewer Priority
Effective January 2006, SB 1087 requires water and sewer providers to grant priority for service
allocations to proposed developments that include units affordable to lower-income households.
Pursuant to these statutes, upon adoption of its Housing Element, the element will be internally
distributed to the City of Yreka Utilities Division, along with a summary of its Regional Housing Needs
Allocation.
Provisions for a Variety of Housing
The Housing Element must identify adequate sites that are available for the development of housing
types for all economic segments of the population. Part of this entails evaluating the City’s Zoning Code
and its provision for a variety of housing types. Housing types include single-family dwellings, duplexes,
guest dwellings, mobile homes, group residential homes, multi-family dwellings, convalescent homes,
accessory structures, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy units.
Some housing types are allowed by right and others are allowed with a conditional use permit. Table
A-38 below summarizes the housing types permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited under the
City’s Zoning Ordinance.
                                                    A-29

Assembly Bill 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the quantification and analysis of existing and projected
housing needs of extremely low-income households. Elements must also identify ways to encourage and
facilitate housing for extremely low-income households.
Single-room occupancy units (SROs) are often the most appropriate type of housing for extremely low-
income persons. The City’s Zoning Code does not specifically define single-room occupancy units, but
does allow boarding or rooming houses with a conditional use permit in the Commercial Highway (CH),
Commercial Tourist (CT), and Light Industrial (M-1) zones. The development standards for these types
of housing are the same as other uses in the respective zone and do not constrain the development of
SRO types. However, to ensure the facilitation of SROs, the City will amend its Zoning Code to clarify
the definition of single-room occupancy unit and describe specific development standards for these units
(see Program HE.2.1.2).
Second Dwelling Units
Second dwelling units are another type of housing appropriate for lower-income persons. "Second unit"
means an attached or a detached residential dwelling unit that provides complete independent living
facilities for one or more persons. It includes permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking,
and sanitation on the same parcel as the single-family dwelling is situated. A second unit also includes an
efficiency unit, as defined in Section 17958.1 of Health and Safety Code, and a manufactured home, as
defined in Section 18007 of the Health and Safety Code.
Assembly Bill (AB) 1866 (Chapter 1062, Statutes of 2002), also known as the “second unit law,”
amended the California Government Code to facilitate the development of second units. This
amendment now requires localities to allow second units ministerially without discretionary review or
hearings. To be considered a ministerial review, the process used to approve second units must “apply
predictable, objective, fixed, quantifiable, and clear standards.” Applications for second units should not
be subject to onerous conditions of approval or public hearing process or public comment.
The second unit law established maximum standards for second units on lots zoned for residential use
that contain existing single-family dwellings. No other standards can be applied to the approval of
second units than those listed in Section 95852.2(b) of the Government Code, except the City may
require that the primary structure be owner-occupied. The City may apply the following standards:
     •    The unit is not intended for sale and may be rented;
     •    The lot is zoned for single-family or multi-family use;
     •    The lot contains an existing single-family dwelling;
     •    The second unit is either attached to the existing dwelling and located within the living area of
          the existing dwelling or detached from the existing dwelling and located on the same lot as the
          existing dwelling;
     •    The increased floor area of an attached second unit shall not exceed 30 percent of the existing
          living area;
     •    The total area of floor space for a detached second unit shall not exceed 1,200 square feet; and
     •    Requirements relating to height, setback, lot coverage, architectural review, site plan review,
          fees, charges, and other zoning requirements generally applicable to residential construction in
          the zone in which the property is located.
                                                      A-30

Table A-38 shows the zoning districts where second dwelling units are allowed. Second units are
allowed in all residential zones on lots greater than 8,000 square feet with approval of an administrative
permit. In the City’s Zoning Code, second unit performance standards are addressed separately in each
of the residential zone districts. Second units must meet all of the same requirements as the main
structure, except that they may not exceed 1,200 square feet unless located on lots that are at least
14,000 square feet. Similar to the primary dwelling, second units must be accompanied by a garage or
carport.

Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As part of a governmental constraints analysis, housing elements must analyze constraints on the
development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. This includes a
review of zoning and land use policies and practices to ensure:
     •    Compliance with fair housing laws;
     •    A provision exists for group homes for six or more persons;
     •    A broad definition of family is included in the zoning code in order to provide occupancy
          standards specific to unrelated adults, as well as comply with fair housing law;
     •    Siting or separation requirements for licensed residential care facilities do not impact the
          development and cost of housing for persons with disabilities; and
     •    The inclusion of alternate residential parking requirements for persons with disabilities.
In accordance with state law, the City must allow group facilities for six persons or less in any area
zoned for residential use and may not require licensed residential care facilities for six or less individuals
to obtain conditional use permits or variances that are not required of other family dwellings.
                                                             A-31

Consequently, group care facilities for six and fewer individuals are allowed by right in all residential
zones and conditionally permitted in the C-1, C-2, CH, and CT zones similar to other residential uses.
Additionally, to better facilitate the development of housing for persons with disabilities, the City will
amend the Zoning Code to allow group care facilities of six or more persons in the Medium Density
Residential (R-2), High Density Residential (R-3), Commercial Downtown (C-2), and Commercial
Highway (CH) zones with a conditional use permit (Program HE.2.1.7).
Section 16.12.480 of the Zoning Code provides a broad definition of “family” as follows: “Family means a
group of individuals with a common bond by means of blood, marriage, or conscientiously established
relations living together as a housekeeping unit sharing a dwelling unit. Clients of a group home subject
to California Community Care Facilities Act (Health and Safety Code 1500 et seq.) are not deemed a
family for purposes of this title.” The Zoning Code also provides a definition of group care home that is
based on Health and Safety Code Section 1500 et seq. Further, the occupancy standards of the Zoning
Code comply with fair housing laws in that they do not restrict occupancy based on relationship.
The City does not have any special requirements for residential care facilities, such as minimum
distances between facilities. While spacing between group homes could be a concern, this has not been
a problem in Yreka. With a limited number of such homes, no standards for spacing exist in either the
General Plan or the Zoning Ordinance.
Parking standards for houses or group homes for the disabled can be modified through a parking waiver
issued by the Planning Commission in accordance with Zoning Code Section 16.54.140(B), when such a
waiver is not detrimental to the public health and safety and would not cause an unreasonable hardship.
For rest homes, nursing homes, convalescent homes, and homes for the aged, the Zoning Ordinance
requires one parking space for each employee, plus one space for each four beds. If the need is
demonstrated by the applicant, the Planning Commission could modify these standards pursuant to
Section 16.54.140(B). Parking requirements are 2 spaces for single-family dwellings and 1.5 spaces per
multi-family unit. The provisions of Sections 16.54.140(B) could apply to these standards as well for
disabled persons.
Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing
State legislation (Senate Bill 2 (Cedillo, 2007)) requires jurisdictions to identify a zone or zones where
emergency shelters will be allowed as permitted uses without a conditional use permit or other
discretionary permit. The zone or zones identified have to have land available to accommodate at least
one full-time emergency shelter. Although the City’s Housing Needs Assessment indicates there are
relatively few homeless persons in the city, and identifies existing homeless services in the city and other
nearby cities, the City will amend its Zoning Ordinance consistent with SB 2 to ensure it does not
constrain the ability of emergency shelters to locate inside city limits. SB 2 further requires that
transitional housing and supportive housing be defined and considered as residential uses subject only to
the same restrictions that apply to similar housing types in the same zone.
California Health and Safety Code Section 50801 defines an emergency shelter as “housing with minimal
supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a
homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability
to pay.”
                                                    A-32

Transitional housing is defined in Section 50675.2 of the Health and Safety Code as rental housing for
stays of at least six months but where the units are recirculated to another program recipient after a set
period. It may be designated for various users including a homeless individual or family transitioning to
permanent housing. This housing can take many structural forms such as group housing and multi-family
units and may include supportive services to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of
independent living.
Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code as housing with linked
on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length of stay that is occupied by a target population as
defined in Health and Safety Code Section 53260 (i.e., low-income person with mental disabilities, AIDS,
substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or persons whose disabilities originated before the age of
18). Services that are linked to supportive housing usually focus on retaining housing, living and working
in the community, and/or health improvement.
In an effort to clarify the Zoning Code and therefore facilitate the above housing types, the City will add
current definitions of “transitional housing,” “supportive housing,” and “emergency shelter” as stated in
this document. Further, pursuant to Senate Bill 2, the City conducted a staff-level review of its zoning
districts and available land and determined the M1 (Light Industrial) zone would be the most appropriate
for emergency shelters because NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) issues would be minimized.
Approximately 460 acres in 50 vacant parcels of currently zoned M1 sites with adjacent sewer and
water infrastructure are available to meet this potential need. Program HE.2.1.3 addresses these changes
to the Zoning Code.
Housing for Farmworkers
The City requires a conditional use permit (CUP) for large-scale housing developments in all residential
zones. The CUP process is in place to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses. Conditions of
approval vary from project to project, but most likely they will contain provisions for landscaping, type
of fencing, driveway locations, compatible lighting, and recreational facilities. This process is not a
constraint to the development of farmworker housing, as the process is streamlined and projects can be
approved in three months. However, in order to comply with the state Employee Housing Act that
ensures local zoning can accommodate employee housing for farmworkers and other employees, the
City has added Program HE.2.1.8.
Density Bonus
The City does not have a codified density bonus ordinance. The City’s Zoning Ordinance will be
updated to reflect the fact that the City complies with state density bonus law. Program H.1.2.2 will
implement this compliance with state law.
Development and Processing Fees
Many of the areas zoned for higher-density projects currently have on- and off-site improvements such
as water and sewer connections, streets, and sidewalks in place so there are no additional requirements.
For other areas, however, the City requires developers to construct improvements and/or pay fees to
help deter the costs of providing infrastructure, public facilities, and services. Impact fees that apply to
new residential single-family and multi-family construction are listed in Table A-39. The City also
collects fees from developers to help cover the costs of planning and processing permits. Processing fees
                                                    A-33

are calculated based on average staff time and material costs required to process a particular type of
case. Planning and processing fees are shown in Table A-40.
The City’s impact fees are somewhat higher than other small cities in the region, which have been slow
to adopt or update fee programs due to declining populations. Being one of the few cities in the county
to experience sustained growth, the City of Yreka’s fees for a typical 1,500-square-foot single-family or
multi-family dwelling are approximately $15,529.83. As illustrated in Table A-41, this typical fee total is
approximately 8 percent of the average new house construction cost and 7 percent of the average new
multi-family unit construction cost. While these costs will likely be passed on to the ultimate product
consumer, thus impacting housing prices, these requirements are deemed necessary to maintain the
quality of life desired by city residents. Further, the City of Yreka is currently charging only 50 percent
of its adopted fees due to a sluggish economy, and no date has been set for restoring fees to the full
amount.

Permit Processing Times
The time involved in processing development applications can become a constraint to affordable housing
development. In Yreka, most development applications for single-family and multi-family developments
take between three and four weeks to process as long as no discretionary approvals are needed. If an
applicant proposes developments that require discretionary review, such as a use that requires a CUP,
the processing time can extend to two months regardless of whether the development is a single-family
or multi-family project. For example, the Shasta Courtyards multi-family housing development and
Emerald Pointe Apartments both required use permits, each of which took approximately two months
to process. Table A-42 lists the typical review times for each type of permit or approval process in
Yreka. These review periods do not present constraints to development, as some review is needed to
ensure the maintenance of health and safety standards. The Planning Department encourages developers
to submit applications concurrently where possible to minimize the total processing time and related
cost for a project.

Building Code and Enforcement
The City adopted the California Building Code (CBC) for its code requirements and deviates from it
only in the case of requirements for wind load and snow load (i.e., the City has a higher standard for
roofing due to local conditions). Because the more stringent standards apply only in these two cases
and to protect public health and safely, the enforcement of the CBC does not pose a significant
constraint to the production or improvement of housing in Yreka.
                                                                  A-36
Code enforcement typically occurs when the building inspector is processing other permits on the site,
or when complaints are filed. The Building Department staff works with the County Health Department
when the complaint appears to be a matter of both health and safety.
Most complaints come from renters who have complaints against their landlord. The inspection may
reveal building or health code violations that are then written up with a timeline for correction and
follow-up inspections. If there are no code violations, but other non-code situations occur, the renter is
given a question and answer sheet prepared by the California Department of Consumer Affairs, which
helps to define the renter’s rights and options in the matter. Complaints in mobile home parks are
referred to the enforcement section of HCD.
The City adopted Ordinance #770 on June 5, 2003, which establishes a process for abating public
nuisances. The types of nuisances defined in the ordinance vary from unsightly storage and debris on a
parcel to elements of disrepair of buildings. Enforcement of Ordinance #770 is a post-construction
activity and does not constrain the development of lower-income housing.
Non-Governmental Constraints
Land Costs
The cost of raw, developable land creates a direct impact on the cost for a new home and is considered
a possible constraint. A higher cost of land raises the price of a new home. Therefore, developers
sometimes seek to obtain City approvals for the largest number of lots allowable on a parcel of land.
Residential land costs in Yreka as of May 2013 are shown in Table A-43. The following list of
properties was gathered through the Internet sites www.sellingsiskiyou.com, www.realtor.net, and
www.richterscalere.com. Single-family land prices ranged from $20,541 per acre to $93,396 per acre;
multi-family land prices ranged from $8,906 per acre to $120,000 per acre. Although there is a wide
range in price per acre, the average costs are substantially lower than they were in 2009.

Construction and Labor Costs
Factors that affect the cost of building a house include the type of construction, materials, site
conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration. An Internet source of construction
cost data (www.building-cost.net), provided by the Craftsman Book Company, estimates the cost of a
                                                                 A-37

single-story four-cornered home in Yreka to be approximately $128 per square foot. This cost estimate
is based on a 1,500-square-foot house of good-quality construction including a two-car garage and
central heating and air conditioning. The total construction costs excluding land costs are estimated at
approximately $192,200, which is nearly $70,000 more than the 2013 median home sales price in the
county.
If labor or material costs increased substantially, the cost of construction in Yreka could rise to a level
that impacts the price of new construction and rehabilitation. Therefore, increased construction costs
have the potential to constrain new housing construction and rehabilitation of existing housing.
Availability of Financing
The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a house affects the
amount of affordably priced housing in Yreka. Fluctuating interest rates can eliminate many potential
homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing project that could have been developed at
lower interest rates infeasible. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has been true
when interest rates increase. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic growth in alternative
mortgage products, including graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types of loans
allow homeowners to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and to qualify for larger home loans.
However, variable rate mortgages are not ideal for low- and moderate-income households that live on
tight budgets. In addition, the availability of variable rate mortgages has declined in the last few years due
to greater regulation of housing lending markets. Variable rate mortgages may allow lower-income
households to enter into homeownership, but there is a definite risk of monthly housing costs rising
above the financial means of that household. Therefore, the fixed interest rate mortgage remains the
preferred type of loan, especially during periods of low, stable interest rates. Table A-44 illustrates
interest rates as of May 2013. The table present both the interest rate and annual percentage rate (APR)
for different types of home loans. The interest rate is the percentage of an amount of money which is
paid for its use for a specified time, and the APR is the yearly percentage rate that expresses the total
finance charge on a loan over its entire term. The APR includes the interest rate, fees, points, and
mortgage insurance and is therefore a more complete measure of a loan's cost than the interest rate
alone. However, the loan's interest rate, not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and
interest payment.

HOUSING RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Yreka currently has seven affordable multi-family projects. These are listed in Table A-45. Three of the
projects are subsidized through HUD and two are subsidized through the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Rural Development Agency. HUD currently provides “project-based” subsidies in Yreka
through its Section 8 and Section 202 programs, and USDA Rural Development provides subsidies
through its Section 515 program. The remaining two projects receive indirect government subsidies
through participation in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program administered through
HUD. Although not a direct federal subsidy, LIHTC provides tax incentives for the utilization of private
equity in the development of affordable housing.

ANALYSIS OF ASSISTED HOUSING PROJECTS AT RISK
In 1989, the California Government Code was amended to include a requirement that jurisdictions
identify and develop a program in their housing elements for the preservation of assisted, affordable
multi-family units. Subsequent amendments have clarified the scope of the analysis to include units
developed pursuant to inclusionary housing and density bonus programs. In the preservation analysis,
localities are required to provide an inventory of assisted, affordable units that are eligible to convert
within ten years of the beginning of the housing element planning period. In the City of Yreka there are
currently 46 units in the Shadows Garden Apartments at risk of conversion to market rates during the
2014–2019 planning period.
                                                                A-39

Loss of Assisted Housing
Affordability covenants and deed restrictions are typically used to maintain the affordability of publicly
assisted housing, ensuring that these units are available to lower-income households in the long term.
Over time, the City may face the risk of losing some of its affordable units due to the expiration of
covenants and deed restrictions. If market rents continue to increase, property owners may be inclined
to discontinue public subsidies and convert the assisted units to market-rate housing.
Risk was assessed based on information from the California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC),
HUD, the California Low Income Tax Credit Committee staff, and information provided by the
property managers of some properties. CHPC data indicates the federally assisted 46-unit The Shadows
Garden Apartments is potentially at risk of conversion to market-rate housing when affordability
controls expire in 2014. The Shadows Garden Apartments project is considered at risk, which indicates
that a property may convert to market rate within five years. Moderate risk is assigned to projects
expected to expire within ten years of the start of the planning period (June 30, 2014). Low risk
indicates that a property cannot convert to market rate for at least ten years. Although projects with
agreements expiring within ten years of the beginning of the planning period are required by law to be
listed, these units may not actually convert.
Although the Shadows Garden Apartments’ affordability status may expire within the next few years, the
property is considered to be at low risk of conversion because the project is owned by a nonprofit
organization and funded under a federal program with no prepayment option. Nonprofit owners have a
public purpose to develop, own, and maintain affordable housing. They have no or little incentive to
remove current rental restrictions by terminating their Section 8 contracts or prepaying their
mortgages. Some owners may prepay their mortgages in order to bring new capital into their projects.
However, they are unlikely to opt out of their Section 8 contracts. Further, a representative from the
company that owns the Shadows Garden Apartments, the Michaels Organization, noted that they intend
to maintain their affordability status and will apply for renewal as soon as to the option to renew is
available.
The following is an analysis of the preservation and replacement options of the Shadows Garden
Apartments affordable housing project if the current owners are unable to maintain the property’s
affordability status.
Preservation and Replacement Options
Overview
To maintain the existing affordable housing stock, the City can work to preserve the existing assisted
units or facilitate the development of new units. Depending on the circumstances of at-risk projects,
different options may be used to preserve or replace the units. Preservation options typically include (1)
transfer of project to nonprofit ownership; (2) provision of rental assistance to tenants using non-federal
funding sources; and (3) purchase of affordability covenants. In terms of replacement, the most direct
option is the development of new assisted multi-family housing units. These options are described
below.
                                                   A-40

 Transfer of Ownership
 Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a nonprofit housing provider is generally one of the least
 costly ways to ensure that at-risk units remain affordable for the long term. By transferring property
 ownership to a nonprofit organization, low-income restrictions can be secured indefinitely and the
 project would become potentially eligible for a greater range of governmental assistance. Although the
 Shadows Garden Apartments complex is already owned by a nonprofit corporation, it could potentially
 be acquired by another nonprofit agency to maintain the affordability of units.
 The current market value of the project was estimated using information from multi-family sales listings
 in Yreka. The average cost to purchase a multi-family development was $78 per square foot. The
 average size of a unit was 730 square feet, and the average cost to buy a unit was $56,690. There are 46
 units at risk of converting to market rate within ten years in the city. If these were purchased, the
 estimated cost of acquiring these would be $2,607,740.
 Rental Assistance
 Rental subsidies using non-federal (state, local, or other) funding sources can be used to maintain
 affordability of the 46 at-risk affordable units. These rent subsidies can be structured to mirror the
 federal Section 8 program. Under Section 8, HUD pays the difference between what tenants can pay
 (defined as 30 percent of household income) and what HUD estimates as the fair market rent (FMR) on
 the unit. In Siskiyou County, the 2013 fair market rent is determined to be $629 for a one-bedroom
 unit, $803 for a two-bedroom unit, and $1,171 for a three-bedroom unit (the three types of units in the
 Shadows Garden Apartments project).
 The feasibility of this alternative is highly dependent on the availability of other funding sources
 necessary to make rent subsidies available and the willingness of property owners to accept rental
 vouchers if they can be provided. As indicated in Table A-46, the total cost of subsidizing the rents for
 all 46 at-risk units is estimated at $17,098 per month or $205,176 annually.

Purchase of Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an incentive package to the
owners to maintain the projects as affordable housing. Incentives could include supplementing the
Section 8 subsidy received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether the
complex is too highly leveraged. By providing lump sum financial incentives the City can ensure that
some or all of the units remain affordable.
Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new affordable housing units is a means of replacing the at-risk units should they be
converted to market-rate units. The cost of developing housing depends on a variety of factors,
including density, size of the units (i.e., square footage and number of bedrooms), location, land costs,
and type of construction. Assuming an average construction cost of $220,830 per unit, it would cost
over $12.3 million to construct 56 new assisted units. 1 Including land costs, the total costs to develop
replacement units will be significantly higher.
Cost Comparisons
The above analysis attempts to estimate the cost of preserving the at-risk units under various options.
The cost of acquiring the Shadows Garden Apartments project and transferring ownership to another
nonprofit organization is high ($2.6 million). In comparison, the annual costs of providing rental subsidies
required to preserve the 56 assisted units are relatively low ($205,176). However, long-term
affordability of the units cannot be ensured in this manner. The option of constructing 46 replacement
units is very high ($12.3 million, including land costs) and constrained by a variety of factors, including
land costs and potential community opposition. The best option to preserve the at-risk units appears to
be the purchase of affordability covenants.
Resources for Preserving Assisted Rental Housing
Organizations
The preservation of affordable rental housing at risk of conversion to market-rate housing can be
assisted by nonprofit organizations with the capacity and interest in acquiring, managing, and
permanently preserving such housing. HCD maintains a list of such interested nonprofit organizations.
Several have expressed an interest in preserving affordable rental housing in Yreka. These organizations
include:

Rehabilitation Program
The City’s rehabilitation loan program is currently funded by a revolving loan account (RLA). The City
applied for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds in the past that were used to give
rehabilitation loans. As repayments of these loans are received, the money is put back in to a loan
account for new applicants. Loans are made to households in target income groups (TIGs) and can be
used for structural rehabilitation, room additions to relieve overcrowding, and total reconstructions.
Interest rates for owner-occupied units are usually set at 3 percent but can be as low as 0 percent for
very low-income households, and the life of the loan can be up to 30 years. Seven households were
assisted between 2008 and 2012. The revolving fund is still in existence. The City has interest in using
the funds to provide accessible housing for those with disabilities.
Housing Authority
The State of California does not own or operate public housing; public housing is administered directly
through local public housing authorities. However, for those jurisdictions that do not have a local public
housing authority, HCD has a Housing Assistance Program that administers the Section 8 program in
those counties.
The Shasta County Housing Authority administers the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program for
Siskiyou County and its jurisdictions. The program provides a voucher to recipients to use to help pay
their rent for any rental unit that accepts the voucher. The recipients pay part of the rent based on 30
percent of their income, and the Section 8 program pays the remaining amount. Shasta County
administers a total of 195 vouchers throughout Siskiyou County and 61 in Yreka. An additional 126
applicants are on the City of Yreka Housing Choice Voucher waiting list.
The Karuk Tribe, which owns land in Yreka, operates its own housing authority. The Karuk Tribe
Housing Authority (KTHA) owns and operates single-family and multi-family housing that is available to
low- and moderate-income Native Americans. Further, the KTHA administers 15 housing vouchers,
which KTHA makes available to the elderly and disabled.
FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS
Pursuant to the California Government Code Section 65584, HCD has developed a Regional Housing
Need Allocation (RHNA) Plan for Siskiyou County. The RHNA Plan identifies a need for 530 new
residential units in Siskiyou County over a five-year period (2014 to 2019). The need for 530 units is
shared and distributed among each of the communities in the county, with each community’s share
determined by its proportion of the county’s overall household population. Thus, the City of Yreka’s
share of regional housing needs is 103 units, or about 21 units per year over the five-year period. In an
attempt to provide housing for all income groups in the city, these 103 units are further divided among
the various income groups identified and defined in Table A-47.

ANNEXATIONS
Minor annexation activity occurred during the previous planning period:
     •   In 2009, an approximately .39-acre parcel was annexed into the city limits of Yreka with a
         General Plan designation of LDR (Low Density Residential).
     •   In 2009, an approximately 2.5-acre parcel was annexed into the city limits of Yreka with a
         General Plan designation of I (Industrial). The annexed parcel was prezoned as M-2 (Heavy
         Industrial).
     •   In 2010, an approximately .52-acre strip of land with the General Plan designation I (Industrial)
         was de-annexed from the city limits of Yreka to the Karuk Tribe of California.
Prior to the annexations listed above, the most recent City-approved annexation occurred in 1997.
VACANT LAND INVENTORY
Table A-48 lists the available vacant land in the city that is appropriate to meet Yreka’s share of the
regional housing needs. As noted in Table A-48, there are a total of 122 acres of R-3 (R-3-12 and R-3-
16) zoned land with the potential to result in 1,267 units; 61 acres of R-2 zoned land with the potential
to result in 511 units; 1,200 acres of R-1 zoned land with the potential to result in 1,987 units; 535 acres
of R-A zoned lands with the potential to result in 184 units; and 3 acres of RPO zoned land with the
potential to result in 28 units.
Some of the sites listed in Table A-48 identify constraints to development. Some constraints are
associated with 100-year floodplains, hillside topography, access, special-status species, and/or parcel sizes
that are too small to develop without boundary line adjustments or mergers with adjacent parcels.
Constraints affecting density yield are reflected in the projected realistic capacity identified in Table A-48.
Based on recent development activity in the city, a net density of 85 percent of the maximum density
was assumed for most of the multi-family zoned parcels, and a net density of 50–80 percent (average 65
percent) of the maximum density was assumed for most of the single-family zoned parcels. Examples of
recent multi-family projects that were developed or approved with a similar capacity are the Shasta
Courtyards apartment complex and the Emerald Point Apartments. In the case of Shasta Courtyards, a
total of 61 units were built on 5.4 acres, for a maximum density of 11.3 dwelling units per acre and an
                                                            A-44

87 percent buildout. Emerald Point Apartments developed with 81 units on 6.11 acres, for a maximum
density of 13.3 units per acre and 100 percent buildout. There are very few large single-family residential
subdivisions in Yreka with which to estimate buildout densities. The most recent single-family residential
subdivision that was approved in Yreka is the Liberty Hills Subdivision. This subdivision, which is situated
on slopes of 12–22 percent, was approved for 16 units on 5.07 acres (including roads), for a maximum
density of 3.2 dwelling units per acre and a 53 percent buildout.
In those cases where steeper slopes and/or other constraints exist, the realistic capacity of the parcels
has been reduced accordingly. For example, the vacant RA zoned lands located north and east of
Interstate 5 and State Route 3 are severely limited by steep slopes and Yreka phlox, a rare and
endangered plant. It is estimated that this area and a small portion of RA land on steep slopes in
southwest Yreka account for roughly 450 acres of the 536 acres zoned RA. Density on this acreage has
typically been estimated to not exceed .20 units per acre (1 unit/5 acres). Similarly, the largest block of
R-1 zoned land on the east side of Interstate 5 and adjacent to the easterly city limits is estimated to
contain 350 acres and is very steep (30 percent slopes and greater). Further, an estimated 300 acres
scattered along the westerly city boundary also contain steep slopes, typically in excess of 20 percent.
Density yield on this acreage is not expected to exceed .20 units per acre. All remaining lands zoned for
single- or multi-family development are located on lands with slopes typically ranging from 0 to 15
percent. The density yields on these lands will not be significantly affected by topography.
Affordable housing is permitted in a variety of residential zone districts. However, most affordable
projects will occur in the R-3 zone since it permits higher densities and fits projects that are supported
by government assistance. As noted above, there are a total of 122 acres of R-3 (R-3-12 and R-3-16)
zoned lands with the potential to result in 1,267 units.
Public sewer and water service is readily available within 100 feet of most of the vacant lands identified
in Table A-48. Water supply and sewage treatment capacity is more than adequate to serve the
projected growth for the next five years and well beyond. The City’s 2010–2012 Urban Water
Management Plan (UWMP) reports that even with an increase of 398 residential units by 2020 (a nearly
400 percent more aggressive estimate over the RHNA of 103 units), the City will maintain a water
surplus of 5,349 acre-feet (AF) in a normal year and 4,478 AF in a single dry year. These assumptions do
not include non-residential growth. In other words, even with considerably more aggressive growth
assumptions than are present in the RHNA, Yreka is only expected to use 31 percent and 36 percent of
available water during a normal year and single dry year, respectively. The UWMP also notes that the
City’s wastewater treatment facility has the capacity to treat 1.3 million gallons per day, or 1,487 AF per
year. Utilizing the same aggressive growth rate used to project water use, the UWMP anticipates 786 AF
per year of collected and treated wastewater in 2020, which is approximately 53 percent of total
capacity.

   Due to the availability of vacant, residentially zoned property, it is unnecessary for the City to consider
   the rezoning of vacant nonresidentially zoned land or the redevelopment of properties in order to
   generate adequate sites for new housing development. The sites identified in Table A-48 can support
   the development of housing in excess of the City’s share of the 2007–2014 regional housing needs as
   estimated by HCD. Therefore, it can be conclusively stated that the City has adequate appropriately
   zoned sites, with supporting public services and facilities, to accommodate its housing needs over the
   current planning period.
   FUNDING SOURCES
   Many types of funding are available to the City and local nonprofit organizations to ensure the availability
   of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income persons. Appendix B lists the grant and loan
   options the City or other agencies can apply for to fund services for residents of Yreka. There are
   programs to help fund the development of multi-family rental housing, supportive housing, homeless
   shelters and transitional housing, first-time homebuyer and rehabilitation programs, second mortgages,
   and self-help housing.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Opportunities for energy conservation can be found for both existing and future housing developments.
Conservation can be achieved through a variety of approaches, including reducing the use of energy-
consuming appliances and features in a home, physical modification of existing structures or land uses,
and reducing the reliance on automobiles by encouraging more mixed-use and infill development and
providing pedestrian access to commercial and recreational facilities.
Some energy conservation features are incorporated into the design of residential structures in Yreka
due to the requirements of Title 24, which outlines measures to reduce energy consumption. These
measures include low-flow plumbing fixtures, efficient heating and cooling opportunities, dual-pane
windows, and adequate insulation and weatherstripping. Incorporating new technology in residential
developments offers developers a chance to design projects that allow for maximum energy
conservation opportunities. Although energy regulations establish a uniform standard of energy
efficiency, they do not ensure that all available conservation features are incorporated into building
design. Additional measures may further reduce heating, cooling, and lighting loads and overall energy
consumption. While it is not feasible that all possible conservation features be included in every
development, there are often a number of economically feasible measures that may result in savings in
excess of the minimum required by Title 24.
Constructing new homes with energy-conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing structures,
will result in a reduction in monthly utility costs. There are many ways to determine how energy
efficient an existing building is and, if needed, what improvements can be made. Many modern building
design methods are used to reduce residential energy consumption and are based on proven techniques.
These methods can be categorized in three ways:
     1. Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out during
         the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven building
         techniques in this category include:
         •   Location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar gain
             in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter.
         •   Use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that
             absorb heat during the day and release heat at night.
         •   Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange between
             the interior of a home and the exterior.
         •   Location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural air
             flow.
         •   Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during
             the summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
         •   Zone heating and cooling systems, which reduce heating and cooling in the unused areas of
             a home.
     2. Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
         Examples include:
                                                    A-52

         •   North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling.
         •   Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces.
         •   Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
    3. Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
         •   Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home.
         •   Use of natural or artificial flowing water.
         •   Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to these naturally based techniques, modern methods include:
    •    Use of solar energy to heat water.
    •    Use of radiant barriers on roofs to keep attics cool.
    •    Use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity.
    •    High efficiency coating on windows to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth.
    •    Weather stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss.
    •    Use of natural gas for dryers, stovetops, and ranges.
    •    Use of energy-efficient home appliances.
    •    Use of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators to reduce hot water use.
Major opportunities for residential energy conservation in the city will include insulation and
weatherproofing, landscaping and maximizing orientation, lowering appliance consumption, and
maximizing solar energy.
The State of California offers numerous programs to assist residents with energy efficiency upgrades and
renewable energy resources. Many of the programs include special financing and extended subsidies for
affordable housing. Siskiyou County residents are eligible for several of these programs, including the
California Solar Initiative, New Solar Homes Partnership, and Energy Upgrade California.
The following policies and programs relate to the City’s opportunities for energy conservation:
    •    Policy HE.6.1. Promote the use of energy conservation measures in all housing, including very
         low-, low-, and moderate-income housing.
    •    Program HE.6.1.1: Promote the use of energy conservation measures in all housing through the
         use of public and private weatherization programs. Provide information on currently available
         weatherization and energy conservation programs to residents of the city. The City will have
         information available for the public at the front counter of City Hall and will distribute
         information through an annual mailing.
    •    Program HE.6.1.2: Continue to enforce state requirements, including Title 24 of the California
         Code of Regulations, for energy conservation in new residential projects and encourage
         residential developers to employ additional energy conservation measures for the siting of
         buildings, landscaping, and solar access through development standards contained in the Zoning
         Ordinance, Building Code, and Specific Plans as appropriate.

   APPENDIX C
GLOSSARY OF TERMS

APPENDIX C – GLOSSARY OF TERMS
The following definitions are for commonly used terms in a housing element:
Above Moderate-Income: Above moderate-income households are defined as households with
incomes over 120 percent of the county median.
Accessible Units: Indicates certain units or all units in the property are wheelchair accessible or can
be made wheelchair accessible. Accessible units also may include those that are accessible to people
with sensory impairments or can be made accessible for people with sensory impairments.
Affordability: Annual cost of housing includes mortgage, principal, and interest payments as amortized
over 25 years with a 25 percent down payment or gross rent that does not exceed 30 percent of gross
annual household income or 30 percent of gross annual income devoted to rental housing, including
utilities are defined as "affordable."
Affordability Covenant: A property title agreement that places resale or rental restrictions on a
housing unit; also known as a deed restriction.
Affordable Housing: The relationship between the price of housing in a region (either sale price or
rent) and household income. Affordable housing is that which is affordable to households of very low,
low, and moderate incomes. For housing to be affordable, shelter costs must not exceed 30 percent of
the gross annual income of the household.
Assisted Housing: A unit that rents or sells for less than the prevailing market rate due to
governmental monetary intervention or contribution. The terms “assisted” and “subsidized” are often
used interchangeably.
At-Risk Housing: Applies to existing subsidized affordable rental housing units, especially federally
subsidized developments, that are threatened with conversion to market rents because of termination
of use restrictions, due to expiration or non-renewal of subsidy arrangements.
Below Market Rate (BMR) Unit: A housing unit that sells or rents for less than the going market
rate. It is typically used in reference to housing units that are directly or indirectly subsidized or have
other restrictions in order to make them affordable to very low-, low-, or moderate-income
households.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): The State CDBG program was established by
the federal Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC 5301, et seq.). The
primary federal objective of the CDBG program is the development of viable urban communities by
providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities,
principally for persons of low and moderate income. "Persons of low and moderate income," or the
"targeted income group" (TIG), are defined as families, households, and individuals whose incomes do
not exceed 80 percent of the county median income, with adjustments for family or household size.
Condominium: A building or group of buildings in which units are owned individually, but the
structure, common areas, and facilities are owned by all owners on a proportional, undivided basis.
                                                    C-1

Continuum of Care: An approach that helps communities plan for and provide a full range of
emergency, transitional, and permanent housing and service resources to address the various needs of
homeless persons at the point in time that they need them. The approach is based on the understanding
that homelessness is not caused merely by a lack of shelter, but involves a variety of underlying, unmet
needs—physical, economic, and social. Designed to encourage localities to develop a coordinated and
comprehensive long-term approach to homelessness, the Continuum of Care consolidates the planning,
application, and reporting documents for the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
Shelter Plus Care, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single-Room Occupancy Dwellings (SRO) Program,
and Supportive Housing Program (US House Bill 2163).
Cost Burden: A household has a "housing cost burden" if it spends 30 percent or more of its income
on housing costs. A household has a "severe housing cost burden" if it spends 50 percent or more of its
income on housing. Owner housing costs consist of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts
to purchase, or similar debts on the property; real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the
property; utilities; and fuels. Where applicable, owner costs also include monthly condominium fees.
Renter calculations use gross rent, which is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of
utilities (electricity, gas, water, and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid by
the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Household income is the total pre-tax income of
the householder and all other individuals at least 15 years old in the household. In all estimates of
housing cost burdens, owners and renters for whom housing cost-to-income was not computed are
excluded from the calculations.
Decennial Census: Every ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a national household survey,
producing the richest source of nationally available small-area data. Article I of the Constitution requires
that a census be taken every ten years for the purpose of reapportioning the US House of
Representatives. The federal government uses decennial census data for apportioning congressional
seats, for identifying distressed areas, and for many other activities. Census data is collected using two
survey forms: the short form and the long form. Short form information is collected on every person
and includes basic characteristics, such as age, sex, and race. The long form is sent to one out of every
six households and collects more detailed information, such as income, housing characteristics, and
employment. Most of the indicators in DataPlace are from the long form and are thus estimates based
on the sample of households. These values may differ considerably from the same indicators based on
the short form data, particularly for small areas.
Density: The number of housing units on a unit of land (e.g., 10 units per acre).
Density Bonus Programs: Allows minimum density increase over the zoned maximum density of a
proposed residential development, if the developer makes a specified amount of units affordable to
lower-income households.
Development Impact Fees: A fee or charge imposed on developers to pay for a jurisdiction’s costs
of providing services to new development.
Development Right: The right granted to a landowner or other authorized party to improve a
property. Such right is usually expressed in terms of a use and intensity allowed under existing zoning
regulation.
                                                      C-2

Disability: A long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult
for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering.
This condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a
job or business.
Down Payment Assistance: The most popular loans for these programs are with the Federal
Housing Administration (FHA). The FHA allows 100 percent gift funds for a down payment and some
allowable closing costs. The gift can be from any relative or can be collected through charitable
organizations like Neighborhood Gold/The Buyer Fund. Another popular tactic, which can be used in a
broader range of loan programs, is to borrow from a 401K. A withdrawal can be made without a
penalty and paid back over a specified period.
Dwelling Unit: Any residential structure, whether or not attached to real property, including
condominium and cooperative units and mobile or manufactured homes. Includes both one-to-four-
family and multi-family structures. Vacation or second homes and rental properties are also included.
Elderly Units: Specific units in a development restricted to residents over a certain age (as young as 55
years and over). Persons with disabilities may share certain developments with the elderly.
Element: A division or chapter of the general plan, master plan, or comprehensive plan.
Emergency Shelter: A facility designed to provide free temporary housing on a night-by-night basis to
homeless families and individuals.
Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG): A grant program administered by the US Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided on a formula basis to large entitlement jurisdictions.
Extremely Low-Income Limit: The upper limit for the extremely low-income category, set at 30
percent of the HUD area median family income. This is not an official program eligibility income limit,
except when associated with a specific family size (e.g., "single person," "family of two," "family of three,"
etc.).
Fair Market Rent (FMR): Freely set rental rates defined by HUD as the median gross rents charged
for available standard units in a county or Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). Fair Market
Rents are used for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program and other HUD programs and are
published annually by HUD.
Family Income: In decennial census data, family income includes the incomes of all household
members 15 years old and over related to the householder. Although the family income statistics from
each census cover the preceding calendar year, the characteristics of individuals and the composition of
families refer to the time of enumeration (April 1 of the respective census years). Thus, the income of
the family does not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the family during all
or part of the calendar year prior to the census if these individuals no longer resided with the family at
the time of census enumeration. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did not reside
with the family during the calendar year prior to the census but who were members of the family at the
time of enumeration are included. However, the composition of most families was the same during the
preceding calendar year as at the time of enumeration.
                                                    C-3
Farm Labor Housing (Farmworker): Units for migrant farmworkers that can be available for
transitional housing for the homeless when not occupied by migrant farmworkers.
FHA-Insured: The Federal Housing Administration–insured mortgages so that lower- and moderate-
income people can obtain financing for homeownership.
First-Time Homebuyer: A first-time homebuyer program provides low-income first-time
homebuyers down-payment assistance in the form of a second mortgage loan to serve as "gap financing."
These loans can be up to $40,000, depending on the amount of assistance required by the individual
homebuyer.
General Plan: A legal document, adopted by the legislative body of a city or county, setting forth
policies regarding long-term development.
Group Quarters: A facility which houses groups of unrelated persons not living in households such as
dormitories, institutions, and prisons.
Habitable (room): A space in a structure for living, sleeping, eating, or cooking. Bathrooms, toilet
compartments, closets, storage or utility space, and similar areas are not considered habitable space.
Habitat for Humanity: A nonprofit, ecumenical Christian housing ministry that seeks to eliminate
poverty housing and homelessness from the world and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience
and action. Through volunteer labor and donations of money and materials, Habitat builds and
rehabilitates simple, decent houses with the help of the homeowner (partner) families. Habitat houses
are sold to partner families at no profit, financed with affordable, no-interest loans. The homeowners'
monthly mortgage payments are used to build still more Habitat houses.
Hispanic or Latino: In decennial census data, Hispanics or Latinos are those who classify themselves in
one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the census questionnaire—‘‘Mexican,’’ ‘‘Puerto
Rican,’’ or ‘‘Cuban”—as well as those who indicate that they are ‘‘other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino.’’
People who do not identify with one of the specific origins listed on the questionnaire but indicate that
they are ‘‘other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino’’ are those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-
speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people identifying
themselves generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on. People who are
Hispanic or Latino may be of any race. There were two important changes to the Hispanic origin
question for Census 2000. First, the sequence of the race and Hispanic origin questions for Census 2000
differs from that in 1990; in 1990, the race question preceded the Hispanic origin question. Second,
there was an instruction preceding the Hispanic origin question in 2000 indicating that respondents
should answer both the Hispanic origin and the race questions. This instruction was added to give
emphasis to the distinct concepts of the Hispanic origin and race questions and to emphasize the need
for both pieces of information.
Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME): HOME provides formula grants to states and
localities that communities use—often in partnership with local nonprofit groups—to fund a wide range
of activities that build, buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or homeownership or provide
direct rental assistance to low-income people.
                                                       C-4

Homeless Person: An individual living outside or in a building not meant for human habitation, or
which they have no legal right to occupy, in an emergency shelter, or in a temporary housing program
which may include a transitional and supportive housing program if habitation time limits exist. This
definition includes substance abusers, mentally ill people, and sex offenders who are homeless (US
House Bill 2163).
Household: A household is made up of all persons living in a dwelling unit whether or not they are
related by blood, birth, or marriage
Housing Authority: An organization established under state law to provide housing for low- and
moderate-income persons. Commissioners are appointed by the local governing body of the jurisdiction
in which they operate. Many housing authorities own their own housing or operate public housing
funded by HUD.
Housing Choice Voucher Program: Formerly known as Section 8, a subsidy program funded by the
federal government and overseen by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development to provide low rents and/or housing payment contributions for very low- and low-income
households.
HUD: The US Department of Housing and Urban Development is cabinet-level department of the
federal government that oversees program and funding for affordable housing laws, development, and
federally funded financial assistance.
HUD Area Median Family Income: HUD is required by law to set income limits that determine the
eligibility of applicants for HUD's assisted housing programs. Income limits are calculated annually for
metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan counties in the United States. They are based on HUD
estimates of median family income, with adjustments for family size. Adjustments are also made for areas
that have unusually high or low income to housing cost relationships.
Income Categories: The federal and state governments require that local jurisdictions consider the
housing needs of households in various "income categories." Income categories are determined by the
median household income at the local level.
Large Family or Household: A household or family with five or more members.
Low-Income Housing: Housing that is made available at prices lower than market rates. These lower
prices are achieved through various financial mechanisms employed by state and local government
authorities.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC): An indirect federal subsidy used to finance the
development of affordable rental housing for low-income households. The LIHTC program may seem
complicated, but many local housing and community development agencies are effectively using these tax
credits to increase the supply of affordable housing in their communities.
Low-Income Limit: Low-income households are defined as households with incomes between 50
percent and 80 percent of the area median household income.
Manufactured Home: Housing that is constructed of manufactured components, assembled partly at
the site rather than totally at the site. Also referred to as modular housing.
                                                      C-5
Market-Rate Housing: Housing that is not built or maintained with the help of government subsidy.
The prices of market-rate homes are determined by the market and are subject to the laws of supply
and demand.
McKinney-Vento Act: The primary federal response targeted to assisting homeless individuals and
families. The scope of the act includes outreach, emergency food and shelter, transitional and permanent
housing, primary health care services, mental health, alcohol and drug abuse treatment, education, job
training, and child care. There are nine titles under the McKinney-Vento Act that are administered by
several different federal agencies, including HUD. McKinney-Vento Act programs administered by HUD
include the Emergency Shelter Grant Program Supportive Housing Program, Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation for Single-Room Occupancy Dwellings, Supplemental Assistance to Facilities to Assist the
Homeless, and Single Family Property Disposition Initiative (US House Bill 2163).
Median Income: Each year, the federal government calculates the median income for communities
across the country to use as guidelines for federal housing programs. Area median incomes are set
according to family size.
Mental Illness: A serious and persistent mental or emotional impairment that significantly limits a
person’s ability to live independently.
Mixed Use: Refers to different types of development (e.g., residential, retail, office) occurring on the
same lot or in close proximity to each other. Cities and counties sometimes allow mixed use in
commercial zones, with housing typically located above primary commercial uses on the premises.
Mobile Home: A type of manufactured housing. A structure movable in one or more sections, which
is at least 8 feet in width and 32 feet in length, is built on a permanent chassis, and is designed to be used
as a dwelling unit when connected to the required utilities, either with or without a permanent
foundation.
Mobile Home Park: A parcel or tract of land having as its principal use the rental, leasing, or
occupancy of space by two or more mobile homes on a permanent or semipermanent basis, including
accessory buildings, or uses customarily incidental thereto.
Mobile Home Subdivision: A subdivision of land, platted in conformance to NRS Chapter 278 and
applicable city ordinances, for the purpose of providing mobile home lots.
Moderate Income: Moderate-income households are defined as households with incomes between 80
percent and 120 percent of the county median.
Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCC): A Federal Income Tax Credit Program. An MCC
increases the loan amount an applicant can qualify for and increases an applicant's take-home pay. The
MCC entitles applicants to take a federal income tax credit of 20 percent of the annual interest they pay
on their home mortgage. Because the MCC reduces an applicant's federal income taxes and increases
their net earnings, it helps homebuyers qualify for a first home mortgage. The MCC is registered with
the IRS, and it continues to decrease federal income taxes each year for as long as an applicant lives in
the home.
Mortgage Revenue Bond: A state, county, or city program providing financing for the development
of housing through the sale of tax-exempt bonds.
                                                        C-6

Multi-Family Dwelling: A structure containing two or more dwelling units for the use of individual
households; an apartment or condominium building is an example of this dwelling unit type.
Non-Hispanic: In decennial census data and in Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data after 2003, non-
Hispanics are those who indicate that they are not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.
Permanent Housing: Housing which is intended to be the tenant’s home for as long as they choose.
In the supportive housing model, services are available to the tenant, but accepting services cannot be
required of tenants or in any way impact their tenancy. Tenants of permanent housing sign legal lease
documents (US House Bill 2163).
Permanent Supportive Housing: Long-term community-based housing and supportive services for
homeless persons with disabilities. The intent of this type of supportive housing is to enable this special
needs population to live as independently as possible in a permanent setting. The supportive services
may be provided by the organization managing the housing or provided by other public or private
service agencies. There is no definite length of stay (US House Bill 2163).
Persons with a Disability: HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher (formerly Section 8) program defines a
“person with a disability” as a person who is determined to (1) have a physical, mental, or emotional
impairment that is expected to be of continued and indefinite duration, substantially impedes his or her
ability to live independently, and is of such a nature that the ability could be improved by more suitable
housing conditions; or (2) have a developmental disability, as defined in the Developmental Disabilities
Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (US House Bill 2163).
Project-Based Rental Assistance: Rental assistance provided for a project, not for a specific tenant.
A tenant receiving project-based rental assistance gives up the right to that assistance upon moving from
the project.
Public Housing: The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers federal
aid to local housing agencies that manage the housing for low-income residents at rents they can afford.
HUD furnishes technical and professional assistance in planning, developing, and managing these
developments. It provides decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, the elderly,
and persons with disabilities. Public housing can be in the form of high-rise apartments or scattered-site
single-family homes.
Rehabilitation: The upgrading of a building previously in a dilapidated or substandard condition for
human habitation.
Rental Assistance: A rental subsidy for eligible low- and very low-income tenants. This assistance
provides the share of the monthly rent that exceeds 30 percent of the tenants’ adjusted monthly
income.
Rent-to-Own: A development financed so that at a certain point in time, the rental units are available
for purchase based on certain restrictions and qualifications.
Rural Housing Service (RHA): A part of the US Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development.
The RHA offers financial aid to low-income residents of rural areas.
                                                     C-7

Second Units: Also referred to as "granny" or "in-law apartments." Second units provide a second
housing unit on the same lot as a single-family dwelling unit.
Section 8: Now known as the Housing Choice Voucher Program, a subsidy program funded by the
federal government and overseen by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development to provide low rents and/or housing payment contributions for very low- and low-income
households.
Service Needs: The particular services required by special populations, typically including needs such
as transportation, personal care, housekeeping, counseling, meals, case management, personal
emergency response, and other services preventing premature institutionalization and assisting
individuals to continue living independently.
Single-Room Occupancy Dwelling (SRO): The SRO program provides rental assistance for
homeless persons in connection with the moderate rehabilitation of SRO dwellings. SRO housing
contains units for occupancy by one person. These units may contain food preparation or sanitary
facilities, or both.
Special Needs Projects: Housing for a designated group of people who desire special
accommodations, such as services, in addition to housing. Services may or may not be provided as part
of the rental project. Examples of special needs populations are people with physical disabilities,
developmental disabilities, mental illness, or those who need assisted living. It also includes health care
facilities.
Subsidized Housing: Typically refers to housing that rents for less than the market rate due to a
direct financial contribution from the government. There are two general types of housing subsidies.
The first is most commonly referred to as “project-based” where the subsidy is linked with a particular
unit or development, and the other is known as “tenant-based” where the subsidy is linked to the low-
income individual or family. The terms “assisted” and “subsidized” are often used interchangeably.
Substandard Housing: Housing where major repair or replacement may be needed to make it
structurally sound, weatherproofed, and habitable.
Supportive Housing: Housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target
population, and that is linked to an on- or off-site service that assists the supportive housing resident in
retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and,
when possible, work in the community.
Supportive Services: Services provided to residents of supportive housing for the purpose of
facilitating the independence of residents. Some examples are case management, medical or
psychological counseling and supervision, child care, transportation, and job training.
Target Population: Persons with low incomes who have one or more disabilities, including mental
illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health condition, or individuals eligible for
services provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5
(commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may include, among other
populations, adults, emancipated minors, families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out
of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.
                                                     C-8

Transitional Housing: Buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under
program requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the assisted unit to
another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that is no less than six
months from the beginning of the assistance.
VA-Guaranteed: Loans made by private lenders to eligible veterans for the purchase of a home which
must be for their own personal occupancy. To get a loan, a veteran must apply to a lender. If the loan is
approved, the VA will guarantee a portion of it to the lender. This guaranty protects the lender against
loss up to the amount guaranteed and allows a veteran to obtain favorable financing terms.
Very Low-Income Limit: Very low-income households are defined as households with incomes less
than 50 percent of the area median household income.
Veteran: Anyone who has been discharged from the military generally after at least two years of
service whether they served on active duty in a conflict or not (US House Bill 2163).
Workforce Housing: Housing that is meant for residents making low, moderate, or above moderate
area median income. Some programs focus on employers providing assistance to their employees; some
are instituting inclusionary programs, while others give preference to this group in their homeownership
programs. Some jurisdictions have programs for specific segments of the workforce that are vital for the
everyday function of the community such as teachers, policemen, and other public employees.
Zoning: An activity under taken by local jurisdictions to direct and shape land development activities.
The intent of zoning is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring that incompatible
land uses (e.g., residential vs. heavy industrial) are not located next to each other. Zoning also impacts
land values, creating and taking away "capital" for and from property owners. For example, a lot that is
zoned for commercial development is more valuable (in financial terms) than a lot that is zoned for open
space. Typically, lots that are zoned for higher densities have greater value on the market than lots that
are zoned for lower densities. Zoning is one of the most important regulatory functions performed by
local jurisdictions.
US CENSUS TERMS
Children: The term “children,” as used in tables on living arrangements of children under 18, includes
all persons under 18 years, excluding people who maintain households, families, or subfamilies as a
reference person or spouse.
     Own Children: Sons and daughters, including stepchildren and adopted children, of the
     householder. Similarly, “own” children in a subfamily are sons and daughters of the married couple
     or parent in the subfamily. (All children shown as members of related subfamilies are own children
     of the person(s) maintaining the subfamily.) For each type of family unit identified in the CPS, the
     count of “own children under 18 year old” is limited to never-married children; however, “own
     children under 25”and “own children of any age,” as the terms are used, include all children
     regardless of marital status. The counts include never-married children living away from home in
     college dormitories.
                                                      C-9

    Related Children: Includes all people in a household under the age of 18, regardless of marital
    status, who are related to the householder. It does not include householder's spouse or foster
    children, regardless of age.
Ethnic Origin: People of Hispanic origin were identified by a question that asked for self-identification
of the persons’ origin or descent. Respondents were asked to select their origin (and the origin of other
household members) from a “flash card” listing ethnic origins. People of Hispanic origin, in particular,
were those who indicated that their origin was Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South
American, or some other Hispanic origin. It should be noted that people of Hispanic origin may be of
any race.
Family: A group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage,
or adoption.
    Family Household (Family): A family includes a householder and one or more people living in
    the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people
    in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A
    family household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not
    included as part of the householder's family in census tabulations. Thus, the number of family
    households is equal to the number of families, but family households may include more members
    than do families. A household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations. Not all
    households contain families since a household may comprise a group of unrelated people or one
    person living alone.
    Family Size: Refers to the number of people in a family.
    Family Type: Refers to how the members of a family are related to one another and the
    householder. Families may be a "Married Couple Family," "Single Parent Family," "Stepfamily," or
    "Subfamily."
Household: Includes all the people who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of residence.
    Household Income: The total income of all the persons living in a household. A household is
    usually described as very low income, low income, moderate income, and above moderate income
    based on household size and income, relative to regional median income.
    Household Size: The total number of people living in a housing unit.
    Household Type and Relationship: Households are classified by type according to the sex of the
    householder and the presence of relatives. Examples include married-couple family; male
    householder, no wife present; female householder, no husband present; spouse (husband/wife);
    child; and other relatives.
Householder: The person, or one of the people, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or
rented. If there is no such person present, any household member 15 years old and over can serve as
the householder for the purposes of the census. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family
householder and a non-family householder. A family householder is a householder living with one or
more people related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all people in
                                                  C-10

the household related to him are family members. A non-family householder is a householder living
alone or with non-relatives only.
Housing Unit: A house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room
occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters.
Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in
the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For
vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants
whenever possible.
Median: This measure represents the middle value (if n is odd) or the average of the two middle values
(if n is even) in an ordered list of data values. The median divides the total frequency distribution into
two equal parts: one-half of the cases fall below the median and one-half of the cases exceed the median.
Median Age: This measure divides the age distribution in a stated area into two equal parts: one-half of
the population falling below the median value and one-half above the median value.
Median Income: The median income divides the income distribution into two equal groups; one has
incomes above the median and the other having incomes below the median.
Occupied Housing Unit: A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the usual place of residence of
the person or group of people living in it at the time of enumeration, or if the occupants are only
temporarily absent; that is, away on vacation or a business trip. The occupants may be a single family,
one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated
people who share living quarters.
Overcrowded Units: Occupied housing units that have more than 1 person per room.
Per Capita Income: Average obtained by dividing aggregate income by total population of an area.
Population Estimate (Population Estimates Program): The Census Bureau's Population
Estimates Program (PEP) produces July 1 estimates for years after the last published decennial census, as
well as for past decades. Existing data series such as births, deaths, federal tax returns, Medicare
enrollment, and immigration are used to update the decennial census base counts. POP estimates are
used in federal funding allocations, in setting the levels of national surveys, and in monitoring recent
demographic changes.
Population Projections: Estimates of the population for future dates. They illustrate plausible courses
of future population change based on assumptions about future births, deaths, international migration,
and domestic migration. Projections are based on an estimated population consistent with the most
recent decennial census as enumerated. While projections and estimates may appear similar, there are
some distinct differences between the two measures. Estimates usually are for the past, while
projections typically are for future dates. Estimates generally use existing data, while projections must
assume what demographic trends will be in the future.
Poverty: Following the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Directive 14, the Census Bureau
uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to detect who is poor. If
the total income for a family or unrelated individual falls below the relevant poverty threshold, then the
family or unrelated individual is classified as being "below the poverty level."
                                                       C-11
Poverty Rate: The percentage of people (or families) who are below poverty.
Race: The race of individuals was identified by a question that asked for self-identification of the
person’s race. Respondents were asked to select their race from a “flashcard” listing racial groups.
Severely Overcrowded: Occupied housing units with 1.51 or more persons per room.
Single-Family Attached Housing: A one-unit residential structure that has one or more walls
extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. This category includes row
houses, townhouses, and houses attached to nonresidential structures.
Single-Family Detached Homes: A one-unit residential structure detached from any other house
(i.e., with open space on all four sides). A house is considered detached even if it has an adjoining shed
or garage.
Tenure: The distinction between owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units. A housing unit is
“owned” if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. A
cooperative or condominium unit is “owned” only if the owner or co-owner lives in it. All other
occupied units are classified as “rented,” including units rented for cash rent and those occupied without
payment of cash rent.
Two-Family Buildings: These dwellings may also be referred to as single-family attached because a
duplex with a shared wall would qualify in both categories. Other two-family buildings would include
older single-family homes that have been converted into two separate living spaces or “flats” that do not
share walls, but do share a floor/ceiling.
Unemployed: All civilians 16 years old and over are classified as unemployed if they (1) were neither
"at work" nor "with a job but not at work" during the reference week, and (2) were actively looking for
work during the last four weeks, and (3) were available to accept a job. Also included as unemployed are
civilians who did not work at all during the reference week, were waiting to be called back to a job from
which they had been laid off, and were available for work except for temporary illness.
Unemployment Rate: The proportion of the civilian labor force that is unemployed, expressed as a
percentage.
Units in Structure: A structure is a separate building that either has open spaces on all sides or is
separated from other structures by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the
number of units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and vacant, are counted.
Vacancy Rate: The housing vacancy rate is the proportion of the housing inventory that is available
‘‘for sale’’ or ‘‘for rent.’’ It is computed by dividing the number of available units by the sum of occupied
units and available units, and then multiplying by 100.
Vacant Housing Unit: A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of enumeration,
unless its occupants are only temporarily absent. Units temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration
entirely by people who have a usual residence elsewhere are also classified as vacant. New units not yet
occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior
windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are excluded from the
housing inventory if they are open to the elements; that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no
                                                        C-12

longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are
condemned or they are to be demolished.
White: In decennial census data, the White category includes persons having origins in any of the
original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race
as ‘‘White’’ or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.
The "alone" designation, as used with decennial census data, indicates that the person reported only one
