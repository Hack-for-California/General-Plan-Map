10 NOISE ELEMENT
   A. Introduction
   Noise is defined as a sound or series of sounds that are considered to be inva-
   sive, irritating, objectionable, and/or disruptive to the quality of daily life.
   Noise varies in range and volume and can originate from individual incidents
   such as construction equipment, sporadic disturbances, such as car horns or
   train whistles, or more constant irritants, such as traffic along major arterials.
   Section 65302(f) of the California Government Code requires that General
   Plans contain a Noise Element that can be used as a guide for establishing a
   pattern of land uses that minimizes the exposure of community residents to
   excessive noise. Local governments are required to analyze and quantify
   noise levels and the extent of noise exposure through field measurements or
   noise modeling, and implement measures and possible solutions to existing
   and foreseeable noise problems.
   This section describes the existing noise environment in Los Gatos and is di-
   vided into the following sections:

B. Noise Background and Terminology
The Town is generally characterized as a quiet, residential community. This
element identifies and evaluates unwanted noise sources in the Town, and
establishes goals and policies for reducing noise levels in the Town. Policies
aimed at reducing noise levels must address specific sources of unwanted
noise, as well as noise-sensitive receptors. Noise level generation, intensity,
and related impacts should be considered in determining the placement of
housing, open space areas and other noise-sensitive land uses.
The State of California Office of Planning and Research Noise Element
Guidelines (Guidelines) include recommended interior and exterior noise
level standards for local jurisdictions to identify and prevent the creation of
incompatible land uses due to noise. These Guidelines describe the compati-
bility of various land uses with a range of environmental noise levels in terms
of dBA CNEL, as explained in Table NOI-1.
According to the State, a noise environment of 50 dBA CNEL to 60 dBA
CNEL is considered to be “normally acceptable” for residential uses. There-
fore, locating residential units, parks, and institutions (such as churches,
schools, libraries, and hospitals) in areas where exterior ambient noise levels
exceed 65 dBA CNEL is undesirable. Additionally, more restrictive standards
for quiet suburban and rural communities may be reduced by 5 to 10 dB to
reflect their lower existing outdoor noise levels in comparison with urban
environments.
Title 25, Section 1092 of the California Code of Regulations also sets forth
requirements for the insulation of multiple-family residential dwelling units
from excessive and potentially harmful noise. Whenever multiple-family
residential dwelling units are proposed in areas with excessive noise exposure,
the developer must incorporate construction features into the building’s de-
sign that reduce interior noise levels to 45 dBA CNEL.
Figure NOI-1 illustrates the State guidelines established by the State Depart-
ment of Health Services for acceptable noise levels for each jurisdiction.

                     The unit for measuring the volume of sound equal to 10 times the
Decibel (dB)         logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the pressure of a measured
                     sound to a reference pressure (20 micropascals).
                     A sound measurement scale that adjusts the pressure of individual
A-Weighted
                     frequencies according to human sensitivities. The scale accounts
Decibel
                     for the fact that the region of highest sensitivity for the human
(dBA)
                     ear is between 2,000 and 4,000 cycles per second (hertz).

                     a.m.
                     The Ldn is a measure of the 24-hour average noise level at a given
                     location. It was adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection
                     Agency (EPA) for developing criteria for the evaluation of
                     community noise exposure. It is based on a measure of the
Day/Night
                     average noise level over a given time period called the Leq. The
Average (Ldn)
                     Ldn is calculated by averaging the Leq’s for each hour of the day at
                     a given location after penalizing the “sleeping hours” (defined as
                     10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) by 10 dBA to account for the increased
                     sensitivity of people to noises that occur at night.
                     The fast A-weighted noise levels equaled or exceeded by a

                     time period.

These standards and criteria are incorporated into the land use planning proc-
ess to reduce future noise and land use incompatibilities. This figure helps the
Town ensure integrated planning for compatibility between land uses and
outdoor noise.
1. Noise Descriptors
Various methods have been developed for evaluating community noise, in-
cluding: the variation of noise levels over time; the influence of periodic in-
dividual loud events; and the community response to changes in the commu-
nity noise environment. Table NOI-1 lists various methods to measure sound
over a period of time.
2. Health Effects
Human response to sound is highly individualized. Annoyance is the most
common issue regarding community noise. The percentage of people claim-
ing to be annoyed by noise generally increases with the environmental sound
level. However, many factors also influence people’s response to noise. The
factors can include the noise character, variability of the sound level, presence
of tones or impulses, and time of day of the occurrence.
Additionally, non-acoustical factors, such as a person’s opinion of the noise
source, ability to adapt to the noise, attitude toward the source and those
noises associated with it, and predictability of the noise, all influence a per-
son’s response. As such, response to noise varies widely from one person to
the next and with any particular noise, individual responses range from “not
annoyed” to “highly annoyed.” When the noise level of an activity rises
above 70 dBA, the chance of receiving a complaint is possible. The effects of
noise are often only transitory, but adverse effects can be cumulative with
prolonged or repeated exposure.
The effects of noise on the community can include:
  ♦ Noise-induced hearing loss       ♦ Interference with communication
  ♦ Sleep interference               ♦ Dissatisfaction, complaints, and stress
  ♦ Annoyance

C.     Noise Standards
Los Gatos has established outdoor noise limits, which represent long-range
community goals for different land use designations within the town. These
outdoor noise limits are shown in Table NOI-2. The Town of Los Gatos
Municipal Code describes when and how construction activities may occur,
with the goal of reducing any short-term impacts from construction noise.
D.     Sources of Existing Noise
1. Stationary Noise Sources
Commercial and industrial land uses located near residential areas currently
generate occasional noise impacts. The primary noise sources associated with
these facilities are delivery trucks, air compressors, generators, outdoor loud-
speakers and gas venting. Other significant stationary noise sources in the
town include construction activities, street sweepers, and gas-powered leaf
blowers. Airports, fire, police, hospitals, schools, and parks also generate
occasional stationary noise impacts. Most of the noise impacts from these
stationary sources are temporary and intermittent.
2. Non-Stationary Noise Sources
The noise environment in the Town is dominated by vehicular traffic, includ-
ing traffic-generated noise along State Routes 17 and 85 as well as along major
arterials. The major roadways that serve the Town and contribute to mobile
noise are Blossom Hill Road, Lark Avenue, Los Gatos/Saratoga Road, Los
Gatos Boulevard, and Winchester Boulevard.
3. Construction Noise
Typical activities associated with construction are highly noticeable tempo-
rary noise sources. Noise from construction activities are generated by two
primary sources: (1) the transport of workers and equipment to construction
sites; and (2) the noise related to active construction equipment. These noise
sources can be a nuisance to local residents and businesses or unbearable to
sensitive receptors.

E. Future Noise Contours
The noise environment in Los Gatos is not expected to significantly increase
as a result of the implementation of the 2020 General Plan. However, vehicu-
lar traffic noise, the dominant source throughout the town, would slightly
increase as a result of additional traffic within the town along local streets and
major through routes, including Highways 17 and 85. Sources of non-
transportation noise are not anticipated to substantially increase in the com-
munity with implementation of the Town’s Noise Ordinance and the follow-
ing goals, policies, and actions. Noise contours for projected conditions
within Los Gatos at 2020 General Plan buildout are provided in Figure
NOI-2 in terms of the Day-Night Average Level (Ldn).

F. Goals, Policies, and Actions
The following goal, policy, and action statements are intended to limit the
exposure of the community to excessive noise levels.
Goal NOI-1       To ensure that noise from new development and new
                 land uses does not adversely affect neighboring land
                 uses.
Policies
Policy NOI-1.1     The Town, as part of the Environmental Review process,
                   shall require applicants to submit an acoustical analysis of
                   projects. All input related to noise levels shall use the
                   adopted standard of measurement shown in Table NOI-2.
                   Noise impacts of new development shall be evaluated in
                   terms of any increase of the existing ambient noise levels
                   and the potential for adverse noise and groundborne vibra-
                   tions impacts on nearby or adjacent properties. The
                   evaluation shall consider short-term construction noise
                   and on-going operational noise.
Policy NOI-1.2     The Town shall maintain the noise ordinance standards.
Policy NOI-1.3     Employ the Ldn scale for the evaluation of outdoor noise
                   for residential land uses and the Leq scale for evaluation of
                   outdoor noise for non-residential uses, as shown in Table
                   NOI-2. Pursue the outdoor noise limits shown in Table
                   NOI-2 as representing the long range community aspira-
                   tions and work toward their accomplishment, even
                   though some may be presently unattainable.
Policy NOI-1.4     Apply the same indoor noise levels standards for single
                   family residential uses and multi-family dwellings.
                                                                           NOI-9

Actions
Action NOI-1.1       Adopt a procedure for reviewing the noise impacts of any
                     proposed development.
Action NOI-1.2       Establish significance criteria for evaluating increases in
                     ambient noise resulting from new development and evalu-
                     ating the compatibility of new development with the exist-
                     ing noise environment.
Goal NOI-2         To ensure that proposed development is not adversely
                   affected by existing noise levels.
Policies
Policy NOI-2.1       Evaluate the potential for existing ambient and/or intru-
                     sive noise to adversely affect new development.
Policy NOI-2.2       Require all noise-sensitive developments adjacent to or
                     within an area where noise levels exceed community aspi-
                     rations to include a noise study and recommendation for
                     reducing noise impact to an acceptable level.
Goal NOI-3         To ensure that roadway noise does not adversely af-
                   fect land uses.
Policies
Policy NOI-3.1       Roads constructed or improved by the Town of Los Gatos
                     shall meet Town of Los Gatos noise level standards or, in
                     some situations, the Los Gatos Noise Ordinance, to the
                     maximum extent feasible.
Policy NOI-3.2       The Town shall take a proactive stance in cooperating
                     with transportation agencies, including Caltrans and VTA,

                 to reduce noise from existing and future facilities. Noise
                 reduction strategies related to the design and location of all
                 facilities will be considered.
Policy NOI-3.3   Require that stringent noise control measures accompany
                 construction of new County, State, and federal roads and
                 highways, preferably by depressing them, but also by con-
                 structing sound walls and berms, by landscaping, and by
                 soliciting funds to modify existing noise-sensitive buildings
                 where appropriate.
Actions
Action NOI-3.1   Conduct a study to identify traffic improvements that
                 could be constructed or signal timing changes that could
                 be made to improve traffic flows without increasing speed
                 levels to reduce high noise levels created by traffic conges-
                 tion.
Action NOI-3.2   Periodically review traffic volumes and average speeds to
                 ensure maximum effectiveness in reducing noise levels, es-
                 pecially adjacent to residential areas.
Action NOI-3.3   Identify those areas adjacent to existing or proposed State
                 Highways that presently need acoustical protection and
                 request that the State construct noise attenuation walls as a
                 noise-reducing measure.
Goal NOI-4     To ensure that equipment noise does not adversely
               affect land uses.
Policies
Policy NOI-4.1   All purchases of noise-producing Town equipment shall be
                 made with careful consideration given to the noise impact
                 they will create.
                                                                         NOI-11

Policy NOI-4.2       Services contracted or performed by the Town shall not
                     cause undue noise problems.
Policy NOI-4.3       The Town shall continue to support legislation that en-
                     courages or requires reducing noise levels for machinery,
                     motor vehicles, and other equipment that generates offen-
                     sive noise.
Policy NOI-4.4       All Town-owned and operated equipment and equipment
                     operated under contract with the Town shall contain ade-
                     quate noise attenuation equipment.
Action
Action NOI-4.1       Study a ban on gardening equipment that may create ad-
                     verse noise.
Goal NOI-5         To ensure that residential land uses are not adversely
                   affected by noise.
Policies
Policy NOI-5.1       Protect residential areas from noise by requiring appropri-
                     ate site and building design, sound walls, and landscaping
                     and by the use of noise attenuating construction tech-
                     niques and materials.
Policy NOI-5.2       For commercial and industrial developments adjacent to
                     residential neighborhoods, additional restrictions beyond
                     the Noise Ordinance may be applied to reduce noise intru-
                     sions in residential districts to an acceptable level.
Goal NOI-6         To ensure that sensitive receptors are not exposed to

11 SAFETY ELEMENT
   A. Introduction
   The Safety Element identifies and evaluates natural and urban safety hazards
   in Los Gatos, both existing and potential. It establishes policies and actions to
   reduce or abate these hazards to protect Town residents and visitors. Addi-
   tionally, this Element guides the Town when participating in resolving safety
   issues that are regional in character, or otherwise beyond the immediate con-
   trol of the Town. The safety concerns identified in this Element have been
   divided into the following categories:
     ♦ Geologic Hazards, including earthquakes, ground shaking, liquefaction,
        and landslides
     ♦ Urban and Wildland Fire Hazards
     ♦ Flood and Inundation Hazards
     ♦ Hazardous Materials Management
     ♦ Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery
   Each category is divided into the following two sections:
     ♦ Background Information: A description of current risks based on each
        hazard category.
     ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: A list of goals, policies, and action state-
        ments that provide guidance on reducing the risks associated with the
        hazards identified in this Element.
   The Safety Element also describes police and fire protection services for Los
   Gatos.
   B. Geologic Hazards
   The San Francisco Bay Area is in one of the most active seismic regions in the
   United States. Each year, low and moderate magnitude earthquakes occur-
   ring in or near the San Francisco Bay Area are felt by residents of Los Gatos.
                                                                              SAF-1

1. Background Information
a. Earthquake Hazards
The law requires the California Geological Survey (CGS) to establish regula-
tory zones (known as Earthquake Fault Zones or Alquist-Priolo Zones)
around the surface traces of active faults and to issue maps to all affected cit-
ies, counties, and State agencies for use in planning and controlling develop-
ment. Figure SAF-1 shows the approximate location of the major fault zones
in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The principal fault zones in the Bay region are the San Andreas fault zone,
which traverses the Town, and the Hayward and Calaveras fault zones. The
San Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras fault zones are responsible for several
large historic earthquakes with ground rupture and all three are associated
with well-defined zones of seismic activity. Secondary fault zones, including
the Sargent, Berrocal, Shannon, and Monte Vista fault zones, traverse the
Town. These fault zones are part of the Southwest Santa Clara Valley Thrust
Belt and are generally believed to be connected to the San Andreas fault zone.
The San Andreas Fault is the potential source for larger earthquakes that will
affect the Town.
b. Ground Shaking
Los Gatos is within a seismically active region and earthquakes have the po-
tential to cause ground shaking of significant magnitude. Any slip along all
or part of a fault surface releases accumulated energy that radiates in all direc-
tions away from the source, in the form of earthquake waves. Associated
ground shaking varies in intensity depending on the severity of earthquake
activity, proximity to that activity and local soil and geological conditions.
Because Los Gatos is within the “near source” zone of both the San Andreas
and Monte Vista Faults, the Town is subject to particularly strong ground
shaking effects.
c. Seismic Hazards
The CGS and United States Geological Survey (USGS) identify liquefaction,
landslides, and ground failure as seismic hazards associated with earthquakes.

As illustrated on Figure SAF-2, these hazards influence patterns of develop-
ment in California, including Los Gatos.
i. Liquefaction
Liquefaction is the process by which the strength and stiffness of saturated
soil is reduced by ground shaking. It is defined as the transformation of a
granular material, such as sand and gravel, from a solid state into a liquefied
state, as a consequence of increased pore-water pressure. Structures which are
constructed on soils which are prone to liquefaction are subject to damage
and possible collapse as a result of settlement and lateral spreading due to liq-
uefaction. Most of the liquefaction zones are minimal in size and skirt the
Town limits.
ii. Landslides and Ground Failure
Landslides and slope instability are characterized by the movement of soils
and surficial deposits and bedrock down steep slopes. This movement results
from wet weather, adverse structures, seismic shaking, and/or improper grad-
ing and drainage. Because Los Gatos includes portions of the steep foothills
of the Santa Cruz Mountains, there is a potential for landslides throughout
much of the southern and eastern portions of the Town and extending as far
north as Blossom Hill Road. Landslide potential is minimal in the gently
sloping west central and northernmost portions of the Town.
d. Expansive Soils
Certain types of soils have characteristics that make them more susceptible to
geotechnical hazards, such as erosion and expansion. Identifying local soil
types and understanding their associated characteristics help cities to establish
appropriate engineering and construction standards for new buildings and
remodeling. The primary soil types in the Los Gatos area are clay and clay
loam.
i. Shrink-Swell Potential
Certain types of soil are inherently expansive, meaning they expand and con-
tract significantly as their water content fluctuates. This dynamic, known as

“shrink-swell potential,” can cause seasonal uplifting of structural foundations
and roads, accompanied by significant and often dangerous cracking. It fol-
lows that soils with high shrink-swell potential have limitations as substrates
for engineering and construction purposes.
ii. Erosion Potential
The potential for erosion generally increases with steepness of slope, rainfall
and in areas where the protective soil and/or vegetation cover has been re-
moved by fire or grading. Due to the varied topography of Los Gatos, the
erosion potential within the Town ranges from low to very high. The poten-
tial for erosion in Los Gatos is highest in the eastern, southern, and south-
western areas of the Town. Erosion potential decreases toward the center of
town, and is non-existent in the flat areas just east of the Highway 17 corri-
dor. However, erosion potential is high to very high in the areas surrounding
the north end of the Los Gatos Creek corridor.
2.    Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal SAF-1          To minimize exposure to geologic hazards, including
                    slope instability, subsidence, and expansive soils, and
                    to seismic hazards, including groundshaking, fault
                    rupture, liquefaction and landslides.
Policies
Policy SAF-1.1        Require reliable evaluations of the existing geologic condi-
                      tions of sites proposed for development where conditions
                      indicate the possibility of weak supporting soils or geo-
                      logic structures.
Policy SAF-1.2        Restrict new development and redevelopment based on
                      the levels of acceptable risk and potential severity of geo-
                      logic hazards.
Policy SAF-1.3        Preserve as open space property that is unbuildable due to
                      geologic conditions.

C. Urban and Wildland Fires
The Town of Los Gatos is susceptible to threat from both urban and wildland
fires. There are several factors that influence the potential for fire hazard,
including population growth, vegetation, topography, and weather.
1. Background Information
Santa Clara County has a high potential for devastating wildland fires. Based
on a “Fire Hazard Severity Zone” map developed by the California Depart-
ment of Forestry (CDF), the majority of the County is identified within the
“high” fire severity zone, with smaller portions of the County within the
“moderate” and “very high” fire severity zones. Figure SAF-3 illustrates the
fire hazard severity zones in the Los Gatos area.
The Town’s Emergency Operations Plan identifies wildfire risk as a seasonal
risk in the winter/spring months. However, the types of vegetation and
typically high moisture content generally reduce the wildfire risk in the area.
During drought years winds blow from the east, dry out the hillsides, and
increase the wildfire potential. The CDF categorizes vegetation based on the
following “fuel loading” characteristics: Light (grasslands), Medium (light
scrub brush) and Heavy (timber and heavy scrub brush).
2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal SAF-2        To incorporate fire safety precautions as an integral
                  consideration in planning development.
Policies
Policy SAF-2.1      New development located in or adjacent to fire hazard
                    areas shall be designed and sited to minimize hazards to
                    life and property. Utilize fire preventive site design, ac-
                    cess, fire-safe landscaping, and building materials, and in-
                    corporate fire suppression techniques.
                                                                            SAF-9

floodplain. Shallow flooding along some streets can be expected during sig-
nificant storm events.
The Parks and Public Works Department has a storm response program.
After a storm event, flooded areas are evaluated to determine the reason for
flooding. Fortunately, due to its topography and local reservoirs, the Town
has not been as severely impacted by flooding as nearby communities.
b. Dam Inundation
The Town Emergency Operations Plan (discussed below in Section F) identi-
fies the Lexington Reservoir, which is contained by the James J. Lenihan
Dam, the third largest reservoir in the County. Although the SCVWD main-
tains that the dam has the ability to withstand significant earthquakes, the
potential inundation zone in the event of failure is significant. Potential dam
inundation areas in the Town are illustrated in Figure SAF-5.
2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal SAF-4        To reduce the potential for injuries, damage to prop-
                  erty, economic and social displacement, and loss of
                  life resulting from flood hazards.
Policies
Policy SAF-4.1      Adopt designated floodways for all major streams utilizing
                    the full floodplain concept as a first priority and the modi-
                    fied floodplain concept as a second priority for floodplain
                    development.
Policy SAF-4.2      Limit the intensity of land use in floodplain areas.
Policy SAF-4.3      Require site planning and building design to address identi-

Policy SAF-4.4       Require development in FEMA designated 100-year flood
                     zones in the Los Gatos area, as shown in Figure SAF-4 or
                     most current FEMA mapping, to meet federal standards.
Policy SAF-4.5       Obtain fee title to all land required to be dedicated for
                     flood protection.
Policy SAF-4.6       Require major new development and redevelopment to
                     provide mitigation to ensure that the cumulative rate of
                     peak stormwater run-off is maintained at pre-development
                     levels.
Actions
Action SAF-4.1       Annually review all areas subject to flooding as identified
                     by FEMA or the State Department of Water Resources, as
                     required by AB 162.
Action SAF-4.2       Adopt floodplain zoning to prevent inappropriate devel-
                     opment in areas subject to flooding.
Action SAF-4.3       Coordinate with Santa Clara Valley Water District,
                     (SCVWD) FEMA, and/or the State Department of Water
                     Resources to develop and distribute flood hazard prepar-
                     edness educational information, including evacuation
                     plans, for residents.
E. Hazardous Materials
A material is considered hazardous if it has been designated as such by a fed-
eral, State, or local agency, or if it has characteristics defined as hazardous by
such an agency (see below). The Santa Clara County Fire District issues Haz-
ardous Materials Permits to all businesses handling such materials in the
Town. While these permits help track hazardous materials use in the Town,
                                                                             SAF-17

this Element of the General Plan addresses broader issues related to hazards
associated with hazardous materials.
1. Background Information
The California Code of Regulations defines a hazardous material as a sub-
stance that, because of physical or chemical properties, quantity, concentra-
tion, or other characteristics, may cause either an increase in mortality or an
increase in serious, irreversible, or incapacitating illness; or pose a substantial
present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when im-
properly treated, stored, transported or disposed of, or otherwise managed.
The California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) has the author-
ity and responsibility to establish a unified hazardous waste and hazardous
materials management and regulatory program, commonly referred to as the
Unified Program. The purpose of the Unified Program is to consolidate and
coordinate six different hazardous materials and hazardous waste programs,
and to ensure that they are consistently implemented throughout the State.
a. Hazardous Sites
The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and the SCVWD
have identified hazardous sites and established programs for cleanup and pre-
vention of further site contamination. The RWQCB tracks data about un-
derground fuel tanks, fuel pipelines and public drinking water supplies. The
RWQCB also tracks the cleanup progress of identified sites, and grants case
closure when the cleanup has been adequately completed.
The Town is located within the Santa Clara Valley Groundwater Subbasin.
Although a large number of Superfund sites are located within the Subbasin,
there are few groundwater quality impacts from the chemical contamination
on these sites. Overall, the SCVWD’s groundwater protection programs have
been effective in protecting the groundwater basin from contamination.
b. Hazardous Materials Transport
Transportation of hazardous materials and wastes is regulated by the Califor-
nia Code of Regulations, Title 26. The California Department of Transporta-

tion (DOT) is the primary regulatory authority for the interstate transport of
hazardous materials and establishes safe handling procedures for packaging,
marking, labeling, routing, etc. The California Highway Patrol and the DOT
enforce federal and State regulations and respond to hazardous materials
transportation emergencies. Emergency responses are coordinated as neces-
sary between federal, State and local governmental authorities and private
entities through a State-mandated Emergency Management Plan.
Major transportation routes within the Town include Highway 17 and
Highway 85, surface streets and the Southern Pacific Railroad. These trans-
portation routes are used to transport hazardous materials from suppliers to
users. Transportation accidents involving hazardous materials could occur on
any of the routes, potentially resulting in explosions, physical contact by
emergency response personnel, environmental degradation and exposure to
the public via airborne exposure.
c. Hazardous Waste Disposal
Landfills can have adverse impacts on surrounding properties, soils and the
groundwater below the landfill. The adverse impacts associated with these
facilities is related to the kind of materials disposed of in them, which can
consist of both non-hazardous (Class III), hazardous waste (Class I), or a com-
bination of both (Class II). The Guadalupe Landfill, a Class III facility serv-
ing the Town of Los Gatos, is located at 15999 Guadalupe Mines Road in the
City of San Jose.
Santa Clara County has implemented a free household hazardous waste dis-
posal program for paint, solvents, batteries and other common household
hazardous materials. Convenient drop-off locations and times are offered
throughout the County of Santa Clara. The nearest drop-off locations to the
Town are located in the adjacent City of San Jose. Hazardous waste can also
be disposed of at West Valley Collection and Recycling (WVCR). WVCR
accepts common household wastes, as well as used motor oil and oil filters,
aerosol cans and E-waste, which includes: batteries, televisions, computer
equipment, and other electronic devices.

1. Background Information
The Town of Los Gatos adopted a comprehensive Emergency Operations
Plan (EOP) in March 2009. The EOP identifies the existing hazards within
the Town, provides guidance and education on effective and skillful emer-
gency response techniques, and ensures the most effective allocation of re-
sources for protection of people and property in time of an emergency. The
EOP includes the following topic areas:
  ♦  Earthquakes                   ♦  Heat wave
  ♦  Wildfires                     ♦  Public health hazards
  ♦  Floods                        ♦  Hazardous materials
  ♦  Dam failure                   ♦  Terrorism/weapons of mass destruction
The EOP is intended to help the Town prevent disasters where and when
possible; reduce the vulnerability of residents to any disasters that cannot be
prevented; establish capabilities for protecting citizens from the effects of dis-
asters; respond effectively to the actual occurrence of disasters; and provide
for recovery in the aftermath of any emergency involving extensive damage.
In general, the EOP establishes emergency organization, assigns tasks, speci-
fies policies and general procedures, and provides for coordination of plan-
ning efforts of the various emergency staff and service elements utilizing the
Standardized Emergency Management System.
The EOP identifies the Town’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) as the
location from which centralized emergency management would be performed
during a major emergency or disaster, including receiving and disseminating
information, maintaining contact with other EOCs and providing instruc-
tions to the public. The EOC is located at the Police Operations Building on
Los Gatos Boulevard.

G. Fire Protection Service
In May of 1970, the Los Gatos Fire Department merged with the Santa Clara
County Central Fire Protection District. At the time of the merger, Los
Gatos had 27 paid firefighters. The Central Fire Protection District was
formed through the consolidation of numerous Fire Districts. Following
these mergers, the Central Fire Protection District was renamed the Santa
Clara County Fire Department.

The Operations Division is comprised of four sections: Fire Suppression, Fire
Investigation, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and Hazardous Materials
Response (Hazmat). Operations is also responsible for Rescues and the
Special Operations Task Force. In the wake of terrorist events in the United
States, the Department created the Special Operations Task Force (SOTF) to
be better equipped and able to respond to major disasters, such as terrorist
attacks and bomb threats, as well as incidents of a less intentional nature, such
as natural disasters, confined space and collapse rescues, and hazmat incidents.
The SOTF is comprised of the crews of Engine 2 and Hazmat 2 from Seven
Springs station, Truck 5 from Winchester station, and Rescue 3 from Los
Gatos station. While the department already had hazmat and rescue capabili-
ties, the SOTF is designed to both extend and integrate these capabilities.
The SOTF trains for technical rescue and body recovery at incidents involv-
ing hazardous and/or biological materials, as well as confined space or struc-
ture collapse rescues.

H. Police Service
Police protection for the Town of Los Gatos is provided by the Los
Gatos/Monte Sereno Police Department. The Town is characterized as a
relatively safe community with limited crime.
1. Background Information
The Los Gatos Police Department was established in 1926 and provides police
protection services to the Town of Los Gatos. In 1995, the Town entered
into a contract with the neighboring City of Monte Sereno to provide police
protection services to this community. This ultimately resulted in renaming
the Police Department the Los Gatos/Monte Sereno Police Department. The
police department serves a combined population of approximately 35,000
residents, and even more when including the workforce of and visitors to Los
Gatos. The department provides the following core services:
  ♦ Response to emergency and non-emergency calls for service from quality
      of life issues to property crimes and crimes against persons.
  ♦ Identification of criminal activity, including the thorough investigation
      and prosecution of crimes.
  ♦ Dispatch and records services.
  ♦ Recruiting, hiring and training of personnel.
  ♦ Crime prevention and community outreach.
  ♦ Traffic safety and enforcement, including safe routes to school, bike ro-
      deos, helmet usage, and placement of radar trailers throughout the com-
      munity.
  ♦ Maintenance of lost or stolen property, records, and criminal evidence.

  ♦ Community problem-solving and engagement.
  ♦ School Resource Officer services.
  ♦ Administration and fiscal management.
a. Facilities
The Los Gatos/Monte Sereno Police Department has two primary locations
in Los Gatos. The Town’s Civic Center complex serves as headquarters for
police administration, records and dispatch. The new Police Operations
building, which was completed in October 2009, houses police operations,
including patrol operations, the investigations unit, and evidence storage.
The operations captain, patrol sergeants, evidence technician and other sup-
port personnel are located at this site. The Police Operations building also
houses a briefing room, training room, prisoner processing facility and Emer-
gency Operations Center (EOC). The location of existing and proposed po-
lice facilities is shown in Figure SAF-6.
b. Service Standards
The Los Gatos/Monte Sereno Police Department has a performance objective
of “providing a safe environment through timely response and police assis-
tance.” The department categorizes calls as Priority One, Priority Two, or
Priority Three. Priority One calls involve either a serious emergency or pub-
lic safety hazard. Priority Two calls are those that require immediate re-
sponse, but are not an emergency. Priority Three calls are all non-emergency
calls. While most calls responded to by the Los Gatos/Monte Sereno Police
Department relate to incidences of vandalism, domestic disputes, theft and
burglary, the department does receive and respond to crimes of violence, in-
cluding robbery, sexual assault, violent assault, and murder.
2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal SAF-9           To reduce the potential for injuries, damage to prop-
                     erty, economic and social displacement, and loss of
                     life resulting from crime.

12 HUMAN SERVICES ELEMENT
   A. Introduction
   Major land use and development decisions have important physical,
   economic, social, and environmental implications that must be considered by
   public officials during any planning process. A Human Services Element in
   the General Plan provides a venue for bringing human concerns into the
   physical planning process. Human Services are those services in the
   community, both public and private, designed especially to meet the social,
   health, safety, communication, education and artistic needs of people.
   This Element expands upon the Town’s role and responsibilities pertaining to
   the broad areas of human services and assessing needs for available resources.
   Through an effective Human Services Element the Town will be better able
   to assist individuals and families in achieving and maintaining high levels of
   social well-being, leading to a more positive and satisfied community.
   The Town should be involved in meeting human needs, but may not
   necessarily be responsible for directly delivering all services. The Town
   recognizes the value of public and private agencies working together to
   effectively deliver services. The Town can be a leader in bringing agencies
   together and encouraging long-range planning. For services not directly
   provided by the Town, the Town may assume any of the following five roles
   to assist in developing more effective delivery of Human Services in Los
   Gatos: resource coordinator; educator; advocate; facilitator; and evaluator.
   This Element is divided into the following sections:
     ♦  Youth Services
     ♦  Senior Services
     ♦  Schools
     ♦  Libraries
     ♦  Town Arts
     ♦  Public Health
                                                                             HS-1

H U M A N    S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
Each of these components is divided into the following sections:
 ♦ Background Information: Provides background information about the
     various resources within Los Gatos.
 ♦ Goals, Policies and Actions: Provides guidance to the Town related to
     decisions affecting the resources addressed in this Element.
B. Public Health
The Town of Los Gatos wants to help ensure a healthy community through
planning efforts that can directly enhance the wellness of the community.
1. Background
Public health and planning professionals now recognize that increasing
individuals’ physical activity is paramount to healthy populations, and that
the built environment greatly influences lifestyle choices that promote such
activity. Los Gatos strives to be an active, inclusive, and responsive
community, where healthy habits are encouraged rather than discouraged by
the environments we build. Goals, policies, and actions that promote active,
healthy lifestyles are also found in the Land Use Element and Transportation
Element.
Policies related to community health are also addressed in other sections of
this General Plan, including:
  ♦   Emergency preparedness in the Safety Element.
  ♦   Parks and recreational opportunities in the Open Space Element.
  ♦   Water and air quality in the Environment and Sustainability Element.
  ♦   Fire and police services in the Safety Element.

C. Youth Services
Having community activities and services catering to young persons 18 years
of age or younger is important for families in Los Gatos. The Town of Los
Gatos strives to be a youth-friendly community and recognizes that youth
services must be identified and developed to foster a healthy and active
environment for youth growing up in Los Gatos.

under the age of 18. Young persons under the age of 18 represent
approximately 20 percent of the total population in Los Gatos. Youth
represent the future of Los Gatos, and providing and maintaining services for
youth continues to be an important issue to the Town.
Information on youth organizations, library services, family and community
events, and Town policies for youth can be found on the Town’s website in
the Youth and Teen Resources section. The Town of Los Gatos provides the

D. Senior Services
Seniors, or persons age 65 and older, are a significant and growing population
group in Los Gatos. In Santa Clara County, seniors are the fastest growing
population segment, expected to number more than 300,000 by 2020. The
Town of Los Gatos strives to be a senior friendly community and recognizes
that, as this population group continues to grow and age, services must be
identified and developed to accommodate the needs of older adults.
1. Background Information
The Los Gatos population is growing older. In 2010, the median age of the
Los Gatos population is estimated to be 45 years, while in 1970 it was
estimated to be 30 years. The older population is evidenced by the increasing
                                                                              HS-9

proportion of the Los Gatos population who are age 65 and older. According
to the 2000 U.S. Census, the number of seniors in Los Gatos has increased
from 11 percent of the total population in Los Gatos in 1970 to 15 percent by
2000. Currently, it is estimated that seniors represent 17 percent of the total
population in Los Gatos and could be at 20 percent by 2020.
The Town of Los Gatos contracts with the Los Gatos-Saratoga Recreation
District for services, information, and activities for seniors living in Los
Gatos. Many of these services are provided at the Los Gatos Adult
Recreation Center at 208 E. Main Street in Los Gatos.
a. Healthcare and Social Services
Los Gatos provides a majority of its healthcare and social service programs
for seniors through the Los Gatos Adult Recreation Center. The Los Gatos-
Monte Sereno Police Department also offers a daily senior check-in program
called Operation C.A.R.E.
i. Los Gatos Adult Recreation Center
The Adult Recreation Center is a gathering place for seniors in Los Gatos and
provides several senior healthcare and social services. The Center provides
case management services to seniors. This service includes advice and
referrals to social service agencies and assistance in completing applications
for social services. The location of the Center is shown on Figure HS-1.
Through the Adult Recreation Center, volunteer counselors give assistance to
seniors interested in drawing up a “durable power of attorney,” or health care
power of attorney. Volunteer counselors also provide other services such as
neutral healthcare insurance advice and information and income tax
assistance.
ii. Operation C.A.R.E. Program
Operation C.A.R.E., or Caring About Resident Elders, is a program run by
the Los Gatos/Monte Sereno Police Department that offers a free, daily

Police Dispatcher will call at an agreed-upon time with the senior and if
unable to reach the senior or any of the senior’s emergency contacts, a Police
Officer will be sent to the home to check on his/her welfare. Seniors can
register for this free service through the Los Gatos/Monte Sereno Police
Department.
b. Housing
The Town of Los Gatos strives to provide a variety of housing alternatives to
allow seniors to live independently and age in place as they so choose. These
housing types include not only single family homes, town homes,
condominiums and apartments, but also life care communities, affordable
housing, shared housing, and below market rate properties.
Villa Vasona, Blossom Hill, and Anne Way offer affordable senior units to
Los Gatos residents, while the Terraces of Los Gatos, a senior residential care
facility run by American Baptist Homes of the West, offers 59 beds and has
independent living, assisted living, and skilled nursing programs on site.
Twenty-nine of the senior units at the Terraces of Los Gatos are Below
Market Price (BMP) units under the Town’s BMP program.
The Town also has Los Gatos Meadows Life Care Retirement, run by
Episcopal Senior Communities, which has 170 units of studios, apartments,
and cottages that house approximately 200 residents.
The Town also supports a Housing Conservation Program which offers no-
interest and low-interest loans to income-eligible Los Gatos residents,
including seniors, for home rehabilitation projects. The program is
administered by the Santa Clara County Housing and Community
Development Department and makes home rehabilitation loans available to
qualified Los Gatos renters and owners.
c. Transportation
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) operates up to six
public transit bus lines that run through the Town and several park-and-ride
                                                                           HS-11

Policies
Policy HS-12.1         Encourage developers to engage in early discussions with
                       the Town and school districts regarding a project, its
                       potential impacts on schools and the potential to reduce
                       impacts. These discussions should occur as early as
                       possible in the project planning stage, preferably preceding
                       land acquisition.
Policy HS-12.2         Cooperate with school districts in identifying and
                       evaluating population and demographic changes that may
                       impact schools.
Policy HS-12.3         Allow alternative uses of the sites and facilities of schools,
                       subject to conditions that will protect the surrounding
                       neighborhood.

                       applicants for residential projects to contact the affected
                       school districts to discuss the impacts of the proposed
                       development.
F. Libraries
The Town of Los Gatos has one public library located within the Town’s
Civic Center complex, which was built in 1964 when the population of the
Town was approximately 9,000. Since that time, the population of the Town
has grown to just over 30,000, with approximately 20,000 registered library
card holders. The Los Gatos library provides a variety of services for people
of all ages.
1. Background Information
To meet the community’s growing library needs, the Town of Los Gatos is
building a new, larger library that will be located on the southeast corner of
HS-22

                                                    T O W N O F L O S G A T O S

the Civic Center complex. The new library is expected to open in early 2012.
The new two-story library will be approximately 30,000 square feet and will
include: a separate space for children’s story-telling programs; a separate teen
room; reading and study areas for users of all ages; computer areas for
research, Internet access and technology education; laptop areas; additional
self-check out machines; and space for the Town’s extensive history
collection. The new library will also have more seating and added space for
adult and youth book collections and multi-media collections.
The current library collection consists of books, audiobooks, magazines and
periodicals, newspapers, DVDs, CDs, CD ROMs, video cassettes, microfilm
and reference materials. A current collection of Los Gatos High School
textbooks is also available for in-house use. The library also subscribes to
computerized databases which provide access to thousands of archived
newspapers, periodicals, primary source documents, reference works and
media files. These databases are accessible on library computers and remotely
using a library card number.
The library also holds an extensive collection of historical artifacts and
information, with emphasis on the Town of Los Gatos and surrounding
areas. Original photographs and newspapers are available, along with copies
of death certificates and profiles of historic homes. The library provides
access to research on the original “Rancho Rinconada de Los Gatos,” the
Hernandez and Peralta families, grantees of the land, the John Lyndon
family, and other early settlers who were important in the founding of the
Town.
The library’s History Collection includes information on local authors, such
as Colonel Charles Erskine Scott Wood, Sara Bard Field and Ruth Comfort
Mitchell. The library also owns signed first editions of many local authors.
The digitized collection of nearly 4,000 historic photographs includes the
Hamsher Collection, donated to the library in the mid-1950s, the entire
                                                                             HS-23

people of all ages in the Town. The Town has committed to protecting and
promoting its cultural resources, including theaters, museums, art galleries,
and public art. The Town also strives to further attract and encourage
performing arts in Los Gatos, including live theater, music, and dance, as well
as the literary arts, including author events and poetry.
1. Programs and Facilities
Los Gatos’s Arts and Culture Commission is actively involved in promoting
cultural events and public art displays in the Town. The Arts and Culture
Commission is an advisory group to the Town Council and works to
encourage the development of music, drama, art, and other cultural and
creative activities in Town.
The Town supports a wide variety of cultural experiences including the
Music in the Park Summer Concert Series, the annual July Fourth musical
celebration, and public art in the Council Chambers and throughout the
community. Many of these efforts are supported or led by a Council-
appointed Arts Commission.
Los Gatos has two museums – the Art Museum of Los Gatos, located in a
historic former firehouse on Tait Avenue, and the History Museum of Los
Gatos, located in the Forbes Mill annex. While the Town owns these two
buildings, collections and operations of these museums are managed by a non-
profit organization.
The Town also supports art-related, non-profit organizations which host
various music and arts programming. In addition, the Town appointed a Los
Gatos Poet Laureate for the construction and opening of the new library, a
new tradition which will likely continue to support the literary arts in Los
Gatos.

3 LAND USE ELEMENT
  A. Introduction
  Los Gatos is a mature, predominantly built-out community. While there is
  little room for growth or change in the physical environment, land use is dy-
  namic and change is constant from within and outside the community. Man-
  aging change in an effort to maintain our quality of life is a priority of this
  General Plan and the Community.
  The Land Use Element is the framework of the General Plan and is intended
  to inform and shape the future physical development of Los Gatos. This
  Element sets forth the patterns of development activity and land uses that will
  support and enhance the character of the Town. Although all General Plan
  Elements are of equal importance, the Land Use Element is the most fre-
  quently used and referenced section of the General Plan.
  Planning for neighborhood preservation and protection is one of the most
  important purposes of the Town’s General Plan. Preserving the small-town
  heritage, natural setting, and architectural diversity are also important to this
  community. One of Los Gatos’s most outstanding assets is the visual diver-
  sity of its individual neighborhoods. Existing development represents a vari-
  ety of architectural styles from various eras, embodying a variety of sizes,
  design features, and building materials, resulting in neighborhoods with their
  own unique identity. For example, Downtown Los Gatos is the historic
  heart of Town with a pedestrian-scale setting of mixed land uses and architec-
  turally historic buildings. It is a unique area that sets the spirit and style of
  the entire Town.
  Maintaining neighborhood quality suggests conservation of existing housing,
  good street design, traffic control in residential neighborhoods, and develop-
  ment review that adheres to quality design. Factors such as new or excessive
  traffic, aging or inadequate infrastructure, and even economic pressures may
  cause disruption of neighborhoods. Neighborhood preservation also includes
  balancing the intensity of land uses with the existing residential density.
                                                                              LU-1

T O W N O F L O S G A T O S
2 0 2 0 G E N E R A L P L A N
L A N D    U S E E L E M E N T
Los Gatos also focuses on maintaining a “full-service” town that provides a
range of goods and services that support the economic vitality of the Town.
The commercial centers of Los Gatos are therefore also important to the
community. Under the Los Gatos Boulevard Plan, the community expressed
interest in creating a shopping experience and destination that complements
but does not compete with the Downtown.
Residential and non-residential uses produce different impacts on the com-
munity. The impacts on traffic, noise, schools, open space, and other quality-
of-life issues will vary, depending on the final mixture of residential and non-
residential uses approved within the area. The overall planning for the area
needs to limit the adverse impacts on the quality of life of all of the residents
of Los Gatos and to provide for open space.
The Land Use Element describes land use designations, special planning areas,
and existing land uses in Los Gatos. The Land Use Element is divided into
the following sections:
  ♦ Introduction: A description of the requirements and contents of the
      Land Use Element.
  ♦ Existing Land Uses: A description of existing land uses in Los Gatos.
  ♦ General Plan Land Use Designations: A description of the characteris-
      tics and intensity of the different land use designations in Los Gatos, in-
      cluding a map identifying the location of these land use designations.
  ♦ Special Planning Areas: A description of special planning areas, includ-
      ing Historic Districts and Specific Plan Overlays.
  ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: A list of goal, policy, and action statements
      that provide guidance to Los Gatos on land use decisions.

B. Authority for the Element
California Government Code Section 65302(a) and Public Resources Code
Section 2762(a) require that the Land Use Element provide the following in-
formation:
  ♦ Distribution, location, and extent of land uses for categories of public or
     private uses. Such categories include, but are not limited to housing,
     business, industry, open space, natural resources, recreation and enjoy-
     ment of scenic beauty, education, and public buildings and grounds.
  ♦ Population density and building intensity standards for land use designa-
     tions.
The Land Use Element has the broadest scope of any of the State-required
components of the General Plan. In addition to the State’s requirements set
forth in the Government Code, it has also been legally established that, while
the location of a particular land use may be expressed in general terms, a
property owner must be able to identify the General Plan Land Use Designa-
tion for his/her parcel from the land use diagram contained in the Land Use
Element.
Among the important implementation mechanisms for the Land Use Ele-
ment are Specific Plans and the Town Code. The California Government
Code requires that the Town Code and zoning map be consistent with its
General Plan Land Use Element and land use map, and that all provisions of
Specific Plans adopted by the Town must be consistent with the General Plan
that they implement.
C. Relationship of Land Use Element to other Elements and Plans
Because the Land Use Element sets the framework of the General Plan, the
Land Use Element relates directly to all goals and policies of the other Ele-
ments and unifies the General Plan by providing the overall policy context
                                                                           LU-3

T O W N O F L O S G A T O S

L A N D    U S E E L E M E N T
for the other Elements. The relationship of the Land Use Element to other
elements and plans is described below.
  ♦ The Land Use Element addresses circulation by setting out, in its map
      and policies, the location and size of all roadways in the Town coordi-
      nated with the land uses the roads will serve. It also notes the planned
      capacities of all other infrastructure systems that will be necessary to pro-
      tect the health and welfare of the Town’s citizens.
  ♦ The location, type, and density of residential units are key components
      of the Land Use Element. The Housing Element uses the density ranges
      specified in the Land Use Element to identify sites to meet the Town’s
      housing needs.
  ♦ The mandates of the Safety Element are reflected in the designation and
      location of land use, the permitted activities within designated areas, and
      the patterns of land use that support defensible space, the Town’s contin-
      gency plan, and fire and other hazard mitigation.
  ♦ The Land Use Element addresses buffers between noise sensitive uses and
      noise sources.
  ♦ The Town conserves resources through policies for the wise use of land,
      water, and energy.
  ♦ Air quality is improved by land use patterns that minimize vehicle travel
      within the Town.
  ♦ The Conservation Element goals address protecting and enhancing the
      natural environment. Programs that retain natural features such as tree
      preservation, limited grading, and water conservation maintain the natu-
      ral character of Los Gatos.
  ♦ The Open Space Element refers to the location, character, and use of
      parks, recreational facilities, and preserved, unimproved land.
  ♦ Land use designations protect and preserve open spaces.
  ♦ The Land Use Element reflects the Town’s high priority for quality de-
      sign.

  ♦ The Land Use and Community Design Elements preserve historical
     buildings and historic areas, limiting the size of houses, while careful de-
     sign of new infill developments protects the character of Los Gatos.
  ♦ California State law requires that all Specific Plans and zoning regulations
     be consistent with the General Plan. The Hillside Specific Plan, the
     North Forty Specific Plan, the Redevelopment Plan, and other plans that
     may be adopted as necessary will be consistent with this General Plan.
D. Existing Land Uses
This section contains qualitative and quantitative descriptions of existing land
uses in the Town of Los Gatos and Los Gatos’s Sphere of Influence (SOI).
“Existing land uses” refers to the existing built environment, regardless of the
General Plan land use designation or zoning designation applied by the
Town. This initial assessment is based on data from the Santa Clara County
Office of the Assessor. Existing land uses are illustrated in Figure LU-1 and
listed in Table LU-1.
1. Residential – Single Family
Approximately 3,183 acres of land in Los Gatos are dedicated to parcels that
contain a single, detached residence and related structures. Single-family resi-
dential land use is located throughout the Town, with the exception of the
public and open spaces in the southern area of the Town and along commer-
cial corridors immediately adjacent to Los Gatos Boulevard and Santa Cruz
Avenue. In the SOI, approximately 2,728 acres of land are dedicated to sin-
gle-family residential land.
2. Residential – Multi-Family
This land use category refers to parcels that contain more than one housing
unit. It includes duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, condominiums, and apart-
ment buildings. This residential land use totals approximately 407 acres in
the Town. There is no multi-family housing in the SOI. Multi-family uses
are largely clustered in and around the Highway 17 corridor, either between

County Park. A significant pocket of multi-family housing is also located in
the northwest corner of the Town, just south of the City of Campbell.
3. Commercial
Commercial land refers to parcels that contain either retail businesses—those
offering specific products for sale—or businesses that provide day-to-day ser-
vices such as grocery stores, restaurants, spas and salons, dry cleaners, and
nurseries. There are approximately 164 acres of commercial uses in Los
Gatos and 1 acre in the SOI. Most commercial parcels in Los Gatos are lo-
cated along the Santa Cruz Avenue or Los Gatos Boulevard corridors.
                                                                                        LU-7

4. Office Professional
Office Professional land use refers to parcels that contain offices for medical,
legal, insurance, consulting, and similar contracted services. Office and pro-
fessional uses account for 125 acres in Los Gatos. Like commercial parcels,
office professional parcels are concentrated along the Town’s primary com-
mercial corridors. An additional cluster of office and professional uses is lo-
cated near the Highway 17/85 interchange.
5. Light Industrial
The Light Industrial land use category refers to parcels used primarily for
production, manufacturing, and research and development. Additional uses
include self-storage and automobile service garages. There are approximately
37 acres of light industrial land uses in Los Gatos. Light industrial uses are
concentrated in two small pockets, one just south of Highway 85 and east of
Winchester Boulevard, and another along University Avenue, north of Blos-
som Hill Road.
6. Public/Quasi-Public
Public/Quasi-Public land uses include schools, libraries, police and fire sta-
tions, faith communities, and hospitals. These uses are distributed through-
out Los Gatos, mostly in single parcels or small groups of parcels. Pub-
lic/Quasi-Public land uses comprise approximately 291 acres of land in the
Town and approximately 149 acres in the SOI.
7. Public Utilities
Public Utilities refer to uses related to communications and energy produc-
tion and distribution. There are approximately 37 acres in the Town devoted
to utilities divided between parcels scattered throughout Los Gatos. Many of
these parcels are owned by San Jose Water Company and PG&E and are sites
of communications infrastructure.
8. Agricultural
Agricultural land is used for raising and harvesting crops, breeding livestock,
and/or housing equipment used for agricultural purposes. According to the
Santa Clara County Assessor’s Office, about 64 acres of land scattered

throughout Los Gatos, and approximately 48 acres in the SOI, are devoted to
existing agricultural uses. One of the largest areas of agricultural land is the
North Forty site, which contains orchard trees, including walnut and fruit
trees. Wine grapes can be found in the Santa Cruz Mountains hillside areas.
The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, better known as the William-
son Act, works to preserve agricultural and open space lands through restric-
tive use contracts administered by counties and cities under State regulations.
Private landowners voluntarily restrict their land to agricultural and com-
patible open space uses under minimum 10-year rolling term contracts, with
counties and cities also acting voluntarily. In return, the property tax on a
Williamson Act parcel is assessed at a rate consistent with its actual use, rather
than potential market value.
Figure LU-2 shows the location of all Williamson Act lands and their designa-
tion as well as farmland not covered by the Williamson Act. Approximately
136 acres of land within the Town limits and 358 acres of land within the SOI
are designated Williamson Act land.1 Of these, only 3.85 acres are considered
“prime agricultural lands” under the definition of the Land Conservation Act.
All of these lands occur in the Town’s SOI. In addition to Williamson Act
lands, approximately 32 acres of Unique Farmland are located within Town
limits and 8 acres within the SOI. “Unique Farmland” is a designation ap-
plied by the State Department of Conservation to land that is capable of pro-
ducing specific high value crops. In Los Gatos, it is applied to the orchards
on the North Forty site.
9. Open Space/Recreation
Open Space/Recreation refers to indoor and outdoor recreational facilities,
including public open spaces such as regional parks, community centers,
         1
           This number is higher than the number of acres in existing Agricultural use
because Williamson Act include parcels that are classified by the Assessor as Agricul-
ture, Open Space, and Single Family Residential. Single Family Residential may be
considered an acceptable classification by the Assessor since Williamson Act contracts
may include provisions for a limited number of dwelling units on the property.

playgrounds and neighborhood parks, country clubs, and natural open spaces.
After Residential – Single Family land use, Open Space/Recreation comprises
the second highest percentage of total land in Los Gatos. There are approxi-
mately 1,624 acres of open space in the Town and approximately 2,218 acres
in the SOI. Much of this acreage is contained in four large facilities: St. Jo-
seph’s Hill and Sierra Azul Open Space to the south of Los Gatos, and
Vasona Lake County Park and La Rinconada Country Club to the north.
10. Vacant
Approximately 292 acres within the Town are vacant parcels of varying sizes
that are scattered throughout the Town. Most of the vacant acreage in Los
Gatos is located in the single-family residential area on the eastern side of the
Town. Parcels here are generally larger than they are elsewhere in Los Gatos,
and a number of significantly sized parcels are vacant. Generally, vacancies
are more common in residential areas of Los Gatos than in commercial areas,
although a few small, isolated commercial vacancies exist. Additionally, the
SOI contains approximately 107 acres of vacant property.
E. General Plan Land Use Designations
The Land Use Element is the basis for physical development in Los Gatos.
The land use map and designations identify the general location, density, and
extent of land available for residential and non-residential uses. Land use des-
ignations do not necessarily reflect the existing land use of each parcel. Figure
LU-3 presents a map of the land use designations in Los Gatos. Each land use
designation is listed and described below.
1. Residential Land Use Designations
This section provides a brief description of each residential land use designa-
tion and the desirable range of density for each designation.

2. Non-Residential Land Use Designations
For non-residential land uses, the specific uses mentioned are illustrative, and
other compatible uses, including those authorized in any other Zoning Dis-
trict within the Town, may be permitted where authorized by a Planned De-
velopment Overlay Zone. For non-residential land uses, building intensity
limits are indicated by either allowable land coverage or floor area ratio
(FAR) and a maximum height limit.

business and professional services and local employment.
b. Central Business District: 0.6 FAR with a 45-foot height limit
The Central Business District designation applies exclusively to the down-
town and accomplishes the following:
   ♦ Encourages a mixture of community-oriented commercial goods, services
      and lodging unique in its accommodation of small-town style merchants
      and maintenance of small-town character.
   ♦ Maintains and expands landscaped open spaces and mature tree growth
      without increasing setbacks.
   ♦ Integrates new construction with existing structures of historical or archi-
      tectural significance and emphasizes the importance of the pedestrian.

rants. Projects developed under this designation shall maintain the small-
town, residential scale and natural environments of adjacent residential
neighborhoods, as well as provide prime orientation to arterial street front-
ages and proper transitions and buffers to adjacent residential properties.
This designation should never be interpreted to allow development of inde-
pendent commercial facilities with principal frontage on the side streets.
d.   Neighborhood Commercial: Up to 50 percent land coverage with a
     35-foot height limit
The Neighborhood Commercial designation provides for necessary day-to-
day commercial goods and services required by the residents of the adjacent
neighborhoods. This designation encourages concentrated and coordinated
commercial development at easily accessible locations.
e.   Service Commercial: Up to 50 percent land coverage with a 35-foot
     height limit
The Service Commercial designation provides for service businesses necessary
for the conduct of households or businesses. These include auto repair, build-
ing materials sales, paint suppliers, janitorial services, towing businesses, con-
tractors offices and yards, launderers and dry cleaners, as well as wholesaling
and warehousing activities.
f.   Light Industrial: Up to 50 percent land coverage with a 35-foot height
     limit
The Light Industrial designation provides for large-scale office developments
and well-controlled research and development, industrial-park-type and ser-
vice-oriented uses subject to rigid development standards. These uses should
respond to community or region-wide needs.
g. Public
The Public designation identifies public facilities in the Town such as the
Civic Center, courthouse, schools, parks, libraries, hospitals, churches, and
fire stations.
                                                                              LU-15

h. Agriculture
The Agricultural designation identifies areas for commercial agricultural crop
production.
i. Open Space
The Open Space designation identifies the location of public parks, open
space preserves, private preserves, and stream corridors.
F. Special Planning Areas
Development in Los Gatos can be targeted to achieve a more specific outcome
by designating specific overlay zones and special planning areas. These areas
have more detailed development guidelines that remain consistent with exist-
ing policies. Los Gatos has three overlay zones that implement land use poli-
cies through the Town Code, five Historic Districts, three Specific Plans, and
one Redevelopment Project Area.
1. Overlay Zones
There are three overlay zones in the Town Code, the Landmark and Historic
Preservation, Planned Development, and Public School Overlay Zones.
  ♦ Landmark and Historic Preservation (LHP) Overlay Zone. This zone is
      designated by Town Council and is applied to individual sites and struc-
      tures or small areas deemed of architectural and/or historical significance.
      The structure(s) in LHP overlays are subject to special standards regard-
      ing their appearance, use, and maintenance.
  ♦ Planned Development (PD) Overlay Zone. The PD overlay zone is in-
      tended to ensure orderly planning and quality design that will be in har-
      mony with the existing or potential development of the surrounding
      neighborhood. The Planned Development Overlay is a specially tailored
      development plan and ordinance which designates the zoning regulations
      for the accompanying project, sets specific development standards, and
      ensures that zoning and the General Plan are consistent. Commercial,

    residential or industrial property or a mixture of these uses may be con-
    sidered for a Planned Development Overlay.
  ♦ Public School (PS) Overlay Zone. The PS overlay zone is intended to al-
    low school buildings to be used, without extensive exterior modifica-
    tions, in ways which will make it unnecessary to sell school facilities.
    The overlay permits a variety of community-related and education-
    related uses, including, but not limited to, museums, community centers,
    playgrounds, and nursery schools. Any land owned by a public school
    district (regardless of underlying zone) may be zoned PS.
2. Historic Districts
The Town has established five historic districts to preserve neighborhoods
deemed significant to the history of Los Gatos.
  ♦ Almond Grove Historic District. An approximately 40-acre area that
    constitutes the largest subdivision following incorporation of the Town
    of Los Gatos. This District was established by ordinance in 1980.
  ♦ Broadway Historic District. An approximately 100-acre area that is the
    site of the first residential subdivision and first residential street in the
    Town of Los Gatos. This District was established by ordinance in 1985.
  ♦ Los Gatos Historic Commercial District. Bounded by Elm Street to the
    north, Main Street to the south, Los Gatos Creek to the east, and North
    Santa Cruz Avenue to the west. The Town’s only concentration of in-
    tact historic commercial buildings. It was established by ordinance in
    1991.
  ♦ Fairview Plaza Historic District. Limited to the cul-de-sac termination of
    Fairview Plaza, part of an historic subdivision originally surveyed in 1885
    known as the “Fairview Addition.” The District retains the same con-
    figuration as originally mapped and contains a rare collection of Victo-
    rian and Craftsman homes, unique in their compact scale and proximity
    to one another. This District was established by ordinance in 1992.
  ♦ University/Edelen Historic District. Bounded by Saratoga Avenue to
    the north, Main Street to the south, Los Gatos Creek to the east, and the
                                                                           LU-17

      former Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way to the west. The District
      is composed of five subdivisions that predate 1900 and contain a number
      of residential and commercial structures of mixed architectural styles.
      This District was established by ordinance in 1991.
All of Los Gatos’s historic districts are defined by structures that contribute
to the District. In every District, the transformation of these structures is
tightly regulated. Demolition of contributing structures is strictly prohibited.
In addition, all restoration, rehabilitation, and new construction of principal
units must adhere to a series of guidelines for preserving architectural heritage
and conforming to existing style. Any modifications to the original design
are either restricted or prohibited.
3. Overlay Designation
The North Forty Specific Plan Overlay is applied to the approximately
40-acre property bounded by Los Gatos Boulevard to the east, Highway 17 to
the west, Lark Avenue to the south, and Highway 85 to the North. This
Overlay requires the preparation and adoption of a specific plan that will de-
termine the mix of uses, dimensional standards, architectural standards, phas-
ing, and infrastructure to support the development of the property prior to
approval of any entitlements. Drawing on the draft North Forty Specific
Plan prepared in 1999, the General Plan overlay designation is intended to
help guide the future development of this property. The 2020 General Plan
Environmental Impact Report assumed a maximum capacity of 750 mixed
residential units and 580,000 square feet of retail and offices uses for the pur-
poses of assessing environmental impacts associated with the development of
the property. While this is the maximum development capacity under this
General Plan, the specific plan may be approved with lower densities and
square footage of residential and commercial uses, respectively. The North
Forty Specific Pan will be based on the following general guidelines:
  ♦ Include a mixture of uses that will complement the Downtown and the
      rest of the community.
  ♦ Be based on sustainable and “smart” development practices.

  ♦ Include public gathering spaces such as a plaza and park.
  ♦ Provide for a variety of residential housing types, both rental- and owner-
    occupied. A minimum of 20 percent of the units shall be affordable to
    households at the moderate income level or below.
  ♦ Include high-quality architecture and design that reflects the rural and ag-
    ricultural history of the site.
  ♦ Provide pedestrian-oriented buildings along the Los Gatos Boulevard
    frontage, with minimal parking oriented to the street.
  ♦ Take advantage of the grade change across the site.
  ♦ Continue the “boulevard treatment” along Los Gatos Boulevard, with in-
    terconnections from one parcel’s drive aisle to the next.
  ♦ Include connections to existing intersections along Los Gatos Boulevard
    and Lark Avenue.
  ♦ Develop gateway or landmark features at Los Gatos Boulevard and Lark
    Avenue and at Los Gatos Boulevard and the Highway 85 off-ramp.
  ♦ Provide an easily accessible, fully connected street network that encour-
    ages walking.
  ♦ Provide a vegetative buffer and screening along Highways 17 and 85.
  ♦ Preserve Town character and views.
4. Other Plans
The Hillside Specific Plan and Los Gatos Boulevard Plan areas are each devel-
oped according to separate land use goals and in different areas of the Town.
In addition to these approved Specific Plans, the Town will be developing a
North Forty Specific Plan.
a. Hillside Specific Plan
The Hillside Specific Plan establishes land use policy for the Hillside Study
Area, an area of mountainous terrain in the southeastern portion of the Town
designated for Hillside Residential development. Adopted by Town Council
in 1978, the Specific Plan establishes a series of policies and standards related
                                                                            LU-19

T O W N O F L O S G A T O S
2 0 2 0 G E N E R A L P L A N
L A N D   U S E  E L E M E N T
to land use, facilities, services, circulation, fire protection, safety, and open
space. These policies and standards are intended to prevent deficiencies in
access to water and sewer services, ensure conservation of the sensitive natural
environment, and address differences in Town and County land use regula-
tions.
Development in the Hillside Specific Plan area is prohibited outside of desig-
nated “least restrictive development areas” (LRDAs) unless it is compliant
with conditions established in the Plan.
b. Los Gatos Boulevard Plan
Adopted by Town Council in 1997, the Los Gatos Boulevard Specific Plan is
a policy framework for meeting a series of short, medium, and long range
goals related to the commercial revitalization of Los Gatos Boulevard. This
Specific Plan is based on a land use concept for which higher density, mixed-
use commercial development in the north of the Specific Plan area transitions
into residential and community clusters, and then into existing residential
neighborhoods just south of the Specific Plan area. This Specific Plan con-
tains policies and design standards targeting safe, attractive public improve-
ments; pedestrian-oriented activity nodes; vital, commercial land use; distinct
gateways, and site-appropriate private improvements.
c. Central Los Gatos Redevelopment Project
The Central Los Gatos Redevelopment Project, which focuses on an area lo-
cated around Downtown Los Gatos, contains a mix of residential and non-
residential land use designations. The Town of Los Gatos Redevelopment
Agency has the authority to facilitate property acquisition and management,
construction of public improvements, structural rehabilitation, and site as-
sembly within the Project Area. The project was adopted in 1991, following
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The main objectives of the project are to
eliminate blight, assemble land parcels for improved development, strengthen
the economic base of downtown, and improve undeveloped and underutilized
areas.

G. Goals, Policies, and Actions
The following goals, policies, and actions guide future physical development
throughout Los Gatos.
Goal LU-1         To preserve, promote, and protect the existing
                  small-town character and quality of life within Los
                  Gatos.
Policy LU-1.1     Encourage developers to engage in discussions as early as
                  possible regarding the nature and scope of the project and
                  possible impacts and mitigation requirements.
Policy LU-1.2     Ensure that new development preserves and promotes
                  existing commercial centers consistent with the mainte-
                  nance of a small-scale, small-town atmosphere and image.
Policy LU-1.3     To preserve existing trees, natural vegetation, natural to-
                  pography, riparian corridors and wildlife habitats, and
                  promote high quality, well-designed, environmentally sen-
                  sitive, and diverse landscaping in new and existing devel-
                  opments.
Policy LU-1.4     Infill projects shall be designed in context with the
                  neighborhood and surrounding zoning with respect to the
                  existing scale and character of surrounding structures, and
                  should blend rather than compete with the established
                  character of the area.
Policy LU-1.5     Encourage private/public funding, development, and op-
                  eration of cultural amenities, activities, and centers consis-
                  tent with the small-town character of Los Gatos.
                                                                           LU-21
T O W N O F L O S G A T O S
2 0 2 0 G E N E R A L P L A N
L A N D   U S E  E L E M E N T
Policy LU-1.6         Recognizing that our ability to preserve our small-town
                      character is somewhat dependent on decisions in sur-
                      rounding communities, continue and expand Town par-
                      ticipation in planning processes in neighboring jurisdic-
                      tions and regional bodies in order to develop innovative,
                      effective, and coordinated land use, transportation, and
                      hillside development plans and standards that will help
                      preserve our small-town character.
Policy LU-1.7         Use task forces, ad hoc committees and other means as
                      appropriate to involve residential and commercial interests
                      in Town matters.
Policy LU-1.8         Commercial development of any type (office, retail, re-
                      search and development, etc.) shall be designed in keeping
                      with the small-town character of Los Gatos.
Goal LU-2             To maintain a balanced, economically stable com-
                      munity within environmental goals.
Policies
Policy LU-2.1         Minimize vehicle miles traveled for goods and services by
                      allowing and encouraging stores that provide these goods
                      within walking distance of neighborhoods in Los Gatos.
Policy LU-2.2         Promote telecommuting and home-based businesses by
                      allowing live-work and work-live uses in existing and fu-
                      ture residential development.
Goal LU-3             To coordinate with surrounding jurisdictions and
                      other local and regional agencies that may affect Los
                      Gatos’s future development patterns and character.

Policies
Policy LU-3.1 Cooperate with the County of Santa Clara to encourage
              the annexation of unincorporated islands into the Town.
              The Town will not require the installation of curbs, gut-
              ters, sidewalks, or street lights as a condition of annexation
              nor will these improvements be imposed on annexed areas
              unless the residents of the area request such improvements
              and are willing to participate in the cost of such improve-
              ments. This does not prevent the Town from requiring
              such improvements as a condition of approval of any zon-
              ing or subdivision approval if such conditions are nor-
              mally made on those items and the improvements would
              be in keeping with the neighborhood.
Policy LU-3.2 Work with Santa Clara County to ensure that projects
              developed in the County meet Town policies and stan-
              dards, do not induce further development, and do not un-
              duly burden the Town.
Goal LU-4     To provide for well-planned, careful growth that re-
              flects the Town’s existing character and infrastruc-
              ture.
Policies
Policy LU-4.1 Integrate planning for the North Forty area, Los Gatos
              Boulevard, Vasona Light Rail area, and Downtown so that
              development in each area takes into consideration the
              Town as a whole.
Policy LU-4.2 Allow development only with adequate physical infra-

4 COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
  A. Introduction
  The Community Design Element is an optional element of the General Plan.
  This Element is intended to address the small town character of Los Gatos
  through its physical design elements.
  This Element is divided into the following sections. With the exception of
  the first section, each of the remaining sections has its own set of goals,
  policies, and actions:
    ♦ Key Features of the Los Gatos Community
    ♦ Town-Wide Design Principles
    ♦ Residential Neighborhoods
    ♦ Non-Residential Neighborhoods
    ♦ Downtown
    ♦ Historic Preservation
    ♦ Hillside Development
    ♦ Scenic Resources
    ♦ Design Review Process
  B. Key Features of the Los Gatos Community
  The Town’s history forms its existing character. Los Gatos was founded
  around the Forbes Mill, a flour mill built in 1854. Located in a heavily
  wooded area, the Town centered around the logging industry in the late 1800s
  and later became an agricultural town in the early 1900s. In the 1950s, the
  Town grew primarily as a suburb of the City of San Jose.
  Today, Los Gatos maintains its small town residential character and suburban
  roots. The remains of Forbes Mill and its 1880 annex have been converted
  into the History Museum of Los Gatos, a landmark now located in the Main
  Street and Civic Center neighborhood. Los Gatos is also defined by its
  beautiful natural setting in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which is integrated
  into the Town’s fabric through its views of forested hillsides, mature trees,
                                                                         CD-1

T O W N O F L O S G A T O S

C O M M U N I T Y   D E S I G N E L E M E N T
and creekside trails. Los Gatos is one of 152 communities in California to be
designated a “Tree City USA” and has been in the Tree City USA Program
since 1980. This program provides national recognition and technical
assistance to towns and cities for preserving and maintaining trees in their
jurisdictions.
The majority of Los Gatos is divided into single-family residential lots.
Mature trees cover much of the landscape, particularly in the hillside
neighborhoods. The small, urban area of Los Gatos is more densely knit,
particularly in the southwestern corner of the Town around Highway 17.
This area contains neighborhood and regional commercial corridors, as well
as civic and cultural uses, and is generally referred to by residents as
Downtown Los Gatos. Town-designated historic districts that include
structures dating back to the early 1900s are also located within and around
this Core Area. Development becomes less dense as it spreads south and east
into the hillside areas.
Today, the Town is situated within one of the largest metropolitan areas of
northern California and is closely tied to the fast-paced economy of Silicon
Valley. Nevertheless, the Town of Los Gatos still retains its small town char-
acter and offers a rich community fabric composed of a varied mix of residen-
tial, commercial, and light industrial uses that serve the residents and attract
visitors.
C. Town-Wide Design Principles
1. Background Information
In order to preserve Los Gatos’s unique character and high quality of life,
new development must meet very high standards, not only in its appearance
but also in its contributions to the social and economic life of the Town. The
Town has created and maintained an attractively built environment through
careful attention to the design of buildings, landscaping, public
improvements, and the preservation of the natural environment.

E. Non-Residential Areas
1. Background Information
Los Gatos has several commercial and industrial areas that are important to
the community. Downtown’s Santa Cruz Avenue corridor is pedestrian-
oriented with one- and two-story buildings housing various retail and
restaurants. It is a local destination for Los Gatos residents and residents of
neighboring communities in Silicon Valley. Los Gatos Boulevard is also a
major commercial corridor with several older shopping centers. These older
shopping centers are primarily commercial strip malls set back from Los
Gatos Boulevard with ample front parking spaces. The malls are typically
long, single-story structures with sidewalks and awnings. Near Blossom Hill
Road, Los Gatos Boulevard has higher density shopping centers with major
grocery anchor tenants.

G. Historic Preservation
1. Background Information
This section provides an historical overview that illustrates land use and
development patterns in Los Gatos from the historic period to the present.
Prior to California’s era of United States governance, Spanish and then
Mexican authorities granted large tracts of land to those who rendered
services to the government. These tracts, called ranchos, were extensive and
contained vast natural resources. Rancho Rinconada de los Gatos was granted
                                                                            CD-13

to Jose Hernandez and Sebastian Peralta by the Governor of Alta California
in May 1840. Because of the Mexican-American War in January 1853,
Hernandez and Peralta were forced to petition the United States Federal
Court in San Francisco to recognize their claim. In March 1860, the United
States government issued both men a patent to their 6,631-acre rancho. The
Peralta and Hernandez Adobe, originally constructed for Claude Simond, was
built in 1853 on Quito Road in the present Town of Los Gatos.
In 1850, Alexander Forbes, former Vice-Counsel in San Francisco for the
British Government, purchased 3,000 acres in the vicinity of Los Gatos Creek
on the Rancho Rinconada de Los Gatos, adjacent to the old Mission Trail
between Santa Clara and Santa Cruz. Forbes constructed a flour mill on the
east bank of Los Gatos Creek, which opened in 1854. The Town that grew
around this building was initially called Forbes Mill, then Forbestown, and
finally Los Gatos after the large wild cats that were so prevalent in the
surrounding mountains.
In the mid-1850s, Old Santa Cruz Highway opened along with the Southern
Pacific Coast Railroad (SPCRR), making Los Gatos an important Town for
the logging industry in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
The completion of the SPCRR in 1878 set the framework for Los Gatos’s
future prosperity. The rail line, which connected San Francisco to Santa
Cruz, passed through the Town and allowed passengers to transit the fertile
Santa Clara Valley. Many American and European families were drawn to
Los Gatos’s mild climate and began purchasing property and planting
orchards. In 1873, oil was discovered south of Los Gatos in an area known as
Moody Gulch. Oil was produced there until 1922 and, although no longer in
use, some oil rigs still remain. In 1958, the gulch was filled to make room for
State Route 17.
During the mid-1870s, the Town expanded to the west side of Los Gatos
Creek and land prices increased significantly. In 1877, Los Gatos was
incorporated and census records list 1,500 inhabitants within the Town’s

limits. During this period of expansion, the Downtown area of Los Gatos
began to develop. The Los Gatos Hotel, originally built in the mid-1860s,
was enlarged in 1878. The Los Gatos Gas Company was organized in 1885, at
about the same time as the Los Gatos Ice Works, the Bank of Los Gatos, and
the Los Gatos and Saratoga Wine Company. In 1886, the Los Gatos school-
house was built, and by 1881 the Town had at least two churches.
The railroad made it possible for Los Gatos farmers to ship their produce all
over the country. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Los Gatos became a
major agricultural area known for its apricots, prunes, grapes, and peaches.
Fruit orchards and logging, Los Gatos’s main industries through World War
I, began to weaken during the Depression and through World War II. During
the period after World War II, however, the Town experienced strong
residential and commercial growth, which continues to the present day.
Today, the Town of Los Gatos has an Historic Preservation Code dedicated
to preserving historic and architectural resources in Los Gatos. The Code
establishes a Historic Preservation Committee and a Historic Preservation
Program that includes a comprehensive series of standards and guidelines
concerning the preservation and demolition of historic structures, design
guidelines for rehabilitation and new construction, and guidance in the
application of historic preservation standards. The Town recognizes an
historic resource as follows: any structure/site that is located within an
historic district; any structure/site that is historically designated; or any
primary structure constructed prior to 1941, unless the Town has determined
that the structure has no historic significance or architectural merit. The
Town Council designates landmark sites and districts by ordinance. Los
Gatos has five historic districts, described below and illustrated on Figure
CD-1.
  ♦ Downtown Commercial Historic District. This district is bounded by
     Elm Street to the north, Main Street to the south, Los Gatos Creek to the
     east, and North Santa Cruz Avenue to the west. It is Los Gatos’s only
     surviving concentration of intact historic commercial buildings and

  includes the Town’s earliest commercial roadway intersection and one-
  half of the 19th century commercial center. Architectural styles in this
  district include Queen Anne, Richardsonian Romanesque, and Art Deco,
  all in typical commercial styles with large display windows. None of the
  buildings exceed two and a half stories and the majority front directly on
  the sidewalk.
♦ Fairview Plaza Historic District. Fairview Plaza was the original name
  given to the cul-de-sac termination in the subdivision known as “Fairview
  Addition.” Fairview Plaza retains the same configuration as originally
  mapped, with houses oriented around a landscaped park. Approximately
  three quarters of the homes within the subdivision were built prior to
  1900 and retain the character of that era. The pedestrian walk labeled
  “Turnstile Walk” on the original map remains essentially unchanged and
  is located at the eastern end of the cul-de-sac. Fairview Plaza is a rare and
  unique neighborhood because of the authentic, well-maintained Victorian
  and Craftsman houses in proximity to one another.
  Almond Grove Historic District. This district is bounded by Bean
  Avenue to the south, Glen Ridge Avenue to the west, the lots facing
  Saratoga Avenue to the north, and the lots facing Santa Cruz Avenue to
  the east. The lots facing Saratoga and Santa Cruz Avenues bound, but are
  not included in, the district. Homes in this district represent the first and
  largest subdivision developed after the incorporation of Los Gatos. The
  land was once part of an almond orchard owned by John Mason and
  Edward Auzerais, two prominent Santa Clara County landowners.
  Almond Grove was developed by four important figures in Los Gatos
  history: Alphonse Eli Wilder, Augustine Nicholson, Magnus Tait, and
  John Bean. Many important contributors to the Town’s development
  lived in this district.
♦ University/Edelen Historic District. This district is bounded by
  Saratoga Avenue to the north, Main Street to the south, Los Gatos Creek
  to the east, and the former SPCRR right-of-way to the west. It was
  originally part of the Mason Tract.               Victorian architecture is
  predominant in this district, including informal wood frame cottages and
                                                                           CD-17

      impressive homes, intermixed with Craftsman/Bungalow-style cottages
      built somewhat later. Also present in smaller numbers are Colonial
      Revival buildings. Both residential and commercial building types
      comprise the district.
  ♦ Broadway Historic District. This district generally includes properties
      south of West Main Street and west of Santa Cruz Avenue. A 100-acre
      tract of land, including what is now the Broadway area, was purchased by
      Henry McCobb in 1863. McCobb planned to subdivide the land and
      name the new city Cobbsville, but ultimately sold it to John Lyndon,
      who subdivided the area into 48 lots in 1881, each selling for $125 and up.
      In 1883, Broadway was opened up to provide access to the Lyndon
      Subdivision. Broadway was the first plotted residential street. The
      Broadway District was the first residential subdivision in what is now
      Los Gatos. Scattered houses and businesses, such as Forbes Mill,
      preceded Broadway, but this subdivision marked the beginnings of a
      formally laid-out town.

H. Hillside Development
1. Background Information
The Hillsides comprise most of the southern portion of Los Gatos. Rural in
character, hillside areas boast larger, wooded lots and private access roads. In
January 2004, the Town adopted the Hillside Development Standards and
Guidelines, which apply to all new hillside development and major hillside
additions and renovations. The Hillside Development Standards and
Guidelines and Hillside Specific Plan, as well as the following goals, policies,
and actions, focus on the design and character of hillside development.
2.  Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal CD-14           To preserve the natural beauty and ecological
                     integrity of the Santa Cruz Mountains and
                     surrounding hillsides by regulating new homes.
Policies
Policy CD-14.1       Minimize development and preserve and enhance the rural
                     atmosphere and natural plant and wildlife habitats in the
                     hillsides.
Policy CD-14.2       Limit hillside development to that which can be safely
                     accommodated by the Town’s rural, two-lane roads.
Policy CD-14.3       Effective visible mass shall be reduced through such means
                     as stepping structures up and down the hillside, following
                     topographical contours, and limiting the height and mass
                     of wall planes. A maximum of two stories shall be visible
                     from every elevation.
Policy CD-14.4       Projection above the ridge view protection line is
                     prohibited. All building plans shall indicate height in
                     relationship to the ridge view protection line when viewed
                     from specific vantage points and the valley floor.
                                                                              CD-21

Policy CD-14.5       Staff shall require adequate environmental analysis for
                     projects in the hillside area to ensure appropriate
                     consideration of potential environmental impacts
                     associated with projects.
Policy CD-14.6       Preserve and protect the natural state of the Santa Cruz
                     Mountains and surrounding hillsides by discouraging
                     inappropriate development on and near the hillsides that
                     significantly impacts viewsheds.
Policy CD-14.7       The Town shall continue to work with the County in
                     updating the County’s Hillside Development Standards,
                     and shall encourage annexations within the Urban Service
                     Boundary.
Actions
Action CD-14.1       Design and implement programs and procedures to
                     mitigate the effects of past developments, and to review

               line.
Policy CD-15.3 New construction shall be designed to follow natural land
               contours and avoid mass grading. When possible, flat pads
               should be avoided and houses should be designed to
               conform to or step down the contours rather than be
               designed for flat pads. Grading large, flat yard areas
               should be avoided.
Policy CD-15.4 Hillside landscaping shall be designed with the following
               goals in mind:
                a.   Minimizing formal landscaping and hardscape.
                b. Siting formal landscaping and hardscape close to the
                     house.
                c.   Following the natural topography.
                d.   Preserving native trees, native plant and wildlife
                     habitats, and migration corridors.

               grading and landscaping and minimal disruption of
               existing native plants and wildlife habitat.
Policy CD-15.6 Fences shall be of open design unless required for privacy.
               A minimal amount of land shall be enclosed by fences over
               five feet high.

                      d.   The effects of indoor lights should be studied and
                           reduced if found to be excessive.
Actions
Action CD-15.1       Determine maximum buildable slope and revise the Town
                     Code accordingly.
Action CD-15.2       Revise the Town’s grading policy to be consistent with the
                     General Plan, Hillside Specific Plan, and Hillside
                     Development Standards and Guidelines.
I.    Scenic Resources
1. Background Information
Los Gatos is located at the base of the Santa Cruz Mountains and is
surrounded by views of these mountains, particularly the Sierra Azul ridge.
Major streets heading north-south in Los Gatos have views of the ridge to the
south. Because of the heavily-wooded nature of the Town, most views are
blocked by trees. Some homes in the hillsides have views of the Town and
the surrounding area. These views of and from the hillsides help orient
residents and visitors within the Town. Because scenic resources are an
important part of Los Gatos’s identity, the Town sets forth policies that are
intended to preserve and protect them.
2.    Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal CD-16           Promote and           protect    viewsheds  and    scenic
                     resources.
Policies
Policy CD-16.1       Prevent development that significantly depletes, damages
                     or alters existing landscape vistas.

  The Housing Element is a required Element of the General Plan. It is
  currently being updated utilizing a separate process consistent with State law.
  Therefore it is not published with the 2020 General Plan at this time.
  Pending approval by the California Department of Housing and Community
  Development (HCD) and the Town of Los Gatos, the Housing Element will
  be included in the Los Gatos 2020 General Plan. The Draft Housing Element
  was submitted to HCD on December 8, 2009 and is available for review on
  the General Plan website at http://www.lggeneralplanupdate.org. A revised
  draft of the Housing Element was submitted to HCD on August 23, 2010 and
  is also available for review on the General Plan website.

6 TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
  A.    Introduction
  This Element addresses various aspects of transportation including the hierar-
  chy of highways, roadway capacity, hillside circulation, cut-through traffic,
  and public transit. This element also addresses a convenient, safe, and accessi-
  ble trails and bikeways system that promotes alternative modes of transporta-
  tion such as walking and bicycling. When designing or making improve-
  ments to the circulation system, the Town shall conserve prominent land
  forms, minimize the removal of trees, minimize grading, and ensure that pro-
  posed infrastructure, parking, and street improvements are well landscaped
  and compatible with the surrounding neighborhoods and undeveloped areas.
  The goals, policies, and actions in the Transportation Element are consistent
  and interdependent with the other elements of the General Plan. This Ele-
  ment meets State-mandated requirements.
  The Transportation Element includes the following sections:
    ♦ Introduction: A description of the contents of the Transportation Ele-
       ment.
    ♦ Roadway System and Standards: Definitions and descriptions of the
       types of roadways and service standards for Los Gatos.
    ♦ Existing Transportation Conditions: A description of traffic operations
       in Los Gatos.
    ♦ Other Transportation Networks and Facilities: Descriptions of bike-
       ways and trails, truck routes, rail, bus, paratransit, parking facilities, and
       pedestrian facilities.
    ♦ Planned and Proposed Transportation Improvements: Descriptions of
       planned and proposed transportation improvements for regional and lo-
       cal transportation infrastructure in Los Gatos.
    ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: A list of goal, policy, and action statements
       that are intended to improve transportation and circulation in Los Gatos.

B. Roadway System and Standards
This section describes the regional highway system, local circulation system,
and level of service standards for Los Gatos. The functional roadway classifi-
cations described in this section are illustrated on Figure TRA-1.
1. Regional Highway System
Three major highways—Highways 9, 17, and 85—run through Los Gatos and
create two major interchanges, one in the northern end of Los Gatos and one
in the southern end. Highway 17 runs north-south through Los Gatos, con-
necting to San Jose and Santa Cruz and providing regional access to Interstate
880 and Highway 85. Highway 9 runs east-west through the southern end of
Los Gatos, connecting to Highway 17, and south through the Santa Cruz
Mountains to Highway 1. Highway 85 runs east-west through the northern
end of Los Gatos and provides regional access to Highway 101 and south San
Jose, Interstate 280, Interstate 880/Highway 17, and Highway 87 (Guadalupe
Freeway).
2. Functional Classifications of the Local Circulation System
In Los Gatos, the local street system is organized in a hierarchy of six types of
roadways. Arterial streets, collector streets, neighborhood collector streets,
hillside collector streets, local streets, and special design streets augment the
regional highway system by serving local automobile traffic. This hierarchy
is based on the degree of mobility and amount of local access provided by a
roadway.
a. Arterial Streets
Arterial streets are designed to facilitate two or more lanes of traffic in each
direction and provide intra-community travel and access to the county-wide
highway system. Arterial streets may be divided by a median island that con-
trols left turns and provides lanes for left-turn movements. Access to com-
munity arterials should be provided at collector roads and local streets.
An arterial street serves a large volume of vehicular traffic with intersections
at grade and generally has direct access to abutting property, with geometric

design and traffic control measures used to expedite the safe movement of
through traffic. Examples of arterial streets include Los Gatos Boulevard and
Blossom Hill Road.
b. Collector Streets
A collector street provides circulation within and between neighborhoods.
Collectors usually serve short trips and are intended for collecting trips from
local streets and distributing them to the arterial network. Collectors serve
abutting property and carry traffic to the other collectors and arterials. Ex-
amples of collector streets include Main Street and North Santa Cruz Avenue.
c. Neighborhood Collector Streets
A neighborhood collector street is located in an identifiable neighborhood
and carries traffic that is predominantly generated within that neighborhood.
Examples of neighborhood collector streets include Shannon Road and
Wedgewood Avenue.
d. Hillside Collector Streets
A hillside collector street serves abutting property in the hillside areas, carry-
ing traffic to arterial streets or other collectors. The cross-section of the hill-
side collector is dictated by grade, topography, and the presence of biological
resources. In general, two lanes with or without sidewalks along one side
(depending on topography) are provided. College Avenue is an example of a
hillside collector street.
e. Local Streets
Local streets provide for neighborhood traffic movement with direct access to
abutting property. These streets carry traffic from individual properties to
collector and arterial streets, and are designed to discourage through traffic.
Most of the residential streets in Los Gatos fall into this category.
f. Special Design Streets
Special design streets are utilized where warranted by unique land use, circula-
tion conditions, or environmental conditions. These streets can either be

arterial streets, collectors, existing local hillside streets, or scenic residential
streets. Their design will take into consideration the following features:
  ♦ Retention of existing physical amenities;
  ♦ Protection of existing trees within the existing right-of-way; and
  ♦ Special treatment of transition sections when conforming to standard
     street sections.
Examples of special design streets in Los Gatos include North Santa Cruz
Avenue and Montebello Way.
3. Level of Service Standards
Level of service is a scale that measures the amount of auto traffic that a
roadway or intersection accommodates, based on such factors as maneuver-
ability, driver dissatisfaction, and delay at intersections. The Town of Los
Gatos utilizes the level of service measurements established for Santa Clara
County by the VTA. Based on these measurements, it is possible to deter-
mine the impact of auto traffic at intersections throughout the Town.
Levels of service are best represented by a letter scale that ranges from level of
service (LOS) A to LOS F. As shown in Table TRA-1, LOS A represents the
fastest flow of traffic and LOS F represents significantly congested conditions.
LOS D is an acceptable level of traffic operation at intersections in Los Gatos.
C. Existing Transportation Conditions
Los Gatos is a member of the Santa Clara County Congestion Management
Agency (CMA). The primary goals of the CMA are to increase the efficiency
of existing transit and roadway systems, plan the best capital improvements
to these systems, and improve the local land use decision-making process.
The CMA prepares and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA) adopts the biennial Congestion Management Program (CMP). The
CMP is a comprehensive program designed to reduce traffic congestion, en-
hance the effectiveness of land use decision-making and improve air quality.

There are five CMP routes in Los Gatos: Highways 9, 17, and 85; Los Gatos
Boulevard from Highway 85 to Lark Avenue; and Lark Avenue from Los
Gatos Boulevard to Highway 17. There are three CMP intersections in Los
Gatos that are reviewed annually in conformance with CMP requirements:
Lark Avenue and Los Gatos Boulevard; Highway 9 and Santa Cruz Avenue;
and Highway 9 and University Avenue.
In accordance with the CMP’s transportation impact analysis guidelines, any
land use project that generates 100 or more new peak hour trips must be
submitted to the CMA to ensure that the additional traffic impact is mitigated

on any road or intersection, regardless of jurisdiction. In accordance with
Town policy, any land use project that adds 20 or more new peak hour trips
is required to prepare a comprehensive traffic analysis report.
Traffic operations, under current traffic conditions, were evaluated at 38 sig-
nalized and unsignalized intersections selected by Town staff. Traffic volumes
were collected during the school year during weekday AM and PM peak pe-
riods, which are from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., re-
spectively. Results of the level of service analysis are presented in Table
TRA-2, along with the minimum jurisdictional standard for acceptable level
of service and current traffic control at each intersection. According to
evaluation results, the intersection of Lark Avenue and University Avenue
does not currently satisfy operational standards. Detailed evaluation results
are included in the Los Gatos 2020 General Plan EIR.
D. Other Transportation Networks and Facilities
1. Trails and Bikeways
Los Gatos contains several multi-use trails and bikeways, which provide im-
portant connections and recreational opportunities for residents and visitors.
Figure TRA-2 indicates the locations of existing and proposed bikeways and
multi-use trails within Los Gatos. Los Gatos has several bikeway types and
trails, described below.
  ♦ Class I Paved Multi-Use Trail: A Class I Multi-Use Trail is an off-street
     path with exclusive right-of-way for non-motorized transportation used
     for commuting as well as recreation.
  ♦ Class II Paved Bike Lanes: Class II Bike Lanes are preferential use areas
     within a roadway designated for bicycles.
  ♦ Class III Paved Bike Routes: Class III Bike Routes are signed bike routes
     that provide a connection through residential, downtown, and ru-
     ral/hillside areas to Class I and Class II bike lanes. Bike Routes serve as
     transportation routes within neighborhoods to parks, schools, and other
     community amenities.

   ♦ Unpaved Recreation Trails: An unpaved recreation trail is a semi-natural
     trail used by pedestrians, equestrians, and/or bicycles that should provide
     connections to Open Space District or Santa Clara County trail systems.
i. Los Gatos Bikeways
Los Gatos also contains on-street bikeways that enable bicyclists to travel
within the community, as well as connect to larger trail networks. Class II
bikeways are striped bike lanes that give bicyclists shared use of the roadway.
Class III bike routes share the roadway with vehicular traffic and include
signs to direct bicyclists and drivers.
ii. Los Gatos Creek Trail
As a dedicated pathway for non-motorized activities and with a minimum
width of 8 feet to accommodate two-way travel, the portion of the Los Gatos
Creek Trail north of where Main Street intersects Highway 17 is the only
recognized Class I bikeway in Los Gatos. South of the Main Street-Highway
17 intersection, the Los Gatos Creek Trail becomes an unpaved, multi-use
trail leading to Lexington Reservoir.
iii. Open Space Trails
In addition to the Los Gatos Creek Trail, all of the open space areas, as well as
some of the Town’s parks, contain trails that are appropriate for hiking, bik-
ing, jogging, horseback riding, and other informal non-motorized activities.
These trails are located in Belgatos Park, Novitiate Park, Worcester Park, the
Heinz Open Space, Santa Rosa Open Space Area, St. Joseph’s Hill Open
Space Preserve, and the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve.

Gatos, immediately south of Highway 85 and east of Winchester Boulevard.
4. Passenger Rail
The Vasona Light Rail project is projected to extend the existing light rail line
from the Winchester Station in Campbell to the Vasona Junction Station at
Highway 85 and Winchester Boulevard in Los Gatos. The Vasona Light Rail
will connect Los Gatos residents to bus service, Caltrain, and future transfers
to other nearby cities. The timeframe of this extension project is subject to
available funding.
5. Bus Service
In 2010, the VTA provides bus service throughout the Town on the Regular
Bus and Community Bus routes listed below. Community Buses are short,
25-passenger buses that serve routes with smaller riderships and offer reduced
fares.
  ♦ Route 27 – Regular Bus from             ♦ Route 61 – Regular Bus from
      Santa Teresa Hospital to Good           Good Samaritan Hospital to Si-

individuals with disabilities that prevent their independent use of VTA bus
and light rail services. As VTA’s paratransit broker, OUTREACH schedules
and manages services delivered to eligible customers through contracts with
sedan, accessible van, and taxi service providers.

7. Parking
Los Gatos has a variety of parking options throughout the Town, including
on-street parking with and without time restrictions, and off-street parking
lots. Some off-street lots have time restrictions and others do not. In some
specifically designated residential neighborhoods a parking permit is required.
The Police Department is responsible for the Parking Management Program
in Los Gatos.
8. Pedestrian Facilities
The Town’s pedestrian facilities consist of sidewalks along various roadways
within Los Gatos. These provide pedestrian connectivity throughout the
Town. Sidewalk facilities are primarily included as part of the transportation
network along and connecting Arterial, Collector, Neighborhood, and Local
streets. The Los Gatos Creek Trail is also used by pedestrians to access the
Downtown area and parks from residential areas.
E. Planned and Proposed Transportation Improvements
This section describes planned and proposed improvements to the regional
and local transportation infrastructure in Los Gatos.
1. Regional Improvements
VTA’s recently adopted 2035 Valley Transportation Plan (VTP) includes
proposed transportation improvements for all Santa Clara County communi-
ties, including Los Gatos. Table TRA-3 lists the proposed improvements in
the Town of Los Gatos that are included in the final draft of the VTP for
2035.
2. Local Intersection and Roadway Improvements
The following road improvements shall be undertaken in order to accommo-
date the future development allowed under the 2020 General Plan and to alle-
viate existing traffic congestion. Any road widening improvements shall be
justified based on a determination that alternative means of congestion relief
are infeasible.
                                                                            TRA-13

a. Intersection improvements
Intersection improvements are planned at the following intersections:
  ♦ Los Gatos – Saratoga Road (Highway 9) and University Avenue: Widen
    University Avenue by adding turn lanes, install protected left-turn signal
    phases, modify intersection corners, close the median opening for safety
    improvements, and reconstruct the intersection as a Downtown gateway
    to improve safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicular traffic. Widen
    University Avenue to add a southbound right-turn lane and extend
    northbound right-turn lane to Boyer Lane. This project has been
    awarded Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) grant funds.
  ♦ Blossom Hill Road and Los Gatos Boulevard: Add a second eastbound
    left-turn lane and extend southbound left-turn lane.
  ♦ Lark Avenue and University Avenue: Install traffic signal and signal in-
    terconnect connecting to Winchester Boulevard.
  ♦ Winchester Boulevard and Knowles Drive: Add an eastbound left turn
    lane and right turn overlap phase.
  ♦ Winchester Boulevard and Lark Avenue: Provide a dedicated receiving
    lane for a westbound right turn.
  ♦ Los Gatos Boulevard and Samaritan Drive: Add a third northbound
    through lane. Add a westbound right turn overlap phase. The addition
    of the westbound right turn overlap phase is outside the jurisdiction of
    Los Gatos and is the responsibility of the City of San Jose if the projected
    level of congestion occurs. Widen Burton Road as needed.
  ♦ Los Gatos Boulevard and Lark Avenue: Add a third southbound
    through lane, remove parking on the south side of Los Gatos Boulevard
    between Lark Avenue and the first driveway south of Lark Avenue to
    provide sufficient room for a fourth lane in that section of the roadway.
    Change the southbound right turn to a free right with the widening of
    Lark Avenue. Add a third northbound left-turn lane if the projected
    queuing occurs requiring stacking space. Add a third eastbound left turn
    lane.
                                                                          TRA-15

   ♦ Los Gatos – Saratoga Road (Highway 9) and North Santa Cruz Avenue:
      Add a southbound right turn overlap phase and prohibit the eastbound
      U-turn movement. Reconstruct as a Downtown gateway.
   ♦ Los Gatos – Almaden Road and Union Avenue: Restripe the westbound
      approach to a through-shared-left lane and a right-turn lane and add a
      westbound right turn overlap phase. Restripe the northbound right turn
      lane to a through-shared-right turn lane. The improvements at this inter-
      section are outside the jurisdiction of Los Gatos and are the responsibility
      of San Jose if the projected level of congestion occurs.
   ♦ National Avenue and Samaritan Drive: Work with adjacent property
      owners, the City of San Jose and future developments to improve traffic
      safety and flow at this intersection.
b. Roadway improvements
Roadway improvement projects are planned on the following roadways:
i.    Blossom Hill Road
   ♦ Bridge Widening at Highway 17: Reconstruct and widen bridge over
      Highway 17 to provide sidewalks and bike lanes on both sides, and evalu-
      ate the need for additional street lighting and traffic lanes based on safety
      considerations for pedestrians and bicyclists.
   ♦ Blossom Hill Park to Union Avenue: Widening only to provide for left-
      turn storage lanes, bicycles and pedestrians and safety improvements.
   ♦ Union Avenue to Westhill Drive: Widening only as additional land be-
      comes available through right-of-way dedications associated with devel-
      opment approvals, or as additional funding sources become available to
      the Town for the purpose of acquiring additional land for right-of-way
      and infrastructure improvements.
   ♦ Cherry Blossom Lane to Camino Del Cerro: Addition of sidewalk and
      bike lanes.
   ♦ Union Avenue to Regent Drive: Widen to conform with the roadway
      width east of Regent Drive.

Policy TRA-1.2      Design and implement the transportation system to be
                    consistent with environmental goals and policies, energy
                    conservation, land use, and small town character.
Policy TRA-1.3      Evaluate the effects of all circulation and other transporta-
                    tion improvements on air pollution, noise, and use of en-
                    ergy prior to issuing any zoning approval.
Policy TRA-1.4      Consider the fiscal implications to the Town of the con-
                    struction and operation of all circulation and transporta-
                    tion improvements and the enforcement of any associated
                    regulations.
Policy TRA-1.5      Make effective use of the traffic-carrying ability of Los
                    Gatos’s arterials and collectors while considering the needs
                    of pedestrians, bicyclists, and adjacent residents.

T R A N S P O R T A T I O N   E L E M E N T
Action TRA-1.2       Monitor traffic flow and roadway conditions. Identify
                     deficiencies and develop improvement measures for road-
                     ways and intersections on a continuous basis.
Goal TRA-2         To create and maintain a safe, efficient and well-
                   designed roadway network.
Policies
Policy TRA-2.1       Vehicular, bicyclist, and pedestrian safety should be an
                     important factor in the design of roadways.
Policy TRA-2.2       Incorporate plans for all users (motor vehicles, transit ve-
                     hicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians) when constructing or
                     modifying a roadway.
Policy TRA-2.3       The Town shall obtain fee title to all land required to be
                     dedicated for public streets.
Policy TRA-2.4       New development shall minimize the number of driveway
                     openings and curb cuts.
Policy TRA-2.5       Discourage single access roads of extended length, and re-
                     strict development along such roads.
Policy TRA-2.6       Street improvements such as curb cuts, sidewalks, bus stop
                     turnouts, bus shelters, light poles, traffic signals, benches,
                     and trash containers shall be planned as an integral part of
                     development projects to ensure safe movement of people
                     and vehicles and minimize disruption to the streetscape.
Policy TRA-2.7       Consider using roundabouts as an alternative to signalized
                     or traditionally controlled intersections to calm traffic and
                     increase the capacity of intersections.

7 VASONA LIGHT RAIL ELEMENT
  A. Introduction
  Vasona Light Rail (VLR) mass transit facilities are projected to be extended
  along Winchester Boulevard and will link the Town with the rest of Silicon
  Valley and the Bay Area. The Town is actively working on planning
  processes to address how it can take advantage of the mass transit
  opportunities presented by these connections.
  It is critical that the Town take advantage of the opportunities and respond to
  the challenges created by the VLR. The unique nature of these transportation
  facilities necessitates that the Town take a proactive role in planning for the
  future of the surrounding areas. The VLR, as well as the land uses planned
  for this area, will affect and benefit the entire community.
  This Element is divided into the following sections:
   ♦ History: Provides background information about the background of this
       area within Los Gatos.
   ♦ Guiding Philosophy: Provides an overview of how the Town will help to
       guide future development and planning processes in this area.
   ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: Provides guidance to the Town related to
       decisions affecting this area.
  B. History
  In October 1990 the Town Council approved several agreements with the
  State Department of Transportation and the Santa Clara County Traffic
  Authority regarding the design of Highway 85. The agreements allowed for
  the construction of a six-lane freeway through the Town with a median
  reserved for mass transit. Since the opening of Highway 85 in October 1994,
  traffic patterns in the Town have changed significantly. A reduction of traffic
  volumes on some arterials and collector streets has occurred, while others
  have experienced increases. Highway 85 is approaching capacity during the
  peak commute hours, but is still a desirable primary transportation route.
                                                                           VLR-1

V A S O N A   L I G H T R A I L E L E M E N T
The future mass transit system will help alleviate a portion of the existing
commute traffic.
The VLR is proposed to utilize the existing Southern Pacific Railroad tracks
adjacent to Winchester Boulevard. The mass transit system would connect
the Town of Los Gatos to the City of San Jose. This system would provide a
much needed means of connecting Los Gatos to regional mass transit systems
in the rest of the Silicon Valley and Bay Area. The VLR area is shown on
Figure VLR-1. Generally, it is bounded by Capri Drive and Winchester
Boulevard on the west, Vasona Lake on the south, National Avenue on the
east and the northern Town limits.
Since the VLR will have a significant impact on transportation within the
Town, it is critical to determine what land uses will best take advantage of
these transportation facilities as well as meet the needs of the Town. The
Town has taken a proactive approach on this important issue and supports
land uses that maximize transit opportunities while meeting the housing and
commercial needs of the Town.
As stated in the Housing Element, Los Gatos has a need for affordable
housing, both for seniors and families. Areas adjacent to the VLR facility
would be good locations for meeting these Town needs due to their
proximity to mass transit and to commercial needs of the future residents.
Los Gatos is a special place, and it is important to demarcate The Town’s
boundaries when entering or leaving from/to other cities. Open space and
gateways, including open space as gateways, are a means of doing so. The
VLR area offers opportunities to preserve and use open space for this
purpose.

The current uses of these parcels range from orchards to underutilized
residential property to manufacturing. The commonality of all of these
parcels is their proximity to future mass transit and their capability to help
the Town meet its housing goals. The Town is working to identify which
types of housing are best suited for the area, and where new development
should be constructed. This area also has easy access to both Highway 85 and
Highway 17 and includes connections to several major arterials including
Winchester and Los Gatos Boulevards and Lark Avenue. These large
underdeveloped parcels may be suitable for other commercial or recreational
uses. Throughout the process of preparing this Element, a basic planning
philosophy has served as the foundation for designating land uses in the area:
development should be community-, pedestrian- and transit-oriented, and
designed and scaled to maintain a small-town character. This Element
consists of goals, policies, and actions that apply specifically to the VLR area.
D. Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal VLR-1          To promote the construction of Vasona Light Rail
                    and mass transit facilities.
Policies
Policy VLR-1.1        Circulation planning for the Town shall recognize the
                      potential for mass transit connections via the Vasona Light
                      Rail.
Policy VLR-1.2        Coordinate and proactively participate with other
                      communities and agencies to ensure that the proposed
                      mass transit facilities are acceptable to the Town.
Policy VLR-1.3        Future development shall contribute financially to support
                      transit services that link the Vasona Light Rail with the
                      rest of Los Gatos.

8 OPEN SPACE, PARKS, AND RECREATION ELEMENT
  A. Introduction
  The Open Space, Parks, and Recreation Element guides the long-range pres-
  ervation and conservation of open space as well as the park and recreational
  facilities. These areas and facilities enhance the character of the Town, help-
  ing to create a unique and pleasant atmosphere for Town residents and visi-
  tors. This Element also addresses prehistoric and Native American resources
  indigenous to Los Gatos. Most of the information in this Element regarding
  open space, parks, and recreational facilities is based on the Los Gatos Open
  Space Inventory, conducted in 2008. The Open Space Element is divided into
  the following sections:
    ♦ Government Code Open Space Classifications: A description of how
       this General Plan addresses the six types of open space dictated by Cali-
       fornia Government Code.
    ♦ Open Space and Preserves: A description of the open space areas and
       preserves in Los Gatos.
    ♦ Existing Parks and Recreational Facilities: A description of parks and
       recreational facilities in Los Gatos.
    ♦ Prehistoric and Native American Resources: A description of prehistory
       and Native American peoples that have lived in the Los Gatos.
    ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: A list of goal, policy, and action statements
       intended to preserve and conserve open space, parks, and recreation in
       Los Gatos.
  B. Government Code Open Space Classifications
  The Government Code requires that General Plans identify and address six
  types of open space. This Element addresses open space for outdoor recrea-
  tion, and open space for the protection of Native American sacred sites, while
  other elements in this General Plan cover the other four types of open space.
  Table OSP-1 lists the six open space types, and describes where each type is
  addressed in this General Plan.

C. Open Space and Preserves
Open space areas and preserves within Los Gatos protect the area’s natural
beauty and contribute to a regional system of hiking, biking, and equestrian
trails. As shown in Figure OSP-1, the Town of Los Gatos contains a total of
four open space areas, all of which are publicly-owned and operated and total
approximately 1,160 acres of wildlife and plant habitat. Two of the open
space areas — Santa Rosa Open Space and Heinz Open Space — are located on
Town-owned land and are maintained by the Parks and Public Works De-
partment (PPW), while the other two — St. Joseph’s Hill Open Space Pre-
serve and the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve — are owned and operated by
the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (MROSD). The MROSD is a
special regional district that was created in the 1970s to acquire and preserve
open space lands and provide and maintain access for public enjoyment. All
of the open space areas offer abundant natural beauty and are available to the
entire community for low-intensity recreation and environmental education.
1. Acquisition of Open Space Areas
To enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors the Town of Los
Gatos actively participates in the acquisition of properties as open space.
Whether acting individually or in collaboration with other agencies, non-
profits, or private land owners, the Town seeks to acquire open space areas
that contribute to the protection of the environment and the safety of resi-
dents.
2. Access to Open Space Areas
The Town recognizes that open space areas, particularly regional open space
areas, need to be easily accessible to all residents and visitors. To that end, the
Town encourages development of appropriate staging areas and trail heads for
equestrians, hikers, and bicyclists. Additionally, the Town understands and
works to ensure that access is available for physically disabled persons.
3. Open Space and Existing Neighborhoods
Within Los Gatos, the Town endeavors to provide open space access areas
that are designed in a manner that benefits the user without creating a burden
                                                                               OSP-3

on existing neighborhoods. This unobtrusive approach allows for a more
pleasant outdoor experience and preserves the character of each neighbor-
hood.
4. Open Space, Development, and Hillside Preservation
The Town’s hillside areas are unique and add to the quality of life of Town
residents and visitors. While much of the Town is considered built out, op-
portunities to develop in the hillside areas remain. The Town’s Hillside Spe-
cific Plan and Hillside Development Standards and Guidelines ensure that
open space areas in the Hillsides are preserved to the greatest extent possible
by the Town. The viewsheds and existing character of the hillsides and open
space areas are carefully maintained through the implementation of this Gen-
eral Plan and the Town’s various planning processes.
D. Existing Parks and Recreational Facilities
In addition to the four open space areas and preserves described above, the
Town has a total of 37 parks and recreational facilities. The following facili-
ties are illustrated in Figure OSP-1 and further described in this section.
  ♦  Fifteen Town-owned and operated facilities
  ♦  Two Santa Clara County Parks and Recreation facilities
  ♦  Nine local public school district facilities
  ♦  One community-based facility
  ♦  Five faith-based facilities
  ♦  One private school facility
  ♦  Four private athletic club facilities
1. Town Parks
Local parks are essential to the quality of life for many Los Gatos residents,
providing recreational opportunities, neighborhood gathering facilities, and
natural beauty throughout the community. The Town of Los Gatos contains
a total of seventeen publicly-owned and operated parks. As stated above, 15
of these parks are located on Town-owned land and are maintained by the
                                                                              OSP-5

PPW and the remaining two parks are owned and operated by the Santa
Clara County Parks and Recreation Department. In total, there are ap-
proximately 240 acres of parkland within Los Gatos, containing nearly seven
miles of multi-use trails and over 65 acres of lawn area.
2. Major Recreational Facilities
Los Gatos has 15 recreational facilities containing one or more sports fields
on-site. Table OSP-2 provides a summary of each facility’s fields and recrea-
tional league use. As shown in the table, 13 of the 15 identified facilities cur-
rently have one or more baseball fields, for a total of 24 baseball fields.
These facilities are owned by public, quasi-public, and private organizations,
including:
  ♦   Town of Los Gatos
  ♦   Los Gatos Union Elementary School District
  ♦   Los Gatos-Saratoga Joint Union High School District
  ♦   Los Gatos Union School District
  ♦   Campbell Union School District
  ♦   Community or faith-based groups
  ♦   A private school
Of the 15 facilities, two are unavailable for use by outside groups or leagues.
Out of the 13 facilities available for use by outside leagues or teams, six have
availability for additional activities and scheduled uses – Balzer Field, Blossom
Hill Park, Live Oak Manor Park, Oak Meadow Park, Rolling Hills Middle
School, and the Mulberry School.
Two of the facilities with fields have complete availability during the spring
season: Oak Meadow Park and the Mulberry School. However, Oak
Meadow Park is generally a high-use park where picnicking, use of the play-
ground, hiking, and biking occur. Organized athletic activities would dis-
place these informal uses. In addition, the Mulberry School is currently con-
sidered very undesirable for league activities due to its uneven terrain. There-

fore, for organized athletic events to occur on the Mulberry School field,
renovations may be necessary.
The eight facilities that are currently at capacity (no additional field availabil-
ity) include all four schools of the Los Gatos Union Elementary School Dis-
trict, Los Gatos High School, two schools in the Union School District, and
the Jewish Community Center. In addition to student and resident use, sev-
eral of the fields are utilized by local sports leagues for team practices and
games. These leagues include: LGS Recreation, Los Gatos Unified Soccer
League, Los Gatos Little League, Los Gatos-Saratoga Softball Association, Los
Gatos Pony League, Union Little League, Pacific Union Academy, and the
Branham Hill Girls Softball League. Currently, LGS Recreation and the Los
Gatos Unified Soccer League each utilize seven different facilities for athletic
activities throughout Los Gatos. Los Gatos Little League holds games and
practices at five different facilities within Los Gatos.
Additionally, as shown in Table OSP-2, 11 of the facilities include a multi-use
field area that permits scheduled activities and is appropriate for organized
group sporting events. These facilities provide a total of approximately
516,700 square feet of multi-use field space within Los Gatos. These fields are
utilized by school children, organized teams, and sports leagues, as well as by
the general public.
E. Prehistoric and Native American Resources
The Santa Clara Valley, possibly including the Los Gatos area, was most
likely settled by native Californians between 12,000 and 6,000 years ago. Pe-
nutian peoples migrated into central California around 4,500 years ago and
were firmly settled around the San Francisco Bay by 1,500 years ago. The
descendants of the native groups who lived between the Carquinez Strait and
the Monterey area are the Ohlone, also know by the name of their linguistic

group, Costanoan. The Somontac, a Costanoan linguistic group, resided in
the area of what is today Los Gatos.1
Like many other Native Americans in California, the acorn was the Ohlone’s
dietary staple. Acorns were knocked from trees with poles, then leached to
remove bitter tannins and eaten as mush or bread. The Ohlone used a range
of other plant resources, including buckeye, California laurel, elderberries,
strawberries, manzanita berries, goose berries, toyon berries, wild grapes,
wild onion, cattail, amole, wild carrots, clover, and chuchupate. Animals
hunted by the Ohlone and their neighbors included black-tailed deer, Roose-
velt elk, antelope, and marine mammals. Smaller animals such as dogs,
skunks, raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, geese, ducks, salmon, sturgeon, and mol-
lusks were also hunted, fished, or gathered. In addition to sustenance, the Bay
Area’s flora and fauna provided the Ohlone with raw materials for clothing,
shelter, and boats.2
Intensive Hispanic exploration and settlement of the Bay Area began in the
late eighteenth century, at which time Ohlone culture was radically trans-
formed. European settlers established the mission system and exposed the
Ohlone to diseases to which they had no immunity. Mission San Francisco,
at which Ohlone from the entire Bay Area were converted, was founded in
1776. Studies of mission records list the Somontac at Mission Santa Cruz
between 1793 and 1801.3 Mission Santa Cruz, in the present City of Santa
Cruz, was founded in 1791. Following the secularization of the missions in

9 ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT
  A. Introduction
  Residents of the Town of Los Gatos are vitally interested in conserving natu-
  ral resources and reducing waste. This Element is designed to protect and
  enhance natural resources and the environment. The Environment and Sus-
  tainability Element promotes the sustainability of resources and the Town’s
  natural ecology for both current and future generations. The Town has iden-
  tified its need for energy conservation in both existing and future develop-
  ments and structures. Issues associated with natural resource conservation are
  often regional in scope and extend beyond the Town’s physical boundaries.
  State law requires that a General Plan include a Conservation Element. In
  accordance with State law, this Element addresses the conservation, develop-
  ment, and utilization of natural resources, including biological resources, wa-
  ter resources, greenhouse gases (GHGs), and energy resources. This Element
  also addresses air quality since clean air is an important natural resource and a
  vital component of a healthy environment. Water service, wastewater,
  stormwater, and solid waste and recycling also affect the environment and are
  included in this Element.
  This Element is divided into the following sections:
    ♦ Biological Resources
    ♦ Water Resources
    ♦ Water Service
    ♦ Wastewater
    ♦ Stormwater
    ♦ Solid Waste and Recycling
    ♦ Air Quality
    ♦ Greenhouse Gases
    ♦ Energy Resources
  Each of these components is divided into the following sections:
   ♦ Background Information: Provides background information about the
       various resources within Los Gatos.
                                                                            ENV-1

  ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: Provides guidance to the Town related to
     decisions affecting the resources addressed in this Element.
B. Biological Resources
Los Gatos is proud of its status as a “Tree City USA.” Trees and other plant
life can prevent soil erosion, landslides, and flooding while ensuring a scenic
buffer from the effects of development and providing wildlife habitats. Wild-
life populations must be preserved as having intrinsic value that contributes
to the quality of Town life, while keeping in mind the safety and well being
of Town residents.
1.    Background Information
a. Plant Resources
Plant resources, or vegetation types, in the Los Gatos are summarized in Ta-
ble ENV-1. Figure ENV-1 identifies their locations. Most of the land in
northern and central Los Gatos is identified as “developed.” The southern
and southeastern portions of the Los Gatos area, including both the Town
limits and Sphere of Influence (SOI), are primarily undeveloped and support
most of the woodland/forest and shrubland habitats in the area.
i. Developed
Approximately 4,727 acres of the Los Gatos area are included in the devel-
oped cover type, including residential development, commercial and indus-
trial developments, roads, schools, as well as developed parks with play-
grounds, picnic areas, fields, and associated ornamental landscaping. Lexing-
ton Quarry and La Riconada County Club are both considered developed.
ii. Grassland
Grasslands account for approximately 610 acres in the Los Gatos area. This
vegetation community is dominated by non-native annual grasses and in-
cludes native and non-native forbs (any herb that is not a grass). More dis-
turbed grasslands and grasslands adjacent to developed habitats are more

likely to support ruderal species (weeds). Less disturbed areas and serpentine
grasslands, known to occur in the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space
District’s (MROSD) open space preserves and Sierra Azul Open Space Pre-
serve (OSP), are more likely to support native grasses and forbs and special-
status plants.
iii. Shrubland
There are approximately 1,650 acres of shrubland in the Los Gatos area, oc-
curring mostly in the MROSD preserves and in undeveloped parcels in the
south. Some shrublands also occur in the vicinity of Heinz OSP and Santa
Rosa OSP. Many of the shrublands are chaparral communities, which gener-
ally occur on hotter, drier south-facing slopes and ridges.

iv. Woodland/Forest
Woodland/forest communities account for approximately 4,329 acres in the
Los Gatos area and include riparian woodlands, oak woodlands, broadleaved
upland forest, and non-native ornamental trees. Riparian woodlands occur
along Los Gatos Creek, Guadalupe Creek, Pheasant Creek, San Tomas
Aquino Creek, and other creeks and drainages. The riparian woodlands sup-
port a dense, well developed canopy of riparian trees dominated by a mix of
native species and include non-native trees. Oak woodlands are located pri-
marily in the southern and eastern portions of the Los Gatos and are domi-
nated by native trees, but some areas are dominated by ornamental trees.
v. Agriculture
This cover type consists of approximately 85 acres in the Los Gatos area and
includes orchards and row crops. One of the largest agriculture areas is the
North Forty area, which contains walnut and fruit trees.
vi. Open Water
Open water habitat consists of approximately 75 acres in the Los Gatos area
and includes ponds and reservoirs. Vasona Reservoir and the northern tip of
the Lexington Reservoir (in the Town’s SOI) are the two main open water
bodies. Cherry Springs Pond in Sierra Azul OSP is also open water habitat.
vii. Creeks
Creeks include perennial and ephemeral creek channels, and aboveground and
underground reaches. Most of these creeks are considered part of the Guada-
lupe River watershed. Los Gatos Creek is one of the primary creeks in the
area, flowing south to north into and out of the Vasona Reservoir.
viii. Wetland
Seasonal wetlands, marshes, and other wetland habitats generally occur
throughout Los Gatos’s grasslands, shrublands, and woodland/forest com-
munities, as well as along creeks and the edges of some open water bodies.

b. Soil Resources
The Town of Los Gatos is characterized by hilly terrain located on the lower
slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Town utilizes landscape and grading
plans to prevent soil erosion and slippage, helping to conserve soil resources.
c. Wildlife Resources
As previously mentioned, wildlife resources, or habitat types, are summarized
in Table ENV-1. Figure ENV-1 identifies their locations.
i. Grassland
Grasslands provide habitat for a relatively small number of wildlife species
due to the uniform structure of vegetation. However, the grasslands on the
sites support populations of small rabbits and rodents, which provide an im-
portant potential prey base for avian and mammalian predators. Likewise,
deer and coyotes utilize the grasslands as part of their foraging habitat.
ii. Shrubland
Wildlife species that are typical of shrubland communities in the region in-
clude western fence lizard, California quail, Anna’s hummingbird, Bewick’s
wren, and black-tailed jackrabbit.
iii. Woodland/Forest
Woodlands and forests provide habitat for a large variety of wildlife species.
They are particularly important as nesting habitat for migratory and resident
birds. Dead snags also provide roosting places for various species of bats.
When dead trees fall, the trunks provide many microhabitats for amphibians,
reptiles, small mammals, and a diversity of insects and other invertebrates.
Many of the wildlife species typical of woodland/forest and shrubland habi-
tats generally utilize both habitats.
iv. Agriculture
Agricultural areas provide habitat for several species of birds, amphibians,
reptiles, and mammals. Small mammals that occur in the agricultural areas
and crop fields provide a prey base for raptors, snakes, and larger mammals.

v. Open Water
Bird species found at Vasona Reservoir and the northern tip of the Lexington
Reservoir, in the Town’s SOI, generally include: snowy egret, great egret,
double-crested cormorant, duck, coot, Canada goose, and killdeer. Western
pond turtles live in both reservoirs, as well as a variety of native and non-
native fish species.
vi. Creeks
Some of the creeks and drainages within the Los Gatos area are known to
support suitable habitat for steelhead, other freshwater fish, and amphibians.
The creeks are also likely to provide a valuable source of water for local ter-
restrial wildlife.
vii. Wetland
Wetlands provide important breeding habitat for amphibians such as the
western toad. Some species previously mentioned rely on these wetland habi-
tats as a source of water and food. The wetlands may also be used as a water
source, on a seasonal basis, for local wildlife.
viii. Developed
Landscaped and native trees within the developed areas of the Los Gatos area
provide roosting, foraging, and/or nesting habitat for many wildlife species.
The larger trees provide nesting habitat for raptors, owls, and other birds.
Black-tailed deer use the trees within the developed areas for shelter and forag-
ing habitat. Additionally, urban-adapted mammal species, such as raccoon
and opossums, occur in the developed areas.
ix. Wildlife Movement Corridors
Large tracts of open space, such as the ones present in the MROSD OSP,
provide substantial wildlife corridors for fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals. Undeveloped parcels, riparian creek corridors, and the riparian
woodlands allow wildlife to migrate, forage, and/or disperse. The creek
channels provide movement corridors for aquatic species such as fish, frogs,
and invertebrates. Los Gatos Creek is one of the few urban creeks in the
                                                                             ENV-7

Santa Clara Valley that is relatively undisturbed and intact and therefore is an
important wildlife corridor in the Santa Clara Valley.
d. Special-Status Species
Four special-status plant species and five special-status wildlife species are
known to occur in the Los Gatos area. Figure ENV-2 shows the California
Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) occurrences of special-status plants and
animals in the Los Gatos area. The CNDDB is a database of the status and
location of rare plants and is maintained by California Department of Fish
and Game (CDFG). The CNDDB does not include any known records of
federal or State listed plants in the Los Gatos SOI.
i. Special-Status Plants
Four special-status plant species are currently known to occur in the Los
Gatos area. There are an additional 28 special-status plants with the potential
to occur in the Los Gatos area based on the potential presence of suitable
habitat. These special-status plant species potentially occur in grassland,
shrubland, woodland/forest, open water, creek, and wetland habitats. The
special-status plant species known to occur in the Los Gatos area include:
   ♦ Western leatherwood                       ♦ Robust monardella
   ♦ Loma Prieta hoita                         ♦ Most beautiful jewel-flower
ii. Special-Status Wildlife
Five special-status wildlife species are known to occur in the Los Gatos area,
and 27 other special-status wildlife species may potentially occur based on the
possible presence of suitable habitat of the species. The special-status wildlife
species known to occur in the Los Gatos area include:
   ♦ Steelhead                                 ♦ Western pond turtle
   ♦ California red-legged frog                ♦ Pallid bat
   ♦ Foothill yellow-legged frog
e. Urban Biodiversity
Los Gatos Creek and San Tomas Aquino Creek provide habitat for a diverse
array of plants and wildlife species within the urban areas. The Town

C. Water Resources
The mission of the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) is to provide
a healthy, safe, and enhanced quality of living in Santa Clara County through
watershed stewardship and comprehensive management of water resources in
a practical, cost effective, and environmentally sensitive manner. The Town
of Los Gatos works closely with the SCVWD to ensure a clean, safe, and
quality water supply for its residents. Additionally, given the Town’s semi-
ENV-14

                                                    T O W N O F L O S G A T O S

              E N V I R O N M E N T A N D S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y E L E M E N T
arid climate, the Town endeavors to promote water conservation measures to
the greatest extent possible.
1. Background Information
The SCVWD was created by the California State Legislature, which identified
the SCVWD’s purpose and authority. The SCVWD is mandated to:
  ♦ To protect Santa Clara County from flood and stormwater.
  ♦ To provide comprehensive conservation and management of flood,
     storm, and recycled waters for all beneficial uses.
  ♦ To increase and prevent the waste of the water supply in the SCVWD.
  ♦ To enhance, protect, and restore streams, riparian corridors, and natural
     resources in connection with water supply and flood protection efforts.
a. Regional Water Quality
The 1972 Federal Clean Water Act requires that states develop a list of water
bodies that do not meet water quality standards, establish priority rankings
for waters on the list, and develop action plans, called Total Maximum Daily
Loads (TMDL), to improve water quality. The list of impaired water bodies
is typically revised every two years. The only listing for water bodies in the
Town is Los Gatos Creek, which is currently being addressed as part of a fed-
eral Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -approved TMDL.
b. Regional Groundwater
The Town is located within the Santa Clara Valley Groundwater sub-basin
(groundwater sub-basin), which is a structural trough that is parallel to the
northwest trending Coast Ranges. The groundwater sub-basin is approxi-
mately 22 miles long and 15 miles wide, with a surface area of 225 square
miles. Annual precipitation for the Santa Clara sub-basin ranges from less
than 16 inches in the valley to more than 28 inches in the mountains.
i. Groundwater Management
The groundwater sub-basin is managed by the SCVWD, whose primary ob-
jectives are to recharge the groundwater basin, conserve water, increase water
                                                                           ENV-15

E N V I R O N M E N T   A N D S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y E L E M E N T
supply, and prevent waste or diminution of the District’s water supply. The
SCVWD endeavors to maintain the basin at equilibrium by augmenting natu-
ral percolation of rainfall and local stream runoff with imported water. As
stated in the SCVWD Groundwater Management Report, the groundwater
basin throughout the County appears to be in good condition.
ii. Groundwater Quality
Natural interactions between water, the atmosphere, rock minerals, and sur-
face water control groundwater quality within the groundwater sub-basin.
However, man-made compounds such as nitrogen-based fertilizer, solvents,
and fuel products can also affect groundwater quality. Groundwater quality
in the Santa Clara Valley sub-basin is generally high. Drinking water stan-
dards are met at public water supply wells without the use of treatment
methods.
In a normal year, less than half of Santa Clara County's water is drawn from
local groundwater aquifers or rainwater captured in the reservoirs operated
by the SCVWD. More than half of the supply is brought into the County of
Santa Clara through the State Water Project, the federal Central Valley Pro-
ject, and San Francisco's Hetch Hetchy system. Local rainfall, or runoff,
flows into the ten SCVWD reservoirs for storage and blending with the im-
ported water before groundwater recharge or treatment.

D. Water Service
The San Jose Water Company has been the Town’s water service provider
since 1870. The San Jose Water Company’s service area encompasses ap-
proximately 138 square miles including most of the City of San Jose; the City
of Cupertino; the entire Cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno, and Saratoga; the
Town of Los Gatos, and parts of unincorporated Santa Clara County.
1.    Background Information
a. Water Supply
San Jose Water Company provides water from three major sources within its
service area: groundwater, imported surface water, and local raw mountain
surface water.
i. Groundwater
Groundwater is pumped from over 100 wells that draw water from the Santa
Clara groundwater basin, which accounts for 40 percent of the supply. The
San Jose Water Company has rights to pump water from the aquifers in the
service area when it is in compliance with the Santa Clara Valley Water Dis-
trict (SCVWD) permitting requirements.
ii. Imported Surface Water
Imported surface water is purchased from the SCVWD, which is the whole-
sale supplier to the San Jose Water Company. Surface water is imported from
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and accounts for approximately 50 percent
of the water supply. A smaller portion is impounded in local reservoirs in
Santa Clara County.
iii. Local Mountain Raw Surface Water
Local mountain surface water is also collected from the watershed in the
Santa Cruz Mountains. San Jose Water Company has “pre-1914 surface water
rights” to raw water in Los Gatos Creek and local watersheds in the Santa
Cruz Mountains. This amount accounts for approximately 10 percent of the
water supply in normal rainfall years.

b. Water Transmission, Distribution and Storage
San Jose Water Company provides water treatment and distribution for the
Town of Los Gatos.
i. Water Treatment Plant
The Rinconada Treatment Plant in the Town of Los Gatos supplies drinking
water to both residential and commercial users in the west Santa Clara Valley
including the Cities of Santa Clara, Campbell, Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Moun-
tain View, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, and Los Gatos. The water treatment
plant can treat and deliver up to 80 million gallons of water per day.
ii. Water Distribution Pipelines
San Jose Water Company has approximately 29 “stations” within the Town
of Los Gatos. These stations include tanks, pump stations and regulators that
regulate the water pressure. Hillside planning in the Town poses unique chal-
lenges in regard to water supply systems as it is difficult to provide water at
higher elevations within the Town.
iii. Water Storage
Los Gatos is located within the Guadalupe Watershed within the boundaries
of the SCVWD. Reservoirs located within the watershed provide water stor-
age and are maintained by the SCVWD, including the Lexington Reservoir
and James J. Lenihan Dam, Vasona Dam and Reservoir, Guadalupe Dam and
Reservoir, Almaden Dam and Reservoir, and Calero Dam and Reservoir.
c. Water Reuse and Conservation
i. Water Reuse
San Jose Water Company is the wholesale retailer for the South Bay Water
Recycling Program, which takes treated wastewater that would normally be
discharged into the San Francisco Bay and pipes it back into the basin to be
used for landscape irrigation.
ii. Water Conservation
The SCVWD has called for a voluntary 10 percent reduction in water use
over the past several years for all water users within the District. However,
                                                                           ENV-19

2 0 2 0 G E N E R A L P L A N
E N V I R O N M E N T   A N D S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y E L E M E N T
the voluntary water use reduction program only achieved an approximately
3 to 4 percent reduction. Therefore, the SCVWD is currently developing a
mandatory conservation program to be implemented by the San Jose Water
Company, if necessary.
San Jose Water Company provides a full range of water conservation meas-
ures to both residential and commercial customers, including the water audit
program, where water inspectors conduct a thorough investigation of the
customer’s home or business by inspecting the property for leaks and measur-
ing the flow of all showers, faucets, and toilets. The goal of this program is to
identify the source of the customer’s water consumption and recommend
methods for more efficient water use.
San Jose Water Company also participates in the SCVWD’s clothes washer
rebate program and augments its water audit program by providing customers
with free low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators, purchased by the
SCVWD. San Jose Water Company constantly performs a system-wide audit
by maintaining extensive records on each customer’s water use.
San Jose Water Company has personnel that evaluate underground leaks so
that they may be repaired as soon as possible. San Jose Water Company also
has a regular schedule of meter calibration and replacement for all meter types
in the distribution system. San Jose Water Company provides and partici-
pates in numerous education programs, including community outreach and
the distribution of written materials to encourage water conservation.

G. Solid Waste and Recycling
Garbage disposal and recycling are important for all residents of Los Gatos.
The resources used to produce the items which end up in landfills are dwin-
dling, and landfill space is limited. Los Gatos endeavors to work with West
Valley Collection and Recycling (WVCR) to proactively address issues of
solid waste and recycling. Los Gatos currently has a contract with WVCR
that expires on February 28, 2014.
1. Background Information
WVCR is the exclusive recycling, green waste, and garbage hauler for Los
Gatos, the Cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno, and Saratoga, and unincorpo-
rated Santa Clara County. All recycling, yard trimmings and garbage are
picked up by WVCR and transported directly to the Guadalupe Landfill.
The Guadalupe Landfill is located at 15999 Guadalupe Mines Road in the
City of San Jose. The Guadalupe Landfill is a Class III solid waste landfill. It
is projected that the landfill will reach its capacity in 2031.
a. Recycling
WVCR provides single stream recycling to single-family and multi-family
residents as well as commercial customers. Single stream recycling means all
recyclables are placed in a single bin and do not need to be sorted based on
the material type. All recyclable materials are sorted at WVCR’s Materials
Recovery Facility in the City of San Jose.
WVCR accepts a wide variety of recyclable materials from both residential
and commercial customers, including paper and cartons, glass, plastics and
polystyrene, metals, and textiles. Additionally, WVCR will pick up used
motor oil and filters as well as used household alkaline batteries from residen-
tial curbsides.

H. Air Quality
The air we breathe is a shared resource. Air pollution affects all Californians,
regardless of where they live or their environmental lifestyles. In addition to
the human impact, polluted air also damages our agricultural industry and
our natural environment. The air pollution potential of the Santa Clara Val-
ley is high. The Valley has a large population and the largest complex of mo-
bile air pollution sources in the Bay Area.
1. Background Information
Air quality in the San Francisco Bay Air Basin is overseen by the Environ-
mental Protection Agency Region IX office at the federal level, the California
Air Resources Board (CARB) at the State level and by the Bay Area Air Qual-
ity Management District (BAAQMD) at the regional level. The Town works
with these agencies in order to do its part to devise methods of air resource
conservation that address both local and regional air quality issues.
a. Regional Climate and Meteorological Conditions
The Town of Los Gatos is located in the Santa Clara Valley subregion of the
Basin. Temperatures in this region are warmer in the summer with mostly
clear skies and cooler nights. Winter temperatures range from mild to very
cool. Wind patterns in the Santa Clara Valley are influenced greatly by ter-
rain, with the greatest wind speeds in the spring and summer, particularly in
the afternoon and evenings.

b. Air Pollutants
i. Carbon Monoxide
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas that is emitted by
mobile and stationary sources as a result of incomplete combustion of hydro-
carbons or other carbon-based fuels. In cities, automobile exhaust can cause
as much as 95 percent of all CO emissions.
ii. Ozone
Ozone (O3) occurs in two layers of the atmosphere, the troposphere and
stratosphere. The stratospheric (the “good” O3 layer) extends upward from
about 10 to 30 miles and protects life on earth from the sun's harmful ultra-
violet rays. The troposphere extends from the earth’s surface to approxi-
mately 10 miles above ground level, where it meets the stratosphere. Within
the troposphere, O3 is a photochemical pollutant produced from the reaction
between volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Nitrogen oxides (NOx), and
sunlight. VOCs and NOx are considered key O precursors. To reduce O
concentrations, it is necessary to control the emissions of these precursors.
High O concentrations can form over large regions from motor vehicles and
stationary sources emissions and can be carried hundreds of miles from their
origins.
iii. Nitrogen Dioxide
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are highly reactive gases that are a primary O3 precur-
sor and react in the atmosphere to form acid rain. Nitrogen dioxides (NO2)
occur in areas that have a high concentration of combustion sources such as
motor vehicle engines, power plants, refineries, and other industrial opera-
tions.
iv. Suspended Particulate Matter
Suspended Particulate Matter (PM) arises from sources such as road dust, die-
sel soot, combustion products, construction operations, and dust storms.
There are two forms or PM, Course Particulate Matter (PM10) and Fine Par-
ticulate Matter (PM2.5). PM scatters light and significantly reduces visibility.
                                                                          ENV-29

E N V I R O N M E N T  A N D  S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y E L E M E N T
In addition, these particulates penetrate into lungs and can potentially damage
the respiratory tract.
c. Toxic Air Contaminants
A Toxic Air Contaminant (TAC) is “an air pollutant that may cause or con-
tribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious illness, or which
may pose a present or potential hazard to human health.” The 189 substances
that have been listed as federal hazardous air pollutants are TACs under the
State’s air toxics program.
d. Significant Sources of Air Pollution or Odors
Major sources of air pollution within Santa Clara County and the Town of
Los Gatos include stationary, area-wide, and mobile sources. These sources
include:
  ♦ Stationary Sources
      y Fuel Combustion
      y Waste Disposal
      y Cleaning and Surface Coating
      y Petroleum Production and Marketing
      y Industrial Processes
  ♦ Area-Wide Sources
      y Solvent Evaporation
      y Miscellaneous processes
  ♦ Mobile Sources
      y On-Road Mobile Sources
      y Other Mobile Sources
According to Santa Clara County’s emissions inventory, mobile sources are
the largest contributor of pollutants.
e. Sensitive Land Uses
Sensitive populations (sensitive receptors) are more susceptible to the effects
of air pollution than the general population and typically include children

under 14, seniors over 65, athletes and people with cardiovascular and chronic
respiratory diseases. Depending on the population groups or activity, some
land use locations are considered more sensitive with respect to changes in air
quality. Locations that may contain a high concentration of these sensitive
population groups include residential areas, hospitals, day-care facilities, sen-
ior facilities, libraries, places of worship, schools, and parks.
2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal ENV-12 To conserve the air resources of the Town and main-
                     tain and improve acceptable air quality in Los Gatos.
Policies
Policy ENV-12.1 Local land use decisions shall consider air quality goals as
                       part of the environmental review process.
Policy ENV-12.2 Require consideration of alternatives to individual auto use
                       whenever the environmental review document concludes
                       that the traffic generated by a development project would
                       result in adverse impacts from air and noise pollution.
Policy ENV-12.3 Require design criteria for site plans to reduce the effects
                       of high air pollution concentrations associated with road-
                       ways by appropriate placement of structures, use of land-
                       scaping, and parking arrangements.

                     among other measures. Appropriate control measures will
                     be determined on a project-by-project basis, and should be
                     specific to the pollutant for which the daily threshold is
                     exceeded. Such control measures may include, but not be

I.   Greenhouse Gases
Through the implementation of this General Plan it is possible to reduce the
Town’s local GHG emissions. The Los Gatos Town Council has already
passed a resolution adopting the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign
(CCP) led by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives
(ICLEI) Local Governments for Sustainability. The CCP helps local gov-
ernments and communities to reduce GHG emissions and their associated
environmental impacts. To achieve its goal of reducing GHG emissions and
improving air quality, the Town will establish a GHG reduction target, de-
velop and implement an action plan, and monitor and report progress.
1. Background Information
The earth’s atmosphere contains a group of naturally occurring gases that are
responsible for maintaining a habitable climate. These gases allow sunlight to
enter the earth’s atmosphere freely and then prevent a portion of the resulting
heat from exiting into the atmosphere. Because of their ability to contain
heat, these gases are known as greenhouse gases, or GHGs. Natural levels of
GHGs exist in balanced proportion, resulting in steady maintenance of the
temperature within earth’s atmosphere. Emissions from human activities,
such as energy production and motor vehicle use, elevate the concentrations
of GHGs, upsetting their natural balance. When GHG concentrations exceed
natural concentrations in the atmosphere, the “greenhouse effect” of trapped
heat is enhanced, and the phenomenon known as global warming occurs.
a. State Mandates
In June 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger established California’s GHG emis-
sions reduction targets in Executive Order S-3-05. The Executive Order es-
tablished goals to reduce statewide GHG emissions to the following levels:
   ♦ Reduce emissions to 2000 levels by 2010;
   ♦ Reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020; and
   ♦ Reduce emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
                                                                          ENV-33

i. Assembly Bill 32
In 2006, Assembly Bill (AB) 32, known as the California Global Warming
Solutions Act, was adopted to further the goals of Executive Order S-3-05.
AB 32 represents the first enforceable statewide program to limit GHG emis-
sions from all major industries, with penalties for noncompliance. This legis-
lation sets a cap on statewide GHG emissions and establishes the regulatory
framework to achieve corresponding reductions in statewide emissions levels.
AB 32 charges the California Air Resources Board (CARB) with implementa-
tion of the act. CARB’s responsibilities include monitoring compliance and
enforcing any rule, regulation, order, emission limitation, emission reduction
measure, or market-based compliance mechanism adopted.
ii. Senate Bill 375
In 2008, Senate Bill (SB) 375 was adopted to further reduce GHG emissions
from automobiles and light trucks by requiring CARB to provide GHG
emission reduction targets from the automobile and light truck sector. SB
375 directs CARB to calculate statewide emissions reduction targets and to
assign regional emissions reduction targets to each metropolitan planning
organization (MPO) in the State. The MPO for Los Gatos is the Metropoli-
tan Transportation Commission (MTC). SB 375 requires that certain regional
transportation planning and programming activities be consistent with the
sustainable communities strategies, and provides incentives for local govern-
ments that adopt policies and programs consistent with the sustainable com-
munities strategy.
b. Greenhouse Gases
The most common GHG that results from human activity is carbon dioxide,
followed by methane and nitrous oxide. Many other trace gases have greater
ability to absorb and re-radiate long wave radiation; however, these gases are
not as plentiful. California State law defines GHGs to include the following:
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocar-
bons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Uses and characteristics of these gases include:
   ♦ Carbon dioxide (CO2) is primarily generated by fossil fuel combustion in
      stationary and mobile sources. The vast majority of CO2 emissions come

             E N V I R O N M E N T A N D S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y E L E M E N T
    from the combustion of fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal and natural
    gas.
  ♦ Methane (CH4) is the primary component of natural gas, which is used
    for space and water heating, steam production and power generation.
    Modern landfills, agricultural operations, coal mines, oil and natural gas
    operations are the primary sources of methane emissions.
  ♦ Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced by both natural and human related
    sources. Natural sources of nitrous oxide are bacteria in the soil and
    oceans. The majority of nitrous oxide produced by human activity is a
    result of agriculture, including nitrogen fertilizers and animal waste,
    which promote nitrous oxide production from naturally-occurring
    bacteria. Industrial processes and internal combustion engines also
    produce nitrous oxide.
  ♦ Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are typically used as foam-blown insulation
    and as refrigerants for both stationary refrigeration and mobile air condi-
    tioning.
  ♦ Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are primarily created as byproducts of alumi-
    num production and semi conductor manufacturing.
  ♦ Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is most commonly used as an electrical insula-
    tor in high voltage equipment that transmits and distributes electricity.
  ♦ Other Compounds have the potential to contribute to the greenhouse ef-
    fect. These compounds include ozone, 1,1,1—trichloroethane, hydro-
    chlorofluorocarbons, and chlorofluorocarbons.
c. Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other GHGs are emitted as the
result of certain natural and technological processes. Many human activities
rely on those processes. Therefore, emissions levels can be minimized by
reducing those activities.
                                                                          ENV-35

E N V I R O N M E N T   A N D S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y E L E M E N T
i. Direct Sources of Greenhouse Gases
There are two types of sources that directly emit GHGs: stationary sources
(buildings, factories, power plants, etc.) and mobile sources (cars, trucks, air-
planes, etc.). There are also two types of stationary sources: point sources,
which are individual facilities such as oil refineries and area sources. Area
sources are an agglomeration of individual facilities that emit GHGs through
daily activities, which would be a combination of sources such as residential
heating, painting and varnishing, or dry cleaning.
ii. Indirect Sources of Greenhouse Gases
The two main indirect sources of GHG emissions are electricity consumption
and water treatment. The facilities in California and the western United
States that provide water and power to homes and businesses in Los Gatos
emit GHGs. These GHGs are emitted at the power plant or water convey-
ance facility, not in Los Gatos, but they originate from homes and businesses
in Los Gatos.
d. Regional Greenhouse Gas Emissions
According to the BAAQMD, of the nine Bay Area counties, Santa Clara
County has the second highest annual direct emissions of GHG emissions.
Santa Clara County is also the most populous County in the Bay Area. Of
the emissions attributed to Santa Clara County, approximately 53 percent of
emissions come from motor vehicles, 20 percent from point sources, and 27
percent from area sources.

J.    Energy Resources
Energy production, conservation, and patterns of energy consumption are of
growing importance to individuals, agencies and jurisdictions. Energy re-
sources, while varied, are not limitless. Traditional energy resources (gas,
electricity) are non-renewable, and conservation of these resources for future
generations is imperative.
1. Background Information
Typically, the most important factors influencing residential energy con-
sumption are the size of the house, the type of house (detached single-family
or multi-family structure), the number of major appliances, and the construc-
tion and siting of the structure. Residential energy needs are often fulfilled by
electricity or a combination of gas and electricity. Space heating and cooling
is the most energy-consuming activity in residential structures.
The State of California requires local governments to address energy conser-
vation and efficiency in new construction. The State Building Standard Code,
including Title 24, applies to any new structure, additions to an existing struc-
ture, changes to the footprint of a structure, remodeling of a structure, or
changes to water and heating systems. Title 24 of the State Administrative
Code has recently been amended to mandate more stringent conservation and
efficiency requirements for new residential and non-residential construction.
The Town of Los Gatos has several opportunities to promote energy conser-
vation and reduce energy consumption, mainly through enforcing construc-
tion standards and through its own operations.
