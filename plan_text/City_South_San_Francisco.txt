2 LAND USE
  This element of the General Plan outlines the framework that has guided land use
  decision-making, provides the General Plan land use classification system, and
  outlines citywide land use policies. Policies for each of the 14 individual sub-areas
  that comprise the General Plan Planning Area are in Chapter 3: Planning Sub-
  Areas.

  neighborhoods in the west side of the city to tall office buildings in the East of 101 area.

The city consists primarily of single-use areas, with industrial facilities and business parks concentrated in the East of 101 area and residential uses in the north
and west areas of the city. The view of San Bruno Mountain provides an aesthetic backdrop for the city.

MAGNITUDE AND DISTRIBUTION OF EXISTING USES
As part of the General Plan preparation process, an existing land use database for
the city was prepared and a land use analysis was performed.
South San Francisco’s City limits encompass 4,298 acres. Single-family residences
are the predominant land use, occupying 33 percent of the land (net, that is, exclu-
sive of streets, water, and other rights-of-way) in the city. Industrial uses, including
warehouses, manufacturing areas and business parks, comprise over a quarter of
South San Francisco’s area. The land use analysis also found that:
•	 Parks and open space occupy over 10 percent of the Planning Area, primarily
    concentrated in Sign Hill Park and the California Golf and Country Club;
•	 Many of South San Francisco’s growing or highest priority land uses currently
    occupy relatively little land. Business parks for high-technology research and       The new condos on El Camino Real are an intensification
    development (R&D) and manufacturing use occupy only 173 acres, or 14                 of uses around the South San Francisco Bart Station.
    percent of the land in the industrial classification. Commercial areas occupy
    approximately eight percent. Hotels and motels can be found on only 37 acres,
    or ten percent of the land in the commercial use classification.
•	 Only a handful of sites in South San Francisco—totaling 167 acres, or less than
    four percent of land within the Planning Area—are vacant. About half of this
    acreage is in Bay West Cove (formerly Shearwater) and Sierra Point - two large
    sites at the northernmost tip of the city, with substantial soil contamination
    and under remediation for the past several years. The majority of the remain-
    ing vacant land comprises sites, such as in Westborough, that have steep slopes.
    Thus, virtually all growth in the city will result from redevelopment or inten-
    sification; and
•	 Development that is approved or under review includes 1,150 housing units
    and 3.4 million square feet of non-residential space.
                                                                                         Some older industrial sites in Lindenville are gradually

GENERAL PLAN DIAGRAM
The principles outlined on the previous page are represented in the General Plan
Diagram (Figure 2-1). The Diagram designates the proposed general location, dis-
tribution, and extent of land uses. As required by State law, land use classifications,
shown as color/graphic patterns, letter designations, or labels the Diagram, specify
a range for housing density and building intensity for each type of designated land
use. These density/intensity standards allow circulation and public facility needs
to be determined; they also reflect the environmental carrying-capacity limitations
established by other elements of the General Plan. The Diagram is a graphic repre-
sentation of policies contained in the General Plan; it is to be used and interpreted
only in conjunction with the text and other figures contained in the General Plan.
The legend of the General Plan Diagram abbreviates the land use classifications
described below, which represent an adopted part of the General Plan.
Uses on sites less than two acres in size are generally not depicted on the Diagram.
The interpretation of consistency with the General Plan on sites less than two acres
in size will be done through the Zoning Ordinance and the Zoning Map.

DENSITY/INTENSITY STANDARDS
The General Plan establishes density/intensity standards for each use classification.
Residential density is expressed as housing units per net acre. Maximum permit-
ted ratio of gross floor area to site area (FAR) is specified for non-residential uses.
FAR is a broad measure of building bulk that controls both visual prominence and
traffic generation. It can be clearly translated to a limit on building bulk in the Zon-
ing Ordinance and is independent of the type of use occupying the building. FAR
limitations are also shown for some residential land use classifications in order to
relate housing size to lot size; both housing density and FAR standards shall apply
in such instances. Building area devoted to structured or covered parking (if any)
is not included in FAR calculations for non-residential developments. However,
parking garages are included in the FAR limitations for residential uses.
The Zoning Ordinance could provide specific exceptions to the FAR limitations for
uses with low employment densities, such as research facilities, or low peak-hour
traffic generation, such as a hospital. In addition to density/intensity standards,
some land use classifications stipulate allowable building types (such as single-
family residential) as well.
The density/intensity standards do not imply that development projects will be
approved at the maximum density or intensity specified for each use. Zoning regu-
lations consistent with General Plan policies and/or site conditions may reduce
development potential within the stated ranges. Airport-related height limits also
restrict development, as shown in Figure 2-2. In addition, Figure 2-3 establishes
height limitations in specific areas, including Downtown, the El Camino Real Cor-
ridor, and near BART stations; these limitations shall apply to all uses, and land
use-based height limitations (in the Zoning Ordinance) shall not apply. For areas
outside the ones shown in Figure 2-3, height limitations shall be in accordance
with the use-based limitations specified in the Zoning Ordinance. These heights
are partly based on a viewshed analysis for the Planning Area, which revealed that
the south face of Sign Hill, the base of San Bruno Mountain, and the east face of
Point San Bruno Knoll, are visible from most areas of the city, as shown in Figure
2-4. Gross density standards and assumed averages for residential categories are
listed below.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
                                 The classifications in this section represent adopted City policy. They are meant to
                                 be broad enough to give the City flexibility in implementation, but clear enough
                                 to provide sufficient direction to carry out the General Plan. The City’s Zoning
                                 Ordinance contains more detailed provisions and standards. More than one zoning
                                 district may be consistent with a single General Plan land use classification.
                                 Residential
                                 Three residential land use classifications are established for areas outside of Down-
                                 town to provide for development of a full range of housing types (Downtown
                                 residential land use classifications are included later in this section). Densities are
                                 stated as number of housing units per net acre of developable land, excluding
                                 areas subject to physical, environmental, or geological constraints, and areas dedi-
                                 cated for creekside greenways or wetlands protection, provided that at least one
                                 housing unit may be built on each existing legal parcel designated for residential
                                 use. Development would be required within the density range (both maximum and
                                 minimum) stipulated in the classification. Development standards established in
                                 the Zoning Ordinance may limit attainment of maximum densities.
                                 Second units permitted by local regulation, State-mandated density bonuses for
                                 provision of affordable housing, and a 20 percent density bonus for residential
                                 developments located within a 1/4-mile of a fixed-guideway transit (BART or Cal-
                                 train) station are in addition to densities otherwise permitted.
                                 Assumed average densities listed are used to calculate probable housing unit and
                                 population holding capacity. Neither the averages nor the totals constitute General
                                 Plan policy. Housing types (which are included here for illustrative purposes only,
                                 and do not represent adopted City policy) are shown in Figure 2-5.
                                 Low Density Residential
                                 Single-family residential development with densities up to 8.0 units per net acre.
                                 Typical lots would be 6,000 square feet, but the minimum would be 5,000 square
                                 feet, and smaller lots (4,500 square feet or less) may be permitted in neighbor-
                                 hoods meeting specified community design standards, subject to specific review

                                 requirements. This classification is mainly intended for detached single-family
                                 dwellings, but attached single-family units may be permitted, provided each unit
                                 has ground-floor living area and private outdoor open space. The Zoning Ordi-
                                 nance may include a separate district for estate-type or zero-lot-line developments.
                                 Medium Density Residential
                                 Housing at densities from 8.1 to 18.0 units per net acre, with a minimum of 2,250
                                 square feet of net area (i.e. exclusive of streets, parks and other public rights-of-
                                 way) required per unit, and a minimum lot area of 6,750 square feet. Dwelling
                                 types may include attached or detached single-family housing, duplexes, triplex-
                                 es, fourplexes, townhouses, apartments, and condominiums. Multifamily housing
                                 type is not permitted. (Amended by City Council Resolution 148-2000, Adopted

                                 High Density Residential
                                 Residential development, with densities ranging from 18.1 to 30.0 units per net
                                 acre. This designation would permit the full range of housing types, including
                                 single-family attached development subject to standards in the Zoning Ordinance,
                                 and is intended for specific areas where higher density may be appropriate.
                                 This designation within the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan, as it ap-
                                 plies to the 4.5-acre former San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (PUC)
                                 parcel between Mission Road and the Colma Creek canal, allows higher densities
                                 than elsewhere in the city, reflecting the area’s close proximity to the South San
                                 Francisco BART Station. Up to 120 units per acre are permitted and a minimum
                                 density of 80 units per acre is required. A maximum of 180 units per acre may be
                                 achieved for development meeting specified criteria. (Amended by Resolution 97-

Three categories are included and are shown on the General Plan Diagram:
•	 Downtown Low Density Residential. Single-family (detached or attached) resi-
     dential development with densities ranging from 5.1 to 15.0 units per net acre.
     Multifamily development is not permitted.
•	 Downtown Medium Density Residential. Residential development at densities
     ranging from 15.1 to 25.0 units per net acre. A full range of housing types is
     permitted.
•	 Downtown High Density Residential. Residential development at densities
     ranging from 25.1 to 40.0 units per net acre for lots equal to or greater than
     H-acre (21,780 square feet) in area. For lots smaller than H acre, maximum
     density shall be 30.0 units per acre.
A maximum of 25 percent density bonus may be approved for projects with afford-
able housing, housing for elderly residents with specific amenities designed for
residents, or housing that meets community design standards that may be specified
in the Zoning Ordinance. Maximum density with all bonuses shall not exceed 50
units per net acre.
Downtown Transit Core
This designation applies to the area that lies within a 1/4 mile, or a five-minute
walk, of the reconfigured Caltrain Station and undercrossing. It is bounded by Lux
Avenue on the north, Second Lane on the south, Union Pacific Railroad/Caltrain
tracks on the east, and properties on the west side of Linden Avenue on the west.
The Downtown Transit Core is envisioned to be a vibrant, mixed-use area. Due
to its proximity to the Caltrain Station and the relative abundance of developable
sites, the Downtown Transit Core is the area most suitable for the highest intensi-
ties of new development in the Downtown area. These higher intensities will help
to support transit ridership since residential units will be within a short walk of the
station. High-density housing will also provide the pedestrian activity needed to
support downtown businesses and will increase activity day and night, add street
life and improve safety. As the Downtown Transit Core area evolves, it will en-
hance the image of the Downtown and frame Grand Avenue—the centerpiece of
the Downtown.
                                                                                               2-17

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 The Downtown Transit Core allows up to 100 dwelling units per acre; a minimum
                                 of 80 dwelling units per acre is required. A maximum of 120 dwelling units per acre
                                 would be allowed for development meeting specified criteria. Ground level retail
                                 uses will be encouraged throughout the area.
                                 Grand Avenue Core
                                 Grand Avenue will remain the historic retail center of the City. The Grand Avenue
                                 district extends from Airport Boulevard on the east to Spruce Avenue on the west.
                                 With a few exceptions, the district includes properties directly fronting on Grand
                                 Avenue. At the east end, Grand Avenue and Airport Boulevard form an important
                                 gateway to the City and the historic core; at the west end, the district transitions to
                                 the residential Downtown Neighborhood described in the General Plan. Historically
                                 interesting buildings will be retained wherever possible. New mixed-use develop-
                                 ment of underutilized properties will be encouraged but guidelines will limit build-
                                 ing heights directly along Grand Avenue in order to respect the historic character
                                 of some existing buildings and to create a comfortable pedestrian environment. Off
                                 Grand Avenue, on the rear portions of Grand-facing lots, taller allowable heights
                                 will help accommodate new residential uses and increase development opportuni-
                                 ties.
                                 The Grand Avenue Core allows up to 60 dwelling units per acre and requires a mini-
                                 mum of 14 units per acre. If meeting specified criteria, residential densities can be
                                 up to 80 dwelling units per acre or 100 units per acre on corner sites or site over 1/2
                                 acre in size. Retail is required on the ground floor.
                                 Downtown Residential Core
                                 Outside of the Grand Avenue Core and the Downtown Transit Core areas, the
                                 remaining areas lying between Tamarack Lane and Second Lane are designated
                                 Downtown Residential Core. This designation is intended to encourage somewhat
                                 higher densities than what is currently allowed but will still be compatible in scale
                                 with the remaining Downtown residential districts: Downtown High Density Resi-
                                 dential and Downtown Medium Density Residential. The areas encompassed by
                                 this new designation are within two blocks of the Grand Avenue Core. With new
                                 residential development, these will become more active, pedestrian-oriented streets
                                 with day and night activity which will promote safety. The added residents will be
                                 important to the success of Grand Avenue businesses.

The Downtown Residential Core designation allows up to 80 dwelling units per
acre with a minimum of 40 units per acre. Densities up to 100 units per acre are
allowed if specific criteria are met and public benefits are provided. Affordable
senrior housing projects may be allowed up to 125 units per acre.
Linden Neighborhood Center
The Linden Neighborhood Center is defined as the properties fronting Linden Av-
enue between California Avenue and Ninth Lane. The large zone of residential
uses that lie north of Miller Avenue up to Armour Avenue and west of Maple have
limited neighborhood amenities that can help to meet daily needs; in addition, there
is little public open space available in this area. The current small collection of
retail uses along Linden Avenue between California and Juniper Avenues provide
a starting point for a more robust neighborhood center that will be walkable for the
surrounding residential areas and can be a supplement to the more citywide desti-
nations that will locate along Grand Avenue.
Retail/commercial uses are required at ground level within this zone. The Linden
Neighborhood Center designation allows up to 60 dwelling units per acre with a
minimum of 40 units per acre. Densities up to 80 units per acre are allowed if spe-
cific criteria are met.
Linden Commercial Corridor
The Linden Commercial Corridor includes the properties fronting Linden Avenue
from California Avenue to Sixth Lane and from Second Lane to Railroad Avenue.
Linden Avenue throughout its length has historically been a location for a variety of
commercial uses and today many of these remain and serve as resources for local
residents and businesses. This designation apples to areas of Linden Avenue south
of Aspen Avenue that do not otherwise fall into the Downtown Residential Core,
Downtown Transit Core, or Grand Avenue Core districts.
Commercial and mixed uses will continue to be allowed and encouraged on prop-
erties within this corridor. While not required, commercial uses will provide op-
portunities for local services for adjoining residential neighborhoods. As with other
mixed use locations, improvements to the sidewalks and streetscape will be en-
couraged to provide additional pedestrian amenities and accessibility especially
for local residents.
                                                                                             2-19
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 Retail use will be encouraged at ground level in this corridor. Other requirements
                                 of the Downtown High Density Residential district will pertain: 20.1-40 dwelling
                                 units per acre.
                                 OFFICE
                                 This designation is intended to provide sites for administrative, financial, busi-
                                 ness, professional, medical and public offices in locations proximate to BART or
                                 CalTrain stations. Support commercial uses are permitted, subject to limitations
                                 established in the Zoning Ordinance. Site planning and building design shall en-
                                 sure pedestrian comfort, and streets shall be fronted by active uses. The maximum
                                 Floor Area Ratio is 1.0, but increases may be permitted up to a total FAR of 2.5 for
                                 development meeting specific transportation demand management (TDM), struc-
                                 tured parking, off-site improvement, or specific design standards criteria. These
                                 bonus standards are shown in Table 2.2-2. The Planning Commission, at its discre-
                                 tion, may permit increase of base FAR in specific instances where existing build-
                                 ings are rehabilitated for office use and are unable meet the structured parking or
                                 specified design standard criteria. However, the maximums (with incentives, is
                                 stipulated in Table 2.2-2) shall not be exceeded.

                                 Transit Office / R&D Core
                                 The Transit Office/R&D area is bounded on the north by East Grand Avenue, on
                                 the east by Gateway Boulevard, on the south by South Airport Boulevard, and on
                                 the west by Industrial Way and the US 101 right-of-way. It is currently a mix of
                                 parking lots and low scale service and light industrial uses. This urban employ-
                                 ment district would be characterized by a walkable street pattern, more like Down-
                                 town than the suburban-style developments that dominate much of the East of 101
                                 area. With the extension of the Caltrain Station and construction of the pedestrian/
                                 bicycle underpass, this area will be well connected to the Downtown, providing an
                                 opportunity for a significant number of workers to easily access downtown ameni-
                                 ties.
                                 Taller buildings are suitable here in conformance with the FAA height limitations.
                                 The area would lend itself to corporate office, hotels, and other major facilities due
                                 to its high visibility from US 101 and proximity to San Francisco International
                                 Airport, Downtown San Francisco and the various employment centers on the

Peninsula. Along the extension of Grand Avenue to the east beyond the rail tracks
undercrossing, limited retail and services may be feasible in the long run and to
provide amenities for nearby employees. The allowable development intensity in
the area would be 1.5 to 2.5 floor area ratio (FAR). A FAR up to 3.5 may be al-
lowed if specific criteria are met.
Community Commercial
This category includes shopping centers, such as Westborough, and major com-
mercial districts, such as El Camino Real, and regional centers along South Air-
port Boulevard. Retail and department stores, eating and drinking establishments,
commercial recreation, service stations, automobile sales and repair services, fi-
nancial, business and personal services, motels, educational and social services are
permitted. An “R” designation on the General Plan Diagram indicates that the site
is reserved for region-serving commercial uses. The maximum Floor Area Ratio is
0.5. Office uses are encouraged on the second and upper floors.
Business Commercial
This category is intended for business and professional offices, and visitor ser-
vice establishments, and retail. Permitted uses include for administrative, finan-
cial, business, professional, medical and public offices, research and development
facilites, and visitor-oriented and regional commercial activities. Regional com-
mercial centers, restaurants and related services are permitted subject to appropri-
ate standards. This category is intended for the emerging commercial and hotel
district along South Airport, Gateway, and Oyster Point boulevards, and South
Spruce corridor. The maximum Floor Area Ratio is 0.5, but increases may be per-
mitted up to a total FAR of 1.0 for uses such as research and development fa-
cilities, or for development meeting specific transportation demand management
(TDM), off-site improvement, or specific design standards. The Gateway Business
Park Master Planb area, comprising several parcels on 22.6 acres at the southeast
corner of Gateway Boulevard and Oyster Point Boulevard, is permitted to develop
up to a FAR of 1.25Maximum FAR for hotel developments shall be 1.2, with in-
creases to a maximum total FAR of 2.0 for development meeting specified criteria.

                                 uses are permitted.
                                 The frontage of a site along El Camino Real and other Arterial/Collector streets
                                 in the corridor is required to be devoted to active uses—uses that are accessible
                                 to the general public and generate walk-in pedestrian clientele and contribute to a
                                 high level of pedestrian activity. Uses that generate pedestrian activity include retail
                                 shops, restaurants, bars, theaters and the performing arts, commercial recreation and
                                 entertainment, personal and convenience services, hotels, banks, travel agencies,
                                 child care services, libraries, museums and galleries.
                                 For sites larger than 20,000 square feet, the minimum FAR for all uses, exclusive of
                                 substantially above-grade structured parking, shall be 0.6, of which a minimum 0.3
                                 FAR shall be active uses. The requirement for a minimum 0.3 FAR of active uses
                                 does not apply to projects where 30% of the units are restricted and affordable to
                                 low- or low-moderate-income households.
                                 The maximum FAR for all uses, inclusive of housing and substantially above-grade
                                 structured parking shall be 2.5, with increases to a maximum total FAR of 3.5 for
                                 development meeting specified criteria.

Mixed Industrial
This designation is intended to provide and protect industrial lands for a wide range
of manufacturing, industrial processing, general service, warehousing, storage and
distribution, and service commercial uses. Industries producing substantial amounts
of hazardous waste or odor and other pollutants are not permitted. Unrelated retail
and service commercial uses that could be more appropriately located elsewhere
in the city would not be permitted, except for offices, subject to appropriate stan-
dards. Small restaurants and convenience stores would be allowed as ancillary uses,
subject to appropriate standards. The maximum Floor Area Ratio is 0.4, with an in-
crease to a total FAR of 0.6 for development seeking an FAR bonus with TDM pro-
gram as specified in the Zoning Ordinance. In addition to development standards,
the Zoning Ordinance may include performance standards to minimize potential
environmental impacts.
PUBLIC/INSTITUTIONAL
To provide for schools, government offices, transit sites, airport, and other facilities
that have a unique public character. Religious facilities are not called out separately
on the General Plan Diagram, but are instead shown with designations on adjoining
sites; these facilities may be specifically delineated on the Zoning Map.
PARKS
Parks, recreation complexes, public golf courses, and greenways.
OPEN SPACE
This designation includes sites with environmental and/or safety constraints. In-
cluded are sites with slopes greater than 30 percent, sensitive habitats, wetlands,
creekways, areas subject to flooding, and power transmission line corridors. Where
otherwise not excluded by noise, aircraft safety or other environmental standards,
residential development is generally permitted at a density not to exceed one hous-
ing unit per 20 acres.

2.3 	 PLANNING SUB-AREAS
Land use information presented in the section that follows is presented by 14 sub-
areas, which have been collectively derived from analysis of land use and urban
design patterns and the need for focused planning efforts and activities. These sub-
areas are shown in Figure 2-6. In some cases, the City’s traditional neighborhood
planning areas that are used for park and schools planning were aggregated where
adjacent neighborhoods are very similar in terms of their land uses, age of devel-
opment, and current activity level. The East of 101 area, which comprises a single
City neighborhood planning area because there are no residents, is divided into
four subareas for presenting planning information. The areas are:
    1.	 Avalon
    2.	 Downtown
    3.	 East of 101 area
    4.	 El Camino Real
    5.	 Gateway
    6.	 Lindenville
    7.	 Orange Park
    8.	 Oyster Point
    9.	 Paradise Valley/Terrabay
    10.	 Sign Hill
    11.	 South Airport
    12.	 Sunshine Gardens
    13.	 Westborough
    14.	 Winston-Serra
Descriptions of these areas and detailed policies for each sub-area are included in
Chapter 3.

Additional development under the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan is
projected for the El Camino Real subarea. Buildout will result in an increase of
1,455 residential units and 298,400 square feet of non-residential space. The plan-
ning horizon for the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan is 2030, which
exceeds the planning horizon of this General Plan. Table 2.4-1 shows additional de-
velopment in the City if full buildout of the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area
Plan occurs within the General Plan horizon. (Amended by City Council Resolu-

Employment
While non-residential building space in South San Francisco will increase from an
estimated current 18.1 million square feet to 30.1 million square feet at buildout (an
increase of 66 percent), the General Plan at buildout will accommodate an employ-
ment increase from 39,100 currently to as much as 77,900 at buildout (an increase
of 99 percent; including construction and at-home workers), primarily as sites with
low-intensity warehousing and distribution uses (with an estimated average 960
square feet per employee in South San Francisco) are succeeded by higher inten-
sity office, retail, and other similar uses. This level of employment attainment will
likely take place over a time-period that may extend beyond 20 years. Table 2.4-3
shows existing and buildout employment by broad land use categories. (Amended
by City Council Resolution 19-2010, adopted February 10, 2010 and 47-2011, ad-

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 REVISED BUILDOUT & GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT
                                 In 2001, the City Council adopted the General Plan Amendment and Transportation
                                 Demand Management Ordinance, which incorporates a revision to the approved
                                 land use buildout in the East of 101 area. The Amendment includes the following
                                 conclusions:
                                 •	 Total buildout will nearly double from existing development: 12.82 million
                                      square feet in 2001 to 23.32 million square feet in 2020, due mainly to the
                                      increase in Office and Office/R&D development. The revised East of 101 area
                                      buildout assumes a 0.9 FAR for new Office development.
                                 •	 The Amendment anticipates that the East of 101 area will support an addi-
                                      tional six million square feet, over the buildout that is projected in the South
                                      San Francisco General Plan (1999). The additional development was based on
                                      the major projects lists (2000-2001), the Gateway and Genentech development
                                      plans, and determining the likely properties that would convert from industrial
                                      to Office/R&D by 2020.
                                 •	 Employment in the East of 101 area will increase by 2.4 times, from 21,654 to
                                      52,880. This increase is due to both increases in floor space in the East of 101
                                      area and due to Office and Office/R&D uses having a much higher employ-
                                      ment intensity that industrial development. The projected employment is
                                      based on Commercial at 400 square feet/employee, Office/R&D at 450 square
                                      feet/employee, Office at 375 square feet/employee, Hotel at 420 square feet/
                                      employee and Industrial at 955 square feet/employee. (Resolution 98-2001,
                                      Adopted September 26, 2001)

                                 Where once the residential and commercial portion of South San Francisco was a
                                 company town for the “beef trust” packers on Point San Bruno, improved transpor-
                                 tation access and extensive growth in the 1940s-1960s turned South San Francisco
                                 into a commuter suburb. Today only 23 percent of employed residents work in the
                                 city, despite a surplus of jobs, indicating regional jobs-housing inter-dependencies.
                                 As Table 2.4-4 shows, the city has continued to add jobs at a faster rate than popula-
                                 tion for the last 15 years, and in 1995, there were 13,610 more jobs than employed

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 jobs; however, during the last 15 years, the overall jobs/employed residents ratio
                                 in San Mateo County has crept closer to balance.
                                 Given that much of the land in the city—including all of the East of 101 area—
                                 is not suited for residential development, it is unlikely that a balance between
                                 jobs and housing can be attained. However, continued job growth in the city will
                                 promote a greater regional balance between jobs and housing. As an inner Bay
                                 Area community well served by all modes of transit—including air and rail, and
                                 in the near future BART and ferry service—employment growth in the city will
                                 support regional transit as well. Nonetheless, availability of housing in South San
                                 Francisco serves not only regional interest, but is imperative to attracting high-
                                 technology and biotechnology jobs that the city seeks. Increased residential de-
                                 velopment within the city will help partly alleviate traffic impacts resulting from
                                 job growth, and provide residential opportunities to those that work in the city but
                                 live elsewhere. Thus, the General Plan seeks to maximize residential development
                                 opportunities on infill sites.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 These plans will continue to play key roles in shaping areas of their geographic
                                 concern. Certain aspects of some of these plans may need to be modified to ensure
                                 consistency with the 1999 General Plan.
                                 PLANS AND PROGRAMS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS
                                 External impacts from land uses and activities in surrounding cities and jurisdic-
                                 tions influence development in South San Francisco as well. By and large, none of
                                 the surrounding cities have planned uses that are likely to have a direct physical
                                 impact on South San Francisco. In its General Plan, the City of Brisbane outlines
                                 a development strategy for its bayside parcels similar to South San Francisco’s
                                 strategies in the East of 101 area, potentially affecting South San Francisco’s fu-
                                 ture development potential. If this development occurs, Brisbane could compete
                                 with South San Francisco for office space or potentially increase traffic in the area;
                                 however, Brisbane still needs to overcome major infrastructure and environmental
                                 constraints before this development is likely to begin. San Bruno is planning for a
                                 mix of office and hotel uses for the West Division property, one-quarter mile south
                                 along El Camino Real, that is currently being used by the U.S. Navy, but will be
                                 vacated soon. Impacts of this are likely to be localized.
                                 San Francisco International Airport has major direct and indirect influences on
                                 South San Francisco’s land use and economic prospects. Airport-imposed height
                                 restrictions and noise limit land use options in some parts of the city (see Figure
                                 2-2). However, a greater impact could stem from airport expansion, fueling growth
                                 in airport-supportive or -dependent uses such as freight forwarding, and the result-
                                 ing demand for housing and other services in South San Francisco.

2.6 	 LAND USE POLICIES
Because land use policies for each of the planning sub-areas are spelled out in
Chapter 3, policies here focus on citywide issues and those of a programmatic
nature.
GUIDING POLICIES
2-G-1	     Preserve the scale and character of established neighborhoods, and
           protect residents from changes in non-residential areas.
           Protection of residential neighborhoods is a General Plan theme. While
           some parts of the city are expected to undergo change over time, the Gen-
           eral Plan seeks to ensure that existing residential neighborhoods are fully
           protected from changes elsewhere.
2-G-2	     Maintain a balanced land use program that provides opportunities for
           continued economic growth, and building intensities that reflect South
           San Francisco’s prominent inner bay location and excellent regional
           access.
2-G-3	     Provide land use designations that maximize benefits of increased
           accessibility that will result from BART extension to the city and adja-    San Bruno residences on the left and South San Francisco
                                                                                       industrial uses on the right share Tanforan Avenue.

           cisco’s best interest, but a regional interest as well.
2-G-4	     Provide for continued operation of older industrial and service com-
           mercial businesses at specific locations.
           The City recognizes that many existing manufacturing and warehousing
           and distribution uses perform a regional function as well, and seeks to
           maintain these as conforming uses in specific locations.
2-G-5	Maintain Downtown as the City’s physical and symbolic center, and a
           focus of residential, commercial, and entertainment activities.
2-G-6	     Maximize opportunities for residential development, including through
           infill and redevelopment, without impacting existing neighborhoods or
           creating conflicts with industrial operations.
                                                                                                                                             2-39

                                                                   and encourage inclusion of childcare centers in non-residential devel-

                                                                   dential development. Approval of developments at lower than stipulated

        underlying base district uses.
        These are areas that are central from a community perspective or areas
        where change is expected. The intent is to provide to achieve unified de-
        velopment regardless of underlying uses. For building heights East of 101
        area, also see Section 3.5: East of 101 area.
2-I-3	  Undertake planned development for unique projects or as a means to
        achieve high community design standards, not to circumvent develop-
        ment intensity standards.
        While in recent years established development intensities have been con-
        straints to achieving prevailing intensities in the region, and even in the
        city, necessitating the need for planned developments, intensities estab-
        lished in this General Plan reflect development that is appropriate given
        both the local and the regional context. This should obviate the need for
        planned developments merely as a tool to achieve higher than otherwise
        attainable standards.
2-I-4	  Require all new developments seeking an FAR bonus set forth in Table
        2.2-2 to achieve a progressively higher alternative mode usage.
        The requirements of the TDM Program are detailed in the Zoning
        Ordinance. (Amended by City Council Resolution 98-2001, Adopted
        September 26, 2001)
	       The requirements of the TDM program for projects seeking an FAR
        bonus are based on the percentage trip reduction that is achieved.
2-I-4a	 Establish design requirements to achieve an FAR bonus as set forth in
        Table 2.2-2. (Amended by City Council Resolution 98-2001, Adopted
        September 26, 2001)
2-I-5	  Examine the potential for establishing performance-based standards
        for industrial development to minimize resulting impacts.
        These would address issues such as noise, glare, odor, air quality, and
        screening of parking and loading areas. Establishment of these is espe-
        cially critical where industrial uses come in contact with other uses, such
        as the Mayfair, Orange Park, and downtown neighborhoods near Linden-
        ville.
2-I-6	  Undertake a comprehensive review of the parking standards and
                                                                                           2-41

                                                             Standards are items that can be mapped or measured and are manda-

                                                             Policies outlined in Chapter 3 for each of these areas would provide a

        design review, improve the community orientation of new develop-
        ment.
        A community orientation calls for greater attention to the relationship be-
        tween residences, streets and shared spaces, and does not require sacrifice
        of privacy or amenities. Specific steps could include:
        •	 Not permitting gated developments;
        •	 Allowing sound walls only along freeway and arterial streets, as
             established in Chapter 4: Transportation; and
        •	 Requiring parking in all non-industrial and business and technol-
             ogy park areas to be tucked behind buildings.
2-I-9	  Ensure that any design and development standards and guidelines
        that are adopted reflect the unique patterns and characteristics of
        individual neighborhoods.
        Examples of urban patterns in South San Francisco that deviate from con-
        temporary practice that would not be permitted under current standards
        are several and include: Southwood Center, one of the few examples of a
        shopping center outside of downtown built to the street edge; residential
        developments in downtown built to the street edge which would be pro-
        scribed under current standards; and small-lot subdivisions such as in the
        “Town of Baden” subdivision, built before the City was incorporated.
        Several tools are available to structure the Zoning Ordinance to be respon-
        sive to the city’s urban fabric rather than imposing a unified set of stan-
        dards, including: community character based districts; special districts
        (base or overlay) targeted at areas with unique development characteris-
        tics, as well as performance-based standards that allow flexibility. These
        options will need to be explored as part of the Zoning Ordinance update
        (Policy 2-I-1).

                                         •	 Developing criteria for incentives for childcare facilities, as part of

            Churches and other institutional land uses in the unincorporated Country
            Club park subdivision have been creating conflicts with surrounding resi-
            dential areas. Parking, noise and traffic within City limits are exacerbated
            by the concentration of churches in this small area. Policy 3.6-I-4 stipu-

            a minimum.
            Most of the level properties in the City have been developed. Many of
            the remaining vacant properties contain steep slopes which exceed 30
            percent grade. Many of these steep slopes are visually prominent and
                                                                                                 2-45

3 PLANNING SUB-
  AREAS ELEMENT
  This chapter established policies specific to individual planning sub-areas in the
  city. Policies in this element complement citywide policies included in the Land
  Use and other elements.
  The sub-areas, 14 in all, were collectively derived from analysis of land use and
  urban design patterns and existing and needed planning efforts and activities. In
  some cases, the city’s traditional neighborhood planning areas that are used for
  park and schools planning were aggregated where adjacent neighborhoods are
  very similar in terms of their land uses, age of development, and current activity
  level. The sub-areas are shown in Figure 2-6; these correspond with the sub-areas
  used for reporting land use information in Chapter 2: Land Use Element. The East
  of 101 area, which comprises a single city neighborhood planning area because
  there are no residents, represents an aggregation of four sub-areas in the Land Use
  Element. El Camino Real was defined as a single sub-area to reflect its distinctive
  use pattern and to facilitate future planning.
  Some of these sub-areas have detailed area plans, specific plans, or redevelopment
  plans; where appropriate, the General Plan provides guidance as to how these
  plans may need to be changed in order to conform to the policy direction provided
  by the General Plan.
  While most neighborhoods in the city are established and unlikely to experience
  great change as a result of the General Plan, others are either in transition, or
  require special emphasis in the City’s planning process. These areas are:
  •	 Downtown. This includes both the core commercial area, as well as downtown
       residential neighborhoods;
  •	 Lindenville. Located south of downtown, this is the city’s only large-scale
       industrial area west of U.S. 101;
                                                                                      3-1

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 •	 South Spruce Corridor/San Bruno Bart Station Area. Traditionally considered
                                     a part of Lindenville, these areas are called out separately due to the potential
                                     created by extension of BART;
                                 •	 El Camino Real Corridor. Included here are policies addressing development
                                     in the almost three-mile long corridor along the old Peninsula highway; and
                                 •	 East of 101. This encompasses the entire area within City limits east of U.S. 101.
                                 Areas not expected to undergo major change are Avalon, Orange Park, Sign
                                 Hill, Sunshine Gardens, Westborough, and Winston-Serra. Development in the
                                 Terrabay portion of the Paradise Valley/Terrabay sub-area is likely to continue
                                 under the auspices of the Terrabay Specific Plan.

3.1 	 DOWNTOWN
Located in the geographic heart of the city, Downtown is the city’s most unique                  Typical Downtown Block Dimensions
commercial center, and arguably contributes more to the city’s identity than any
other district. It includes the oldest commercial and residential areas of the city
– the Grand Avenue Commercial District and adjoining residential areas, extend-                                       1300 ft
ing from Linden Avenue in the east to Chestnut Avenue in the west. Downtown
also extends northward in roughly a quarter-mile width along Linden Avenue to
Hillside Boulevard. The area within a half-mile radius of the Linden Avenue/
                                                                                                                        Alley
Grand Avenue intersection, a small portion of which is in Lindenville, supports         300 ft
more than 8,500 jobs (20 percent of the city total) and 15 percent of the city’s         20 ft
residents.
Downtown’s gridiron development pattern was established at the turn of the
century. The orthogonal street pattern (completed in 1908) is 1.5-miles long and
extends from the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the east to Chestnut Avenue in
the west. The pattern is 0.25-miles and four blocks wide from Railroad Avenue in
the south to Miller Avenue in the north. Another 0.25-mile wide portion extends
along Linden Avenue from Miller Avenue to the edge of Sign Hill and San Bruno
Mountain to the north. The typical block dimension in Downtown is 1,300 x 300
feet, with 20-foot wide mid-block alleys. Resulting average lots are 140 feet deep
and 50 feet wide, or 7,000 square feet in area. Half lots (25-feet wide) and other
sizes exist as well.                                                                              Downtown’s Gridiron Development Pattern
While the tallest building in Downtown is four stories in height, the majority
of buildings, including those along Grand Avenue, are one- to two-stories tall.
Almost all non-residential uses are built to the street. Older commercial buildings
have side-parking, permitting a portion of the site to be built to the street.
Stores in Downtown generally serve the adjacent residential neighborhoods,
although some restaurants have a citywide draw. A wide range of housing types—
from single-family detached residences to three-story apartment buildings with
tuck-under parking—are represented. A handful of apartment buildings with three
occupied floors also exist in the northern part of the area. Due to the small lot
sizes, there had been little residential redevelopment activity, until very recently.

3.1-G-3	Promote infill development, intensification, and reuse of currently
            underutilized sites.
3.1-G-4	 Enhance linkages between Downtown and transit centers, and
            increased street connectivity with the surrounding neighborhoods.
3.1-G-5	    Implement the principles and policies of the South San Francisco
            Downtown Station Area Specific Plan. (Amended by City Council
            Resolution 15-2015, Adopted January 28, 2015).
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES: DOWNTOWN
See also policies related to transportation and specific street improvements
in Downtown in Chapter 4: Transportation, and Chapter 7: Open Space and
Environmental Conservation for historic and cultural preservation policies. See           Unique mid-block alleys in Downtown provide linkages
also policies in the adopted Downtown Station Area Specific Plan.                         and parking tucked away behind buildings.
3.1-I-1	    Maintain land uses and development intensities in Downtown in accor-
            dance with Table 3.1-2.
3.1-I-2	Prohibit manufacturing, warehouses, and marginal uses such as bars
            or adult entertainment, as well as additional single-room occupancy
            units in Downtown.
3.1-I-3	    Do not permit any commercial and office uses in areas designated
            Downtown Residential.
3.1-I-4	    Establish a height overlay zone in the Municipal Code correspond-
            ing to the standards depicted in Figure 2-3. Do not maintain separate
            height requirements tied to underlying land uses.
            This will help attain heights appropriate to individual corridors, rather
            than reflecting the variation that will result from the application of height
            requirements tied to individual land uses.
3.1-I-5	    Establish development standards in the Municipal Code to reinforce
            Downtown’s traditional development pattern.
		               These should include:

3.1-I-6	 Work with the Peninsula Joint Corridors Board and other agencies to
         develop a new multi-modal transportation hub on the southeast side
         of the Grand Avenue/Airport Boulevard intersection. Encourage the
         inclusion of a child care facility near the multi-modal hub.
         See Figure 4-5 of Chapter 4 for a conceptual plan of the multi-modal hub.
3.1-I-7	 Undertake a Downtown streetscape improvement program, which
         would include:
         •	  Signage or banners along the east side of Airport Boulevard to
             announce Downtown and the auto row from U.S. 101;
         •	  Signage for the new multi-modal transportation center at the south-
             east corner of Grand Avenue/Airport Boulevard;
         •	  Tree planting, especially along Linden Avenue, Maple Avenue, and
             Spruce Avenue, and Miller, Grand, and Commercial avenues; and
         •	  Vegetation along Railroad Avenue to provide a buffer between
             Downtown residential uses and industrial areas to the south.
3.1-I-8	 Improve pedestrian connections between the new multi-modal trans-
         portation center and Downtown through techniques such as sidewalk
         bulbing, lighting improvements, and signage.

3.2 	 LINDENVILLE
For policies related to the Spruce Corridor and the San Bruno BART Station area,
see Section 3.3.
Government-built housing for military personnel and shipyard workers was devel-
oped during the war on the former marshland between Railroad Avenue, South
Spruce Avenue, and San Mateo Avenue. The area is still known as Lindenville, after
the largest government development. Demolition of the housing in the late 1950s
paved the way for redevelopment of the area with warehouses, light industry, and
single-family housing in the Mayfair Village subdivision. Today, warehousing and
distribution and light industrial uses are dominant; storage, automobile repair, man-
ufacturing, and small business parks are also present. Parcels in Lindenville are also
smaller when compared to their industrial counterparts in the East of 101 area. The
largest single structure is the 583,000 square foot former Zellerbach Paper plant,
which ceased operations in 1998, and converted to a maintenance facility to SFO.         Lindenville abounds with large industrial facilities such
                                                                                         as the closed DuPont plant. Redevelopment of these uses

part of South San Francisco where industrial and residential land uses are in close
proximity, it is the source of most of the use conflicts in the city. Conflicts are most
apparent along the Railroad Avenue corridor, where industrial uses abut the down-
town residential neighborhoods, although the Mayfair Village, Francisco Terrace,
and Baden subdivisions are sometimes affected as well. Access to the area is con-
strained, and often trucks have to negotiate downtown streets to access U.S. 101 at
the Grand Avenue intersection, creating bottlenecks at major entryways to the city.
With the establishment of the San Bruno BART station, which lies at the southern
tip of Lindenville, regional access to the area will be dramatically improved. Since
the San Bruno BART station will be about half the distance from downtown South
San Francisco than will be the South San Francisco BART Station, South Linden
Avenue will form the connection between the BART station and Downtown, neces-
sitating improvements.

          cially South Linden Avenue, are likely to become important gateways

          that help visually link Downtown with the BART station, street lighting to

3.3	     SOUTH SPRUCE CORRIDOR/SAN BRUNO
	        BART STATION AREA
SOUTH SPRUCE CORRIDOR
The South Spruce Corridor consists of a mixture of old and fairly new offices, light
manufacturing, warehousing, and residential uses. One of the major manufacturing
uses is Oroweat. Bordering uses include older industrial uses such as automobile
retail and repair shops and Black Mountain Water.
BART STATION AREA
This area includes manufacturing and distribution facilities such as Dow Chemicals
and Rodger’s Trucking that are either winding down operations or are closed. RV
storage lots, tire service centers, and freight forwarders are the other uses in the
area. Extension of BART to the area (the San Bruno BART Station is located with-
in one-quarter mile of most of this 25-acre area) will dramatically alter regional
accessibility. The area also lies across from the intensively developed Tanforan
Shopping Center in San Bruno. Of all the sites near a fixed-guideway transit sta-
tion in South San Francisco, this offers the greatest potential for redevelopment
and use intensification. Soil contamination is a major problem. Land assembly
may also be necessary to achieve high-end commercial development.

3.4 	 EL CAMINO REAL
El Camino Real (State Route 82), was the first highway and automobile route
through the Peninsula. It developed parallel to the former Southern Pacific tracks
(owned by Union Pacific) that linked the “railroad suburbs” of San Mateo County
to San Francisco. The corridor continues to be an important movement route
through the Peninsula. The downtowns of most of the County’s cities—includ-
ing San Mateo, Burlingame, Redwood City, Belmont, Atherton, San Bruno and
Millbrae—are located on or adjacent to either El Camino Real or the Union Pacific
tracks.
El Camino Real, almost two miles long through its stretch in the city, is South San
Francisco’s most diverse area in terms of land use. Reflecting the regional heritage
of the corridor, commercial uses such as hotels, fast-food restaurants, and shopping
centers selling home furnishing and comparison goods­predominate. Residential
uses, offices, and service commercial uses are located in small pockets. El Camino   The site of the former Macy’s warehouse north of the
Real is also a major neighborhood commercial center; all but one of the city’s       South San Francisco BART station.
neighborhood shopping centers are located in the corridor. In addition, the area
contains the See’s Candies manufacturing plant, the Kaiser Permanente Medical
Facility, the County Government Center, and the planned South San Francisco
BART station. New housing developments along El Camino Real include the
Promenade and Greenridge. (Amended by Resolution 31-2010, Adopted March
24, 2010)
Policies for El Camino Real in the General Plan refer to North El Camino Real
and South El Camino Real. The North El Camino Real area refers to portions of
El Camino Real north of First Street and includes the following subareas: South
San Francisco BART Station Area, Kaiser Hospital Area and Buri Center Area.
The South El Camino Real area refers to portions of El Camino Real south of
First Street on the western side and up to Chestnut Avenue on the eastern side of
El Camino Real, and include the following subareas: South San Francisco High

           99-2011, Adopted July 27, 2011)
3.4-1-13	 Develop the El Camino Real/Chestnut Area in accordance with the
          vision established for the area by the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue
          Area Plan.
3.4-1-14	 Maintain the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan as the detailed
          implementing guide for the area. The El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue
          Area Plan provides principles and policies that lay the framework for
          development within the area. The Area Plan provides an overall vision
          for the area in terms of land use, urban design and circulation, and
          emphasizes the creation of a vibrant and viable activity center in South
          San Francisco. The Area Plan also includes Design Standards and
          Guidelines to guide design review of projects.
3.4-1-15	 Work with Kaiser Hospital to undertake circulation improvements as
          described in the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan. Currently,
          the only access points to Kaiser Hospital are from El Camino Real.
          Potential pedestrian/bicycle connections would both improve acces-
          sibility to the hospital and from the hospital to Centennial Way.
3.4-1-16	Connect Arroyo Drive to the west of El Camino Real with Oak Avenue
           to the east.
           This will provide a new east-west connection parallel to Chestnut Avenue.

          El Camino Real:
	         Require a minimum percentage of the frontage of a site to be devoted
          to active uses. Ensure that depth and height of the provided space is
          adequate to accommodate a variety of tenants and provide flexibility
          for the future.
	         Allow buildings up to 80 feet by right, and up to 120 feet (along with
          a higher FAR as specified in Chapter 2) based on discretionary design
          review and approval by the Planning Commission.
	         Maintain a consistent building base/streetwall along El Camino Real
          and side streets.
	         Maintain build-to lines, with step-backs to minimize bulk.
	         Require buildings to be finely articulated and visually engaging.
3.4-1-22	 Maintain large lot sizes to accommodate high-intensity mixed-use
          development.

3.5 	 EAST OF 101
The traditional core of South San Francisco’s industry, the East of 101 area was
originally developed with meat packing and heavy manufacturing activities.
Bethlehem Steel, U.S. Steel, and the Edwards Wire Rope Factory were some of
the city’s major establishments whose products helped build California’s modern
transportation and communications infrastructure. In the 1930s, shipping also
emerged as a major industry, as South San Francisco became an adjunct facility to
the Port of San Francisco. Easy rail access made South San Francisco even more
attractive as a shipping terminal, and the city became the central distribution point
for the entire Peninsula.
In the post-war years the City converted previously unused marshlands into areas
usable for industrial development, drastically reshaping the shoreline and attract-
ing light industry to the city for the first time. Plans were announced in 1963 for
a 600-acre industrial park adjacent to the newly-developed Oyster Point Marina.
This industrial park was South San Francisco’s first industrial development to
                                                                                      The Genentech Campus. Landscaping and lighting near

building design. The park heralded South San Francisco’s industrial future.
In some ways a microcosm of American industry, South San Francisco has been
making a slow industrial transformation for the past 30 years. Steel production
and other heavy industries have largely been replaced by warehousing, research
and development and biotechnology, in part spurred by the success of the 72-acre
Genentech campus, employing over 3,200 people at its 72-acre headquarters at the
bayshore. While the East of 101 area is almost completely built out, redevelop-
ment remains extremely active. Since the city’s industrial base has continued to
evolve as the context for industry has changed, industry will continue to play an
important role in South San Francisco’s future.
EAST OF 101 AREA PLAN
The East of 101 Area Plan, adopted in 1994, was prepared to maximize the poten-
tial of undeveloped or underused properties in the city’s traditional industrial area
east of U.S. 101. Upgrading of existing uses and provisions for quality design are
important components of the plan. In addition to policies relating to land use dis-

                                                          overall employment levels are expected to double (from 22,200 in 1997 to 42,000

3.5-G-4	 Use the East of 101 Area Plan as a guide for detailed implementation of General Plan
         policies.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES: EAST OF 101 AREA
3.5-I-1	 Maintain the East of 101 Area Plan as the detailed implementing guide for the area;
         amend it as appropriate for consistency with the General Plan.
         This includes design review of projects in accordance with policies established in the
         Design Element of the East of 101 Area Plan.
3.5-I-2	 Update land use map and classifications of the East of 101 Area Plan to reflect the
         General Plan policy direction.
         This can be done by making physical changes to the plan document, or by incorporating
         the General Plan policies and maps by reference.
3.5-I-3	 Do not permit any residential uses in the East of 101 area.
         This has been a long-standing City policy. Although virtually the entire East of 101 area
         lies outside the projected Year 2006 65CNEL airport noise contour, the area is nonetheless
         sensitive both from noise and safety perspectives. The 1991 Agreement for Aircraft Noise
         Mitigation between the City and the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) stipulates
         that if South San Francisco approves policies or new development allowing noise sensitive
         uses to be established east of U.S. 101, despite any stated objections on the part of SFO,
         the City will reimburse all noise mitigation funding to SFO. However, with the Agreement
         set to lapse in August 2001, South San Francisco could permit noise-sensitive uses to
         locate in the East of 101 area after this time without forfeiting the monies provided the
         airport for noise retrofitting in the city. However, residential uses are incompatible with
         the existing and emerging uses in the area.
3.5-I-4	 Unless otherwise stipulated in a specific plan, allow building heights in the East of 101
         area to the maximum limits permissible under Federal Aviation Regulations Part 77.
         Airport-related height limits in South San Francisco are shown in Figure 2-2. The most
         stringent limit in the City is 161 feet (above mean sea level) over much of East of 101
         south of Forbes Boulevard and Lindenville. Outside of those areas, height limits increase
         to 361 feet at a slope of 20:1. Some of the western parts of South San Francisco are within
         the airport approach zone, where height limits increase at a rate of 40:1 above the 361-foot Warehousing and freight forwarding will be limited to
         limit, and where other safety guidelines apply.                                              the areas south of the East Grand Avenue.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                          Height regulations have not posed any major constraint to development in
                                          the past. The limits have the greatest potential impact in the East of 101
                                          area; however, even the most stringent requirements in the southeastern
                                          portion of the Planning Area still allow for development of buildings of
                                          up to 12 to 14 stories.

                                          development following adoption of the General Plan.
                                          The need for such a study is at least five to six years, if not longer, away.
                                          The intent is to establish a threshold to trigger a study if the pace of devel-
                                          opment is more rapid than anticipated.
                                          The General Plan contemplates 6.8 million square feet of additional build-

                                          intensity uses, the net space change is expected to be about 5.3 million
                                          square feet. With existing approvals for about 2.2 million square feet, this
                                          policy will permit remaining capacity of about 1.0 million square feet to
                                          allow for continued approvals while the study is completed.

                                          The initial location of biotechnology businesses in South San Francisco
                                          was due to the city’s location as well as a combination of fortuitous cir-
                                          cumstances. The East of 101 area is under multiple ownership, with par-

             estimates suggesting that employment in the area could double over the
             course of the Plan, the need to implement a signage and landscaping plan
             is even more critical. It may also be necessary if South San Francisco is to
             remain competitive against emerging campus-style biotechnology parks,
             such as at the Mission Bay in San Francisco. Policies DE-7 through DE-12
             of the East of 101 Area Plan also include guidance on specific landscape
             treatments, and should be consulted as part of the streetscape plan.
3.5-I-8	     Encourage the development of employee-serving amenities with restau-
             rants, cafes, support commercial establishments such as dry-cleaners,
             to meet the needs of the employees in the East of 101 area. Such uses
             could be located in independent centers or integrated into office parks
             ar technology campuses.
3.5-I-9	     Examine the feasibility of developing a shoreline park at the terminus
             of East Grand Avenue.
             This park will be funded through the standard of 0.5 acre of parkland per
             1,000 employees established in the Parks, Public Facilities and Services
                                                                                                                                                               3-47

                                           sive lunch-time recreation needs of employees.
                                 3.5-I-10	 Prepare a new Concept Plan for the Oyster Point area. Work with the
                                           Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) to reconcile
                                           the differing designations for the area in the City’s General plan and
                                           BCDC’s park priority use in the San Francisco Bay Plan.
                                           BCDC carries out its regulatory process in accordance with the Bay
                                           Plan policies and maps, which guide the protection of the Bay and its
                                           marshes, managed wetlands, salt ponds, and shoreline. The Bay Plan was
                                           last updated in 1998, and retains a park priority designation for the site,
                                           reflecting a land use designation in South San Francisco’s General Plan
                                           that was changed many years ago. The General Plan calls for the Oyster
                                           Point Marina area to be a combination of Coastal Commercial and park
                                           uses. Although BCDC’s jurisdiction and permitting authority embrace
                                           only a 100-foot shoreline band, the City should work with BCDC to
                                           achieve consistent designations in the Bay Plan and the General Plan.
                                 3.5-I-11	 Do not permit any new warehousing and distribution north of East
                                           Grand Avenue or in areas designated Business Commercial.
                                           While warehousing and freight forwarding are important components
                                           of the local and regional economy, they tend to have high service costs
                                           and low revenue and employment generation. The location of freight
                                           forwarding has been an issue in South San Francisco throughout the
                                           1990s. Inclusion of freight forwarding in the East of 101 Area Plan
                                           Planned Industrial (PI) land use classification was debated extensively
                                           during preparation of the East of 101 Area Plan, and freight forwarding
                                           was ultimately included as a permitted use. Recently the City has expe-
                                           rienced an surge in applications for new freight forwarding uses, with a
                                           55 percent increase in freight forwarding firms in the East of 101 area
                                           between 1993 and 1997. About half of the freight forwarding operations
                                           are located in the PI area north of East Grand Avenue, limiting the avail-
                                           ability of this land for expansion of the R&D and office uses for which
                                           the district was created, and potentially making the area less attractive
                                           to such firms. After proposing an amendment to the East of 101 Area

          Plan that would limit expansion of such operations, the City reached a compromise with
          freight forwarding operators whereby warehousing uses may not expand or convert to a
          freight forwarding use after 2000. This policy would make this interim understanding a
          permanent one. The adoption of Resolution 18-2016 clarifies the intent of this policy, by
          stating that the provisions of Resolution 84-97 that permit freight forwarding, customs
          brokering, wholesale, warehouse or distribution uses as legal conforming uses are no
          longer applicable to the parcels wtihin the Downtown Station Area Specific Plan.
3.5-I-12	 Explore mechanisms to help warehousing and distribution establishments, located in
          Business Commercial or Business and Technology Park districts, that are unable to
          convert to conforming uses due to parking requirements, to attain conformity.
          Many warehousing buildings in these districts are fairly new, and many would convert to
          conforming uses if parking standards were not an impediment. Options to facilitate this
          that should be explored as part of the implementation process include reduced parking
          standards for such uses, or in lieu fee contributions to a City-established parking program
          to provide off-site parking at select locations.
3.5-I-13	 Facilitate waterfront enhancement and accessibility by:
          •	   Establishment of uses that would bring people to the waterfront (see policies 3.5-I-8
               and 3.5-I-9);
          •	   Establishment of a bayshore design review area as part of the Zoning Ordinance; and
          The integration of water access and waterfront enhancement into new bayshore develop-
          ment is a major issue. Specific design criteria for the bayshore area should be established,
          either as part of the East of the 101 Area Plan or elsewhere, and design review for the
          area should be conducted as part of design review for other aspects of the development,
          as per the process laid out in the East of 101 Area Plan.
          •	   Ensuring that the Park Recreation and Open Space Master Plan include specific
               improvements for shoreline enhancement and accessibility, as spelled out in the East
               of 101 Area Plan. See policy RE-3 in the plan.

3.6      AVALON
This 492-acre area consists of the Avalon, Southwood and Brentwood single-fam-
ily subdivisions developed in the 1940s and 1950s, as well as approximately 800
multiple-family units. With the exception of these acres of commercial develop-
ment, the remaining land is occupied by residential, public, and open space uses.
The area includes the unincorporated Contry Club Park area and the California
Golf and Country Club. Two schools serve this neighborhood, and Rotary Plaza—a
nonprofit-managed senior housing apartment project—is located here. No land is
vacant within City limits, and reuse or intensification is not expected.
GUIDING POLICY: AVALON
3.6-G-1 	   Maintain the existing character and uses of the Avalon area.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES: AVALON
3.6-I-1 	   Do not annex any part of the Country Club Park area unless the entire
            area is annexed.
3.6-I-2	    Retain the rural character of the Country Club Park, with minimum lot
            sizes being three-quarters (3/4) of an acre per housing unit.
3.6-I-3	    Do not permit any additional religious institutions in the Country Club
            Park neighborhood or in the immediately adjoining area.
3.6-I-4	    Annex the unincorporated islands in the area only after improvements
            to deficient utility and roadway systems are made or otherwise guar-
            anteed by the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors and/or by the
            affected property owners.
3.6-I-5	    In the event that the Country Club area is annexed, allow existing con-
            forming animal uses to continue. This can be accomplished by creating
            and applying a zone to the area by other appropriate means.

3: PLANNING SUB-AREAS ELEMENT
3.8 	 PARADISE VALLEY/TERRABAY
This area includes the subdivisions north of Sign Hill and the new Terrabay proj-
ect on the south slope of San Bruno Mountain. It also includes Peck’s Subdivision
located north of Linden Avenue and east of the PG&E utility corridor which is an
older development with narrow streets, insufficient parking, and homes showing
signs of dilapidation and deferred maintenance. The area includes two schools;
however there are no large grocery stores in the neighborhood.
The Terrabay Specific Plan (see extent in Figure 2-6) was originally prepared in
1982 to address development of one of the last remaining unbuilt areas in South
San Francisco – the lower south slopes of San Bruno Mountain. Development in
this area was extremely controversial, and the plan eventually led to the prepara-
tion of a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for protection of endangered butterflies
and other species on San Bruno Mountain. The Specific Plan is currently being
amended, but may include 745 housing units (including 125 single-family homes),
a hotel, high tech space, offices, restaurants, and a health club. 132 acres of open
space, including an archaeological site, are to be dedicated to the San Bruno
Mountain HCP area. Phase I was recently completed and includes 293 single-
family homes and townhouses.                                                         The Southwest face of San Bruno Mountain is the site of

     3.10 	 SUNSHINE GARDENS
     This largely single-use area contains the Sunshine Gardens subdivision devel-
     oped in the 1930s and 1940s. Multifamily housing is concentrated in the triangle
     between Chestnut Avenue and Willow Avenue. The area is well served by two
     schools and is the site of some new single-family residential development at
     Chestnut Estates and Heather Heights. Development opportunities are limited to a
     vacant site between Mission Road and El Camino Real. A rehabilitation program
     has been approved for the Willow Gardens apartment complex, which may also be
     included in the El Camino Redevelopment Area.
     GUIDING POLICY: SUNSHINE GARDENS
     3.10-G-1	 Maintain the character of the Sunshine Gardens neighborhood and
                 promote new development in remaining vacant sites at intensities suit-
                 able to proximity to transit and employment centers.
     IMPLEMENTING POLICY: SUNSHINE GARDENS
     3.10-I-1	   Require development of the vacant site between Mission Road and the
                 future linear park on the BART right-of-way to:
                  •	 Be at a density no less than 20 units per net acre (maximum density
                     shall be in accordance with the land use classification in Chapter 2).
                  •	 Maximize access from individual units to the linear park and trails on
                     the BART tracks.
                  •	 Not include any perimeter walls (including sound walls).

3.11 	 WESTBOROUGH
Developed after Interstate 280 was built in the 1970s, Westborough contains a
large concentration of townhomes. It also contains one of the city’s main concen-
trations of local-serving commercial uses, with some establishments particularly
oriented toward the Asian community. Although there is some vacant land in the
area, steep slopes and the nearby San Andreas fault are obstacles to development.

               October 23, 1991. Undertake a design review of any proposal in the
               area for consitency with the recommendations and guidelines con-
               tained in the plan. (Amended by City Council Resolution 132-2001
               Adopted December 12, 2001)

  Transportation has long played a key role in shaping South San Francisco. Like
  much of the rest of San Mateo County, South San Francisco initially developed as
  a “railroad suburb” to San Francisco. The Caltrain service that now uses the Union
  Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific Railroad) tracks continues that early commute
  pattern; the earlier train route is paralleled by El Camino Real (State Route 82),
  the first highway and automobile route through the Peninsula. Since World War II,
  these early commute routes have been replaced by freeways – first, U.S. 101 (the
  Bayshore Freeway) east of El Camino Real and Caltrain and, later, I–280, which
  defines much of the western edge of the City.
  South San Francisco has extraordinary access to all transportation modes, includ-
  ing air, water, rail, bus, and automobiles, though capacity and access to the prin-
  cipal route—U.S. 101—is constrained. With the BART extension, the soon to be
  constructed Airport Rail Transit (ART) System, and ferry service on the horizon,
  access to the City has been enhanced even further in the last decade. (Amended by
  Resolution 26-2014. Adopted February 12, 2014)
  The Transportation Element includes policies, programs, and standards to enhance
  capacity and provide new linkages to further an integrated multi-modal transpor-
  tation system that encourages transit and meets the needs of pedestrians and bi-
  cyclists, as well as programs to help reduce transportation demand. Issues from a
  citywide to a neighborhood- and block-level scale are addressed. The relationship
  between the local and the regional system and agencies is also examined. The
  element contains policies to ensure that existing uses and neighborhoods are not
  unduly impacted as the city grows.
  The Transportation Element identifies future circulation needs for a long-range
  planning horizon. The City is implementing these long-range objectives through
  numerous near-term, strategic planning documents. The South San Francisco Bi-
  cycle Master Plan and Pedestrian Master Plan (PMP) are two examples, both pro-
  viding detailed recommendations and concept plans that support General Plan
  objectives. Building on the General Plan’s overarching vision for safe and conve-

WORK TRIP PATTERNS
While South San Francisco is part of the larger Bay Area commutershed, in 1990
over half of the city’s residents worked in either San Francisco (35 percent) or
South San Francisco (23 percent). However, as city residents continue to take
advantage of emerging job opportunities in other San Mateo County cities, the
proportion of residents working in the city or in San Francisco has declined by
ten percent since 1980. Most city workers live in distant locations, partly due to
the presence of large high-technology employers such as Genentech (the largest
employer in the North County region, with 45 percent of the workforce residing
outside of San Mateo County), that attract employees from a wide region. In effect,
more San Francisco and San Mateo residents work in South San Francisco than
South San Franciscans.

4.2 	 STREET NETWORK, CLASSIFICATION, AND 		
	OPERATIONS
Two north-south freeways, U.S. 101 and I-280, form the backbone of the street sys-
tem in South San Francisco, carrying regional traffic between San Francisco and
Santa Clara County. I-380, an east-west connector between these two freeways, lies
just south of the city. A network of arterial, collector, and local streets provides mo-
bility within South San Francisco.
STREET CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
Figure 4-1 illustrates the street system serving South San Francisco and identifies
the roadway classifications. This classification system includes:
•	 Freeways. Freeways are limited-access, high-speed travelways included in the
     State and federal highway systems. These roads carry regional through traffic
     and access is provided by interchanges at intervals of one-mile or greater. No
     access is provided to adjacent land uses. There are two freeways in South San
     Francisco – U.S. 101 and I-280.
•	 Arterials. Arterials are major streets that primarily serve through traffic and
     provide access to abutting properties as a secondary function. Arterials are
     generally designed with four to six travel lanes and major intersections are sig-
     nalized. In South San Francisco, there are two types of arterials: major arterials
     and minor arterials. Major arterials are typically divided (have raised medians),
     have more travel lanes, and carry more traffic than minor arterials. Major arte-
     rials in the city include El Camino Real, Sisters Cities Boulevard, Junipero Serra
     Boulevard, and East Grand Avenue. Minor arterials include Mission Road and
     Orange Avenue.
•	 Collectors. Collectors connect arterials with local streets, and provide access
     and circulation within neighborhoods. Collectors are typically designed with
     two travel lanes, parking lanes, planter strips, and sidewalks. Examples of col-
     lectors in South San Francisco are Commercial Avenue and Del Monte Avenue.
•	 Local Streets. Local streets provide direct access to abutting properties as their
     primary function. Local streets have no more than two travel lanes.
                                                                                                        4-5

                                              STANDARDS FOR TRAFFIC LEVEL OF SERVICE
                                              Traffic service levels for intersections and roadway segments are characterized
                                              by examining peak period and daily operations. The standard used for evaluat-
                                              ing traffic flow is called level of service (LOS) ( Table 4.2-1). Levels of service
                                              are classified by a letter grade that describes the quality of flow, ranging from the
                                              best condition (LOS A) through extreme congestion associated with over-capacity
                                              conditions (LOS F). One measure of level of service is volume-to-capacity (or
                                              demand-to-capacity).
                                              Traffic demand modeling assumes that travel demand is a response to the patterns
                                              of land use activity in a city and surrounding region. The transportation analy-
                                              sis process for the Transportation Element uses existing and projected land use to
                                              evaluate transportation system improvement and demand management needs.
Grand Avenue in Downtown is a minor arterial. TRAFFIC OPERATIONS

                                              Francisco during peak commute hours. Levels of service were calculated for the
                                              city’s roadway segments with current daily volume counts. The resulting volume-
                                              to-capacity ratios are presented in Table 4.2-2.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 train extension projects—show projected operations of LOS F on U.S. 101 and
                                 LOS E on I-280. Within the City, the transportation system can adequately serve
                                 existing travel demand, provided improvements outlined in the General Plan (Fig-
                                 ure 4-2; also see Policy 4.2-I-2) are implemented. In general, with the improve-
                                 ments, existing service levels along most roadway segments are expected to be
                                 maintained. However, portions of Westborough Boulevard, El Camino Real, East
                                 Grand Avenue, and Oyster Point Boulevard are expected to continue operating at
                                 congested levels. (See Table 4.2-2)
                                 The East of 101 Area Plan prepared in 1994 presents several intersections operat-
                                 ing at unacceptable levels of service (LOS E and F) under future conditions with
                                 growth and development in that area. The plan identified improvements to accom-
                                 modate the traffic generated by the anticipated growth. A transportation analysis of
                                 the East of 101 area is currently being prepared to assess land use revisions of the
                                 1994 plan. The results of this updated analysis will be a set of transportation system
                                 improvements to accommodate current growth projections in that area of South
                                 San Francisco.
                                 For a full evaluation of projected traffic operations, the Environmental Impact Re-
                                 port on the General Plan should be consulted. Because existing development limits

                                 emphasis on alternative transportation modes will be needed to maintain mobility
                                 in future.

•	 Arroyo Drive/Oak Avenue connection. This short connection will re-
   lieve pressure off the Chestnut Avenue/El Camino Real intersection.
   Signal coordination will help to ensure that El Camino Real traffic
   flow is not impeded. Use the El Camino Real/Chestnut Area Plan
   to guide the development of the Arroyo/Oak Avenue connection.
   (Amended by City Council Resolution 97-2011 and 99-2011, Adopted
   July 27, 2011)
•	 Mission Road extension from Chestnut Avenue to South Linden Av-
   enue extension. This will be on the BART right-of-way. The General
   Plan proposes additional uses for the right-of-way—a bikeway and
   a linear park as well—a coordinated design strategy and joint efforts
   by the Public Works and Parks and Recreation departments will be
   needed.
•	 Myrtle Avenue extension to South Linden Avenue. This will run paral-
   lel (on the north side) of the former Zellerbach Paper plant. Alignment
   study will be needed, and some small existing structures may need to
   be removed.
•	 South Maple Avenue extension to Noor Avenue at Huntington Avenue.
   While this connection is short and within the City limits, it may be vi-
   able only at the time of redevelopment of the site along Browning Way
   (designated for high-intensity office development, as it is adjacent to
   the San Bruno BART Station). This connection should be a condition
   of redevelopment of sites in the area.
•	 South Linden Avenue extension to Sneath Lane. This would dramati-
   cally increase access to Lindenville and enable trucks to get to I-380
   without going through Downtown. This connection is also extremely
   critical to ensure connection between Downtown and the (San Bruno)
   BART Station.
•	 Railroad Avenue extension from South Linden Avenue to East Grand
   Avenue, following the general alignment of an abandoned railroad
   right-of-way. This would be the first non-freeway related connection
   between the areas east and west of U.S. 101. The street will go under
   U.S. 101. Either a depressed intersection at Railroad Avenue or an
   elevated section that goes above the Caltrain tracks would be needed.
   This will probably be an expensive improvement ($15-20 million),
                                                                                          4-17

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                              requiring detailed studies. However, it is expected to accommodate
                                              more than 20,000 trips per day and existing structures will not need
                                              to be removed. Consideration should be given to providing a bikeway
                                              and pedestrian access in conjunction with the street design. (Revised

                                              development of the regional commercial facilities designated on the
                                              General Plan Diagram.
                                          •	  New interchange at Victory Avenue and U.S. 101. This will provide
                                              direct connection between Lindenville and U.S. 101, and be the pri-
                                              mary truck ingress/egress point in South San Francisco, obviating the
                                              need for trucks to negotiate Downtown streets. As with Victory Av-
                                              enue extension, development will need to occur in conjunction with
                                              development of regional commercial facilities.
                                          •	  Produce Avenue extension to Shaw Road. This will run parallel to
                                              U.S. 101 on the western side.
                                 4.2-I-3	 Undertake studies to establish precise alignments for streets in order
                                          to identify future right-of-way needs. Locate future arterials and col-
                                          lectors according to the general alignments shown in Figure 4-2.
                                          Minor variation from the depicted alignments will not require a General
                                          Plan amendment.
                                 4.2-I-4	 Establish priorities for transportation improvements, and prepare an
                                          action program to implement identified street improvements.
                                          This would require working with other agencies, including BART for the
                                          Mission Road extension on the BART right-of-way, Caltrans on the new
                                          U.S. 101 interchange, and with C/CAG on several other projects.
                                 4.2-I-5	 Establish accessibility requirements for all streets designated as arte-
                                          rial or collector on Figure 4-1. As part of development review of all
                                          projects along these streets, ensure that access to individual sites does
                                          not impede through traffic flow.

         The General Plan anticipates development along several arterial and col-
         lector streets, including in much of Downtown, and along El Camino Real,
         Gellert Boulevard, Arroyo Drive, Victory Avenue extension, Hillside Bou-
         levard, Mission Road extension, and East Grand Avenue. Accessibility re-
         quirements should ensure that ingress/egress from sites along arterial and
         collector streets is limited to a few locations, and residential developments
         do not have driveways lined up along the streets, which would represent a
         safety hazard and impede traffic flow.
4.2-I-6	 Incorporate as part of the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP)
         needed intersection and roadway improvements to enhance mobility
         in the East of 101 Area. These improvements shall include consider-
         ation of bike lanes and pedestrian routes. (Amended by City Council
         Resolution 98-2001 and 26-2014.)
                                                                                       Spruce Avenue looking towards Downtown.
         The East of 101 traffic study, prepared by the City in April 2001, identi-
         fies improvements that would result in better traffic flow and a reduction
         of congestion during peak hours. The following improvements have been
         proposed and evaluated:
         •	   Bayshore Boulevard and US 101 South Hook Ramp(s);
         •	   Bayshore Boulevard and Sister Cities/Oyster Point Boulevard;
         •	   Dubuque Avenue and Oyster Point Boulevard;
         •	   Eccles Avenue and Oyster Point Boulevard;

4.3 	 ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND
PARKING
See Section 4.5 for transit.
Shuttle buses, vanpools, bicycle facilities, pedestrian facilities and informal car-
pools also serve the travel needs of South San Francisco. These modes provide
an alternative to the single-occupant automobile. These modes, plus programs to
promote their use, are discussed in this section.
BICYCLE FACILITIES
Classification System
Bicycle facilities include bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes:
•	 Bike Paths (Class I facilities) are paved facilities that are physically separated 	
    from roadways used by motor vehicles by space or a physical barrier and are 	
    designated for bicycle use.
•	 Bike Lanes (Class II facilities) are lanes on the outside edge of roadways
    reserved for the exclusive use of bicycles, so designated with special signing
    and pavement markings.
•	 Bike Routes (Class III facilities) are roadways recommended for use by bicycles
    and often connect roadways with bike lanes and bike paths. Bike routes are
    designated with signs.
                                                                                                      4-21

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 Existing and Proposed Bikeways
                                 South San Francisco has few existing bicycle facilities within South San Fran-
                                 cisco. Figure 4-4 depicts the locations of the existing and proposed bike lanes and
                                 bike paths. General Plan proposals include: Bike Path on linear park on the BART
                                 right-of-way, extending between the South San Francisco and San Bruno BART
                                 stations; paths or lanes along proposed Bay Trail; and Bike Lanes along the pro-
                                 posed Railroad Avenue extension. Additional facilities, including those connecting
                                 portions of the city on either side of El Camino Real, will be delineated as part of
                                 the City’s Bikeway Master Plan. Future bicycle facilities will focus on abandoned
                                 railroad tracks, located in the East of 101 area and throughout the city, which can
                                 be converted to bicycle paths as part of a rails-to-trails program.
                                 PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
                                 Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, paths, pedestrian bridges, crosswalks, pe-
                                 destrian signals and resting areas. South San Francisco offers many great walk-
                                 ing environments. The Downtown area provides a well-connected street network
                                 complete with sidewalks, commercial activity, destinations, and public amenities.
                                 Shared multi-use paths run along the waterfront and connect San Bruno and South
                                 San Francisco BART stations. Many streets throughout the city and the Downtown
                                 have sidewalks, pedestrian signals and crosswalks to accommodate pedestrian cir-
                                 culation. (Amended by City Council resolution 26-2014, Adopted February 12,
                                 2014)
                                 Pedestrian facilities include the following elements:
                                 •	 Pedestrian right-of-way (sidewalk, bulbout, curb ramp, median islands, etc.);
                                 •	 Traffic control measures (striping, signs, etc.); and
                                 •	 Amenities (benches, trash receptacles, water fountains, etc.).
                                 Many streets in the East of 101 area and in Lindenville do not have sidewalks.
                                 Busy, car-oriented streets such as El Camino Real, Junipero Serra, South Spruce,
                                 South Linden Avenue, Westborough Boulevard, and streets east of U.S. 101 have
                                 gaps in the sidewalk network. Pedestrian facility improvements will improve safe-
                                 ty for pedestrians and also encourage the use of alternative modes throughout the
                                 community. (Amended by City Council resolution 26-2014, Adopted February 12,

SHUTTLE BUS SERVICE
Another alternative mode is the shuttle bus system. The PCRA coordinates with
SamTrans to ensure adequate funding for the shuttle buses. There are three shuttle
bus routes that serve employees of the East of 101 area: the Gateway/Genentech
Shuttle, the Oyster Point Shuttle, and the Utah/Littlefield Shuttle.
The service is fixed-route, fixed schedule and is provided on weekdays during the
commute periods. Currently, the shuttles carry 700 riders per workday. They are
free to the riders. The operating costs are borne by the JPB, SamTrans, the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District, and the City/County Association of Gov-
ernments (75 percent) and sponsoring employers (25 percent).
TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programs are provided by employ-
ers to reduce the amount of peak period traffic by encouraging their employees
to use modes other than the single-occupant automobile for transportation to the
workplace and to travel during non-peak times. According to PCMA, South San
Francisco hosts the region’s largest employers and the best-developed TDM pro-
grams. The largest increases in work-related trip diversion to alternative modes are
likely to be through carpooling and employer shuttle programs, on which TDM
efforts should be focused. While mandated requirements for TDM programs have
been overturned in the State legislature,1 the General Plan establishes an incen-
tives-based land use intensity program with bonuses for projects meeting identified
TDM objectives (see Table 2.2-3) that does not discriminate between small and
large employers.
PARKING
The City’s Zoning Ordinance has parking requirements to ensure that adequate
numbers of parking spaces are provided on-site for most uses. Downtown has a
parking district as well. Instead of individual property owners providing their own
parking, parking is consolidated into City-owned lots. These lots contain 502 spac-
es. In general, the amount of parking in Downtown is sufficient; however, there are
a few locations with capacity shortages.
 1 Bay Area Air Quality Management District’s Regulation 13, Rule 1, requiring employers with over 100 employees to
 decrease the average vehicle ridership was overturned. However, the City can encourage TDM programs and require 	
 TDM measures as mitigation measures to transportation and air quality impacts.
                                                                                                                                  4-23

4.4 	 TRANSIT AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
Figure 4-5 shows existing and planned transit improvements in South San Fran-
cisco.
SAMTRANS BUS SERVICE
SamTrans operates six express routes and ten local bus routes in South San Fran-
cisco. The local bus routes have an average weekly ridership of approximately
3,220 people. These bus routes serve areas of South San Francisco west of U.S.
101. Areas east of U.S. 101 are not served by fixed bus-route service but by shuttle
buses.
SamTrans bus routes in South San Francisco will be modified to provide feeder bus
service to the new BART station at Hickey Boulevard. This will improve accessi-
bility to the station and help reduce the amount of automobile traffic in the vicinity
of the station, but may result in reduced service on local residential routes. Current
plans do not include expanding fixed-route service to the East of 101 area.
CALTRAIN
The South San Francisco station is located on the east side of U.S. 101 on Dubuque
Avenue, under the East Grand Avenue overpass. Caltrain, operated by the Pen-
insula Corridor Joint Powers Board (JPB), has 68 weekday trains between San
Francisco and San Jose/Gilroy. Currently, 55 trains serve the South San Francisco
Station each weekday. Approximately 1,000 passengers use the station daily.
Pedestrian and bicycle access to the station is difficult due to its location. SamTrans
fixed bus route service does not serve the station, as the standard buses cannot ne-
gotiate the tight curve on the driveway from Dubuque Avenue to the station. Con-
nection between Downtown and the station is extremely poor and there is also no
direct eastern access to the station.
In 1998, the City prepared a concept plan to move the station and the platforms fur-
ther south, move track sidings, provide shuttle drop-off on the eastside and direct
bus and pedestrian connection on the west (Figure 4-5).
                                                                                                      4-33
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 The Downtown Station Area Specific Plan furthered the concept of extending the
                                 Caltrain Station platforms to the south, opposite Grand Avenue and the Downtown.
                                 By lengthening the station platforms and reconfiguring the southern leg of Airport
                                 Boulevard at Grand Avenue, pedestrians and bicyclists will have convenient access
                                 from the Downtown to the station. With a well-designed, wide, well-lighted, and
                                 attractive undercrossing, access to the station will be greatly improved.
                                 The undercrossing will also connect the Downtown with Grand Avenue east of the
                                 freeway along the north edge of the Eastern Neighborhood. This extension can be
                                 a location for dining and other amenities that can serve workers in the area. An im-
                                 proved Grand Avenue here will provide a direct pedestrian and bicycle connection
                                 to the Downtown from the rest of the East of 101 area of the City. Plazas, config-
                                 ured with space for special events, art or other gateway elements, will be possible
                                 at either end of the undercrossing and will improve the image of Downtown to
                                 visitors.
                                 BART EXTENSION
                                 The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system provides rail service between San
                                 Francisco, East Bay locations, Daly City, and Colma. BART will be extended from
                                 its current terminus at the Colma Station to the San Francisco International Airport
                                 and Millbrae. The tracks will be underground through their stretch in South San
                                 Francisco. The South San Francisco Station will be located between El Camino
                                 Real and Mission Road to the south of the new Hickey Boulevard Extension. The
                                 San Bruno BART Station will also be within a few hundred feet of South San Fran-
                                 cisco, and about a mile south of Downtown.
                                 ART SYSTEM
                                 An Airport Rail Transit (ART) System, to move people and luggage between build-
                                 ings, terminals, major employment locations, and parking areas within San Fran-
                                 cisco International Airport (SFO) is being designed as part of the current SFO
                                 Expansion Plan. The ART system would loop around the main terminal and garage
                                 area and extend approximately four miles north along McDonnell Road to the fu-
                                 ture rental car facility. Phase II will extend from McDonnell Road to South Air-
                                 port Boulevard (near the United Airlines maintenance facility) and terminate along

the North Access Road. Construction of Phase I started in September 1997. These
routes are illustrated in Figure 4-6. The potential for extending ART to Downtown
South San Francisco along Airport Boulevard was examined as part of the General
Plan sketch planning process. Costs are prohibitive ($60 to $85 million for capital
and $10 to $15 annually for operations), and currently not justifiable based on ex-
pected ridership.
FERRY SERVICE
While there is no scheduled ferry service to South San Francisco, potential for a
terminal at Oyster Point Marina exists. The recently released Bay Ferry Plan by
the Bay Area Council identifies Oyster Point as a site for a potential ferry terminal.

             Avenue/Airport Boulevard intersection, with a relocated Caltrain
             Station as its hub.
4.4-I-2	     Ensure that detailed plans for the multi-modal center include:
             •	  Direct pedestrian access from Downtown;
             •	  Shuttle drop-offs and pedestrian access from businesses east of the
                 station;
             •	  Sam-Trans bus and taxi drop-off patrons from bus routes along Air-
                 port Boulevard; and
             •	  Clear visibility from Downtown and Grand Avenue.

   Amended by City Council Resolution 89-2015, adopted July 22, 2015.
   This chapter outlines the policies and standards relating to parks and recreation,
   educational facilities, and public facilities. While this is an optional element of the
   General Plan, parks, recreation programs, schools, water, and wastewater treat-
   ment are directly related to the physical development of South San Francisco. The
   framework for development provided by this Plan must be well served by these
   programs, facilities, and services.
   Oyster Point Marina Park provides residents and visitors with a trail along the San Francisco
   Bay and picnic areas. The extension of the bay trail along other portions of the city’s bayshore
   would provide continuous access to the city’s valuable natural resource.

                                                       Parks and recreational open spaces provide opportunities for both active recre-
                                                       ation, such as organized or informal sports, and passive recreation. Despite the rel-
                                                       atively small quantity of parkland in South San Francisco, a broad range of outdoor
                                                       recreation opportunities exist, each reflecting the variety of the city’s landscape and
                                                       pattern of development. These range from shoreline open space on San Francisco
                                                       Bay, to Sign Hill Park, situated at an elevation of more than 600 feet. In addition,
                                                       the San Bruno Mountain County Park—a major regional open space resource and

                                                       The General Plan provides for new parkland in South San Francisco by maintain-
                                                       ing the existing parkland standard for new residents and setting a new standard for
                                                       new employees. This provision is made with the recognition that the City’s ability
                                                       to provide these facilities may be limited since the city is largely built out. The Plan
                                                       also seeks to increase shoreline accessibility and foster the creation of an integrated

                                                       South San Francisco currently has 251.2 acres of parkland, as shown in Figure
                                                       5.1. This includes 93.7 acres of community parks, neighborhood parks and mini
                                                       parks; 28 acres of linear parks; 2 acres of specialty parks, 78.4 acres of open space
                                                       and 49.1 acres of common greens. (See Table 5.1-1 – Existing City Park Acreage.)
                                                       Additionally, a Joint Use Agreement with the South San Francisco Unified School
                                                       District provides for the public use of school facilities located on 95.8 acres of
                                                       school district land. (See Table 5.1-2 – Joint Use School Sites.) Not all of the
                                                       school sites are currently available for public use. Two school sites, Southwood
                                                       and Hillside Athletic Fields, are listed in this document as neighborhood parks,
                                                       because although they are owned by the school district which retains discretion
                                                       regarding their disposition, they are currently programmed and maintained by
                                                       the city exclusively for public use. While the overall amount of parkland appears
                                                       adequate to meet the community’s needs, at 5.3 acres per 1,000 residents, closer
                                                       analysis reveals that only 2.7 acres of developed parkland, excluding school parks
                                                       and open space, is available per 1,000 residents. Table 5.1-3 provides a summary
                                                       of park acreage and population.

 Recreation Facilities and Programs
 Community and recreation centers provide space for many of the classes and
 services that are central to South San Francisco’s recreation programs. The City
 has nine community/recreation buildings, some of which are used for specialized
 services such as senior programs at the Magnolia Center, public meetings at the
 Municipal Services Building, and Boys and Girls Club programs at the Paradise
 Valley Recreation Center. The City also has an indoor public pool at Orange Park.
                                                                                                                          5-7

Park Recreation and Open Space Master Plan
Under the direction of its 1990 and 1997 Park, Recreation, and Open Space (PROS)
Master Plans, the City addressed a number of the specific deficiencies in park and
recreational opportunities. The 2015 Parks and Recreation Maser Plan sets forth
Goals and Recommendations, covering areas including acreage standards, park
access, sports field standards, park features and amenities, maintenance, Orange
Memorial Park Master Plan and Aquatics Center, community center facilities,
performing arts facilities, programming, open space access, sustainability and
technology.
PARK AND RECREATION DEFICIENCIES
Deficiencies in park and recreation facilities stem from both the amount and the
distribution of parks and community centers. The following deficiencies have been                                Wind Harp Park at Point San Bruno Knoll in the heart of
identified:                                                                                                      the City’s high-technology district offers 270˚ vistas. The
                                                                                                                 Wind Harp is a visually prominent feature in East of 101
•    A lack of community and neighborhood parks in downtown, home to 20
     percent of the city’s population. The PG&E easement between Armour and
                                                                                                                 area and is also visible from several other locations in the

     Linden, improved in 1997, is partly helping to alleviate this shortage, and the
     Downtown Station Area Specific Plan provides for additional parkland;
•    Inadequate Bayshore access and public parking;
•    Lack of traditional park facilities in the Sign Hill/Paradise Valley Area.
     Development in Terrabay has helped alleviate this situation. Access to Sign Hill
     is also limited;
•    The Sunshine Gardens/Mission Road area is served by schools but lacks park-
     land. Although opportunities for park acquisition are lacking, joint use of
     school facilities may alleviate this situation; and
•    Park facilities have been upgraded (1997-99) to address deferred maintenance
     and for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
     the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) Handbook for Public
     Playground Safety.1
1 California Senate Bill 2733 requires all public playgrounds to conform to the guidelines described in the CPSC
handbook by January 1, 2000.

                                                          recently emerged as a concern. The 1994 East of 101 Area Plan calls for establish-

                                                          Classification System
                                                          The General Plan defines eight classes of parks and recreational open space areas:
                                                          •   Community Parks. Community parks serve a citywide population and usu-
                                                              ally include sports facilities, such as lighted fields, courts, swimming pools,
                                                              recreation buildings, and other special use facilities. Restrooms and off-street
                                                              parking are generally provided. Although community parks have a much
                                                              larger service area than neighborhood parks, they often serve a neighborhood

                                                          •   Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks are devoted primarily to serving
                                                              a small portion of the city, usually within easy walking and biking distance
                                                              from residences. These parks are designed for unorganized and unsupervised
                                                              recreation activities. Play equipment, open turf areas, and picnic tables may be
                                                              provided, although restrooms and off-street parking may not. Neighborhood
                                                              parks typically measure between two and seven acres in South San Francisco.
                                                              There are 12 existing neighborhood parks designated in the city.
                                                          •   Mini Parks. Mini parks are small play areas or green spaces, usually less than
                                                              two acres in size, designed for small children or for visual purposes. In addi-
                                                              tion to play equipment, these parks may provide active recreation opportuni-
                                                              ties, such as handball or basketball. There are 13 mini parks scattered through-
                                                              out South San Francisco.
                                                          •   Linear Parks. Linear geographic features, such as watercourses and shorelines,
                                                              public utility and transportation rights-of-way, provide unique opportunities

   parks and open space areas. While these lands are most often used for pas-
   sive recreational pursuits, play equipment, open turf areas, and picnic tables
   may be provided, depending upon the width of the corridor. There are cur-
   rently three linear parks in South San Francisco - Centennial Way, the San
   Francisco Bay Trail, and Sister Cities Park.
• Specialty Parks. These parks provide highly specialized functions for very
   specific uses. Parks in this category include the Centennial Way Dog Park
   and the Community Garden.
• Common     Green Areas. These areas are maintained by the City, through the
   Common Green Fund, which is finded by a tax assessment on properties
   within the designated areas. They are semi-public in nature.
•  Joint Use School Parks. School playground facilities may be available for
   public use. The City maintains a Joint Powers Agreement with the School
   District for the use of 11 parks and playfields for school sports and City rec-
   reation programs. School playgrounds account for approximately 25 percent
   of the park and open space area in South San Francisco, measuring between
   1.5 and 11.5 acres in size. These areas significantly enhance the City’s com-
   plement of neighborhood parks and athletic fields.
•  Recreational Open Space. These lands are most often used for passive recre-
   ation activities, such as walking or hiking. Improvements are generally not
   provided. South San Francisco’s unusual geographic features provide numer-
   ous opportunities for unique open space areas, such as the Sign Hill Park.
   Over the years, the City has taken advantage of these opportunities, and is
   continuing to put effort into improving access to the bayfront and the hills.
                                                                                                                         5-11

                                                  General Plan park standards are established in Table 5.1-5. These include stan-
                                                  dards for parks in residential areas (3.0 acres of developed parkland per 1,000 new
                                                  residents), supported by residential development, and in employment areas, with
                                                  new parkland to be funded by requirements based on employment generated (0.5
                                                  acres per 1,000 new employees). With the expected addition of 10,000 residents per
                                                  ABAG projections and 28,800 employees over the plan horizon, approximately 44.4
                                                  acres of new parkland will be needed. Additional opportunities will result from
                                                  creation of new linear and mini-parks, for which no specific standards are estab-

lished in the General Plan. While new parkland should generally conform to size
and service area standards outlined in Table 5.1-5, because opportunities for new
parkland are extremely limited, size and service area adherence is not required.
General Plan Park Proposals
The General Plan proposes several new parks to meet the needs of new residents
and employees, as well as linear parks along old railroad spurs and above the
underground BART tracks. Parkland proposals are discussed in detail in policies
that follow:
GUIDING POLICIES: PARKS AND RECREATION
5.1-G-1      Develop additional parkland in the city, particularly in areas lacking
             these facilities, to meet the standards of required park acreage for new
             residents and employees.
5.1-G-2      Improve bayfront access along its entire length and endorse the promi-
             nence of this important natural asset.
5.1-G-3      Provide a comprehensive and integrated network of parks and open
             space; improve access to existing facilities where feasible.
5.1-G-4      Use the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan as a guide for
             detailed implementation of Parks and Recreation policies for the El
             Camino Real/Chestnut Area. (Amended by City Council Resolution
             97-2011 and 99-2011, Adopted July 27, 2011)
5.1-G-5      Develop linear parks in conjunction with major infrastructure
             improvements and along existing public utility and transportation
             rights-of-way.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES: PARKS AND RECREATION
5.1-I-1      Maintain the PROS Master Plan as the implementing tool for General
             Plan park and recreation policies and proposals.
                                                                                                                            5-13
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                              Park proposals and standards in the General Plan are reflected in the
                                              PROS Master Plan.
                                 5.1-I-2      Maintain parkland standards of 3.0 acres of community and neighbor-
                                              hood parks per 1,000 new residents, and of 0.5 acres of parkland per
                                              1,000 new employees, to be located in employment areas.
                                              The standards set out in this policy may generate a need for 14.4 acres
                                              of new parkland in employment areas, and 30.0 acres of new park-
                                              land in residential areas, as shown in Table 5.1-6. (Amended by City
                                              Council Resolution 97-2011 and 99-2011, Adopted July 27, 2011)
                                              The residential standard is in compliance with the Quimby Act. While
                                              park facilities are currently required for new residential development,
                                              the City’s implementing regulations will need to be amended to incor-
                                              porate park standards for employment uses as well.

        •   Downtown Park. A two-acre park in the downtown area would pro-
            vide important aesthetic benefits to the area. Benches, paths, and                                                  

        •   Orange Memorial Park Expansion. The 2007 Orange Memorial
            Park Master Plan Update calls for the expansion of the park to
                                                                                    
            approximately 36 acres. The potential purchase or agreement for
            long term use of the adjacent Cal Water property would increase
            the park by 6.7 acres, create additional sports fields, and connect
            the park with both Chestnut Avenue and Commercial Avenue. An
            additional contiguous city-owned parcel on the west side of Colma
            Creek would add another 0.8 acres to Orange Memorial Park.
        •   El Camino Real / Chestnut Avenue Area Parks. The El Camino Real/
            Chestnut Avenue Area Plan calls for approximately 9.1 acres of

                                         residents expected at Plan buildout create the need for about 44.4
                                         acres of new parkland. Potential and proposed park sites shown and
                                         described in the General Plan meet the entire need for parkland in

                                         in the General Plan.
                                 5.1-I-7 Work with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), Pacific Gas and Electric
                                         (PG&E), and the SFPUC to lease and develop linear parks on exist-

                                         appropriate and feasible.
                                         The proposals for potential linear parks are shown on the General Plan
                                         Diagram; several of the proposals from the previous Master Plans have
                                         been completed. Previous sites include:
                                         •   Pacific Gas and Electric Corridor. Located in the northeast portion
                                             of the city, this 5.5 acre right-of-way would link the new Terrabay
                                             residential development with Irish Town Green at Linden Avenue
                                             and Airport Boulevard. The varied terrain of this site makes it ideal
                                             as a passive recreation area.

            western boundary to Hickey Boulevard. The PROS Master Plan
            proposes the extension of this park to the Alta Loma School site.
            Opportunities for this extension may be limited by the fact that
            residences are located along this right-of-way. Nevertheless, this
            proposal should be explored.
        •   Bayfront Linear Park. The South San Francisco portion of the San
            Francisco Bay Trail is now continous, and includes paved path-
            ways, benches, parking areas, etc. The area of existing parkland is
            29 acres, could increase with extensions of trail spurs. While pri-
            vately owned, it is under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Bay
            Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), which must
            approve new development plans on land 100 feet from the mean
            high tide level. Existing parkland has been established by requiring
            open space dedication along the shoreline.
5.1-I-8 Develop a network of linkages, as shown in Figure 5-1 and the El
        Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan, to connect existing and
        proposed parks and open space, school facilities and other significant
        features to the greatest extent possible. (Amended by City Council
        Resolution 97-2011 and 99-2011, Adopted July 27, 2011)
        The parkland proposals of the General Plan and the PROS Master
        Plan provide the basis for a continuous network of linkages to connect
        existing parkland and open space areas, school facilities, the bayfront,
        and San Bruno Mountain. This network would facilitate movement
        between these features, improve actual and perceived access, and better
        incorporate more distant landmarks. Linkages would comprise land-
        scape features—such as existing and proposed linear parks and open
        space—and hardscape features—such as existing and proposed city
        streets and connections.
        This network of linkages would also provide the basis for a bicycle
        and pedestrian route system in South San Francisco. See Section 4.3:
        Alternative Transportation Systems and Parking.
                                                                                                                       5-19

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 5.1-I-9 Improve the accessibility and visibility of Sign Hill Park and the
                                         bayfront. Appropriate departments in the City should study issues of
                                         access, safety, and protection of surrounding neighborhoods in con-

                                         Hill Park does not create unacceptable impacts to surrounding areas.
                                         Sign Hill Park and the bayfront are the City’s most significant parkland
                                         resources; however, access to these features is difficult due to the loca-
                                         tion and the perception that these areas are off limits.
                                         Sign Hill
                                         While Sign Hill is clearly visible from most locations in the city, it is
                                         surrounded by residential development and access is limited to three
                                         locations, including Poplar Avenue, Spruce Avenue, and Ridgeview
                                         Court. Access should be enhanced to provide trailhead facilities, such
                                         as signage, a map board, an interpretive display, waste receptacles,
                                         etc. Opportunities to formally establish other access points should be
                                         explored, and access points should be indicated on approach roads and
                                         on bicycle and pedestrian route system maps.
                                         Bayfront
                                         The bayfront is South San Francisco’s most significant natural feature.
                                         Three formal public access points currently exist, including Oyster
                                         Point Marina, Oyster Point Business Park, and at SamTrans. While
                                         access has improved over time as shoreline sites have been redeveloped,
                                         U.S. 101 significantly hinders residents to the west from accessing the
                                         bayfront. The General Plan proposes three solutions for increased bay-
                                         front access:
                                         •    The creation of two new east-west street crossings of U.S. 101 at

             promote improved access (Policy 3.5-I-13).
5.1-I-10 Review the current regulations for the dedication of parkland in subdi-
         visions to ensure that requirements are adequate to meet the standards
         of the General Plan at Plan buildout.
         The City’s regulations apply population density, determined to be the
         average number of persons per household, to calculate the appropriate
         dedication of parkland in subdivisions. The current requirement is the
         dedication of 3.0 acres of parkland for every 1,000 new residents.
         According to Department of Finance estimates, the current average
         number of persons per household in South San Francisco is 3.07.
         According to ABAG projections, this number is expected to increase
         slightly through 2005 to 3.12, and then fall again to 3.07 by 2020. In
         addition, the trend toward higher density residential development—due
         to smaller households and the fact that South San Francisco is generally
         built out and most new residential development will be in the higher
         density ranges—means that more parkland per housing unit will be
         required to maintain the parkland standard of 3.0 acres per 1,000 resi-
         dents.

The District regulates school capacity based on class size rather than school size,
and there is no upper limit on enrollment in each elementary, middle or high
school. The current class size standard is 29 students per classroom for grades K-5,
and 28 students per class for grades 6-12. Since school facilities have been built to
meet this standard, the State 20:1 elementary school class size reduction program
may create the need for additional portable classrooms at elementary school sites.
While only two schools are currently over student capacity, several elementary
schools are approaching the standards set by the District.
Table 5.2-1 outlines current enrollment and capacity for each school in the District.
FUTURE SCHOOL NEEDS
Buildout of the General Plan will result in the addition of 2,800 housing units, or
an increase in population of about 8,200. Based on State Department of Finance
projections by age class and San Mateo County enrollment projections, a decrease
in enrollment in the South San Francisco Unified School District of 940 elemen-
tary, 250 junior high, and 680 high school students, or a total of 1,870 students
compared to current enrollment will result over the General Plan horizon. This
forecast is consistent with the low-medium projections of the SSFUSD which were

                                 ment by school type within the District. It should be noted that these projections
                                 are approximate numbers and actual numbers may vary based on future popula-
                                 tion demographics.
                                 In order to accommodate projected decreased enrollment, approximately three or
                                 four existing elementary schools may need to be closed and existing portable class-
                                 rooms removed at junior high and high schools. The closed facilities could be used
                                 for a variety of purposes, including new parks, residential projects, and childcare
                                 centers or reserved for future school uses. The District will need to determine the
                                 use of these facilities.
                                 FUNDING
                                 The availability of high quality schools is an important factor in the attraction of
                                 new residents and businesses. Consequently, adequate funding for schools is a
                                 primary concern. Development impact fees are an essential source of revenue in
                                 the provision of additional school resources needed for development. Fee proceeds
                                 may be used for construction or reconstruction of schools. Although it is not likely
                                 that any new schools will be built, existing facilities will need to be renovated. The
                                 current fees are $1.50 per residential square foot and $0.15 per commercial square
                                 foot, neither of which are at the maximum levels permitted by State law.2

                                 Historic Use
                                 As indicated in Table 5.3-1, water use has increased steadily, and at a rate faster
                                 than increases in the number of users. Water use has rebounded significantly from
                                 the levels of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when an extended period of drought
                                 and resulting conservation measures brought water use levels down considerably.
                                 While residential users comprise approximately 90% of the water accounts in
                                 South San Francisco, less than half of the total consumption may be attributed to
                                 these users (Table 5.3-2). On the other hand, industrial users comprise only 0.46%
                                 of the water accounts but use 11% of the total water. The yearly average sales for
                                 each industrial user between 1986 and 1996 was 3.65 million gallons. Part of the
                                 reason for the high industrial water usage in South San Francisco is the predomi-
                                 nance of biotechnology firms in the city. Pharmaceutical manufacturing requires
                                 extremely pure water, and large quantities of water are used to achieve necessary
                                 water purity levels.
                                 Projected Use
                                 As indicated in Table 5.3-2, water consumption varies considerably by land use,
                                 making future consumption projections difficult. While projecting water con-
                                 sumption for residential uses may be relatively straightforward, projecting indus-
                                 trial consumption is not, since each industrial activity is different and consumes
                                 varying quantities of water.
                                 The California Water Service Company bases its future water use projections
                                 on estimates of both the number of future water users and the amount of water
                                 each type of user will consume. The five-year average growth in the number of
                                 accounts is the basis for the utility’s projections of the number of water users
                                 through 2020. Water use projections for 2020 range from 5.9 millions gallons per
                                 day to 9.1 MGD. Assuming the SFWD contract allocation is not modified during
                                 the remaining contract period, the CWSC has adequate supply to meet even the
                                 highest projected demand.

IMPLEMENTING POLICIES: WATER SUPPLY
5.3-I-1 Work with California Water Service Company and Westborough County

        to the extent and timing of growth.
5.3-I-2 Establish guidelines and standards for water conservation and actively
        promote the use of water-conserving devices and practices in both new
        construction and major alterations and additions to existing buildings.
        These can be established at two levels: 1) As part of the City’s functional
        plans relating to water supply; and 2) Requiring the use of water-con-
        serving devices as part of project approvals.
        The drought of the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in the imple-
        mentation of water conservation measures in South San Francisco.
        These measures effectively reduced water consumption, particularly for
        residential and commercial uses. Since that time, the average year-over-
        year increases in consumption for these uses was five percent. As these
        consumption levels approach pre-drought levels, and as General Plan
        buildout expects 2,800 new residential units and almost nine million
        square feet of new non-residential development, conservation measures

Just as industry in South San Francisco is a heavy water user, it is a heavy generator
of wastewater as well. Of the 4.95 MGD average dry weather flow contributed by
South San Francisco in 1995, 25 percent can be attributed to industrial sources.3
Projected Use
At buildout, the average flow is expected to reach 13.1 MGD, from South San
Francisco’s contribution alone. The approved and additional development is pro-
jected to generate approximately 2.4 MGD of wastewater. The addition of Biotech
companies who generate large amounts of wastewater, could result in higher flows.

                                         and timing of growth.
                                         The need for capital improvements to the wastewater system will
                                         necessarily be linked to the extent and timing of growth, if sufficient
                                         capacity is to be provided. This requires the continuous monitoring of
                                         very dynamic trends in both development and system capacity.

                                         ment costs should remain affordable.
                                         Discharge from the City’s wastewater treatment plant is closely moni-
                                         tored for quantity and concentrations of pollutants. Noncompliance
                                         with various numerous federal, State, and regional regulations could
                                         result in the City’s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
                                         (NPDES) waste discharge permit to be revoked. Because increased
                                         industrial growth may make it difficult to achieve the standards for
                                         BOD and TSS concentrations over time, linkages between pollutant
                                         levels and land uses need to be established.
                                         Industrial discharges also place enormous treatment costs on the City.
                                         The cost of providing this service should also be closely monitored to
                                         ensure that the continuation of this service remains cost-effective.
                                 5.3-I-7 Encourage new projects in East of 101 area that are likely to generate
                                         large quantities of wastewater to lower treatment needs through recy-
                                         cling, pretreatment, or other means as necessary.
                                         This will aid water pollution control efforts as well.

6 ECONOMIC
  DEVELOPMENT
  South San Francisco’s notable competitive locational advantages within the region,
  a positive business environment, and a resurgent Northern California economy
  position it well to capture significant new development with resultant economic
  benefits for the City. The City’s location is highly strategic, between between
  two world-class universities—Stanford and UCSF—and three major centers of
  economic activity: (1) the rapidly expanding San Francisco International Airport
  (SFO); (2) downtown San Francisco; and (3) the Silicon Valley, the San Francisco
  Bay Area’s primary economic engine, which is producing tremendous growth
  in business and employment activity. The Silicon Valley, once synonymous with
  Santa Clara County, has expanded into southern San Mateo County.
  South San Francisco’s economy was historically based upon manufacturing and
  processing industries, many of which slowly gave way to warehousing and distri-
  bution businesses. Growth in recent years has focused on the information-based
  economy, as more high-technology and service firms have located to the eastern
  portion of the city. With Genentech serving as a major high-technology/biotech-
  nology anchor in East of 101, a significant cluster of bio-technology establishments
  exists today. The ability of the City to attract uses that generate economic benefits
  will depend on maintaining a positive business climate and availability of land,
  particularly sites suited to the needs of large office or research and development
  campuses, or regional-scaled commercial centers.
  Although not required by State law, the Economic Development Element is includ-
  ed to provide a policy framework for ensuring South San Francisco’s long term
  competitiveness in the region. This Element—based on the analysis of recognized
  business trends and available resources—outlines the City’s economic develop-
  ment objectives, serves to ensure that economic decision-making is integrated
  with other aspects of the city’s development, and provides a framework for detailed
  implementing actions.
                                                                                        6-1

                                           ROLE
                                 With demand for land vastly outstripping supply, and with transportation capacity
                                 a potentially major constraint, the need to prioritize the type and the location of
                                 developments that provide the greatest economic benefit to the City is greater than
                                 at any other time in South San Francisco’s history. While most economic develop-
                                 ment activity occurs in the private sector, the City can work to: ensure City policies
                                 do not impede the needs of businesses to move or expand; facilitate and act as a
                                 catalyst for development in strategic market segments; coordinate and provide for
                                 infrastructure improvements; and generate revenue to support economic develop-
                                 ment activities.
                                 A coordinated economic development strategy is also essential for the City to sup-
                                 port its community development objectives - such as providing and maintaining
                                 parks, protecting open space, and maintaining high levels of municipal services.
                                 A managed program of fiscal development, strategic public improvements, and
                                 balanced land use will help maximize resultant community benefits. Thus the
                                 Economic Development Element envisions three central roles for the City:

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 1.	 Promoting development that results in fiscal benefits to the City. Central to this is
                                     an understanding of the benefits or burdens of various land uses on the City’s
                                     General Fund. The relative benefit or burden on the City is an important con-
                                     sideration in the allocation and prioritization of future development in South
                                     San Francisco. Such an analysis was completed as part of the General Plan
                                     process. Table 6.1-1 illustrates, on an average cost basis, the relative net fiscal
                                     impact of various land uses. In the case of South San Francisco, these impacts
                                     on an annual per acre basis range from negative $3,000 for high-density resi-
                                     dential development, to more than $112,000 for hotels.
                                 	   An understanding of these considerations can allow the City to ensure that
                                     each new development pays its fair share of the costs to service it. Perhaps
                                     equally critical, it can allow the City to proactively facilitate fiscally beneficial
                                     development with upfront costs defrayed by enhanced future revenue returns.
                                 2.	 Financing public improvements. The financing of public improvements is a key
                                     element of any municipal economic development effort. Such improvements
                                     may include road widening or extension, sewer and water upgrades, utility
                                     undergrounding, etc. In many cases, these improvements provide the neces-
                                     sary incentive for subsequent private sector investment in the revitalization or
                                     redevelopment of an area. In others, these improvements are made in an effort
                                     to retain or expand existing business, or to attract new business. Since the
                                     City’s ability to finance public improvements is in part determined by its fiscal
                                     health, these roles are closely intertwined.
                                 	   Improvements can be targeted to facilitate or expedite certain developments,
                                     or to ensure that infrastructure capacity does not become an impediment to
                                     growth, as was the case in the 1980s when sewage capacity constrained devel-
                                     opment in East of 101 area.
                                 3.	 Maintaining Land Use Balance. Maintaining a balanced supply of different land
                                     uses—based on economic and community development objectives—is critical
                                     to the City’s financial health. This balance is also necessary to attract businesses
                                     seeking quality housing opportunities and retail services, in addition to ensuring
                                     that existing transportation capacity can be used more effectively. Chapter 2: Land
                                     Use, of this Plan sets the policy direction in this area for South San Francisco.

6.2 	 LAND USE BALANCE: NEED AND GENERAL 		
    	PLAN PROVISION
As noted in Chapter 2: Land Use, a small inventory of sites—totaling 167 acres,
or less than four percent of land within the Planning Area—is currently vacant.
Market assessment conducted as part of the General Plan forecasts that demand
for all land uses will exceed 1,400 acres during a 20-year horizon, necessitating
redevelopment and intensification of land uses. Thus, prioritizing development
and reserving sites for designated uses will be essential to maintain economic
development and to maximize available transportation capacity.
Table 6.2-1 indicates how the provisions of the General Plan will meet the land use
needs in South San Francisco to buildout.
While overall non-residential floor space in the city is expected to increase by
about 30 percent at buildout, employment could soar by as much as 80 percent
or 32,500 additional jobs (see Section 2.4). A great majority of these new jobs will
be in the services sector in R&D establishments and offices, although significant
growth will also result in hotel/visitor services industry. Major sites targeted for
employment growth are located in East of 101 area and Lindenville, both of which
are unsuitable for residential uses.
                                                                                                          6-5

6.3 	 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
The economic development implementation strategy outlined here provides a
framework for ensuring South San Francisco’s long-term regional competitiveness.
The strategy is based on the analysis of business and market trends and of avail-
able resources. While the strategy seeks to attract new businesses, build on exist-
ing clusters of high technology and biotechnology, and nurture start-ups in new
market segments, it also outlines measures to retain and expand existing business
establishments.
GUIDING POLICIES: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
6-G-1	      In partnership with business and community groups, proactively par-
            ticipate in the City’s economic development.
6-G-2	      Establish economic development priorities and undertake targeted
            investments to facilitate expansion, retention, and attraction of busi-
            nesses that meet the City’s economic development objectives.
6-G-3	      Maintain and enhance an attractive climate for conducting business in
            South San Francisco.
6-G-4	      Undertake a leadership role in the coordination and completion of
            infrastructure improvements, and in facilitating environmental reme-
            diation, particularly where the City can provide these services more
            effectively than the private sector.
6-G-5	      Establish land use priorities based on economic criteria and sound
            fiscal planning; reserve sites for designated uses rather than accept-
            ing any development.
6-G-6	      Maintain a centralized economic development and land information
            system, and actively promote economic development opportunities.

                                 Programs
                                 6-I-1	   Establish an economic development implementation program that spe-
                                          cifically outlines tasks to be undertaken, timeframes for completion,
                                          resource allocation, monitoring, and annual evaluation and progress
                                          reporting to ensure the success of the overall economic development
                                          strategy.
                                          Whereas the General Plan provides the overall framework, the imple-
                                          mentation program will determine the specific tasks to be undertaken,
                                          set the task deadlines, allocate the necessary resources, and provide
                                          the means for monitoring, evaluation, and regular reporting. The pro-
                                          gram format could be similar to that of the City’s Capital Improvement
                                          Program, with a five-year program horizon and annual budgeting and
                                          updates. Specific components should at least include:
                                          •	 Target investment and strategic improvements;
                                          •	 Target industries;
                                          •	 Revenue enhancement;
                                          •	 Small business incubation;
                                          •	 Redevelopment;
                                          •	 Land acquisition and assembly;
                                          •	 Development tracking;
                                          •	 Land availability;
                                          •	 Business climate; and
                                          •	 Marketing.
                                          The program will allow the City to demonstrate its commitment to
                                          the expansion, retention, and attraction of business through specific

       actions and investment decisions. The program should actively involve
       business and community groups, and property owners in South San
       Francisco to access community knowledge and expertise and partner
       in the city’s future.
6-I-2	 Continually monitor land use in the city to ensure a “balanced inven-
       tory” of commercial and residential land. This analysis of land use
       should assess the sufficiency of available supply offering appropriate
       use designations and development intensities in strategic locations. If
       needed, undertake strategic land assembly and improvements to provide
       sites adequate in size and at appropriate locations to meet the needs of
       businesses the City wishes to attract..
       Currently, there is a greater demand for all land uses than there is land
       available over the longer term. For the first time, the City is in a posi-
       tion to prioritize the type and location of developments that generate
       the greatest economic benefit for the community. In order to capitalize
       on this situation, the City must maintain a balanced land use inventory.
                                                                                  Several residential projects are currently under construction
6-I-3	 Create and update a detailed five-year Economic Development Budget         in the city such as the Parc Place single family homes along
       outlining the uses of funds, such as priority projects and departmental    Orange Avenue. Maintaining a balanced inventory of land
       operating costs, and sources of funds, including increases in the tran-    uses will be central to meeting the City’s economic develop-
       sient occupancy tax dedicated to economic development.                     ment objectives.
       South San Francisco’s transient-occupancy taxes (TOTs) are towards
       the lower end of the range for peninsula cities. A portion of the TOTs
       is also set aside for the Conference Center. Mechanisms to direct
       some of these resources to economic development activities should be
       explored.
6-I-4	 Establish a computerized central information system for the City to be
       linked with development permitting and the Geographic Information
       System (GIS).
       A computerized central information system could be a key element of
       the economic development strategy. The system could provide instant
                                                                                                                                            6-9

                                        erty ownership, lot dimensions, General Plan designation, current
                                        zoning, business activity (SIC or another federally-recognized code),
                                        development history, environmental status, relevant City programs, etc.
                                        Such a system could offer significant advantages to the City by provid-
                                        ing it with the ability to:
                                        •	 Monitor     sites that are of strategic importance for redevelopment. 	
                                             Monitoring of progress in environmental remediation or status of
                                             environmental clearance is possible;
                                        •	 Coordinate      strategic improvements for redevelopment, such as 	
                                             infrastructure upgrade and extension, environmental remediation,
                                             etc.;
                                        •	 Identify development trends and monitor land capacity;
                                        •	 Identify   sites for acquisition or assembly in support of economic 	
                                             development initiatives; and
                                        •	 Generate reports for marketing key development sites.
                                        Others benefiting from such a system include permit applicants,
                                        property owners, and prospective locators. For permit applicants, the
                                        system could make necessary property information and application
                                        requirements instantly available at the development counter. Tracking
                                        status could also be available once the application is filed. For property
                                        owners, this information could be used to determine the environmen-
                                        tal compliance of their property. Finally, for prospective locators to
                                        South San Francisco, the system could provide the ability to electroni-
                                        cally search and identify sites in the city that best meet their needs.
                                 6-I-5	 Establish a one-stop shop for information on environmental cleanup,
                                        which could be integrated with the City’s existing one-stop shop for
                                        development permits. Assume a leadership role in enhancing environ-

industrial and commercial sites and by facilitating their redevelop-
ment, and considering undertaking permitting authority for brown-
field development.
Employment growth in the city will result from redevelopment of
existing areas. The City can foster redevelopment by acting as a
catalyst and facilitator of former industrial and commercial sites, par-
ticularly where upfront private sector investment is unlikely due to
perceived or actual environmental constraints or liabilities, referred to
as brownfields.
The City should work with the California Environmental Protection
Agency’s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) to deter-
mine the eligibility of these lands for the Voluntary Cleanup Program
(VCP). The VCP offers a streamlined process whereby the DTSC
reviews, maintains oversight of, and signs off on specific remediation
activities for voluntary participants. Successful projects receive a reme-
dial action certification at the end of the process. While the State does
not offer any financial inducements for the upfront costs associated
with site assessment or remediation, the City could use tax increment
financing to undertake the work and facilitate redevelopment.
Several Bay Area cities have launched innovative programs to facili-
tate brownfields redevelopment. In Oakland, the City’s Urban Land
Redevelopment Program streamlines the approval of cleanup activities
for new projects by tracking the development permits and remedia-
tion procedures of completed projects. Based on local hydrology and
soil conditions, the cleanup procedures of completed projects can be
quickly adopted for new projects of similar conditions and use. In
Emeryville, the Redevelopment Agency will become the main permit-
ting authority for brownfield development in the city, coordinating
actions with the DTSC and the RWQCB. Emeryville also plans to
implement a risk-based approach that defines groundwater manage-
ment zones that would allow development without having to totally
cleanup the underlying groundwater.
Some of these approaches may be appropriate to South San Francisco

           as indicated on the Land Use Diagram, and if feasible facilitate the
           required infrastructure improvements.
           The Land Use Diagram designates the area west of U.S. 101 along
           San Mateo Avenue as Regional Commercial. This site has excellent
           visibility and with improvements would provide excellent highway
           access. While South San Francisco has regional retail facilities, a
           regional Commercial Center currently does not exist in South San
           Francisco. A preliminary assessment conducted as part of the South
           San Francisco General Plan: Existing Conditions and Planning Issues
           (1997) indicates that the market area could most likely absorb such
           retail development in the future. The lack of such a facility in South
           San Francisco means that city residents must drive to San Bruno,
           Colma, San Francisco, San Mateo, or Palo Alto to shop.
           A regional commercial center at the location designated on the Land
           Use Diagram would require the extension of Victory Avenue to U.S.
           101, and the construction of a Victory Avenue/U.S. 101 interchange.
           The cost of the Victory Avenue extension is estimated at $17 million;

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 Industry clusters may be described as the vertical and horizontal
                                 integration of firms. In other words, the clustering of certain activi-
                                 ties is largely a function of locational characteristics: some advantage
                                 must exist for clustering to occur. For instance, the proximity of like
                                 ­activities may be advantageous in some industries; the proximity of
                                  complementary activities may be advantageous in others. The identifi-
                                  cation of industry clusters could result from the implementation of the
                                  computerized central information system program outlined in policy
                                  6-I-4. The clusters could then be mapped as part of the system integra-
                                  tion with the City’s GIS.
                                  The identification of industry clusters would make it possible to
                                  ­evaluate City policy and regulation to determine their effect on the
                                   operation and continued success or phased elimination of these clus-
                                   ters. Such an evaluation should include the General Plan, as well as the
                                   various regulations and standards included in the Zoning Ordinance,
                                   such as conformity, lot area, parking and loading.
                                   The industry cluster evaluation should determine industry site selec-
                                   tion and expansion requirements. The high-tech industry demands
                                   high amenity areas that offer physical (parks, common areas, plazas,
                                   and open space) and service advantages. As part of the efforts of this

                                   ness centers, and laundry services. The location of commercial uses in
                                   the East of 101 area should not have a negative impact on Downtown
                                   businesses.
                                   Identification of industry clusters would also help the City determine
                                   which clusters should be targeted for economic development, based
                                   on their current contribution to the local economy and potential for
                                   growth in the future. Targeting of certain clusters could result in the
                                   creation of a specific planning, infrastructure improvement, or mar-

        keting program to retain and expand existing cluster businesses, or to
        attract new businesses to the cluster. The City must work closely with
        industry contacts to ensure the program meets the needs of the industry.
6-I-11	 Identify new industry clusters, such as multimedia, and work to
        encourage startups by promoting locational advantages and favor-
        able City policy and regulation. This should be pursued through the
        Enterprise Development Center outlined in policy 6-I-12.
        Proximate to San Francisco’s “Multimedia Gulch,” centered at South
        Park, South San Francisco is in a position to capture some of the
        growth of this industry segment for two reasons: 1) As multimedia
        startups continue to locate in the “Gulch” the primary advantages for
        locating there—inexpensive and plentiful space—are reduced. This
        trend has already begun with many firms beginning to move other
        Bay Area locations, including to the East Bay. 2) The city’s workforce
        already consists of great number of San Francisco residents (in effect,
        in 1990 there were more San Franciscans than South San Franciscans
        who worked in the city). Thus, the city should be able to draw from
        an established labor pool. Needed will be small ready-to-go spaces
        (including loft-style development) with room to expand quickly.
6-I-12	 Establish an Enterprise Development Center to promote and assist in
        small business startup.
        As an incubator for small business, the Enterprise Development Center
        would serve to promote small business startup in South San Francisco
        and provide technical assistance to small businesses. The Center could
        provide permit and license information, relevant resource materi-
        als, Internet access for research purposes, office space for short-term
        lease, training workshops, guest lectures, and a mentoring program to
        connect startups with similar firms already established in the city. The
        Center could be linked with the City’s computerized central informa-
        tion system to facilitate the identification of appropriate locations for
        startups, and assist the City in its tracking of business trends, identifi-
        cation of industry clusters, and targeting for economic development.
                                                                                                        6-17

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                            New industry clusters should be the main focus of the Enterprise
                                            Development Center.
                                            The Center could operate half-time and be located in an existing City
                                            facility. Similar programs exist in Daly City and San Jose.
                                 6-I-13	    Adopt a home occupation ordinance in support of home-based busi-
                                            ness in South San Francisco.
                                            As home-based businesses become more and more common, the
                                            revenue they generate and the employment they provide has become
                                            ­significant. A home-based business ordinance would permit business-
                                             es of limited size and intensity to locate in some or all residential areas.

                                               infrastructure, and environmental clearances. If necessary, acquire or
                                               assemble sites to ensure availability of sites of adequate size to attract
                                               industry clusters that meet the City’s development objectives.

                                             Chapter 3: Planning Sub-Areas, of the General Plan identifies the
                                             opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization in South San
                                             Francisco and provides a policy framework for the inclusion of these
                                             areas in the achievement of Plan buildout expectations. These areas—
                                             East of 101 area, Downtown, South Spruce Corridor/San Bruno BART
                                             Station Area, and the El Camino Real Corridor—present a variety
                                             of challenges. With careful planning, municipal incentives, and pri-
                                             vate sector involvement, the opportunities that would result from
                                             ­redevelopment and revitalization are tremendous.
                                              While the City should engage in land acquisition, assembly, and

6-I-16	 Maximize the City’s public financing tools and consider opportunities
        for enhancement in order to fund the various economic development
        initiatives outlined in this Element.
        The City derives revenues from several sources. The Sewer Rental
        Fund, not a part of the City’s General Fund, constitutes 41 percent of
        the City’s operating revenues for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. The top
        revenue-generating general fund sources are sales taxes, property taxes
        and transient occupancy taxes (TOT), respectively. These three sourc-
        es are projected to comprise 59 percent of the total General Fund in the
        1999-2000 fiscal year ( percent of the Citys total operating revenues).

   This element outlines policies relating to habitat and biological resources, water
   quality, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions and historic and cultural resources
   conservation. Background information is included to establish the context for
   the policies. Regulatory authority over environmental resources within the city is
   shared among various agencies; the City itself offers protection of natural resources
   through its land use and development policies, particularly in areas not protected
   under State or federal legislation. In addition, the City can also participate actively
   in restoring degraded habitat areas. The risks and opportunities presented by vari-

supports many threatened or endangered plant species, and the city’s salt marshes
provide foraging habitat for seven special status bird species and may include red-
legged frogs and two species of protected plants. Grassland and scrub habitat in
the area attract a variety of reptile, amphibian, and bird species for breeding and
foraging. Some reptile and amphibian species, as well as birds and small mammals,
such as raccoon, skunk, and fox, may use wetland habitat. The nearshore tidal flats
of San Francisco Bay, as well as the open waters, provide habitat for many species
of plankton and other invertebrates, birds, fish, and mammals.
HABITAT CONSERVATION PLANS (HCP)
South San Francisco contains two areas set aside as habitat for the conservation
of threatened and endangered species: the southern base of San Bruno Mountain
within the city limits, and the portion of Sign Hill currently designated parkland
by the City.
The purpose of the HCPs is to conserve and enhance as much of the remaining
natural habitat on San Bruno Mountain and Sign Hill as possible. The plans allow
for limited development in strict accordance with the provisions of each HCP,
ensuring enhancement of habitat through the transfer of privately held lands to the
public, and through the provision of funding for conservation and enhancement
activities outlined in each HCP.

                                         from ecologically sensitive areas, including Sign Hill Park, Colma
                                         Creek Linear Park, Bayfront Linear Park, and other City-owned open
                                         space, as depicted in Figure 7-1.
                                         Non-native vegetation originally introduced as landscaping includes
                                         French broom, eucalyptus, Star Thistle, and Pampas Grass. Removal of
                                         invasive species from public parks and open space in designated wet-
                                         lands or habitat conservation areas is required only where these spe-
                                         cies are known to threaten habitat for special status plant and animal
                                         species. Removal of invasive species may also be required if they are a
                                         notable fire hazard in the parks or open space.
                                 7.1-I-3 As part of development approvals on sites that include ecologically
                                         sensitive habitat designated in Figure 7-2, require institution of an
                                         on-going program to remove and prevent the re-establishment of the
                                         invasive species and restore the native species.
                                         Development projects on ecologically sensitive lands at Sign Hill and
                                         wetlands along the bayshore and Colma Creek must consider the
                                         impact of invasive species on native plant communities in the assess-
                                         ment of biological resources. This program would be required only if
                                         the invasive species are found to be degrading to the habitat for special
                                         status plant and animal species. Table 7.1-1 presents a list of non-native
                                         invasive plant species that should be evaluated.

                                             This mitigation may include providing wetland habitat of the same
                                             type as the lost habitat, equal to or greater than existing conditions.

        ration projects should be sought from a variety of sources. Alternative
        sources of funding may include development projects impacting Bay
        wetlands and habitat outside of South San Francisco that require wet-
        land restoration as a mitigation measure, such as the expansion of the
        San Francisco International Airport. This will also enrich the overall

                                 7.2           WATER QUALITY
                                 Water quality is a particular area of concern because of the ease of water pollution
                                 and the effects of pollution on nearshore wildlife habitat. Point sources of pollu-
                                 tion are regulated through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
                                 (NPDES) permit process. Permits are required under NPDES for all publicly oper-
                                 ated treatment plants and for surface-water runoff in urban areas. These permits
                                 specify the discharge limits for certain pollutants and ensure that local industries
                                 pretreat the pollutants they discharge into treatment plants.
                                 For the purposes of administering NPDES, the State Water Resources Control
                                 Board (SWRCB) has jurisdiction over nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards
                                 (RWQCB) in California. South San Francisco falls under the authority of the
                                 San Francisco Bay RWQCB, which is responsible for implementing State policy
                                 through the preparation of basin plans for water quality control and the regulation
                                 of all activities affecting water quality.
                                 The quality of groundwater and water flowing into Colma Creek and the Bay is
                                 most likely to be affected by nonpoint pollution sources in South San Francisco,
                                 simply because they are not as rigorously regulated as point sources. Development
                                 can potentially pose a threat to surface and groundwater quality through construc-
                                 tion sediment, materials used on-site, and related increases in automobile use.
                                 SURFACE WATER QUALITY AND POLLUTION
                                 Since the city is largely developed, there is a high proportion of impermeable sur-
                                 face area. Also, the clay soils typical of the hills surrounding the city are relatively
                                 impermeable, resulting in significant runoff with very little ground infiltration.
                                 Stormwater and irrigation runoff is collected in the City’s storm system and dis-
                                 charged to Colma Creek or San Francisco Bay.
                                 Colma Creek is particularly susceptible to water quality problems due to nonpoint
                                 sources of pollution. These sources include general pollutants picked up by runoff
                                 from streets, open areas, and urban lands. In most urban areas, nonpoint pollution
                                 includes sediment, oil, debris, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, volatile organic com-
                                 pounds, herbicides and pesticides, and fertilizers. Industrial areas may have a vari-
                                 ety of other toxic and hazardous substances as well. Any pollution in Colma Creek

affects the immediate habitat and is ultimately discharged into San Francisco Bay
near sensitive mudflat habitat areas.
In order to control nonpoint source pollution, which is generally difficult to man-
age, the City joined the San Mateo Countywide Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Program (STOPPP) in 1991. STOPPP functions under a Joint Municipal NPDES
Permit for stormwater quality management, as authorized by the San Francisco Bay
RWQCB. The program includes pollutant source identification and water quality
measurement, and elimination of illicit discharges; structural and nonstructural
controls for commercial and residential areas, and controls for industrial facilities;
and, controls for new development and construction sites1 and other elements.
The program also calls for the preparation of a Stormwater Management Plan
(SWMP) for each municipality. The City has selected a variety of best manage-
ment practices (BMPs) for adoption into its plan. These practices include street
sweeping, storm drain stenciling, spill cleanup, and annual catch basin mainte-
nance. Since much of Colma Creek flows through private property, the City has
also adopted a number of BMPs aimed at private land owners to control litter,
gain compliance from industrial dischargers, reduce pollutants at commercial
sites, minimize construction sediment, and clean and maintain privately-owned
watercourses.
GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND POLLUTION
Much of the alluvium that underlies the lowland areas of the City is capable of
transmitting groundwater, especially in the southwestern portion of the City
which is underlain by a portion of the San Mateo Groundwater Basin. With the
exception of industrial areas or locations with underground storage tanks where
high levels of nitrate and manganese have been detected, the quality of this
water is considered good. However, contamination may be present in existing
or former industrial areas of unconfined waste disposal, or in the areas of high
groundwater levels.
1 Under the regulations promulgated by EPA, construction disturbance on sites greater than five acres
  requires a separate NPDES permit.

7.3      AIR QUALITYAND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Air and climate are important resources affecting the local quality of life. While
changes in the climate and air quality are affected by local activities, they are
regional and even global issues. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have contributed
to the creation of a barrier that prevents heat from escaping the earth’s atmosphere
in a process known as the greenhouse gas effect. Scientific consensus maintains
that human activities are rapidly increasing the concentrations of GHG emissions
in the atmosphere, resulting in a warming of the planet and altering the earth’s
climate systems. Climate change is projected to cause hotter and drier conditions
in California, resulting in more extreme heat events, an increased risk of drought,
more intense weather events, flooding of low-level coastal areas as a result of sea
level rise, and less available water due to a decrease in snowfall. The combined
impacts of these risks pose a significant threat to economic and natural systems
both globally and locally. Yet South San Francisco is making strides in reducing the
local contribution to climate change and preparing to adapt to new climate change
conditions. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
Although both climate change and air quality are broader issues, they affect the
local quality of life. Protecting these resources is vital to the overall health of the
environment. While the local impact of climate change can be indirect and more
long-term, air quality has directly observable impacts affecting the attractiveness
of any locality. South San Francisco enjoys generally good air quality, due largely
to the presence of the San Bruno Gap, a break in the Santa Cruz Mountains that
allows onshore winds to flow easily into San Francisco Bay and quickly disperse air
pollutants. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
Within South San Francisco, certain areas of the city are more likely to result in
pollutant exposure for residents and workers. These areas include the U.S. 101,
I-280, and El Camino Real corridors, which experience relatively high pollutant
concentrations due to heavy traffic volumes, particularly during peak periods. In
addition, wind blowing out of the south and southeast exposes the city to emissions
from the San Francisco International Airport (SFO).
San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin
South San Francisco is located within the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area
                                                                                                                   7-13

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 Air Basin. Air quality in the basin is monitored by the Bay Area Air Quality
                                 Management District (BAAQMD), which operates a regional network of air pollu-
                                 tion monitoring stations to determine if the national and State standards for crite-
                                 ria air pollutants and emission limits of toxic air contaminants are being achieved.
                                 Under the federal Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
                                 can classify an air basin or a portion thereof, as either in “attainment” or “nonat-
                                 tainment.” This classification is based on whether or not the basin meets national
                                 ambient air quality standards. Likewise, a basin is classified under the California
                                 Clean Air Act with respect to the achievement of State ambient air quality stan-
                                 dards. The Bay Area is considered “attainment” for all of the national standards,
                                 with the exception of ozone. It is considered “nonattainment” for State standards
                                 for ozone and suspended particulate matter (PM-10).
                                 In 1991, the Bay Area 1991 Clean Air Plan was developed to address the State
                                 requirements of the California Clean Air Act. The Plan has been updated twice,
                                 in 1994 and 1997, with the continued goal of improving air quality through tighter
                                 industry controls, cleaner fuels, and combustion in cars and trucks, and increased
                                 commute alternatives.
                                 CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS
                                 The federal Clean Air Act requires the EPA to identify National Ambient Air
                                 Quality Standards. The EPA has established national standards for six criteria
                                 air pollutants, including ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur diox-
                                 ide, PM-10, and lead. In addition, under State law, the Air Resources Board has
                                 established State standards for ambient air quality that are more stringent than the
                                 corresponding national standards. The Air Resources Board also sets standards
                                 for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl chloride, pollutants for which no national
                                 standards have been set.
                                 While no monitoring station is located in South San Francisco, BAAQMD sam-
                                 ples local air quality from the nearby Arkansas Street station in San Francisco.
                                 Monitoring station measurements indicate that air quality in the vicinity of South
                                 San Francisco performs well against State standards for criteria air pollutants. No
                                 violations of the State standard for ozone occurred between 1993 and 1997, although
                                 locally generated emissions of ozone precursors, reactive gases (ROG), and nitrogen

oxides (NOx), affect downwind areas where violations do occur.
With respect to carbon monoxide, again the State standard was not exceeded.
However, since 71 percent of the carbon monoxide emitted in the Bay Area comes
from on-road motor vehicles, concentrations in the vicinity of congested intersec-
tions and highway segments would be expectedly higher than the monitoring data
indicates.
Ambient PM-10 concentrations do violate the State standard on occasion in the
vicinity of South San Francisco. PM-10 in the atmosphere is the result many of
dust- and fume-producing industrial and agricultural operations, construction,
fugitive sources (such as roadway dust), and atmospheric photochemical reactions
involving ROG and NOx.
TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS
Unlike criteria air pollutants, ambient air quality standards have not been estab-
lished for toxic air contaminants. These pollutants are typically carcinogens,
mutagens, or reproductive toxins. Regulation of toxic air contaminants is achieved
through federal and State controls on individual sources.2 The preferred technique
for reducing toxic air emissions is source reduction, and as part of a local control
strategy in the Bay Area, all applications for new stationary sources are reviewed to
ensure compliance with required emission controls and limits.
BAAQMD maintains an inventory of stationary sources of toxic air contaminants
in the Bay Area. There are 17 such sources listed within South San Francisco, 14
of which are dry cleaners. The remaining sources include the South San Francisco
San Bruno Wastewater Treatment Plant, the Shell Oil Company Distribution Plant,
and the Superior Aluminum Body Corporation.
Many other commercial/industrial facilities in South San Francisco are sources of
toxic air contaminants, but none result in a substantial risk to the public. As noted,
BAAQMD regulates toxic air contaminants from stationary sources through a
permit process. Mobile sources of toxic air contaminants are regulated indirectly
through vehicle emissions standards and fuel specifications.
2 Federal environmental laws refer to “hazardous air pollutants” and California environmental laws refer
  to “toxic air contaminants”. Each of these two terms encompasses the same constituent toxic compounds.
                                                                                                                                    7-15

                                 Sensitive Receptors
                                 Some people are more sensitive than others to air pollutants. Heightened sensitivity
                                 may be caused by health problems, proximity to the emissions source, and duration
                                 of exposure to air pollutants. Sensitive receptors are facilities that house or attract
                                 children, the elderly, people with illnesses, or others who are especially sensitive
                                 to the effects of air pollution. Hospitals, schools, convalescent facilities, and resi-
                                 dential areas are examples of sensitive receptors. Residential areas are considered
                                 sensitive to poor air quality as people in residential areas are often at home for
                                 extended periods.
                                 CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
                                 GHG emissions result from day-to-day activities within the community. Key sec-
                                 tors that locally contribute GHG emissions include energy, transportation, and
                                 solid waste. These sectors cause emissions through activities such as the combus-
                                 tion of natural gas or fuel, and the decomposition of solid waste.
                                 Standards for GHG emissions and guidance for addressing climate change primar-
                                 ily come from regional and state agencies. In 2006, California established itself as
                                 a national leader on climate change with the adoption of the California Global
                                 Warming Solutions Act of 2006, also known as Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), which
                                 sets statewide targets for GHG emissions reductions and initiated numerous pro-
                                 grams and standards for GHG emissions. AB 32 provides a statewide directive
                                 to achieve 1990 GHG emissions levels by 2020, equivalent to a 15% reduction
                                 below baseline 2005–2008 emissions levels. Statewide, new projects subject to the
                                 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) must analyze GHG emissions and
                                 contribution to climate change. Section 15183.5(b) of the CEQA guidelines also
                                 allows jurisdictions to use a GHG emissions reduction plan consistent with CEQA
                                 guidelines for assessing cumulative project impacts on climate change.
                                 In 2010, the BAAQMD updated its air quality guidelines to include guidance on
                                 assessing GHG- and climate change-related impacts consistent with CEQA Section
                                 15183.5(b). BAAQMD also adopted thresholds of significance for GHG emis-
                                 sions. These thresholds can be used to determine that a proposed project’s impact
                                 on GHG emissions is less than significant if the project is in compliance with a
                                 Qualified Greenhouse Gas Reduction Strategy, as outlined by BAAQMD and the
                                 CEQA Guidelines.

South San Francisco Climate Action Plan
On February 12, 2014, the City of South San Francisco adopted a Climate Action
Plan (CAP) that follows both the State and BAAQMD CEQA guidelines. The pur-
pose of the CAP is to demonstrate the City of South San Francisco’s commitment
to reduce GHG emissions while protecting the unique resources of the community.
As an implementation tool of the General Plan, the CAP provides specific programs
and measures that the City will implement to reduce GHG emissions and achieve
General Plan goals and policies. The CAP and General Plan function together,
with the General Plan providing an overarching framework to reduce GHG emis-
sions and the CAP identifying near-term actions to implement the General Plan.
Technical analysis in the CAP also demonstrates the impact of South San Francisco
policies and programs on GHG emissions. The CAP is a tool that allows the City
to understand its impact on GHG emissions, establish goals for GHG emissions
reductions, and create steps to achieve these reduction targets. Maintaining the
CAP as a separate plan provides flexibility to the City as regulations change, guid-
ance evolves, and new opportunities emerge. (Climate change section: Amended by
Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
GUIDING POLICIES: AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GAS
EMISSIONS
7.3-G-1     Continue to work toward improving air quality and meeting all nation-
            al and State ambient air quality standards and by reducing the genera-
            tion of air pollutants both from stationary and mobile sources, where
            feasible.
            While South San Francisco’s air quality is generally good due to climatic
            conditions, local concentrations of toxic air contaminants, odors and
            dust are relatively high around certain uses and transportation corri-
            dors. In addition, the City has a responsibility to contribute to regional
            air quality improvement efforts.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                         AB 32 calls for the reduction of GHG emissions to 15% below 1990 lev-
                                         els by the year 2020. This state target is also consistent with BAAQMD’s
                                         CEQA compliance guidelines. The City commits to ongoing GHG
                                         emissions reductions consistent with state directives for the year 2020
                                         and beyond. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12,
                                         2014.)
                                 7.3-G-3 Reduce energy use in the built environment.
                                         The energy sector is the single largest GHG emissions sector within
                                         South San Francisco, contributing approximately 47% of emissions in
                                         2005. This sector consists of energy used in local homes and businesses
                                         that are generated from a mix of nonrenewable, fossil-fuel based sourc-
                                         es, such as coal and natural gas, and renewable sources, such as bio-
                                         mass, geothermal, hydroelectric, and wind. The amount of energy used
                                         in South San Francisco homes and businesses determines how much
                                         power utility companies must generate and the quantity of GHGs emit-
                                         ted. Energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy systems can
                                         reduce GHG emissions by reducing the amount of electricity or natural
                                         gas that must be generated and supplied to the city. Optimizing energy
                                         use throughout the community also provides the benefit of improved
                                         building quality and indoor comfort. The City can support energy
                                         reductions through programs such as education, outreach, and incen-
                                         tives. Such efforts will draw on the City’s long tradition of collaboration
                                         and outreach like the Green X-Ray House, a City project with exposed
                                         green remodel improvements that showcase energy improvements.
                                         Standards and regulations are also important opportunities to facili-
                                         tate energy reductions in development. The Economic Development
                                         Element and the Housing Element also support business operations
                                         and improve the quality of the housing stock.(Amended by Resolution

             laws, are the major source of criteria air pollutants in the Bay Area
             Air Basin, accounting for the vast majority of carbon monoxide and
             particulate matter and over a quarter of the reactive organic gases and
             nitrogen oxides in the region. The transportation sector also was the
             second largest community-wide source of GHG emissions in South
             San Francisco in 2005, contributing approximately 45% of emissions.
             A majority of automobile emissions in the city result from regional
             through-trips. Thus, while reduced traffic congestion or vehicle miles
             traveled in South San Francisco will only minimally impact the Bay
             Area’s air quality, the City’s planning decisions can help to moder-
             ately reduce motor vehicle use, contributing to cumulative reductions
             in emissions across the entire Bay Area. Increased use of transit and
             carpooling, coupled with land use and circulation patterns that pro-
             mote walking and bicycling, can lead to a decrease in daily trips, less
             emissions, and improved air quality. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014.

                                         Combustion of fuels in mobile equipment and vehicles is a contribu-
                                         tor to GHG emissions throughout the community and affects local air

                                         duty equipment such as tractors and generators. The City of South
                                         San Francisco can also reduce fuel combustion by promoting idling
                                         time reductions, expanding the use of alternative fuels, and facilitating
                                         use of clean or plug-in electric vehicles and equipment. (Amended by

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 7.3-I-2 Use the City’s development review process and the California
                                         Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) regulations to evaluate and miti-
                                         gate the local and cumulative effects of new development on air qual-
                                         ity and GHG emissions. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on
                                         February 12, 2014.)
                                         The BAAQMD’s CEQA Guidelines could be used as the foundation
                                         for the City’s review of air quality and GHG emissions impacts under
                                         CEQA, with the City’s CAP serving as the tool for addressing cumu-
                                         lative GHG emissions.(Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on
                                         February 12, 2014.)
                                         The City should continue to include responsible agencies in the review
                                         of proposed land uses that would handle, store, or transport any poten-
                                         tial air pollutant sources such as, but not limited to, lead, mercury, vinyl
                                         chloride, benzene, asbestos, beryllium, and all fuels.
                                 7.3-I-3 Adopt the standard construction dust abatement measures included in
                                         BAAQMD’s CEQA Guidelines.
                                         These measures would reduce particulate emissions from construction
                                         and grading activities.
                                 7.3-I-4 Require new residential development and remodeled existing homes to
                                         install clean-burning fireplaces and wood stoves.
                                         Residential woodburning is a growing source of localized air pollution.
                                         Woodsmoke released from fireplaces and wood stoves contains carbon
                                         monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and PM-10. Pollution can be reduced by
                                         installing gas fireplaces or EPA certified wood heaters and operating
                                         existing fireplaces and wood stoves more efficiently.
                                 7.3-I-5 In cooperation with local conservation groups, institute an active
                                         urban forest management program that consists of planting new trees
                                         and maintaining existing ones.
                                         South San Francisco has few street trees compared to other Bay Area
                                         cities. Trees growing in urban settings provide environmental benefits

        including energy carbon-dioxide absorption, reduced air and noise
        pollution, and erosion control. Trees also beautify, shade, and mitiga-
        tion the ‘urban heat island effect’ by shading pavement and other dark
        surfaces and through the cooling effects of their evapotranspiration.
        Funding should be sought from a variety of sources. Businesses or new
        development should also be encouraged to plant more trees in parking
        lots and building landscaping.
7.3-I-6 Periodically update the inventory of community-wide GHG emissions
        and evaluate appropriate GHG emissions reduction targets, consistent
        with current State objectives, statewide guidance, and regulations.
        The CAP can provide streamlining to new development only if it pro-
        vides a process for evaluating and updating the CAP. Accordingly, the
        City will monitor progress toward CAP targets and provide a mecha-
        nism to revise the CAP, should programs and measures not be achiev-
        ing anticipated reductions. Conducting regular inventories allows
        the City to monitor progress toward the reduction target. Inventory
        updates also provide an opportunity to evaluate the City’s reduction
        target based on current State guidance and best practices. (Amended
        by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
7.3-I-7 Adopt and implement the City of South San Francisco’s CAP, which
        will identify a GHG emissions reduction target and measures and
        actions to achieve the reduction target.
        To meet CEQA guidelines and provide streamlining benefits, the
        CAP must identify and quantify actions that will reduce emissions to
        a less than significant level. The City will ensure that the CAP meets
        these necessary criteria of the CEQA Guidelines to provide streamlin-
        ing benefits to new development. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014.
        Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
7.3-I-8 Evaluate and regularly report to City Council, or its designee, on the
        implementation status of the CAP and update the CAP as necessary
        should the City find that adopted strategies are not achieving antici-
        pated reductions, or to otherwise incorporate new opportunities.
                                                                                                           7-23

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                          Regular monitoring and reporting on CAP progress allows the City to
                                          capitalize on new opportunities and evaluate the results of programs
                                          intended to reduce GHG emissions. Revisiting the CAP helps iden-
                                          tify new opportunities to leverage CAP programs with other efforts,
                                          address challenges, and ensure success as the City works toward
                                          CAP reduction targets. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on
                                          February 12, 2014.)
                                 7.3-I-9  Promote land uses that facilitate alternative transit use, including
                                          high-density housing, mixed uses, and affordable housing served by
                                          alternative transit infrastructure.
                                          The City’s location and the predominance of large-scale industrial and
                                          commercial activities with a large commuting workforce are factors
                                          that have resulted in a high number of vehicle miles traveled through-
                                          out the community. In concert with the Transportation Element and
                                          Specific Plans, the City is facilitating the development of transit-ori-
                                          ented and mixed-use development in distinct and vital neighborhoods.
                                          This implementing policy supports the development of interconnected
                                          neighborhoods that reduce car travel and improve the local quality of
                                          life. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
                                 7.3-I-10 Facilitate energy efficiency in building regulations and streamlined
                                          review processes, providing flexibility to achieve specified energy per-
                                          formance levels and requiring energy efficiency measures as appropri-
                                          ate.
                                          The regulatory permit process can be a disincentive to easy and feasible
                                          energy efficiency improvements. South San Francisco will support
                                          energy efficiency through effective and flexible processes. To the extent
                                          feasible, simple permits and checklists for energy-related improve-
                                          ments will be convenient and user-friendly. Through the CAP, the
                                          City will evaluate the lowest-burden programs or standards to achieve
                                          energy efficiency while supporting the growth objectives of the city.
                                          (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
                                 7.3-I-11 Coordinate with the business community to encourage energy effi-

          The biotechnology and industrial sectors are pillars of South San
          Francisco’s identity and local economy. Policies promoting the success
          of these and other economic sectors are provided in the Economic
          Development Element. Understanding and addressing the distinct
          energy needs of the City’s economic sectors is critical to ensure ongo-
          ing economic success while supporting efficient energy use. Top
          nonresidential energy sectors include biotechnology, high technol-
          ogy industries, food processing, offices, and hospitality. The City will
          implement a collaborative approach to achieve nonresidential energy
          reductions, strengthening partnerships with companies and businesses
          to understand efficiency opportunities, identify funding opportunities,
          and implement efficiency standards and programs tailored to local
          practices and facilities. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on
          February 12, 2014.)
7.3-I-12  Adopt guidelines, standards, and flexible regulations that promote
          on-site renewable energy systems while strengthening South San
          Francisco’s economic competitiveness.
          South San Francisco’s large nonresidential energy users can benefit
          from the installation of on-site renewable energy systems with short
          payback that reduce expenditures on electricity and natural gas. City
          standards and development programs will encourage and/or require
          the use of on-site renewable energy systems to meet local energy
          needs, focusing on options that maximize benefit to the community.
          (Amended by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
7.3-I-13  Encourage efficient, clean energy and fuel use through collaborative
          programs, award programs, and incentives, while removing barriers to
          the expansion of alternative fuel facilities and infrastructure.
         By acting as a leader and educator, the City can promote voluntary
         reductions in GHG emissions. The City can share information through
         the City website, public events, and other materials. City staff can
         also work with project applicants during the CEQA review process
         to encourage use of alternative, grid-connected, and low-emissions
         equipment for construction activities. (Amended by Resolution 26-2014.
         Adopted on February 12, 2014.)

                                 7.3-I-14     Ensure that design guidelines and standards support operation of
                                              alternative fuel facilities, vehicles, and equipment.
                                              Simple requirements such as requiring electrical outlets on build-
                                              ing exteriors can remove barriers to the use of electric or clean fuel
                                              equipment options. South San Francisco is also implementing new
                                              CALGreen state requirements that support electric vehicle-charging
                                              in new homes. The City will continue to provide code incentives that
                                              address barriers to lower-emissions equipment and vehicles. (Amended
                                              by Resolution 26-2014. Adopted on February 12, 2014.)
                                 7.3-I-15     Demonstrate effective operations in municipal facilities that reduce
                                              GHG emissions.
                                              The City has taken a number of steps to reduce energy use and improve
                                              sustainability at municipal facilities and in the community. By demon-

                                 7.4      HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
                                 South San Francisco’s growth is notable for the close relationship between industry
                                 and community. The development of a residential town in support of new industri-
                                 al plants was the calculated strategy of local industrialists. With the success of the
                                 city’s industries, South San Francisco earned an important role as “The Industrial
                                 City” of the region.
                                 The conservation of this unique history is the objective of historic and cultural
                                 preservation in South San Francisco. In addition to Sign Hill, designated resources
                                 in South San Francisco include several residential and commercial buildings in
                                 the downtown area. The City’s Municipal Code and State and federal law, protect
                                 these local, State, and national historic resources from alteration and demolition.
                                 The Historic Preservation Commission oversees the protection of these resources.
                                 As such, designation is an important tool for preserving reminders of the past that

contribute to the City’s identity. Equally central, and perhaps more difficult, is the
broader goal of conserving the city’s unique industrial heritage.
HISTORIC LANDMARKS
South San Francisco’s only national historic landmark—Sign Hill—is also its best-
known feature. Sign Hill has proclaimed the City’s identity since 1891 when the J.
Dunn Real Estate Company, South San Francisco’s first realtor, initially installed
the sign. After a period of several years during which the sign was absent, the
Chamber of Commerce had the words “South San Francisco The Industrial City”
whitewashed onto the hillside. The concrete letters were installed in 1929. The sign
has become a regional landmark, clearly visible to travelers on nearby freeways and
to those flying into and out of San Francisco International Airport.
LOCAL LANDMARKS
South San Francisco’s older buildings display a wide range of architectural styles,
emblematic of the shifting styles that characterize the periods of the city’s growth.
Queen Anne, Victorian, Neoclassical, Craftsman, Spanish and Mission Revival,
Moderne, as well as contemporary styles, are all represented in the city’s central
neighborhoods.
The city has several historic homes and commercial buildings. Most are located
along Grand Avenue near the Civic Center, and around the intersection of Grand
Avenue and Eucalyptus Street. In addition, many of the structures in downtown
along Grand, Linden, Baden, and Miller avenues were identified as potential his-
toric resources in a comprehensive survey completed in 1986. These buildings are
representative of an architectural period, are of local historic prominence, or are well-
restored examples of vernacular architecture. Regardless of their role, these buildings
contribute to the overall scale and character of the area, and are included on the City’s
list of potential historic resources, giving the Historic Preservation Commission an
opportunity to review all requests for demolition permits in the area.
Although industry played a critical role in South San Francisco’s history, no indus-
trial buildings or sites are currently designated historic resources. While buildings
representing various historical styles are present in numerous communities in the
Bay Area, few communities have manufacturing buildings, and those that remain
are disappearing rapidly. The lack of designated industrial buildings puts the com-
                                                                                                                     7-27

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 munity in danger of losing these reminders of its past as new industrial and com-
                                 mercial uses expand. However, the need to preserve the city’s history must be bal-
                                 anced with the economic considerations of industrial operations.
                                 ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
                                 Consistent with its history as an Ohlone settlement location, South San Francisco
                                 has Native American village sites and shell mounds scattered around the city.
                                 Known resources include:
                                 •    A Native American archaeological village (CA-SMA-299) located within the
                                      El Camino Real Corridor Redevelopment Area that contains household items,
                                      projectile points, dietary debris, and human burials.
                                 •    A large shell mound (CA-SMA-40) and one small shell midden (CA-SMA-40)
                                      near the south slope of San Bruno Mountain. The shell mound is considered a
                                      significant archaeological resource.
                                 South San Francisco’s coastal location, and its rich history as a center of industry,
                                 makes the existence of additional prehistoric and historic archaeological resources
                                 likely. While the city is essentially built out, archaeological surveys may be appro-
                                 priate as part of large project redevelopment activities.
                                 GUIDING POLICIES: HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
                                 7.5-G-1      Conserve historic, cultural, and archaeological resources for the aes-

                                                                                 7: OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION
        to promote the revitalization and redevelopment of the area.
        The 1986 Historic Resources Inventory recommended designation of
        the Downtown South San Francisco Historical Commercial District.
        The proposed district extends along Grand Avenue from Airport
        Boulevard to Maple Street, just below City Hall and also includes
        Linden Avenue to a distance of one block from Grand Avenue. The
        district is composed of late 19th and early-mid 20th century one-,
        two-, and three-story commercial buildings, with a pattern of large or
        architecturally prominent buildings at street corners. Several struc-
        tures have residential apartments above the street level.
        Formal designation of the Historical District would be an important
        economic development initiative in generating interest and support for
        efforts to revitalize the commercial area.
7.5-I-2 Institute downtown urban design guidelines, and require a design
        review of developments in the proposed Downtown South San
        Francisco Historical Commercial District to ensure that the height,
        massing, and design of buildings furthers Downtown’s character (see
        also policies 3.1-I-4 and 3.1-I-5).
7.5-I-3 Explore mechanisms to incorporate South San Francisco’s industrial
        heritage in historic and cultural preservation.
        An inventory of industrial buildings in the city would identify impor-
        tant reminders of South San Francisco’s industrial history. Without
        historic designation, these buildings are at risk of being demolished
        as new industrial and commercial uses expand. The adaptive reuse of
        these buildings would encourage an architecturally diverse and his-
        toric texture in South San Francisco’s industrial areas. However, the
        need to preserve the city’s industrial history must be balanced with the
        economic considerations of industrial operations.
7.5-I-4 Ensure the protection of known archaeological resources in the city
        by requiring a records review for any development proposed areas of
        known resources.
        South San Francisco’s known archaeological resources are located
        within areas undergoing development: Terrabay and the El Camino
                                                                                                            7-29

                                         development, has the potential to contain additional resources due
                                         to the extensive marshlands that existed prior to landfill activities.
                                         Adequate policies and measures for protection of known and unknown
                                         archaeological resources that can supplement CEQA requirements may
                                         need to be incorporated into future plans and development activities.
                                 7.5-I-5 In accordance with State law, require the preparation of a resource
                                         mitigation plan and monitoring program by a qualified archaeologist
                                         in the event that archaeological resources are uncovered.
                                         CEQA requires the evaluation of any archaeological resource on the
                                         site of a development project. State law also protects these resources.
                                         City involvement in the identification, mitigation, and monitoring of
                                         project impacts on these resources will ensure the protection of South
                                         San Francisco’s cultural heritage.

   Like most of the Bay Area communities, South San Francisco is located in a seis-
   mically active region. Environmental, seismic and topographic conditions, and the
   patterns of urban and industrial development in South San Francisco pose risks
   to human health and property. The purpose of this element is to acknowledge and
   mitigate the risk posed by hazards. These include seismic and geologic, flooding,
   hazardous materials and waste, and fire.
                                                                                     8-1

                                 8.1 	 GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
                                 Seismic and geologic hazards are significant concerns in South San Francisco. Not
                                 only do these hazards pose risks to life and property, but also they represent con-
                                 straints on development.
                                 GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
                                 South San Francisco is comprised of three distinct topographic zones, each with
                                 its own soil compositions and hazards to development (see Figure 8-1: Slope).
                                 Lowland Zone
                                 A large portion of the city, primarily east of U.S. 101, is underlain by deposits of Bay
                                 mud up to 80 feet deep in some places. Associated development hazards include
                                 shrink-swell, settlement, and corrosivity. Seismic hazards include earthquake wave
                                 amplification and liquefaction. Development in the lowland zone often requires
                                 engineering solutions to address soil constraints and the increased risk of geologic
                                 and seismic hazard in this area.
                                 Upland Zone
                                 Soils in this zone are mostly developed, covered by urban land and cut-and-fill.
                                 The cut-and-fill in some areas has superimposed the alluvial soils of the Colma
                                 Creek floodplain. The difficulty in this zone is the varying nature of the fill, which
                                 was laid with varying attention to engineering practices. There is a moderate
                                 potential for shrink-swell and/or erosion hazard here.
                                 Hillside Zone
                                 The Hillside Zone includes some slopes of over 30 percent. The native soils of this
                                 zone are characterized as various sandy and gravelly loams with generally high to
                                 very high erosion potential, low strength and stability, and shallow depth. These
                                 areas are susceptible to soil creep and small landslides.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 SEISMICITY
                                 South San Francisco is located in one of the most seismically active regions in the
                                 United States. There are approximately 30 known faults in the Bay Area that are
                                 considered capable of generating earthquakes; eleven of these are within 40 miles
                                 of the city. The Peninsula segment of the San Andreas Fault, the predominant
                                 fault system in California, passes through the westernmost corner of South San
                                 Francisco, commonly referred to as the Westborough area. This area was devel-
                                 oped after Interstate 280 was built in the 1970s and contains a large concentration
                                 of townhomes. It also contains one of the city’s main concentrations of local-serv-
                                 ing commercial. Although there is some vacant land in the area, steep slopes and
                                 the nearby San Andreas fault are obstacles to development.
                                 The San Andreas Fault is considered a source of high earthquake hazard to the
                                 entire city, creating potential for ground rupture and high levels of ground shak-
                                 ing. It has generated some of the largest, most destructive earthquakes in the Bay
                                 Area, including the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (magnitude 8.3) and the 1989
                                 Loma Prieta earthquake (magnitude 7.1). Most of the city would experience an
                                 intensity level of VII (Nonstructural Damage) or VIII (Moderate) from a rupture
                                 of the Peninsula Segment of the San Andreas Fault during an earthquake with a
                                 7.1 magnitude. Portions of the city with unstable soil conditions, particularly the
                                 fill areas in the east, would experience particularly strong ground shaking. Other
                                 faults in the region may also generate earthquakes that affect South San Francisco.
                                 While most of South San Francisco is comprised of flat to gently sloping areas,
                                 steep hillsides surround the northern and western portions of the city.
                                 Seismic and other structural hazards are related to two geologic conditions found
                                 in South San Francisco:
                                 •	 Soils   in the flat lowland areas, comprised largely of Bay mud overlain with fill
                                      in the eastern portions of the city, have high shrink-swell potential, high water
                                      table, and low strength. These soil conditions amplify earthquake waves and
                                      groundshaking, and are subject to liquefaction.

•	 Steeply-sloping    hillside areas have soils with shrink-swell hazards, high ero-
    sion hazard, and low strength. Some of these soils have severe limitations for
    bearing dwellings without basements and for local roads. In addition, substan-
    tial portions of the south flank of San Bruno Mountain are classified as a high
    landslide risk area.
SEISMIC RISKS TO DEVELOPMENT
Within South San Francisco, earthquake damage to structures can be caused by
ground rupture, near-field effects, liquefaction, landsliding, ground shaking, and
possibly inundation from seiche or tsunami. The level of damage in the city result-
ing from an earthquake will depend upon the magnitude of the event, the epicen-
ter distance from the city, the response of geologic materials, and the strength and
construction quality of structures.
Buildings constructed prior to the 1970s in most cases would not meet current
design provisions in the Uniform Building Code for earthquake forces. The most
severe hazards are presented by unreinforced masonry buildings constructed of
brick or concrete block. Under strong intensity ground shaking, many of these
structures may be expected to collapse or require demolition. The City has devel-
oped a list of unreinforced masonry buildings to assess their potential to meet
Uniform Code for Building Conservation (UCBC) requirements through retrofit.
Other types of buildings that may also be severely damaged are older buildings of
steel and concrete framing that were not designed to resist earthquake vibrations
and older reinforced brick and masonry structures.
Ground Shaking
The distribution of earthquake wave amplification as related to geologic materi-
als has been mapped by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) with
input from the U.S. Geological Survey. Areas subject to extremely high or very
high levels of wave amplification include the hills west of Callan Boulevard, adja-
cent to the San Andreas Fault zone, and the alluvial lowlands surrounding Colma

                                 Creek, between Orange and South Linden Avenues. ABAG has also mapped the
                                 intensities created by a rupture of the Peninsula Segment of the San Andreas Fault
                                 registering 7.1 on the modified mercalli intensity scale in the South San Francisco
                                 area. Only the southeastern and eastern portions of the city, including much of the
                                 area east of U.S. 101, would experience an intensity level VIII (Moderate); damage
                                 is expected to be nonstructural in other areas.
                                 Liquefaction
                                 Liquefaction is the rapid transformation of saturated, loose, fine-grained sediment
                                 to a fluid-like state because of earthquake ground shaking. Most of the lowland
                                 areas of South San Francisco potentially have liquefaction hazards, with moder-
                                 ate liquefaction potential in the alluvial fan of Colma Creek and in a narrow strip
                                 of land south of Sister Cities Boulevard. Lateral spreading (lurching) also may be
                                 present where open banks and unsupported cut slopes provide a free face, or where
                                 artificial fill overlies Bay mud. Ground shaking, especially when inducing liquefac-
                                 tion, may induce lateral spreading toward unsupported slopes.
                                 Landsliding
                                 The strong ground motions that occur during earthquakes are capable of inducing
                                 landslides, generally where unstable soil conditions already exist. The parts of the
                                 San Francisco Bay region having the greatest susceptibility to landsliding are hilly
                                 areas underlain by weak bedrock units of slope greater than 15 percent. In South
                                 San Francisco this hazard is primarily located on the southern flank of San Bruno
                                 Mountain in the Terrabay development and near Skyline Boulevard.
                                 Inundation
                                 Earthquakes can cause tsunami (‘tidal waves’) and seiches (oscillating waves in
                                 enclosed water bodies) in the Bay. As portions of the city are located adjacent San
                                 Francisco Bay, and are low-lying, tsunami or seiche inundation is a possibility.
                                 Wave run-up is estimated at approximately 4.3 feet (msl) for tsunami with a 100-

Earthquake damage inflicted on structures and infrastructure within the city is not
only a function of the seismic risks outlined above, but also of the form, structural
design, materials, construction quality, and location of the structure. Since the
1970s, the Uniform Building Code (UBC) in California has incorporated mini-
mum strength standards to which a building must be designed. New construction
in South San Francisco is required to meet the requirements of the 1994 UBC, and
buildings of special occupancy are required by the State to meet more stringent
design requirements.
GUIDING POLICY: GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
8.1-G-1	    Minimize the risk to life and property from seismic activity and geo-
            logic hazards in South San Francisco.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES: GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC
HAZARDS
8.1-I-1	    Do not permit special occupancy buildings, such as hospitals, schools,
            and other structures that are important to protecting health and safety
            in the community, in areas identified in Figure 8-2.
            Although the State requires special occupancy buildings to meet more
            stringent seismic strength requirements than the 1994 Uniform Code
            for Building Conservation (UCBC), these facilities should not be
            located in areas that are seismically sensitive. Since the city already
            contains adequate hospitals, schools, fire stations, and public build-
            ings, very few, if any, special occupancy buildings will be sited in the
            city. Existing special occupancy buildings located in seismically sen-
            sitive areas should be monitored and reviewed to ensure structural
            compliance with seismic safety standards.
8.1-I-2	    Steep hillside areas in excess of 30 percent grade should be retained in
            their natural state. Development of hillside sites should follow existing
                                                                                                        8-7

                                          contours to the greatest extent possible. Grading should be kept to a
                                          minimum.
                                 8.1-I-3	 Explore programs that would build incentives to retrofit unreinforced
                                          masonry buildings.
                                          These buildings are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and pose a
                                          high risk to human safety as they can collapse in earthquakes. Programs
                                          to encourage retrofit include additional transfer taxes on property sales
                                          which can be used by the owner to pay for seismic retrofit work, reduced
                                          permit fees, grants to offset retrofit costs, or loan programs. In addition,
                                          information should be disseminated to the public on ways to reinforce
                                          buildings to reduce damage from earthquakes.

                                                     8.2 	 FLOODING
                                                     Periodic flooding occurs in South San Francisco, but is confined to certain areas
                                                     along Colma Creek. Colma Creek handles much of the urban runoff generated in
                                                     the city; since South San Francisco is highly urbanized, runoff levels are high and
                                                     there is increased potential for flood conditions during periods of heavy rainfall.
                                                     The principal flooding problem in the city is an inadequate culvert and channel
                                                     system where Colma Creek runs under the Southern Pacific Railroad (SPRR) line.
                                                     Peak flood flows in Colma Creek back up and pond east of the tracks, and water
                                                     moves away from the creek along city streets.
                                                     Flood depth during a 100-year storm is two to three feet in the ponding area at the
                                                     tracks. Many homes in South San Francisco may be exposed to this hazard as they
                                                     were constructed with insufficient elevation to remain above even shallow flood-
                                                     waters. New development west of the SPRR right-of-way may be constrained by
                                                     potential flooding, but careful design could minimize flooding hazards and damage.
                                                     FLOOD CONTROL
                                                     The San Mateo County Flood Control District (SMCFCD) is responsible for flood
                                                     control and stream channel maintenance in South San Francisco. The SMCFCD
                                                     has developed a Colma Creek Flood Control Improvement Project. Improvements

                                                     Kaiser Permanente, and between Spruce Avenue and the creek mouth, will be
                                                     improved and/or realigned to reduce flooding and to complement the County’s
                                                     existing tide gate at North Access Road.
                                                     These projects, to be completed by 2002, will reduce flood hazard to a 50-year
                                                     storm recurrence interval plus two feet of freeboard. As a result, the area con-
                                                     strained by flood hazard will be greatly reduced, and may be eliminated, once these
                                                     improvements are made. Once complete, the Federal Emergency Management
                                                     Agency (FEMA) will remap the 100-year floodplain for the purposes of the South

GUIDING POLICY: FLOODING
8.2-G-1	 Minimize the risk to life and property from flooding in South San
         Francisco.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES: FLOODING
8.2-I-1	 Continue working with the Regional Water Quality Control Board
         (RWQCB) in the implementation of the San Mateo Countywide
         Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program (STOPP).
         The City should comply with the Performance Standards for Control
         of Stormwater Pollutants from Development and Construction
         Activities that were part of the RWQCB’s Staff Recommendations
         for New and Redevelopment Controls for Stormwater Programs.
         These Recommendations incorporate the mandates of EPAs storm-
         water ­regulations as well as the Coastal Zone Act R   ­ eauthorization
         Amendments.
         Policy 7.2-I-2 in Section 7.2: Water Quality directs the City to review
         and update the Best Management Practices adopted by the City and
         in STOPP as needed. The BMPs were last updated for STOPP in 1991        Unchannelized portion of Colma Creek dividing North and
         when the program was established. Additional City BMPs may be           South Canal streets in Lindenville.
         updated if necessary. The BMPs for the design and installation of the
         stormwater drainage systems could include use of a 25-year storm cri-
         teria for design of stormwater drainage systems to prevent increased
         flooding potential in the redevelopment subareas. All stormwater
         drainage system designs should incorporate the Department of Public
         Works stormwater design standards for urban a­ reas.
         Additional measures to reduce the risk of localized and downstream
         flooding could include:
         •	 The    City of South San Francisco should recommend as guidance
             the use of high infiltration measures within the Planning Area to
             reduce stormwater discharge into the regional storm drain sys-
                                                                                                                                     8-11

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                              tem. These measures could include ponds built into landscapes,
                                              unlined runoff channels and dispersion points into landscaped
                                              areas. In addition, the amount of permeable landscape should
                                              be maximized. Landscaping in parking lots and around building
                                              perimeters can reduce the initial generation of stormwater runoff.
                                          •	 The    City of South San Francisco should strongly recommend
                                              that dispersed stormwater be directed into landscape, or natural
                                              vegetation where feasible. Surface runoff should be diverted into
                                              open areas that have high infiltration capabilities. Where possible
                                              and technically feasible, roof tops and paved areas should drain
                                              into underground dispersal pipes or vegetated percolation beds.
                                              By increasing the amount of permeable surfaces around impervi-
                                              ous structures, rainfall infiltration rates would increase and thus
                                              decrease concentrated runoff.
                                 8.2-I-2	 Use the City’s development review process to ensure that proposed
                                          development subject to the 100-year flood provides adequate protec-
                                          tion from flood hazards, in areas identified in Figure 8-3.
                                 8.2-I-3	 Encourage FEMA to update the 100-year floodplain boundaries to
                                          reflect the new limits of flood hazard constraint to be determined by the
                                          completion of the Colma Creek Flood Control Improvement Project.
                                          Completion of the Colma Creek Flood Control Improvement Project
                                          will significantly reduce the area constrained by flood hazard in South
                                          San Francisco. Remapping will be undertaken by FEMA for the pur-
                                          poses of updating the Flood Insurance Rate Map for the city. Once
                                          completed, the City should update the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the
                                          new boundary.

                                 8.3 	 WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
                                 San Mateo County’s Integrated Waste Management Plan was recently approved by
                                 the county and is under review by the state. This Plan complies with the California
                                 Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939) requiring local agencies to
                                 implement source reduction, recycling, and composting activities to reduce solid
                                 waste generation by 50 percent by the year 2000.
                                 State law requires that each city and county is required to prepare a Source
                                 Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE), Household Hazardous Waste Element
                                 (HHWE), and Non-disposal Facilities Element. Together, these three elements
                                 comprise the City’s IWMP. Household hazardous wastes within San Mateo
                                 County are addressed in the San Mateo County Hazardous Waste Management
                                 Plan, rather than a HHWE. The IWMP for each city in the County, the County’s
                                 IWMP, and the countywide siting element will comprise the countywide Integrated
                                 Waste Management Plan.

                                 Collection and Recycling
                                 Solid waste is collected from South San Francisco homes and businesses and then
                                 processes at the Scavenger Company’s materials recovery facility and transfer sta-
                                 tion (MRF/TS). Materials that cannot be recycled or composted are transferred
                                 to the Ox Mountain Sanitary Landfill, near Half Moon Bay. Browning-Ferris
                                 Industries, owner of the Ox Mountain Landfill, has a permit for forward expansion
                                 of the Corinda Los Trancos Canyon at Ox Mountain. When the permit expires in
                                 2016, either Corinda Los Trancos Canyon will be expanded further or Apanolio
                                 canyon will be opened for fill.
                                 The new Scavenger MRF/TS, which was approved in April 1999, will be permitted
                                 to receive a daily maximum of 1,250 tones per day of wastes and recyclable materi-
                                 als. This facility will give the Scavenger Company increased capability to recover
                                 valuable materials from wastes, reducing the amount of waste being sent to the
                                 landfill. South San Francisco recycles both household and industrial solid waste
                                 and sewage sludge. The Blue Line Transfer Station has a recycling center for news-

Hazardous waste is generated in homes and businesses alike, and includes products   Depending upon the success of current source reduction and recycling
ranging from used motor oil to infectious compounds to dioxins. Management of       programs, this amount could be much lower.
hazardous waste in San Mateo County occurs under the 1991 Hazardous Waste
Plan.
Although most hazardous waste is generated by larger commercial and industrial
enterprises, wastes generated by households and small businesses are of particular
concern, since these wastes are more likely to be handled improperly and disposed
of in a landfill or sewer. Although the amount of household and small business
hazardous waste is relatively small, these wastes are of particular concern because
they are more likely to be handled improperly, such as disposed of in a landfill
or sewer. The County operates a household hazardous waste education program
and established a household hazardous waste transfer station for county residents
in 1989.
General Plan Buildout
With an expected buildout population of 67,400 residents in South San Francisco,
the city will generate approximately 38,000 tons of solid waste each year, based on
the assumed generation rates used by the County (Table 8.3-1).
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
Numerous industrial and commercial operations, both past and present, have
manufactured, handled, stored and disposed of hazardous materials in South San

                                 Francisco. Hazardous material sites include manufacturing operations, active and
                                 abandoned landfills, facilities with leaking underground storage tanks (USTs),
                                 permitted dischargers, and generators of hazardous waste.
                                 The presence of hazardous materials or hazardous waste in soil or groundwater in
                                 the city’s commercial and industrial areas could constrain development of certain
                                 areas due to the actual or perceived threat to human health and the costs associated
                                 with site cleanup. The actual health threat at a given site depends upon a number
                                 of factors such as the quantity and toxicity of contaminants, exposure, and the
                                 available pathways for contaminants to affect human health. Cleanup of hazardous
                                 waste sites is mandated by law and enforced by the appropriate regulatory agencies
                                 in order to protect human health, resources, and the environment. Cleanup is usu-
                                 ally expensive and can be a significant factor in the viability of land development.
                                 Generation
                                 Many hazardous waste sites are identified on the Cal/EPA Hazardous Waste and
                                 Substances Site List (Cortese List). The Cortese list includes 114 known sites in
                                 South San Francisco with leaking USTs (as of December 1994). These sites are
                                 concentrated in the industrial area East of 101 area.
                                 The East of 101 Area Plan EIR identified 67 permitted generators of hazardous
                                 waste in the project area. In addition there are ten companies east of 101 that
                                 are permitted to emit toxic pollutants. In addition, four sites in the East of 101
                                 area have major hazardous materials concentrations, including the Koll, Gateway,
                                 Shearwater, and Wildberg Brothers sites. These sites are in various stages of study,
                                 remediation, and redevelopment. The East of 101 and Lindenville areas are known
                                 to have a high water table, increasing the risk that on-site contamination will leach
                                 into groundwater and spread to other properties or to the Bay.
                                 Storage and Disposal
                                 San Mateo County is responsible for issuing hazardous material storage permits,
                                 and a Throughout San Mateo County, Hazardous Materials Management Plans
                                 must be prepared for the County by businesses that use or store hazardous mate-
                                 rials. The County provides copies of Business Plans to the local fire department.

The San Mateo County Health Services Department (HSD) issues permits
for installation of USTs. The County HSD and the South San Francisco Fire
Department regulate the removal of USTs. Before a tank may be removed, the
applicant must prepare a closure plan and submit it to the County HSD. Upon
approval of the plan, the County HSD issues a permit for tank removal. While
USTs are primarily associated with service stations, they may also be found in con-
nection with hospitals, companies with a backup power supply, and older industries.
Transport
Transport of hazardous waste and hazardous materials is regulated by federal
and state agencies, primarily the California Highway Patrol and the California
Department of Transportation. South San Francisco has no ordinances that address
the transport of hazardous materials in the city. Kaiser Permanente Medical Center
is known to receive shipments of radioactive substances on a regular basis. The
County is responsible for issuing hazardous material storage permits.
GUIDING POLICIES: WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
8.3-G-1	     Reduce the generation of solid waste, including hazardous waste,
             and recycle those materials that are used, to slow the filling of local
             and regional landfills, in accord with the California Integrated Waste
             Management Act of 1989.
8.3-G-2	     Minimize the risk to life and property from the generation, storage,
             and transportation of hazardous materials and waste in South San
             Francisco. Comply with all applicable regulations and provisions for
             the storage, use and handling of hazardous substances as established
             by federal (EPA), State (DTSC, RWQCB, Cal OSHA, Cal EPA), and

                                          South San Francisco has a responsibility to meet regional source
                                          reduction and recycling initiatives in order to achieve State-mandated
                                          waste reduction targets and extend the useful life of existing landfill
                                          facilities. Builders should be encouraged to incorporate interior and
                                          exterior storage areas for recyclables into new or remodeled buildings
                                          (both residential and commercial) to make recycling activities more
                                          convenient for those who use the buildings. The City should explore
                                          the feasibility of installing recycling receptacles for plastic and glass
                                          beverage containers and papers in parks, Downtown, and other public
                                          areas. Furthermore, commercial and business parks should be encour-
                                          aged to install recycling receptacles on their premises. The City should
                                          explore incentives for businesses to establish recycling programs.

         City should use an address matching program to identify the sites on
         the Cortese list. A database including detailed site information should
         be linked to the digital map. Redevelopment of these sites must comply
         with myriad regulations at both the federal and State levels. However,
         the identification of contaminated sites will allow the City to better
         identify opportunities for redevelopment and funding. As most con-
         taminated and affected sites are situated in the city’s key redevelop-
         ment areas (East of 101 area and Lindenville), it is important for the
         City to quantify the levels of constraint and opportunity, and prepare
         an areawide remediation plan. This program should explore programs
         or incentives to remediate hazardous waste contamination on private
         lands. Sites with contamination that is known to be spreading to other
         properties or affecting groundwater quality should be prioritized.
8.3-I-4	 Establish an ordinance specifying routes for transporting hazardous
         ­materials.
          These routes should not pass through residential areas or other sensi-
          tive areas. Specific time periods for transport should be established to
          reduce the impact and accident risk during peak travel periods.

                                 8.4 	 FIRE HAZARDS
                                 Many areas of open space within the city pose a substantial risk of fire hazard to
                                 surrounding resources. Beyond the topographic, climatic, and land use conditions
                                 that create fire hazard, two factors contribute to fire risk in individual locations:
                                 1.	 Vegetation. Accumulations of vegetation serve as fuel for wildland fires; large
                                     concentrations of fuel, particularly where fires can spread from ground level
                                     to the tops of trees, can create conditions where wildland fires spread rapidly.
                                     Vegetation on both public- and privately-owned land in South San Francisco is
                                     generally poorly maintained and overgrown. Nonnative vegetation in and near
                                     open spaces such as French broom, eucalyptus, Monterey pine, and Monterey
                                     cypress, currently pose the greatest threat of wildland fire. Defensible fire
                                     breaks around structures and residential properties in particular are generally
                                     poor or nonexistent.
                                 2.	 Infrastructure. Public infrastructure, particularly site access and water supply,
                                     affect the City’s ability to respond to fire. Poor access and inadequate local
                                     water supply can increase the loss of life and property in a fire. While most of
                                     the areas near open spaces have good access and water supply, access is poor
                                     near Sign Hill and along Dundee Drive. The Sign Hill area also has limited
                                     water supply.
                                 Eight fire hazard management units are identified in areas that need vegetation
                                 management or other measures to reduce wildland fire risk and increase the
                                 potential for successful fire suppression. Each management unit is designated as
                                 high, medium or low priority in recognition of the relative need for risk manage-
                                 ment. Sign Hill, the Hillside School area, and the area along Dundee Drive have the
                                 highest priority due to the combination of fuel characteristics, infrastructure and
                                 adjacent uses. Management approaches are recommended for each unit.
                                 Access for fire and other safety personnel is good in areas other than the Sign Hill
                                 and Dundee management units, with the exception of the currently undeveloped
                                 Koll property on Sierra Point. This site can presently only be reached by passing
                                 through the portion of Sierra Point that is within Brisbane. It is expected that
                                 development on the Koll property will require access improvements.

         City efforts to reduce fire hazards in these areas should include regu-
         larly scheduled pruning of overgrown grass, shrub, and canopy vegeta-
         tion and the removal of debris and leaf litter. Fuel modification tech-
         niques may include mechanical removal, hand removal, prescribed
         burning, or chemical treatment.
8.4-1-2	 Explore incentives or programs as part of the comprehensive fire haz-
         ard management program to encourage private landowners to reduce
         fire hazards on their property.
         Programs may include free property risk assessments, educational
         workshops, and literature, etc. In particular, owners of property abut-
         ting management units should be encouraged to reduce the fire haz-
         ard.
8.4-1-3	 Consider future access and water supply infrastructure improvements
         in the Dundee and Sign Hill areas to reduce fire hazard risk.
         Improvements necessary to reduce fire hazard risk in the Dundee
         and Sign Hill areas—both of which are identified as High Priority
         Management Units—are expensive, longterm capital projects. The
         City should consider establishing these improvements as part of its
         Capital Improvement Program.
8.4-I-3	 Require site design features, fire retardant building materials, and
         adequate access as conditions for approval of development or
         improvements to reduce the risk of fire within the City.
         New construction is required to meet the requirements of the 1994
         Uniform Building Code. Fire potential of buildings could be further
         reduced through the addition of defensible buffers, the use of type “A”
         roofing materials, and residential fire protection devices.

                                 The South San Francisco Police Department’s jurisdictional area includes the
                                 entire city. Two unincorporated pockets, including the California Golf and
                                 Country Club, are under the jurisdiction of the San Mateo County Sheriff ’s office.
                                 As of 1999, the Department had a total of 122 employees, with 80 sworn officers
                                 and 37 police units. The current ratio of officers is 1.4 per 1,000 residents. The
                                 Police, Fire, and Parks and Recreation departments share facilities within the City’s
                                 Municipal Building. The Police Department also has one station, located in the
                                 Municipal Building at 33 Arroyo Drive.
                                 The Department is generally able to respond to high priority calls within two to
                                 three minutes. These times are within the department’s response time goals. The
                                 entire city is patrolled except for the undeveloped Sierra Point area.
                                 The Department typically works a four-beat system, but the watch supervisor has
                                 the discretion to deploy his personnel as he sees fit to accomplish daily goals and
                                 objectives. Each beat is typically staffed by a one-officer unit with between six and
                                 nine other officers consisting of traffic, K-9, training, float, and supervisory units
                                 available for backup and overlap.

                                              Although the police can not be solely responsible for controlling and
                                              limiting crime and interpersonal conflicts, they will continue to be the
                                              primary agency capable of immediate response and crisis intervention.

8.5-I-1	 Ensure adequate police staff to provide rapid and timely response to
         all emergencies and maintain the capability to have minimum average
         response times.
         Actions that could be taken to ensure rapid and timely response to all
         emergencies include:
         •	 Maintain     a law enforcement standard of 1.5 police officers per
              1,000 residents;
         •	 Analyze    and monitor factors affecting response time (population
              growth, police staffing, community policing programs) and aver-
              age response times as guidelines based on past experience;
         •	 Maintain,    train, and equip special response teams for extraordi-
              nary or extremely hazardous emergency incidents; and
         •	 Develop     and/or use the City’s Geographic Information System
              (GIS) for analysis of issues including crime location trends and
              response routes (see policy 2-I-14).
8.5-I-2	 Control and/or intervene in conduct recognized as threatening to life
         and property.
         Actions the Police Department maintains on an on-going basis to
         implement this policy include:
         •	 Providing    on-scene services to restore the peace and prevent fur-
              ther injury to life or property;
         •	 Maintaining     a “Directed Patrol” approach, when appropriate, to
              focus on prevention; and
         •	 Identifying evolving crime patterns, particularly those involving
                                                                                                  8-25

                                 8.5-I-3	 Reduce crime by strengthening the police/community partnership.
                                          The underlying socioeconomic conditions conducive to crime and dis-
                                          order can be affected by City actions directed at preserving and enhanc-
                                          ing a strong sense of community. Actions the Police Department could
                                          take to strengthen relationships with the c­ ommunity include:
                                          •	 Continue      and enhance neighborhood-based crime prevention
                                              activities (Neighborhood Watch) and programs designed to rein-

                                          •	 Continue     and enhance programs designed to prevent and reduce
                                              drug and alcohol abuse, including joint education programs with
                                              City schools; and
                                          •	 Identify   geographical areas or population groups experiencing
                                              noticeable crime victimization in order to improve effectiveness of
                                              crime prevention efforts and commit resources, as appropriate, to
                                              these areas to help them.
                                 8.5-I-4	 Assess community needs and expectations on an ongoing basis and
                                          report periodically to the City Council on citizen complaints and citi-
                                          zen commendations received.
                                          As part of the comprehensive update of the City’s Zoning Ordinance,
                                          ensure that design standards and guidelines reflect the principles of
                                          Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).
                                 8.5-I-5	 Continue to coordinate law enforcement planning with local, regional,

                                 In 1995, the City prepared an Emergency Response Plan, integrated with the San
                                 Mateo Area/ County Multi-Hazard Functional Plan. Consistent with state law
                                 requiring updates at four-year intervals, the County is currently revising this plan.
                                 The City’s plan is in compliance with existing law. The objectives of the plan are
                                 to reduce life, injury, and property losses through effective management of emer-
                                 gency forces. The City’s plan:
                                 •	 Establishes   and defines the duties of the Operations, Planning, Logistics and
                                     Finance Units, and defines the roles of the South San Francisco Emergency
                                     Operations Center and other emergency services organizations; and

             other public building have been adequately retrofittted for seismic
             shaking in accordance with State regulations.
8.7 	 AIRCRAFT SAFETY
The land surrounding the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and under
the landing and departure flight paths is almost entirely developed with urban
uses. Portions of the City of South San Francisco are subject tofrequent overflight
from aircraft departures on Runway 28 and less frequent overflight from arrivals
on Runway 10. Thus aircraft accidents pose a significant risk to persons and prop-
erty in South San Francisco as well as the occupants of an aircraft involved in an
accident that occurs beyond the runway environment.
Aircraft accidents may be caused by land use conditions that pose hazards to flight.
Protection against such conditions is esential to airport/land use safety compat-
ibility. The Airport Land Use Commission (C/CAG) recognizes and discourages
approval of specific land uses that would pose a potential hazard to aircraft in
flight.
The Land Use and Sub Area elements of the General Plan include policies restrict-
ing building heights in the vicinity of SFO in accordance with Federal Aviation
Regulations Part 77 height limits.

93 NOISE
   Noise is an important and complex issue in South San Francisco. Almost every
   part of the city is susceptible to noise impacts, due mainly to the presence of major
   noise generators. Significant sources of noise in the city include San Francisco
   International Airport (SFO), major transportation corridors such as U.S. 101 and
   I-280, and extensive industrial uses. The city’s land use pattern generally accommo-
   dates these conditions with industrial uses clustered close to the airport, separated
   from relatively noise-sensitive uses by U.S. 101. This element is intended to ensure
   compliance with State requirements and promote a comprehensive, long-range
   program of achieving acceptable noise levels throughout South San Francisco.
                                                                                         9-1

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 9.1       NOISE MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING
                                 Noise can be defined as a sound or series of sounds that are intrusive, irritat-
                                 ing, objectionable and/or disruptive to daily life. Noise varies widely in its scope,
                                 source, and volume, ranging from individual occurrences such as a barking dog,
                                 to the intermittent disturbances of overhead aircraft, to the fairly constant noise
                                 generated by traffic on U.S. 101.
                                 Many uses are noise sensitive, such as residences, schools, churches, and hos-
                                 pitals. Noise needs to be controlled around other uses as well, although levels
                                 rarely exceed the recommended maximum. The known effects of noise on humans
                                 include hearing loss, communication interference, sleep interference, physiological
                                 responses, and annoyance.
                                 When noise levels are reported, they are expressed as a measurement over time
                                 in order to account for variations in noise exposure. Levels also account for
                                 varying degrees of sensitivity to noise during daytime and nighttime hours. The
                                 Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and Day-Night Noise Level (Ldn)
                                 both reflect noise exposure over an average day with weighting to reflect this sen-
                                 sitivity. The CNEL is the reference level for State noise law and is used to express
                                 major continuous noise sources, such as aircraft or traffic.

9.2 NOISE SOURCES AND PROJECTIONS
For the purposes of this Plan, sources of noise are categorized as being either
aircraft-generated or locally-generated. Existing and projected noise levels are
depicted on noise contour maps. Each contour reflects linear bands subject to
similar average noise levels. Figure 9-1 depicts existing and projected aircraft-
generated noise levels in South San Francisco.
NOISE SOURCE SEXISTING CONDITIONS AND STANDARDS
Aircraft-Generated Noise
Aircraft overflight noise is a particularly important issue in South San Francisco
due to the city’s proximity to San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Aircraft
noise continues to receive considerable attention in the city, due in part to the
massive current terminal expansion project and to significant expected increases
in average daily aircraft operations.
Existing Noise Levels
Average aircraft noise levels measured in 1997 indicate that areas in the southwest-
ern part of the city experience noise levels in excess of 65 dB CNEL. A smaller area
in the vicinity of El Camino Real near the San Bruno border has noise levels in
excess of 70 dB CNEL. Existing and projected noise contours, as well as the Noise
Insulation Program area, are shown on Figure 9-1.1
Assuming no change in SFO’s runway configuration, aircraft noise contours are
projected to shift gradually eastward by 2010. As a result, areas east of the current
flight path may experience an increase in average noise levels. At the same time,
the 70 dB CNEL contour are expected to shrink, no longer impacting South San
Francisco.
Single Event Flyover Noise
Noise contours are based on average noise levels. Single event noises such as air-           Aircraft overflight noise is a particularly in the city due to
                                                                                             close proximity to San Francisco International Airport.
craft flyovers need to occur frequently and at very high volumes in order to bring
average noise levels to 65 dB CNEL. Even areas outside the 65 dB CNEL contours
are impacted by flyovers. Thus, even the 65 dB CNEL noise contour is expected to

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL PLAN
                                 shift eastward, flyovers will still expose areas throughout the southwestern part of
                                 the city to high noise levels.
                                 ALUC Noise Standards and Related Requirements
                                 ALUC’s 1995 SFO Land Use Plan establishes the 65 dB CNEL contour as the noise
                                 impact boundary for SFO, consistent with noise restrictions in the California
                                 Administrative Code, Title 21, Subchapter 6 “Noise Standards.” Local plans, policy
                                 actions, or development activities that affect areas within that boundary must
                                 receive ALUC approval or have a finding of overriding consideration prior to local
                                 permit issuance. ALUC determines the 65 dB CNEL boundary by examining both
                                 federal and State noise impact boundaries:
                                 •    Federal Impact Boundary. The federal 65 dB CNEL boundary is based on
                                      the Noise Exposure Map (NEM),2 as accepted by the FAA under the Federal
                                      Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150 Noise Compatibility Program. This 65 dB
                                      contour serves as the basis for FAA determination of local agency eligibility for
                                      federal grant money for noise insulation projects.
                                 •    State Impact Boundary. The State boundary is the 65 dB CNEL boundary as
                                      defined by the required airport noise monitoring system. The monitoring sys-
                                      tem consists of 27 off-site noise monitors, plus two additional monitors near
                                      the runway ends. The noise contour is updated each calendar quarter and sub-
                                      mitted to San Mateo County and the State Division of Aeronautics. ALUC uses
                                      the latest SFO quarterly noise report to determine the compatibility of land use
                                      plans.
                                 Local plans, policy actions, or development activities within the 65 dB CNEL
                                 boundary requires the approval of the San Mateo County Airport Land Use
                                 Commission (ALUC) prior to local permit issuance. To assist this process, the
                                 ALUC has established noise/land use compatibility standards as the basis of plan
                                 review (see Table 9.2-1). The City also applies these standards in its review of
                                 development applications located within the 65 dB CNEL boundary.
                                 2 Although the 1995 SFO Land Use Plan was adopted with the 1983 NEM, the FAA subsequently approved the 1995
                                 NEM and 2000 projected NEM. The updated version of the Land Use Plan, expected in early 1999, is based on the
                                   1995 NEM, which will need to be considered in preparation of the Specific Plan.

• Industrial Noise. Industrial uses in the city are an important part of the noise
  environment in South San Francisco. Industrial noise is generated from onsite
  activities or from associated truck traffic offsite. While industrial uses in East
  of 101 and south of Railroad Avenue do generate noise, impacts on noise-
  sensitive uses is minimal. In any case, these industrial areas are largely located
  within the 65 dB CNEL contour for aircraft noise.
  This element prohibits industrial development that will result in noise levels of
  60 dB CNEL or greater at noise-sensitive uses, a situation that could occur in
  the industrial areas west of U.S. 101, that border on residential uses north of
  Railroad Avenue and within the Mayfair Village subdivision.

Locally-generated noise
It is possible to project future levels of locally-generated noise over the horizon of
this Plan simply by considering current and projected land use trends.Figure 9-2
depicts future locally-generated noise levels in the city.
•    Traffic Noise. Traffic noise depends primarily on traffic speed and the propor-
     tion truck traffic. Traffic volume does not have a major influence on traffic
     noise levels; a doubling of traffic volume results in a 3 dB to 5 dB increase
     in noise levels. As a result, projected traffic increases on U.S. 101, Interstate
     280, and major arterials within South San Francisco should have not have an
     appreciable impact on noise levels in the city. And as traditional industrial uses
     make way for less intensive research and development activities, it is expected
     that truck traffic will decline in South San Francisco, particularly in areas east
     of U.S. 101 and south of Railroad Avenue.
•    Railroad Noise. The number of trains passing through South San Francisco
     on the Southern Pacific Railroad line is not expected to change significantly.
     While CaltTrain ridership is expected to increase through 2010, it is unknown
     if this will result in any increase in the number of trains. In any case, the
     impacts of railroad noise are negligible due to the proximity of the line to U.S.
     101, and the fact the line is generally surround by industrial and commercial
     land uses.
•    Industrial Noise. It is expected that industrial activity in South San Francisco
     will continue its shift away from traditional manufacturing and warehousing
     toward biotech and high-tech activity. This transition toward office-based
     uses will result in reduced levels of industrial noise in East of 101 and south
     of Railroad Avenue. Associated truck traffic and noise should also be reduced.
     These industrial areas will also largely remain within the 65 dB CNEL contour
     for aircraft noise.
•    BART Extension. The BART extension to SFO will pass through South San
     Francisco. The route will descend underground from the South San Francisco
     station, and ascend to the surface at the San Bruno station at the Tanforan
     Shopping Center. Since BART will remain underground through South San

      the single-event flyover noise. Homes in these areas would not be eli-
      gible for noise abatement funding under the current standard. The City
      should consider adopting a single-event noise standard to complement
      the existing 65 dB CNEL standard to mitigate the impacts of noise in
      these areas through land use planning and noise abatement programs.
9-I-2 Work to adopt a lower average noise standard for aircraft-based miti-
      gation and land use controls.
      A lower average noise standard for aircraft-based noise mitigation and
      land use controls would address the impacts of aircraft flyovers in areas
      outside the existing 65 dB CNEL boundary. The current 65 dB CNEL
      boundary provides the basis for FAA noise abatement funding and land
      use planning controls limiting noise-sensitive uses. The City should
      work with the FAA and SFO to determine if the current average noise
      standard is adequately mitigating the impacts of aircraft noise in South
      San Francisco.
      A lower average noise standard could be used in conjunction with the
      single-event noise standard proposed in Policy 9-I-1.
9-I-3 Pursue additional funding sources and programs for the noise insu-
      lation retrofit of homes not completed before the expiration of the

      The Memorandum of Understanding between SFO and San Mateo
      County jurisdictions, and the specific 1991 Agreement for Aircraft
      Noise Mitigation between the Airports Commission and South San
      Francisco establishes the parameters for the City’s retrofit program.
      This agreement requires the City to seek federal grants (to be matched
      by SFO) to retrofit noise-impacted homes constructed prior to 1983
      with noise insulation. The Agreement runs out in 2000 and between
      1,200 and 1,500 homes will still require retrofitting.

1        Introduction
Housing is of critical importance to the City of South San Francisco. The long-term vitality of the
South San Francisco community and local economy depend on a full range of housing types to
meet the needs of all segments of the City’s population. As South San Francisco looks towards the
future, the increasing range and diversity of housing options will be an integral aspect of the
City’s growth and development. Consistent with South San Francisco’s long-term commitment to
providing suitable, decent, and affordable housing for its residents, this plan sets forth a vision for
guiding future residential development, as well as for preserving and enhancing existing
residential areas.
1.1 Role and Content of Housing Element
The purpose of this Housing Element is to adopt a comprehensive, long-term plan to address the
housing needs of the City of South San Francisco. The State mandates the inclusion of seven
elements in all General Plans; one of these is the Housing Element. The Housing Element is South
San Francisco’s primary policy document regarding the development, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing for all economic segments of the population within the City’s boundaries.
Accordingly, this Housing Element identifies and analyzes the existing and projected housing
needs of the City and states goals, policies, quantified objectives, and implementation programs
for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing, including a discussion of
available financial resources.
The Housing Element must also identify sites for housing development that are adequate to
accommodate the City’s allocation of the regional housing need. South San Francisco intends to
implement a set of programs and projects to meet the goals, policies, and objectives included
herein. The City will also coordinate its housing efforts with those occurring within the other
areas of San Mateo County and the broader Bay Area region.
AUTHORITY
All California localities are required by Article 10.6 of the Government Code (Sections 65580-
65590) to adopt Housing Elements as part of their general plans, and submit draft and adopted
elements to the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review with
compliance with State law. HCD is required to review Housing Elements and report its written
findings within 60 days for a draft Housing Element (Government Code Section 65585(b)) and
within 90 days for an adopted Housing Element (Government Code Section 65585(h)). In
addition, Government Code Section 65585(c) requires HCD to consider written comments from
any group, individual, or public agency regarding the Housing Element under review.
                                                                                                      1

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
STATUS
This document is an update to the Housing Element of the City of South San Francisco General
Plan. The current Housing Element was adopted by the City Council and certified by the State in
2010, and the General Plan was most recently amended by the City Council on October 13, 1999.
This updated Housing Element corresponds to the planning period of January 31, 2015 to January
31, 2023 and the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) projection period of January 1,
2014 to October 31, 2022, which are the periods established by State law for San Francisco Bay
Area jurisdictions.
1.2 Relationship with General Plan
State Law requires that a General Plan and its constituent elements “comprise an integrated,
internally consistent and compatible statement of policies.” This implies that all elements have
equal legal status and no one element is subordinate to any other element. The Housing Element
must be consistent with land use goals and policies set forth in the Land Use Element, and it must
be closely coordinated with the Circulation Element of the General Plan. The Housing Element
must also be consistent with area Specific Plans including those currently being developed in
South San Francisco. As part of the implementation process for this Housing Element, the City of
South San Francisco will initiate and complete amendments to the City’s General Plan as
necessary to achieve internal consistency.
1.3 Related Planning Efforts
DOWNTOWN STATION AREA SPECIFIC PLAN
In February 2015, the City adopted the Downtown Station Area Specific Plan (DSASP), which is a
twenty-year plan that will guide development in the half-mile radius of the City’s Downtown
Caltrain Station. The DSASP aims to create a vibrant, transit-supportive, diverse Downtown core.
It includes strategies to enhance connectivity and improve accessibility to the Downtown and the
Caltrain station area for all community members and various modes of transportation, including
pedestrians and bicycles. The DSASP identifies opportunities for development near the transit
station, and it includes design guidelines and standards for all types of development in the
planning area.
1.4 Public Participation
This Draft Housing Element has been developed with extensive participation from members of
the South San Francisco community, as well as housing advocates, developers, and other
interested parties. The City hosted a Stakeholders Workshop on February 11, 2014. This
workshop was primarily intended for housing service providers, housing developers (market rate
and affordable), stakeholders, and representative organizations to take part in an open discussion
about the City’s long-term housing goals, needs, and polices. Attendees included representatives
from the Sierra Club, Rotary Club, San Mateo County Union Community Alliance, Office of
Assembly Member Kevin Mullin, the Housing Leadership Council, and neighborhood
organizations. In conducting outreach for the workshop, care was taken to recruit potential

participants who would reflect the City’s full ethnic and economic diversity. The public outreach
efforts for the Stakeholder Meeting included:
     •     Newspaper advertisement printed 10-days prior to the meeting;
     •     Direct mail flyer to 21 Elements Stakeholder list-65 recipients;
     •     Direct mail flyer to HOAs, Chamber, non-profit service providers, ethnic and cultural
           organizations, and community members-65 recipients;
     •     Public television notice;
     •     Facebook posting (on Library page);
     •     Flyers posted at 10 kiosks along Centennial Trail;
     •     Flyers posted at both libraries, City Hall, Annex;
     •     E-blast with Parks & Recreation (approximately 8,000 subscribers);
     •     21 Elements website posting;
     •     Nextdoor webpage posting; and
     •     City website posting.
In addition, the City of South San Francisco participated in the 21 Elements project, a
collaborative effort of the 21 jurisdictions within San Mateo County to share resources, ideas,
data, policy direction, and outreach for the fifth Housing Element cycle. At the request of local
jurisdictions, 21 Elements organized four panels of experts to provide information and policy
suggestions on affordable housing and special needs populations. As shown in the table below, the
four panels focused on the needs and perspectives of people with developmental disabilities;
developers (for-profit and non-profit, as well as architects); advocates and funders; and special
needs and sustainability.

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
These panels were well-attended by housing advocates, city representatives, and other
stakeholders from throughout San Mateo County, and provided valuable insight for South San
Francisco into the most pressing needs and constraints that developers and other service
providers face in the area. Several themes emerged from all the panels. Many speakers talked
about the importance of multi-family housing in mixed use, transit-oriented neighborhoods. This
type of development is necessary because it accommodates seniors and people with disabilities
who cannot depend on cars for transportation. The reduced dependence on cars and increased
density also helps meet sustainability goals. Additionally, many jurisdictions in San Mateo County
have little or no vacant land and therefore cannot meet their RHNA requirements without
rezoning. Panelists also discussed the importance of adding predictability to the development
process and the necessity of removing excessive regulations to encourage development.
Finally, the South San Francisco Planning Commission discussed housing needs, constraints, and
proposed policies at a study session held on November 6, 2014. The City Council held a similar
study session to discuss housing needs, constraints, and proposed policies at a meeting on
December 10, 2014. Their comments have collectively been incorporated into the draft Housing
Element.
As a result of the public outreach process, the City heard from a number of individuals and
organizations on the draft Housing Element, including the Housing Leadership Council. In
response to the public comments received, a number of issues were carefully considered by the
City and incorporated into the Housing Element Update. Changes to the Housing Element as a
result of public comments include the addition of 11 programs to the Housing Plan, such as
Policy 3-4 and Program 3-4B to address displacement, as well as additional programs to preserve
and maintain affordable and market-rate units in the city.
1.5 Organization of Housing Element
Following this introduction, the Housing Element includes the following major components:
    •    A review of the prior Housing Element, including an analysis of housing production over
         the previous Housing Element planning period (2007-2014).
    •    An analysis of the City’s current and future housing needs.
    •    An analysis of governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing production.
    •    An inventory and analysis of housing resources.
    •    A housing plan setting forth goals, policies, programs, and quantified objectives to
         address the City’s housing needs.

2        Review of Housing Element Past
         Performance
A key component of each Housing Element update is a review of performance under the previous
Housing Element, including a quantitative and qualitative description of outcomes, a comparison
of outcomes against stated goals, and an evaluation of the continued appropriateness of existing
goals, objectives, policies, and programs.
Accordingly, this chapter reviews progress under the previous Housing Element, which covered
the period from 2007 to 2014. This review is organized around the following seven overarching
goals of the previous Housing Element:
    •    Promote new housing development;
    •    Remove constraints to housing development;
    •    Conserve existing housing and neighborhoods;
    •    Maintain and improve the quality of life;
    •    Support development of special housing needs;
    •    Assure equal access to housing; and
    •    Energy conservation.
Summarized below are key findings of this review of past performance. Analysis includes the
progress on implementation, effectiveness of the element, and the appropriateness of the goals,
objectives, and performance. A more detailed review of each of the 45 policies adopted under the
previous Housing Element is included in Appendix A.
2.1 Promote New Housing Development
The first goal of the previous Housing Element was to promote the provision of new housing by
both the private and public sectors for all income groups in the community, a goal that the City
actively pursued during the previous Housing Element cycle. The City’s Redevelopment Agency
(RDA) acquired property within the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan and in the
Downtown area before the Agency was eliminated in 2011. The City is continuing to work with
developers on potential projects; however, due to the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency,
funding is limited and depends on the ultimate outcome of distribution of funds and property.
                                                                                               5

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
In 2010, the City adopted the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance Update. It incorporated a variety
of tools and measures to encourage a variety of residential unit sizes, a mix of housing types,
mixed-use development, and more intense mixed-use development in the South El Camino Real
Corridor and in the Downtown. The updated Zoning Ordinance expanded permissions for
residential and mixed-use development, and it included Design Guidelines and an EIR for a
General Plan Amendment for the South El Camino Real corridor. The City also supported the
development of secondary dwelling units through provisions in its Zoning Ordinance and with
brochures at the Permit Center Counter.
Detailed land use and design guidelines were created in the El Camino Real/Chestnut Area Plan,
which was adopted in 2011 and included regulations for some of the Redevelopment Agency’s
Successor Agency properties. In addition, the City received a grant in 2012 and began work on the
Downtown Station Area Plan. This plan increased residential and mixed use densities near the
Caltrain Station and was adopted in early 2015.
A number of new residential development projects were completed under the previous Housing
Element between 2007 and 2014. Park Station, a residential project near the City’s BART station
completed in 2007, added to the City’s housing stock and included seven new low income units
and eight new moderate income units. A total of seven secondary units were constructed between
2007 and 2012. The 636 El Camino Real affordable housing development project provided 108
affordable units, including 40 three-bedroom units to accommodate large families.
The following section evaluates the City’s progress in accommodating its “fair share” of the region
wide need for additional housing, also referred to as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA), including an examination of new construction activity. As shown in Table 2.1-1, the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) determined a need for 1,635 additional housing
units in South San Francisco during the prior Housing Element cycle from 2007 to 2014,
including a need for 956 units for extremely low, very low, low, and moderate income households.

The “Great Recession” of 2008 greatly affected the housing market in South San Francisco during
the RHNA period of 2007 to 2014. As shown in Table 2.1-2, within the last planning period, the
City issued a total of 251 permits. In addition, the City approved but has not yet issued permits
for three other development projects totaling 330 units.

While the dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency and the economic recession did impact
the ability of the City to meet their RHNA for housing production during this housing cycle,
progress was still made towards producing South San Francisco’s “fair share” of housing.
2.2 Remove Constraints to Housing Development
The City has taken a number of actions during the previous Housing Element period to remove
constraints to housing development, the second goal of the previous Housing Element. To
provide support for private market construction, the City’s One Stop Permit Center continues to
provide accessible services by the departments of Planning, Building, and Public Works in one
building. The One Stop Permit Center is operated by accessible staff from 8am to 5pm, and
permit processing is efficient and timely. To ensure timely processing of applications, the
Planning Commission meets twice each month, and the Design Review Board meets once a
month.
To encourage residential development, the City strives to ensure the availability of adequate
public facilities, including streets, water, sewerage, and drainage, throughout residential areas. For
specific development projects, the City collects “sewer impact fees” to support the ongoing
maintenance and upgrading of the City’s infrastructure. In addition, the City adopted a Capital
Improvement Program (CIP) budget that included several projects to repair and upgrade
infrastructure to support added populations. To ensure that new development promotes quality
design and harmonizes with existing neighborhood surroundings, the City adopted a Residential
Design Guide and design standards in the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Plan.
The City continually provides material to the public regarding affordable housing opportunities,
programs, and inclusionary units, including at the City’s Economic Development and Housing
Division, City’s Community Learning Center, on community calendars, on the City’s website, and
at the Citizen’s Academy.
                                                                                                      7

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
2.3 Conserve Existing Housing and Neighborhoods
The third goal of the previous Housing Element was to conserve existing housing and
neighborhoods. Related to this goal, the City has continued to encourage private residential
reinvestment in older neighborhoods and fund lower-income housing rehabilitation. The
Economic Development and Housing Division manages the Community Development Block
Grants Program, which provides funding for a number of housing rehabilitation activities for low
income residents. These activities include the following: low interest loans and/or grants through
the City-Sponsored Housing Rehabilitation Program; free accessibility modifications to houses
through the Center for Independence of Individuals with Disabilities’ (CID) Housing
Accessibility Modification Program; free home repairs to South San Francisco households
through Rebuilding Together Peninsula programs; and through 2012, free home repairs to
households through the now-disbanded North Peninsula Neighborhood Services Center House
Helpers.
The City aggressively enforces housing, building, and safety codes. The City’s Code Enforcement
Division is operated through the Fire Department, and Building Division staff members also
enforce the codes when they are out on inspections. To upgrade and maintain housing, streets,
sidewalks, and other municipal systems, the City’s CIP budget includes projects in older
neighborhoods. The City also strives to limit the number of apartment units that are converted to
condominium units and the number of subsidized units that are converted to market rate units,
through regulations in the zoning code.
2.4 Maintain and Improve the Quality of Life
The fourth goal of the previous Housing Element strived to maintain and improve the quality of
life in South San Francisco, and the City accomplished this goal in several ways. The City has
adopted policies to prohibit residential development in areas with major environmental hazards,
to abate existing hazards, and to mitigate airport noise for residents. These policies continue to be
implemented through the CEQA process as well as the City-Sponsored Housing Rehabilitation
Program, minor home repair program, and airport noise insulation program.
The City’s General Plan has been updated to be consistent with the SFO Airport Land Use Plan
and its aircraft noise contours. Disclosures are provided to potential buyers of homes that are
located in the 65 to 69 CNEL aircraft noise contour areas, and there are added restrictions placed
on new homes within the 65 to 69 CNEL aircraft noise contour. In addition, the updated Zoning
Ordinance includes a Special Environmental Studies Overlay District that applies to areas of the
City that the General Plan identifies as ecologically sensitive habitats or susceptible geologic
hazards.

2.5 Support Development of Special Housing Needs
The fifth goal of the previous Housing Element was to provide housing for people with special
needs. Through its policies and programs, the City has worked to address the needs of special
needs populations in the City, particularly large families with children, seniors, persons with
disabilities, and people who are homeless or in need of transitional housing. The City
accomplishes its goal of serving special needs populations in several ways.
Housing that serves special needs populations continues to be constructed in South San
Francisco. The affordable housing development at 636 El Camino Real includes 108 units,
including 40 three-bedroom units to accommodate large families and 20 units for San Mateo
County Mental Health clients. The City provides annual grant funds to the Center of
Independence of Individuals with Disabilities to allow for disabled access to homes.
The Zoning Ordinance allows for requests for parking reductions for senior housing
developments and developments near transit. The updated Zoning Ordinance also provides
provisions for reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to housing by allowing the
Chief Planner authority to grant relief from zoning requirements. The Zoning Update also
included a district where an emergency shelter is permitted by right and subject only to the same
development and management standards applicable to other uses in the zone. Similarly,
transitional and supportive housing are also subject only to those restrictions that apply to other
residential uses of the same type in the zone.
The City’s support for various non-profit organizations varies each year based on the amount of
funding available and the organizations’ capacity and need. To serve South San Francisco
residents who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness, the City provided funding to a variety of
San Mateo County service agencies, including Samaritan House, which operates a 90-bed year-
round shelter for the homeless in South San Francisco. The City also supported the not-for-
profits Shelter Network, which provides emergency and transitional housing for homeless
individuals and families, and Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA), which
provides emergency shelter for battered women.
2.6 Assure Equal Access to Housing
The sixth goal of the previous Housing Element was to promote equal opportunity to secure safe,
sanitary, and affordable housing for everyone in the community regardless of age, race, gender,
religion, marital status, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, and other arbitrary factors.
In conjunction with San Mateo County, Daly City, Redwood City, and San Mateo, the City
developed the Analysis of Impediments for Fair Housing Choice. It was adopted by the City
Council in 2013.
To support equal housing opportunities in South San Francisco, the City contracts with Project
Sentinel, a fair housing provider and tenant/landlord service organization, to address fair housing
complaints and resolve landlord/tenant disputes in the City. In addition, City staff provides
referrals regarding fair housing to appropriate agencies and advocacy groups.

April 2015
2.7 Energy Conservation
The final goal under the previous Housing Element related to energy conservation. To
incorporate energy and water conservation in construction and rehabilitation projects, the City
adopted a Green Building Ordinance in 2014. City Council adopted a Climate Action Plan on
February 12, 2014, which will promote energy information and sharing. The City’s rehabilitation
and repair programs have benefited numerous low-income households with weatherization
projects. The City also continues to implement Title 24 requirements for energy conservation in
residential development, and it encourages residential developers to employ the use of solar
access, landscaping, building siting, lot configuration, and street design energy conservation
measures.
2.8 Housing Element Changes
As presented above, the City of South San Francisco has been successful at promoting housing
development consistent with the goals and objectives outlined in the prior Housing Element.
Given the patterns of land use and development in the city, this Housing Element continues the
approach of its predecessor by promoting medium- and high-density housing development on
infill sites. In South San Francisco, these sites will be located mainly in mixed-use zones near
transit, providing the City with the opportunity to promote high-quality transit and pedestrian-
oriented neighborhoods that include a full range of housing types and affordability levels.
For the 2015 to 2023 Housing Element planning period, the Housing Plan has been organized to
complement the City’s planning efforts in medium-density, high-density, and mixed-use zones,
particularly in the Transit Village and in Downtown. In addition, the guiding policy framework
has been simplified by consolidating and eliminating redundancies wherever possible, ultimately
resulting in a more efficient and straightforward plan to encourage high-quality residential
development, as well as to ensure a full range of affordable housing.
The proposed Goals, Policies, and Programs contained in this Housing Element Update have
been modified from the prior Housing Element in light of the findings discussed above, and also
based on the Housing Needs Assessment, Constraints Analysis, and Housing Resources inventory
contained within the document. Most of the programs that have been modified for this Housing
Element Update were previously funded and operated by the City’s Redevelopment Agency,
which was eliminated in 2011. A more detailed description of changes to programs based on their
previous successes can also be found in Appendix A.

3        Housing Needs Assessment
The purpose of the Housing Needs Assessment is to describe housing, economic, and
demographic conditions in South San Francisco, assess the demand for housing for households at
all income-levels, and document the demand for housing to serve various special needs
populations. The Housing Needs Assessment is intended to assist South San Francisco in
developing housing goals and formulating policies and programs that address local housing
needs.
To facilitate an understanding of how the characteristics of South San Francisco are similar to, or
different from the larger area in which it is situated, this Housing Needs Assessment presents data
for South San Francisco alongside comparable data for all of San Mateo County and, where
appropriate, for the San Francisco Bay Area and the state of California.
This Needs Assessment incorporates data from numerous sources, including the United States
Census; American Community Survey; the Association of Bay Area Governments; and the State
of California, Department of Finance.
3.1 Regional Context
Located in northern San Mateo County on the San Francisco Peninsula, the City of South San
Francisco is known as the birth place of the biotechnology industry. The City measures 9.6 square
miles and was incorporated in 1908. Its population has tripled since the Second World War, but
population growth has moderated in recent years, as the community has become increasingly
developed. The City is served by Highway 101, Interstate 280, Interstate 380, BART, and Caltrain.
In addition, the City is adjacent to the San Francisco International Airport and is served by a
Ferry Terminal that began operating in June 2012. South San Francisco is adjacent to the cities of
Brisbane, Colma, Daly City, Pacifica, and San Bruno, as well as portions of unincorporated San
Mateo County. The City is home to a collection of compact neighborhoods, including an active
and walkable downtown. The area east of Highway 101 contains research and development,
office, and industrial uses, and is where many of the City’s biotechnology businesses are located,
as well as the Oyster Point Marina, situated on the San Francisco Bay.

  EMPLOYED RESIDENTS
  Table 3.3-3 presents recent trends in employment for the City of South San Francisco and San
  Mateo County. South San Francisco is a “jobs rich” city with substantial in-commuting from
  other jurisdictions. As shown, in 2010 there were approximately 30,000 employed residents in the
  City compared to 44,000 jobs, a ratio of 1.4 jobs per every working resident of the City. By
  comparison, San Mateo County has a much closer balance between the number of employed
  residents and total jobs, with approximately 342,000 employed residents and 345,000 jobs, a ratio
  of 1.0 jobs per every working resident of the county. Since 2005, job growth in South San
  Francisco has been faster than that of the county, increasing at an average annual rate of 2.8
  percent, adding substantially to a need to provide additional housing opportunities to support a
  fast-growing economy.

POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects South San Francisco’s population to
increase from 63,632 to 87,700 between 2010 and 2040, a 38 percent increase over 30 years.
Household growth is expected to be slightly lower, rising from 20,938 households to 27,900, a
gain of 33 percent. These projections reflect the growing need for residential development in
South San Francisco.
As illustrated in Table 3.3-4, South San Francisco will continue to contain more jobs than
households over this 30-year period, deepening its reputation as a “jobs-rich” community.
Compared with San Mateo County and Bay Area figures, South San Francisco’s jobs-housing
imbalance is disproportional; 2040 estimates for both the county and the region hover around 1.4
jobs per household compared to 1.9 in South San Francisco.

3.4 Housing Characteristics
HOUSING STOCK CONDITIONS
The last comprehensive survey of the condition of the City’s housing stock was completed in the
1990s. While much has changed since this time, the general findings of this survey, presented
below, are still considered to be generally applicable. At the time of this survey, Irish Town,
located north of the downtown commercial area, had by far the greatest percentage of structures
in need of rehabilitation. This is the Downtown Target Area, where Community Development
                                                                                                  17

Block Grant funds are concentrated for rental and single-family rehabilitation. In five other
neighborhoods, over 10 percent of the structures were in fair to poor condition: Grand Avenue,
Paradise Valley, Mayfair Village/Francisco Terrace, Town of Baden, and Peck's Lots.

To supplement this first-hand survey data, the following section presents data gathered from the
2008-2012 American Community Survey regarding the condition of the City’s housing stock.
The age of South San Francisco’s housing stock is similar to that of San Mateo County. As shown
in Table 3.4-2 the largest proportion of homes (27 percent) was built between 1950 and 1959 in
South San Francisco. According to the 2008-2012 American Community Survey, nearly half (45
percent) of the City’s housing stock was built before 1960, indicating a relatively old housing
inventory. Unless carefully maintained, older housing stock can create health, safety, and welfare
problems for occupants. Even with normal maintenance, dwellings over 40 years of age can
deteriorate, requiring significant rehabilitation.
Despite the presence of older homes in South San Francisco, virtually all housing units contain
complete plumbing and kitchen facilities. As shown in Table 3.4-2, less than one percent of homes
lack these facilities.

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS BY STRUCTURE TYPE
As shown in Table 3.4-4, a majority of housing units in South San Francisco are single-family
detached homes; 60 percent of homes were single-family detached dwelling units in 2013. Both
South San Francisco and San Mateo County maintained a constant share of single-family
detached units since 2000, when the City and County’s shares made up 59 and 58 percent of the
overall housing stock, respectively. Large multifamily housing units (defined as units in structures
containing five or more dwellings) represent the second largest housing category in South San
Francisco and have experienced the most rapid growth between 2000 and 2013. The number of
large multifamily housing units grew by 17 percent while single-family detached dwellings grew
by 11 percent between 2000 and 2013. At 20 percent in 2013, however, South San Francisco still
has a smaller proportion of large multifamily housing units compared to San Mateo County,
where over a quarter (26 percent) of all housing was in large multifamily structures.
Single-family attached homes comprised the third largest housing category in South San
Francisco at 13 percent in 2012, a higher figure than San Mateo County, at 9 percent. The
remaining housing categories, small multifamily homes (defined as units in structures containing
2 to 4 dwellings) and mobile homes, represented relatively small proportions of South San
Francisco’s housing stock in 2013 and have experienced little or no growth since 2000.

   Building Permit Trends
   Building permit trends in South San Francisco support the evident growth in multifamily units
   experienced between 2000 and 2012. Since 2002, large multifamily units have made up the
   majority of new development. Since 2002, South San Francisco issued 857 building permits for
   these larger complexes, while only 279 permits were issued for new single family development,
   leading to a relatively small increase in the city’s single-family housing stock (see Table 3.4-5).

   OVERCROWDING
   Overcrowding refers to a household with an average of 1.01 or more persons per room, with those
   rooms including all rooms in a house except bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and closets. Units
   with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered to be severely overcrowded. As shown in
   Table 3.4-6, South San Francisco households were as likely to be overcrowded as San Mateo
   County households in 2012. Of all households in South San Francisco, 7 percent of households
   were overcrowded or severely overcrowded, equal to San Mateo County with 7 percent.
   Overcrowding was more common in South San Francisco’s renter-occupied households, with 10
   percent overcrowded, while only 5 percent of owner-occupied households in South San Francisco
   were overcrowded.
                                                                                                                       21

INVENTORY OF EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS
As presented in Table 3.4-7, the City of South San Francisco is home to 994 deed-restricted
affordable housing units, including 650 family units and 344 senior units. South San Francisco
contributed $9,989,000 towards the construction of 108 new affordable units at 636 El Camino
Real by MidPen Housing. In addition, the City leases the land, valued at $4.5M, for $1.00 per year
to MidPen. The project was completed in 2012 and is now fully occupied.

UNITS AT RISK OF CONVERSION DURING NEXT TEN YEARS
The California Housing Partnership Corporation identifies one affordable housing development
in South San Francisco at “very high” risk for conversion to market rate housing during the next
10 years. The Fairway Apartments, located at 77 Westborough Boulevard, contains 74 nonelderly
units and is a development that is owned by a private, for-profit entity and was financed using
Section 221(d)(4) funds with Project-Based Section 8; its affordability restrictions were set to
expire in December 2014. Since the time that the California Housing Partnership Corporation
                                                                                                  23

was contacted, the affordability restrictions on the Fairway Apartments were extended for another
five years; however, this leaves the development still at risk of conversion within the next 10 years.
Given the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency, the City's ability to acquire such at risk units
is hampered. Options for retaining these affordable housing resources in the community include
preserving the units by working with nonprofit and other public agencies, or replacing them. An
analysis of options to preserve affordable housing resources is as follows.
Preserving Affordability
In Project-Based Section 8 properties, such as the Fairway Apartments, the owner of the building
receives rent from each unit equal to the HUD-established Fair Market Rent (FMR) for the area.3
Where the FMR is less than actual market rents, the owner realizes less income from the property
than he or she would without affordability restrictions. Hence, in order to incentivize a property
owner to continue to contract out his or her buildings as a Project-Based Section 8 property once
mortgage restrictions expire, an ongoing subsidy is required to make up for the gap between FMR
and actual market rent. As shown in Table 3.4-8, there is a gap of approximately $504 per unit per
month between FMR and actual market rent in South San Francisco. Hence, for a 74-unit
development, the average monthly gap is $37,300. If the property owner were willing to enter into
a rental subsidy agreement with the City or some other entity that would subsidize the rents on
behalf of the lower-income renters, this would require an ongoing annual payment of
approximately $448,000. Currently there is no funding available for the City to implement a rental
subsidy program. In previous years (and in the most recent renewal), HUD worked with the
owner of the Fairway Apartments to extend the affordability period. Another option would be for
the City to work with a nonprofit housing provider to negotiate the purchase of the building;
however, the City acknowledges that this option is unlikely given the lack of available funding
sources required for the acquisition.
Replacing Affordable Units
As an alternative to providing ongoing monthly rent subsidies, the City or another entity could
attempt to purchase or develop replacement housing units that could be rented to the displaced
lower-income households at similar rents. In order to make this possible, it would be necessary to
provide a subsidy for the purchase or construction of the replacement units that would be the
equivalent of $448,000 per year in current dollars. The initial investment in existing or new
housing units that would be necessary to allow a $448,000 reduction in annual rent can be
estimated by calculating the net present value of mortgage payments equal to $37,300 per month,
on the theory that if the owner (e.g., a non-profit housing organization) can reduce its required
mortgage payments by $37,300 per month, it could then reduce the rents that it needs to charge
its tenants by a similar amount. Hence, as shown in Table 3.4-8, based on a 30-year mortgage
term at 7.5 percent interest rate, it would take an initial investment of approximately $5.3 million
to reduce the monthly debt service by $37,300 per month.

  FMRs are defined by HUD as the 40th percentile rent drawn from the distribution of rents of all units occupied by
   recent movers.

This analysis likely understates the true cost of preserving or replacing the units, as it would be
quite difficult to assemble an appropriate combination of subsidies to acquire the property or
develop a similar project with the same mix of unit sizes and affordability levels.

Financial Resources Available to the City to Assist in Preservation
Clearly, the costs are substantial to preserve or replace housing units that currently rent below
market rates, yet the City has access to a range of different funds that could potentially assist in a
preservation effort, including the following:
     •    Mortgage Revenue Bonds
     •    State Grant Programs, such as the Affordable Housing Innovation Program and the
          Transit Oriented Development Housing Program
     •    Federal Grant Programs (Section 202 funds only- Supportive Housing for the Elderly)
     •    Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)
     •    HUD Section 8 “Mark to Market” Program
Where affordable units are at risk of conversion to market rate, it is the City’s policy to work to
preserve them, if possible. However, with the dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency, the
City is no longer able to acquire such at-risk units. Some properties are less at risk of conversion
than others in the City; for example, the owner of the Rotary Plaza property has a motivation to
keep the units affordable. Therefore, the City has focused its efforts on working with county and
federal agencies to secure housing vouchers for tenants in properties at higher risk of conversion
to subsidize keeping them in place or to assist with relocation.
To monitor the status of affordable housing properties and advocate for tenants, South San
Francisco Economic Development and Housing staff has met with Congresswoman Jackie Speier;
Ophelia Basgal, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Regional
Administrator; and William Lowell, the Executive Director of the San Mateo County Housing
                                                                                                            25

Authority. Key potential partners in this effort include HUD as well as a range of affordable
housing developers and property managers who have expressed an interest in working with local
communities on preservation of affordable housing projects, including such well-known
affordable housing providers as Mercy Housing, Inc., EAH, Inc., BRIDGE Housing Corporation,
the Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition, and Eden Housing. Numerous other organizations
working to preserve affordable housing units are listed in a database maintained by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development.
3.5 Market Conditions
This section of the Needs Assessment provides information on market conditions for housing in
South San Francisco and San Mateo County. This information is important because it reveals the
extent to which the private housing market is providing for the needs of various economic
segments of the local population. The information on housing market condition is combined with
local demographic and employment information to identify those segments of the population that
face difficulties in securing housing in South San Francisco at costs that do not place them under
excessive housing cost burden.
RENTAL MARKET OVERVIEW
A review of rental market trends in South San Francisco was conducted for this Housing Element
by reviewing data from RealFacts, a commercial database service that tracks rental apartment
occupancy statistics and rents within South San Francisco and other California cities. Data from
RealFacts focuses on large, professionally-managed apartment complexes with 50 units or more,
which accounts for approximately 11 percent of the total rental market in South San Francisco.
There are approximately 7,500 renter-occupied housing units in the City. As shown in Table 3.5-
1, RealFacts reports rents for studio units in South San Francisco averaging $1,279 per month;
one-bedroom, one-bath units averaging $2,293 per month; two-bedroom, two-bath units
averaging $3,076 per month; and three-bedroom townhouses averaging $2,695 per month. Asking
rents fluctuate frequently; therefore, the data presented here represent one point in time that may
or may not be indicative of long-term trends. Typically, three-bedroom units rent at higher rates
than two-bedroom units; however, the fact that two-bedroom units are renting at higher prices
than three-bedroom units in South San Francisco at the point in time at which the data were
collected may reflect lower inventory of two-bedroom units and/or lower quality housing stock of
three-bedroom units.

Consistent with trends elsewhere in the Peninsula and in San Francisco, RealFacts reports that
rental rates rose sharply between 2011 and 2013. Overall rents increased 16 percent between the
fourth quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2013. One-bedroom, one-bathroom units
registered a particularly steep increase during this period, with monthly rents jumping from
$1,869 to $2,293, a 23 percent increase. RealFacts reported a relatively low vacancy rate of
approximately 2.5 percent among large apartment complexes in the City in 2013, a marked
                                                                                                27

decrease compared to 2009 when the vacancy rate was 8.3 percent, indicating that demand
continues to outpace supply.
As RealFacts focuses on large apartment complexes, Dyett & Bhatia also reviewed online listings
for all rental units posted to Craigslist during April of 2014. These data show average asking rates
that are substantially lower than for just the subset of large, professionally-managed complexes.
Among all units listed for rent in the City during this period, average asking rents were $1,674 per
month for one-bedroom units, $2,226 for two-bedroom units, $3,173 for three-bedroom units,
and $3,470 for four-bedroom units.

OWNERSHIP MARKET OVERVIEW
A review of for-sale housing market conditions in South San Francisco was also conducted for
this Housing Element by reviewing data from Data Quick, a commercial database service that
tracks sales statistics in South San Francisco and other California cities. As shown in Table 3.5-3,
the median sale price of a single-family home was $625,000 as of 2013. This was off substantially
from a peak of $745,000 in 2006, but nonetheless represents a more than doubling of price since
1990. For condominiums, the median sale price stood at $414,500 in 2013, down from a high of
$555,000 in 2006, but still more than double the price in 1990.
Examining the for-sale residential market as a whole, including condominiums and single-family
homes, Data Quick reported a median home sale price of $580,000 in South San Francisco during
2013, well below the countywide median of $738,250.4
Consistent with the recent drop in prices has been a notable decline in sales. During 2013, only
406 homes sold in South San Francisco, one of the lowest levels in approximately 20 years.
Similarly, with only 124 sold during 2013, condominium sales volumes were also near a 20-year
low.
 As described in the following section, while sale prices have dropped from their 2006 peak, they
 nonetheless have escalated much faster than wages across the past 20 years, meaning that finding
 affordable housing remains a pressing challenge for many South San Francisco households.

3.6 Housing Affordability
According to the federal government, housing is considered “affordable” if it costs no more than
30 percent of the household’s gross income. Often, affordable housing is discussed in the context
of affordability to households with different income levels. Households are categorized as very
low income, low income, moderate income, or above moderate income based on percentages of
the Area Median Income (AMI) established annually by the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD). Income limits vary by household size. Table 3.6-1
provides the maximum income limits for households ranging from one to four people in size in
San Mateo County in 2014. Very low- and low-income households are eligible for federal, State,
and local affordable housing programs. Moderate-income households are eligible for some State
                                                                                                29

AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING
Households earning the 2012 median income for South San Francisco ($73,568) could afford to
spend up to $22,070 a year, or $1,839 per month, on housing without being considered
“overpaying.” For renters, this is a straightforward calculation, but home ownership costs are less
transparent. A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is 2.5 to 3.0 times the
annual income of that household, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term
obligations (such as a car loan), and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors
allows some households to qualify for homes priced at more than three times their annual
income, while other households may be limited to purchasing homes no more than two times
their annual incomes. Table 3.6-3 below calculates the estimated maximum affordable purchase
price by household income category.
                                                                                                                              31

As noted earlier, the median purchase price of a home in South San Francisco was $580,000 in
2013. This purchase price is too high for all but the highest of household income categories listed
in Table 3.6-1 to afford. Indeed, households must have an income that is more than 120 percent
of the county median ($123,600) to afford the median home price. This is consistent with the fact
that over 45 percent of renters in South San Francisco spend more than 30 percent of their
income on housing (see Table 3.6-4).
OVERPAYMENT
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) establishes that a household is
“cost-burdened” (i.e., overpaying for housing) if it spends more than 30 percent of gross income
on housing-related costs. A “severe housing cost burden” occurs when a household pays more
than 50 percent of its income on housing costs. The prevalence of overpayment varies
significantly by income, tenure, household type, and household size. The Comprehensive
Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data provides detailed information in this regard for
different types of households.
In general, overpayment disproportionately affects lower-income households. Table 3.6-4 shows
the relationship between low-income households and the varying degrees of cost burden. The
data show that renter households are much more likely to be overpaying than owners. The 2006-
2010 American Community Survey provides the most recent data on overpayment by tenure for
South San Francisco. According to these data, 61 percent of extremely low-income, 44 percent of
very low-income, and 57 percent of low-income homeowners were cost-burdened. At the same
time, 84 percent of extremely low-income, 72 percent of very low-income, and 42 percent of low-
income renter households were cost burdened.

3.7 Projected Housing Needs
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65584, the State, regional councils of
government (in this case, ABAG), and local governments must collectively determine each
locality's share of regional housing need. In conjunction with the State-mandated Housing
Element update cycle that requires Bay Area jurisdictions to update their Housing Elements by
January 31, 2015, ABAG allocated housing unit production needs for each county within the Bay
Area and, with the exception of San Mateo County, also allocated housing unit production need
to the city level. These allocations set housing production goals for the RHNA projection period
that runs from January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2022.
In the case of San Mateo County, the county formed a subregion in partnership with all twenty
cities in its jurisdiction for the purposes of conducting the RHNA, as allowed by State law. The
San Mateo subregion designated the City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) as the
entity responsible for coordinating and implementing the subregional RHNA process. Their
process paralleled, but was separate from, the Bay Area’s RHNA process. San Mateo County
created its own methodology, issued draft allocations, and handled the revision and appeal
processes. They also issued final allocations to members of the subregion. Although the subregion
worked independently of the regional RHNA process, the final allocation methodology was
ultimately similar to ABAG’s methodology.
                                                                                                          33

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
Shown below in Table 3.7-1, the countywide RHNA process determined a need for 1,864 housing
units in South San Francisco between January 1, 2014 and October 31, 2022. This need is divided
among various income categories with 15 percent of the need identified for extremely low-income
households, 15 percent for very low-income households, 15 percent for low-income households,
17 percent for moderate-income households, and the remaining 38 percent for above moderate-
income households.

3.8 Special Housing Needs
This section of the needs assessment profiles populations with special housing needs, including
large families, single parent families, extremely low income households, persons with disabilities,
elderly households, farm workers, and homeless persons and families. The end of the section
addresses resources available to address special housing needs in South San Francisco.
LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
In 2012, South San Francisco contained a greater proportion of large households (defined as five
or more persons) than San Mateo County as a whole. As shown in Table 3.8-1, 15.4 percent of
South San Francisco’s households contained five or more persons in 2012, versus San Mateo
County’s 11.8 percent. Large households were equally common among owners and renters in
South San Francisco, with 15.4 percent of homeowner households and 15.3 percent of renter
households having five or more persons.

While the prevalence of large households was relatively similar between renters and owners, as
shown in Table 3.8-2, renters were much less likely to live in housing units with four or more
bedrooms. Only 4 percent of South San Francisco renter households lived in units with four or
more bedrooms, despite the fact that 15 percent of renter households had five or more members.
By comparison, 23 percent of owner households lived in units with four or more bedrooms, while
15 percent of owner households had five or more members. Overall, these data point to the need
for additional rental housing opportunities for large households in South San Francisco.

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Single female-headed households with children tend to have a higher need for affordable housing
than family households in general. Single female-headed households with children often need
larger houses than other populations who need affordable housing, such as the elderly. In
addition, such households are more likely to need childcare since the mother is often the sole
source of income and the sole caregiver for children within the household.
Table 3.8-3 shows that in 2012, there were 1,177 single female households with children in South
San Francisco. As a proportion of all families, such households represented 5 percent of all
households in South San Francisco and 8 percent of family households.
San Mateo County contained a similar proportion of female-headed households, totaling 12,004
households in 2012, or 5 percent of all households present in the county. In addition, both South
San Francisco and San Mateo County contained a significantly smaller proportion of male
households with children; this household type made up 2 percent of both the city and the county.
At the city level, there were 265 single female-headed households with children living in poverty
in South San Francisco in 2012.

EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
Extremely low income households are defined as households earning less than 30 percent of area
median income (AMI). These households may require specific housing solutions such as deeper
income targeting for subsidies, housing with supportive services, single-room occupancy units, or
rent subsidies or vouchers.
In 2010, 2,675 South San Francisco households earned less than 30 percent of AMI. Extremely
low-income (ELI) households represented 21 percent of all renter households and 7 percent of all
owner households in the City. A majority of extremely low-income households were severely
overpaying for housing; 72 percent of renters and 47 percent of homeowners paid more than 50
percent of their gross income on housing.

SENIORS
Generally, senior households tend to have higher rates of homeownership than other households,
but also tend to earn less and in many instances face a significant housing cost burden.5 Shown in
Table 3.8-5, 77 percent of senior-headed households in South San Francisco owned their own
home, compared to 54 percent of younger households.

Among elderly households, most earn well below the county Median Family Income (MFI).
Shown in Table 3.8-6, only 12 percent of elderly renter households and 46 percent of elderly
owner households earn 80 percent of MFI or more. 6
For elderly residents, homeownership provides some level of security against increasing housing
costs. Shown in Table 3.8-7, approximately 28 percent of elderly homeowners paid 30 percent or
more of their income toward housing costs. This compares to 39 percent of homeowners in South
San Francisco overall. While elderly homeowners are less likely than younger homeowners to face
a cost burden, elderly renters are much more likely to overpay for housing. Overall, 52 percent of
elderly renter households paid 30 percent or more of their income toward housing, compared to
45 percent of renters citywide.

PERSONS WITH DISABILITY
Persons with a disability generally have lower incomes and often face barriers to finding
employment or adequate housing due to physical or structural obstacles. Based on the 2008-2012
American Community Survey, approximately 10 percent of South San Francisco residents were
affected by one or more disability, compared to 8 percent of people countywide.
As shown in Table 3.8-8, among the adult population with a disability, there was a much higher
likelihood of not having a job than among the general population. This high rate of joblessness
remains a contributing factor affecting the ability to find affordable housing.7

  As distinguished from a senior-headed households (age 65 or older), an “elderly household” as defined by HUD is a
   household with one or more member who is 62 years of age or older.

Notes:
1. Working age population refers to persons age 20 to 64.
2. Not employed persons include persons not currently part of the active labor force (e.g.,
full-time students, stay-at-home parents, other people not currently seeking employment).
The unemployment rate is calculated based on the active labor force and would be a lower
number than presented above.

  It should be noted that the percentage of people who are not employed is not the same as the unemployment rate. The
   unemployment rate refers to the percentage of people actively seeking employment who are not currently employed.
   Where people are not actively seeking employment (e.g., full-time students or persons unable to work due to a
   disability), they are not considered to be part of the labor force and are not counted in the unemployment rate.

with some activities of daily living while still allowing residents to be more independent than in
most nursing homes. Skilled nursing facilities, also known as nursing homes, offer a higher level
of care, with registered nurses on staff 24 hours a day. Adult residential facilities offer 24-hour
non-medical care for adults, ages 18 to 59 years old, who are unable to provide for their daily
needs due to physical or mental disabilities. Group homes, such as small residential facilities that
serve children or adults with chronic disabilities, provide 24-hour care by trained professionals.

Developmentally Disabled Persons
According to Section 4512 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code a “developmental
disability” is a disability that originates before an individual reaches adulthood (18 years old),
continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for
that individual. This includes intellectual disabilities (characterized by significantly sub-average
general intellectual functioning), cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes
disabling conditions found to be closely related to other intellectual disabilities or that require
treatment (i.e., care and management) similar to that required by individuals with intellectual
disabilities; however, it does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally

                                                                           Housing Needs Assessment
disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) supports approximately 216,000
children and adults with developmental disabilities and 29,000 infants at risk of developmental
delay or disability throughout the state. Services are provided through state-operated
developmental centers and community facilities, as well as through contracts with 21 non-profit
agencies called regional centers. The regional center is a private, non-profit community agency
that contracts with local business to offer a wide range of services to individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families.
Table 3.8-11 below summarizes the number of persons with development disabilities and their
place of residence. The majority of the people with developmental disabilities in this area reside
with their parents through age 29. People with autism comprise more than 30 percent of all those
with developmental disabilities for the ages 4 through 14 years and approximately 17 percent of
all those with developmental disabilities for ages 15 through 29 years. Due to improvements in
health care prevention, treatment, and maintenance, people with developmental disabilities are
expected to live much longer than in the recent past.

There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a development disability:
rent subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing,
Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The
design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the
availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are
important in serving the needs of this group. Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all, new multi-
family housing (as required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important
to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be
given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
                                                                                                    43

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS OR
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING
According to the 2013 San Mateo County Homeless Census and Survey, there were 2,281
homeless people reported in San Mateo County on the night of January 24, 2013. This point-in-
time study counted 1,299 homeless people living either on the street or in vehicles, a population
referred to as “unsheltered.” An additional 982 homeless people were staying in shelters,
transitional housing, jails, hospitals, or treatment facilities or were using a voucher to stay in a
motel, a population referred to as “sheltered.” Using an annualization formula, the County’s
survey estimated 7,151 homeless people in San Mateo County on an annual basis. The Homeless
Census and Survey did not provide an estimate of homeless people in San Mateo County on a
seasonal basis.
Within this dataset, 260 homeless individuals were counted in South San Francisco, including 172
unsheltered persons and 88 sheltered persons. With a total population of approximately 63,742
residents as of 2012, South San Francisco contained approximately 9 percent of the San Mateo
County population. By comparison, it was home to 13 percent of the county’s unsheltered
persons and 9 percent of the sheltered population.
Government Code Section 65583(a) requires that each city must include sufficient capacity to
accommodate the need for emergency shelters. According to an inventory of shelter capacity in
the county, there are 168 emergency beds.8 Accordingly, the Safe Harbor Shelter in South San
Francisco, which provided 90 beds, accounts for 53 percent of emergency shelter capacity
countywide, far exceeding the City’s share of countywide general and homeless populations.
Hence, the City goes well beyond its obligation to provide for a share of the countywide
emergency shelter facilities. It also supports not-for-profit organizations that provide emergency
shelter, counseling, and housing referral services, such as the organizations Community
Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA) and the Shelter Network.

 Farm Workers
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural labor. Most jurisdictions in San Mateo County have no farms or farm
workers; however, there are 334 farms and 1,722 farm workers in the county, primarily located in
coastal communities. Of these 1,722 farm workers, 88 are migrant workers and 329 work less than
150 days annually (and are therefore considered to be “seasonal labor”). Farm workers who are
migrant or seasonal workers have special housing needs because of their relatively low income
and the unstable nature of their job (i.e. having to move throughout the year from one harvest to
the next). These workers generally face higher rates of overcrowding and other substandard
housing conditions. Continued efforts to provide affordable housing, especially affordable
housing suitable for families, will help meet the needs of these farm workers.

AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
The City and the County provide funding and subsidies, with support from State, federal, local,
and private resources, for the construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of housing units to
support those with special housing needs in South San Francisco. Many of these programs are
described in greater detail in Section 5.2 of this Housing Element.
The U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides funds to local
governments for a wide range of housing and community development activities through the
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG). The City of South San Francisco
expects to receive CDBG funds during the 2014 to 2022 period, which can be used for site
acquisition, rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer assistance, emergency and transitional shelters,
and fair housing/housing counseling activities. In particular, CDBG funds have been used in
South San Francisco to provide free accessibility modifications to houses through the Center for
Independence of Individuals with Disabilities’ Housing Accessibility Modification Program.
The Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) program is a federal program that has been used
in combination with City and other resources to encourage the construction and rehabilitation of
rental housing for lower-income households in South San Francisco. The HOME Investment
Partnership Act, which is under the National Affordable Housing Act, provides a source of
federal financing for a variety of affordable housing projects. The City of South San Francisco is a
participating jurisdiction in the San Mateo County HOME Consortium and is eligible to apply for
funding from the Consortium’s annual grant allocation. The Section 8 Program is a federal
                                                                                                 45

program that provides rental assistance to very-low income persons in need of affordable
housing, and the program is administered locally by the San Mateo County Housing Authority.
South San Francisco is a member of the Housing Endowment and Regional Trust (HEART),
which raises funds from public and private sources to meet critical housing needs in San Mateo
County. In addition, the City provides financial support for the not-for-profit organization
Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA), which provides emergency shelter for
battered women, and two agencies that provide housing referral and counseling services, the
Shelter Network and the Human Investment Project.

4        Housing Constraints
Section 65583(a)(4) of the California Government Code states that the Housing Element must
analyze “potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or
development of housing for all income levels, including land use controls, building codes and their
enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local
processing and permit procedures.” Where constraints are identified, the City is required to take
action to mitigate or remove them.
In addition to government constraints, this section assesses other factors that may constrain the
production of affordable housing in South San Francisco. These include infrastructure
availability, environmental features, economic and financing constraints, and public opinion
regarding affordable housing development.
4.1 Government Constraints
Government regulations affect housing costs, standards and allowable densities for development,
and exacting fees for the use of land or the construction of homes. With respect to the housing
market, the increased costs associated with such requirements are often passed on to consumers
in the form of higher home prices and rents. Potential regulatory constraints include local land
use policies (as defined in a community’s general plan), zoning regulations and their
accompanying development standards, subdivision regulations, urban limit lines, and
development impact and building permit fees. Lengthy approval and processing times also may
be regulatory constraints.
GENERAL PLAN
The South San Francisco General Plan was last comprehensively updated in 1999 and has been
amended since to incorporate the 2001 BART Transit Village Plan, the 2007-2014 Housing
Element Update, the 2010 South El Camino Real General Plan Amendment, and the 2011 El
Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan, which allowed residential land use through mixed-use
development. In early 2015, the General Plan was amended to incorporate the Downtown Station
Area Specific Plan (DSASP).
As required by State law, the General Plan includes a land use map indicating the allowable uses
and densities at various locations in the City. Listed below are the primary residential land use
designations in addition to commercial land use designations that allow residential development.
Under existing designations, the City permits the construction of a range of housing types,
including opportunities for higher density housing up to 100 dwelling units per acre.

The General Plan includes a range of policies to encourage and support a variety of housing
opportunities in the City. Several key policies are discussed below.
In order to balance community interests and assure continued support for medium- and high-
density housing in South San Francisco, the City established Policy 2-G-1, which calls for the
preservation of “the scale and character of established neighborhoods” and the protection of
“residents from changes in non-residential areas.” Consistent with this policy, the General Plan
Land Use map designates medium-and high-density residential areas along major transit
corridors and in the downtown area to avoid conflicts with existing neighborhoods. The City’s
political leadership credits this policy with facilitating recent multi-family housing development
with minimal opposition from neighborhood or other interest groups.
Policy 2-G-6 calls for the maximization of “opportunities for residential development, including
through infill and redevelopment, without impacting existing neighborhoods or creating conflicts
with industrial operations.” Policy 2-G-7 calls for the encouragement of “mixed-use residential,
retail, and office development in centers where they would support transit, in locations where
they would provide increased access to neighborhoods that currently lack such facilities, and in
48

                                                                                Housing Constraints
corridors where such developments can help to foster identity and vitality.” The City has worked
to realize these policies in recent years with several key developments along El Camino Real in the
Transit Village area. The City continues to encourage development of high density housing near
transit with the adoption (February 2015) of the DSASP, partially funded by the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC). The major goals of the plan are to:
     •   Revitalize downtown South San Francisco - encourage the retention of existing and local
         business while also promoting new improvements to bring a focus back to the historic
         downtown;
     •   Promotes new residential development downtown-primarily on underutilized or vacant
         parcels, while retaining the existing land use and density standards for residential
         neighborhoods outside of the Downtown Core; and
     •   Improving pedestrian and bicycle connections to Caltrain as well as the Downtown with
         the East Employment area.
The General Plan contains very few policies addressing the siting or design of housing. Those
policies that do exist include Policy 2-I-2, which establishes height limits within the downtown
and along major commercial corridors. These height limits range from 50 to 80 feet and are
consistent with residential development of 30 dwelling units per acre and higher and are not
considered an impediment to housing development. However, with the adoption of the DSASP in
February 2015, the height limits in downtown have increased to promote higher densities. Policy
2-I-19 limits the allowable density of housing development on steep slopes by up to 50 percent
compared to existing land use designations to prevent excessive grading. While this policy does
work to limit the amount of housing development, it applies to a relatively small area of the city
(only parcels with a slope greater than 20 percent) and provides some certainty as the minimum
amount of housing development that will be allowed on steep sites, consistent with the General
Plan. Finally, Policy 2-1-18 specifically allows for senior housing development in the City to be at
a density of up to 50 dwelling units per acre regardless of underlying land use designations and
allows for reduced parking standards to be applied to this type of development. With the adoption
of the DSASP, qualifying affordable senior housing will be allowed densities limits in excess of 50
dwelling units per acre to upwards of 125 dwelling units per acre.
Based on a review of the General Plan and discussion with key stakeholders, including developers,
the General Plan is not an obstacle to housing development and is supportive of the development
of a range of housing types, including substantial opportunities for medium- and-high density
residential development. The General Plan does not constitute an obstacle to housing
development for farm workers, seniors, large families, female-headed households, persons with
disabilities, persons needing emergency shelter, those needing supportive and transitional
housing, and those needing factory-built housing.
                                                                                                 49

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
ZONING ORDINANCE
The City updated the Zoning Ordinance in 2010 to ensure that current standards and guidelines
support the implementation of the General Plan, including the 2010 Housing Element Update.
Shown below is a list of existing districts that allow housing development, along with existing
development standards.
The City’s main residential districts are the Single Family Districts in RL-1.3, RL-5, RL-6, and RL-
8; Medium Density Residential Districts in RM-10, RM-15, and RM-17.5; and Multiple Family
Residential Districts in RH-30 and RH-35. Residential development is also allowed the Transit
Village (TV-C, TC-R, TV-RM, and TV-RH) Districts, El Camino Real Mixed Use District
(ECRMX), and Downtown Districts (DC, DMX, DRL, DRM, and DRH), as well as in the
Commercial Mixed Use (CMX) District. The district that corresponds with the adopted El
Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan – El Camino Real/Chestnut District – includes three
districts that allow mixed-use residential development (ECR/C-RH, ECR/C-MXM, ECR/MXH).
There are five districts that correspond to the DSASP area and permit residential development
(DTC, GAC, DRC, LCC, and LNC). The Parks and Recreation (PR) and Open Space (O-S)
districts cover a very small portion of the city, and are intended for the preservation of open-space
and/or the rural character of certain unincorporated areas; residential development is not allowed
in these districts.
The Zoning Ordinance does not constrain or unreasonably limit the types of housing that can be
developed in South San Francisco. It supports populations with special housing needs by
permitting many supportive and transitional residential uses across many zones. These uses
include multiple-unit developments, group residences, residential care facilities, mobile homes,
elder and long-term care facilities, family day care, and shelters. These uses are supported in
Medium Density Residential Districts, Multiple Family Residential Districts, Transit Village
Districts, Downtown Districts, DSASP Districts, the El Camino Real/Chestnut Districts, and the
El Camino Real Mixed Use District.
Table 4.1-2 shows the various residential uses permitted in the city and lists whether they are
permitted (P) or permitted subject to a conditional use permit (C) or minor use permit (MUP).
This table is followed by a narrative discussion of each residential use and its permitting
requirements.
The Zoning Ordinance does not impede housing development and enables development of a wide
range of housing types, including substantial opportunities for medium- and-high density
residential development. The Zoning Ordinance is not an obstacle to housing development for
farm workers, seniors, large families, female-headed households, persons with disabilities, persons
needing emergency shelter, those needing supportive and transitional housing, and those needing
factory-built housing.

  PARKING
  Developers and other key stakeholders identified the City’s multi-family parking standard as an
  obstacle to housing development. The Zoning Ordinance includes the following parking
  requirements in Table 4.1-4 for residential uses in all zones except Downtown districts, which are
  shown in Table 4.1-5.

According to the 2010 Zoning Ordinance, the parking requirement may be reduced through a
Conditional Use Permit, if it meets the criteria for approval, including reduced parking demand
as evaluated by a parking demand study. The Zoning Ordinance allows for a reduced parking
requirement for any land use except residential single-unit and duplex development; if any
portion of the lot is located within a quarter mile of a BART or CalTrain station, the number of
required parking spaces may be reduced by 25 percent of the normally required number of spaces
with Conditional Use Permit approval. This reduction does not apply in the TV or Downtown
districts. Additionally, under certain conditions and with a Conditional Use Permit, the provision
of a shared parking facility can result in a reduction of up to 50 percent of the number of parking
spaces normally required.
FEES AND EXACTIONS
The City charges residential developers fees for planning and construction services performed by
the City. Developers of new residential projects also pay various impact fees to finance
improvements to infrastructure and public facilities needed to serve new housing in the city.
In order to determine fees charged by the City of South San Francisco and other jurisdiction in
San Mateo County, the 21 Elements Working Group conducted a survey of all jurisdictions in the
County, asking that each provide fee information for the following three different developments:
60
                                                                                 Housing Constraints
    •    Development 1 - Single Family Infill: A new home on an empty lot in an existing
         neighborhood, with no significant grading or other complicating factors. The two-story
         home is 2,400 square feet with a 500 square foot garage, and it has four bedrooms and
         three bathrooms.
    •    Development 2 - Single Family Home Development: A new development consisting of
         50 units, each on their own lot, on an 8-acre parcel. There are three models of homes in
         the development: Model A (20 units total) is 1,600 square feet and 2 stories tall, with 3
         bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, as well as a 500 square foot garage; Model B (15 units total)
         is 2,000 square feet and 2 stories tall, with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, as well as a 500
         square foot garage; Model C (15 units) is 2,400 square feet and 2 stories tall, with 4
         bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, as well as a 500 square foot garage. All units have HVAC
         systems. The project would result in 98,000 total square feet of development, with public
         streets and no sprinklers. It is estimated the development would generate 50 peak hour
         trips.
         The project is complicated by the fact that it requires a zoning change to planned
         development zoning, a planned development permit, and a tentative map, all of medium
         complexity. It would require significant grading work (10,000 CY), with Type 1
         erosion/sediment control. The construction of public streets would cost about $1,300,000
         in public improvements (no public landscaping or traffic signal work).
    •    Development 3 - Multi-family Development: A new development consisting of 96 units
         in 16 buildings on 8 acres. There are three models of units in the development: Model A
         (28 units) is 1,250 square feet and 2 stories, with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, as well as
         a 500 square foot garage; Model B (34 units) is 1,500 square feet and 2 stories, and it has 3
         bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, as well as a 500 square foot garage; Model C (34 units) is
         1,750 square feet and 2 stories, with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, as well as a 500
         square foot garage. All units have HVAC systems. It would result in a total of 145,000
         square feet, without sprinklers, and generate 72 peak hour trips.
         The project is complicated by the fact that it requires a zoning change to planned
         development zoning, a planned development permit, and a tentative map, all of high
         complexity. It would require significant grading work (5,000 CY) and Type 1
         erosion/sediment control. On the existing public street frontage, $400,000 of frontage
         improvements would be required, and $600,000 in private improvements would be
         required for construction of new private streets. No public landscaping or traffic signal
         work would be involved.
Fees for the City for each of these hypothetical developments are listed below in Table 4.1-6. As
shown, planning, construction, and impact fees would be nearly $17,000 per unit for a single
family unit as described above; approximately $390,000 for the development project with 50
single family homes; and approximately $369,000 for the multi-family development project with
96 units.

   Notes:
   1. In addition to the above fees, the City requires parkland dedication in accordance with Quimby Act and
   requires the provision of affordable housing units on site through its inclusionary housing ordinance. Developers
   have the option to pay in-lieu fees to avoid these exactions.
   2. Per City Resolution 97-2012 Public Safety Fee, calculation assumes Development 1 is Low Density Residential
   ($1,285 per unit), Development 2 is Medium Density Residential ($810 per unit), and Development 3 is High
   Density Residential ($563 per unit).
   3. Does not include fees that may result because of Inclusionary Housing policy. The City is currently
   considering adjusting the in-lieu fee calculation to encourage more use of the in-lieu fee; this may result in a
   reduced in-lieu fee.

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING
Revised in 2010, Chapter 20.380 of the Zoning Ordinance details the City’s inclusionary housing
regulations. The City’s objective is to ensure that all residential development provides a range of
housing opportunities for all identifiable economic segments of the population, including low-
and moderate-income households. The inclusionary housing regulations require that all approved
residential development projects with four or more units have a minimum of 20 percent of the
units restricted to and affordable to low- and moderate-income households. Additionally, the City
requires that at least 20 percent of all new dwelling units are restricted to and affordable to low- or
moderate-income households. Development projects must provide affordable units on-site,
although under certain conditions, alternatives are provided to this requirement as a means of
providing affordable units in the City. Housing developments can pay an in-lieu fee as an
alternative to the requirement of constructing inclusionary units. These requirements apply to all
residential market-rate dwelling units that are newly constructed for sale as well as the conversion
of apartments to condominiums that will be for sale.
Although concerns exist that inclusionary housing may constrain production of market rate
homes, studies have shown evidence to the contrary. One school of thought is that the cost of an
inclusionary housing requirement must ultimately be borne by either (1) developers through a
lower return, (2) landowners through decreased land values, or (3) other homeowners through
higher market rate sale prices. Another significant body of research and analysis suggests that in
fact the cost of inclusionary housing and any other development fee “will always be split between
all players in the development process.”10 Some academics have pointed out that over the long
term, it is probable that landowners will bear most of the costs of inclusionary housing, not other
homeowners or the developer (Mallach 1984, Hagman 1982, Ellickson 1985).
The most definitive empirical study on inclusionary housing was completed in 2008 by the
Furman Center of New York University working for the Center for Housing Policy of the
National Housing Conference. Entitled “The Effects of Inclusionary Zoning on Local Housing
Markets: Lessons from the San Francisco, Washington DC and Suburban Boston Areas,” this
study measured the impact of inclusionary housing ordinances on median homes sale prices and
residential development activity in these three regions. While findings for the DC and Boston
regions were mixed, the study found definitive evidence that inclusionary ordinances do not lead
to higher home prices or a decrease in building activity in the Bay Area. This is attributed in large
part to the more flexible nature of the ordinances in the Bay Area region and to the number of
options that developers have to meet inclusionary requirements.
In addition to this study, a 2004 study on housing starts between 1981 and 2001 in communities
throughout California with and without inclusionary housing programs evidences that
inclusionary housing programs do not lead to a decline in housing production. In fact, the study
found that housing production actually increased after passage of local inclusionary housing
ordinances in cities as diverse as San Diego, Carlsbad, and Sacramento.11

In keeping with the Furman Center study findings cited above, the City of South San Francisco
recognizes the need for a financially feasible program that does not constrain production. In order
to ensure maximum flexibility so as not to constrain production, the City’s Zoning Ordinance
allows alternatives to constructing new affordable units on-site as a means of providing affordable
units in the City. If the City Council finds that new construction of affordable housing units
would be infeasible or present unreasonable hardship for a developer, an alternative may be
approved (for example, acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable units or the construction of
special needs housing projects or programs). Additionally, under certain circumstances,
developers may satisfy the affordable housing requirement with off-site combined inclusionary
housing projects or in-lieu fees. The City also offers a series of developer incentives, per State
Density Bonus Law, that help offset the added cost of the inclusionary units. Finally, the City’s
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance allows for developers to seek modification of the requirements
due to undue hardship. These policies are in line with recommendations in On Common Ground:
Joint Principles on Inclusionary Housing Policies, published by the Non-Profit Housing
Association of Northern California (NPH) and the Home Builders Association of Northern
California (HBA) in 2005. The report points to the need for flexible inclusionary housing
requirements, such as those established by South San Francisco, to allow for financially feasible
residential development.
PROCESSING AND PERMIT PROCEDURES
The entitlement process can impact housing production costs, with lengthy processing of
development applications adding to financing costs, in particular. The City has worked to
establish transparent and streamlined procedures for processing and permitting development
applications.
Explained below are the typical processing and permit procedures for a single family housing
development in a single family district and for a multi-family housing development in a multi-
family district.
Single Family Residential Procedure
For single family homes proposed in a residential district (RL-1.3, RL-5, RL-6, RL-8, RM-10, RM-
15, RM-17.5, RH-30, and RH-35) steps in the permit and approvals process are as listed below:
     1. Pre-application meeting with staff (required)
     2. Application submittal
     3. Review of application by City staff
     4. Design Review Board review/recommendation
     5. Decision by Chief Planner
     6. Appeal to Planning Commission (if applicable)
     7. Building permit issuance
                                                                                                 65

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
As listed above, approvals for single family development in a single family district do not
generally require action by the Planning Commission or City Council. The process does, however,
require review by the Design Review Board (DRB), which makes a recommendation to the Chief
Planner to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the application.
Design review is required of all new construction in South San Francisco, including single family
residential, multi-family residential, and commercial development. For residential development
of three or fewer units, design review is limited to height, bulk, lot coverage, and general
compatibility with the neighborhood. If the DRB recommends approval of a project and the Chief
Planner approves the project, it may proceed without requiring any action by the Planning
Commission or City Council.
Design review applications submitted before the submittal deadline at the end of a given month
are generally heard during the Design review meeting scheduled for the following month.
Depending on the outcome of the Design Review Board meeting and the specific timing when an
application is submitted (whether toward the beginning or end of a month), the typical timeframe
for approval of a single family residential unit and issuance of building permits varies between
eight and 18 weeks.
Multi-Family Residential Procedure
For a typical multi-family housing development of 20 or more units proposed in a multi-family
district (RM-30, RM-35, TV-C, TV-R, TV-RM, TV-RH, DRC, and ECRMX) steps in the permit
and approvals process are as listed below:
      1. Pre-application meeting with staff
      2. Application submittal
      3. Review of application by City staff
      4. Design Review Board review/recommendation
      5. Planning Commission Hearing
      6. City Council Hearing (if applicable)
      7. Building permit issuance
As listed above, approval of multi-family housing requires action by the Design Review Board to
recommend the project to the Planning Commission for approval, approval with conditions, or
denial. Design review may address any of the following topics: exterior design, materials, textures,
colors, means of illumination, landscaping, irrigation, height, shadow patterns, parking, access,
security, safety, and other usual on-site development elements.
Design review is typically completed within four weeks for simple projects and can take up to
twelve weeks if plans require revision. The submittal requirements are clearly delineated in an
application check list, with some latitude given to the Planning Division to waive certain
requirements for small projects or to add additional requirements, such as a shadow study where
taller development will be located adjacent to single-story residential uses.

Following the Design review process, the Planning Commission reviews the project. For smaller
projects not involving an affordable housing agreement or a development agreement, the
Planning Commission is the final decision making body for the development. However, more
typically in South San Francisco, larger scale multi-family housing developments require an
affordable housing agreement and/or utilize a development agreement, requiring action by the
City Council.
In total the typical approval time for a multi-family development application from the time the
application is submitted to the Planning Division until issuance of building permits is between 18
and 36 weeks, depending on the complexity of the project and the outcome of the design review
process and Planning Commission meeting.
Other Permit Processing Times and Procedures
Listed below are the typical processing times for various types of planning actions. Where
possible, when multiple planning approvals are required for a single project (e.g., a Zoning
Amendment and Conditional Use Permit), both approvals are considered together as part of the
same hearing, such that times listed below are not necessarily additive.
In general, South San Francisco’s processing and permit procedures are reasonable and
comparable to those in other San Mateo County communities. The permit process only increases
in complexity and duration when the circumstances of individual projects warrant extra
consideration on the part of local staff and officials. This is especially true of the environmental
review component of the process. However, the City has little flexibility to change this, since the
California Environmental Quality Act specifies procedures that local jurisdictions must observe in
reviewing the impacts of development projects.

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
CODES AND ENFORCEMENT AND ON/OFF SITE IMPROVEMENT
STANDARDS
New construction in South San Francisco must comply with the California Building Codes
(2013). Thus, there are no extraordinary building regulations that would adversely affect the
ability to construct housing in the city.
The City requires that developers complete certain minimum site improvements in conjunction
with new housing development. Required on-site improvements include grading and installation
of water, sewer, storm drainage, gas, electricity, and cable utilities. Required off-site
improvements include curbs, gutters, sidewalks, full street sections, and street lighting.
Based on conversations with local developers, these site improvement standards are typical of
many communities, and do not adversely affect housing production in the city.
EFFORTS TO REMOVE CONSTRAINTS
As described above, current regulations, standards, and procedures in the City reflect several
efforts to accommodate all housing types and promote housing production, including the
following:
     •   Diverse housing and development types and uses allowed in the General Plan and Zoning
         Ordinance;
     •   Provisions in the Zoning Ordinance to reduce the amount of parking required;
     •   Comparatively low fees and exactions for San Mateo County;
     •   Inclusionary housing regulations to provide a range of housing opportunities for all
         identifiable economic segments of the population;
     •   Transparent and streamlined procedures for processing and permitting development
         applications; and
     •   No extraordinary building regulations that would adversely affect housing production in
         South San Francisco.
4.2 Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Consistent with State Law, the following section analyzes governmental constraints to housing for
persons with disabilities and describes ongoing and needed future actions to remove constraints
or provide reasonable accommodations for such housing.
STANDARDS AND PROCESSES
The City’s standards and processes are analyzed below, within several categories identified by
HCD as potential sources of constraints to housing for persons with disabilities.
Reasonable Accommodations. Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on cities and counties to make
reasonable accommodations in their zoning and land use policies when such accommodations are
70

                                                                                                     Housing Constraints
necessary to provide equal access to housing for persons with disabilities. Reasonable
accommodations refer to modifications or exemptions to particular policies that facilitate equal
access to housing. Examples include exemptions to setbacks for wheelchair access structures or
reductions to parking requirements.
ZONING AND LAND USE
The 2010 Zoning Ordinance included updates to Chapter 20.510 Waivers and Modifications, to
facilitate compliance with the Federal Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and
the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. It provides reasonable accommodation to
persons with disabilities seeking fair access to housing through modification of the application of
the City’s Zoning Ordinances. Chapter 20.510 allows the Chief Planner to grant relief from the
Zoning Ordinance’s dimensional requirements when necessary to provide access to housing. It
also allows the Planning Commission to grant exceptions and waivers when necessary to
accommodate religious uses protected by the Federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized
Persons Act of 2000. Below is a discussion of existing zoning and land use policies in the City
affecting the development of housing for persons with disabilities.
Provision for Group Homes. Consistent with State law, the City allows for Limited Residential
Care Facilities, which serve six persons or fewer, in all residential zoning districts, as well as DRL,
DRM, DRH, ECR/C-MXH, ECR/C-MXM, ECR/C-RH, districts, without a special use permit and
not subject to any special restrictions.1 These facilities are also conditionally permitted in the
DMX, TV-C, TC-RH, CMX, DTC, DRC, and ECRMX zones. The City also permits General
Residential Care Facilities serving six or more persons in the TV-C, TV-R, TV-RM, and TV-RH
districts. General Residential Care Facilities are conditionally permitted in all multi-family
districts, the ECRMX district, the DTC and DRC districts, and all Downtown districts except the
DC district. These are not subject to any minimum distance requirements in relationship to other
special needs housing nor subject to any other special land use requirements.
Broad Definition of Family. Consistent with State Law, the City’s Zoning Ordinance provides for
a broad definition of family as “one or more persons living together as a single nonprofit
housekeeping unit and sharing common living, sleeping, cooking and eating facilities. Members
of a ‘family’ need not be related by blood but are distinguished from a group occupying a hotel,
club, fraternity or sorority house.” (Section 20.630) This definition of family does not limit the
number of people living together in a household and does not require them to be related.
Reasonable Accommodation. The City’s Zoning Ordinance facilitates the development of
housing and residential parking spaces accessible to persons with disabilities by allowing waivers
and modifications to required dimensional requirements, such as encroachments into front, side,
and rear yards for wheelchair access structures. Section 20.330.111 establishes procedures for
private residential handicap parking, while Chapter 20.510 establishes the rules and procedures
for requests for reasonable accommodation to ensure access to housing.

  A Limited Residential Care Facility is a facility that requires a State license or is State licensed and provides 24-hour
   non-medical care and supervision for 6 or fewer persons in need of personal services, supervision, protection, or
   assistance for sustaining the activities of daily living, excluding the licensee or members of the licensee’s family or
   persons employed as facility staff. See SSFMC 20.080 and 20.630.002.

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
BUILDING CODE AND PERMITTING
Uniform Building Code. In 2014, the City of South San Francisco adopted the 2013 California
Administrative Code and the 2013 California Building Code published by the International
Conference of Building Officials. In addition, the City adopted and implemented the 1997
Uniform Housing Code, which provides requirements for the conservation and rehabilitation of
housing. The City’s Building Code does not include any amendments to the California
Administrative Code, California Building Code, or Uniform Housing Code that might diminish
the ability to accommodate persons with disabilities.2
Site and Building Accessibility. The City complies with all State and federal standards and laws
pertaining to the accessibility of sites and buildings for disabled persons.
Permitting. The City does not require special permitting that could impede the development of
group homes for six people or fewer. As discussed above, Residential Care Facilities are permitted
uses in all residential zoning districts. Furthermore, there are no siting requirements or minimum
distances between facilities that apply to Residential Care Facilities or Group Care Facilities.
EFFORTS TO REMOVE CONSTRAINTS
As described above, current regulation standards and procedures in the City reflect several efforts
to accommodate housing for persons with disabilities, including the following:
     •    Provision for small group homes in all residential zones by right;
     •    Use of a broad definition of family;
     •    Provisions to allow encroachment into required setbacks for wheelchair access structures
          and waivers and modifications to other dimensional requirements when necessary to
          provide reasonable accommodation; and
     •    Provision of alternative parking requirements for special needs housing; and
     •    Implementation of the Uniform Building Code.
4.3 Non-Governmental Constraints
In addition to governmental constraints, there may be non-governmental factors that may
constrain the production of new housing. These could include market-related conditions such as
land and construction costs as well as public opinion toward new development.
CONSTRUCTION & LAND COSTS
Land costs in San Mateo County are high, due in part to the desirability of housing in the county
and because available land is in short supply. These costs vary both between and within
jurisdictions based on factors like the desirability of the location and the permitted density.
2
  As a practical matter the City has been following the 2013 California Building Code in evaluating projects, which was
   formally adopted in December 2013.
72

                                                                                  Housing Constraints
The following land costs are approximate, and derived from conversations with local developers.3
For a typical multi-family construction project in San Mateo County, land costs add
approximately $90,000 per unit. Land for a single family home often costs $400,000 or more per
lot.
Construction costs include both hard costs, such as labor and materials, and soft costs, such as
architectural and engineering services, development fees and insurance. For multi-family homes
in San Mateo County, hard costs account of 60-65 percent of the building cost and soft costs
average around 15-20 percent (the remaining 15-20 percent is land costs). For single family
homes, hard costs often are roughly 40 percent of the total cost, soft costs are 20 percent, and land
is 40 percent.
According to housing developers in San Mateo County, construction costs for multi-unit
buildings vary based on the form of parking (structured vs. surface) in addition to other
environmental factors such as topography, pre-existing structures, etc. For a larger, multi-unit
building, costs can vary from $185,000/unit to as high as $316,000/unit. The cost per square foot
ranges from $172-$200.
For the least expensive production single family homes, the cost of preparing the vacant land is
around $100,000/lot, and the cost of construction is approximately $145/sf. For more expensive,
custom homes, however, the construction costs can be higher than $435/sf. In general, soft costs
add another approximate third to the subtotal.
MORTGAGE FINANCING
Until mid-2008, home mortgage financing was readily available at attractive rates throughout San
Mateo County and California. Rates vary, but ranged around 6.25 percent to seven percent from
2006-2008 for a 30 year fixed rate loan (HSH Associates Financial Publishers). However, rates
have been as high as ten or 12 percent in the last decade.
As part of the aftermath of the subprime crisis in 2008, interest rates are very low. In San Mateo
County, rates range from 4.0-4.5 percent for a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage. One remaining
challenge is that many mortgages in San Mateo County are for more than $417,000, meaning they
qualify as jumbo loans and often have higher interest rates.
The data in the table below is from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and represents
loan applications in 2012 for one- to four-unit properties, as well as manufactured homes, for the
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and metropolitan division (MD) that includes South San
Francisco (MSA/MD: 41884 – San Francisco – San Mateo – Redwood City, CA). More than 65
percent of the loan applications were filed by households earning above a moderate income
(greater than 120 percent of AMI). Moderate income households (80-120 percent of AMI)
represented 18 percent of loan applicants, low income households (50-80 percent of AMI)
represent 12 percent, and very low income households (less than 50 percent of AMI) only 4
percent. Almost 75 percent of all loans were approved and accepted by the applicants, and 10

CONSTRUCTION FINANCING
Construction loans for new housing are difficult to secure in the current market. In past years,
lenders would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction (loan to value ratio). In
recent years, due to market conditions and government regulations, banks require larger
investments by the builder.
Due to federal and State budget cuts, affordable housing developers have had a much harder time
securing funding. Since 2009, the federal government has cut programs such as Community
Development Block Grant, HOME, and HOPE VI funding by 27-50 percent (ABAG).
Traditionally, these programs have been a large source of affordable housing funds. In addition to
federal cuts, the State dissolved Redevelopment Agencies in 2012, leaving San Mateo County with
a loss of $25.5 million in funds for affordable housing.4 However, some funding opportunities
remain from the federal and state governments, such as the federal Low Income Housing Tax
Credit program, which still provides an important source of funding for developers.
PUBLIC OPINION
In some communities, public opinion is a significant constraint to the production of higher
density and affordable housing. To date, housing developers, City staff, and elected officials do
not report significant public opposition to recent multi-family housing developments. As key to
this success, elected officials stress the need to continue to work with neighbors to address
concerns and the importance of the City’s policies to protect single family neighborhoods from
significant change, while finding opportunities for multi-family housing development along key
transit corridors and in the downtown area. In addition, city officials and developers can work to

                                                                                Housing Constraints
assuage these concerns by requiring design review, emphasizing management of new
developments, and engaging in public education to address myths about high density, low-
income, and supportive housing (HUD).5
4.4 Environmental & Infrastructure Constraints
South San Francisco is a largely developed community with sufficient infrastructure in place to
accommodate anticipated levels of development on most sites. A more detailed analysis of specific
sites is included in the review of Housing Opportunity sites. The City Engineer reports that there
are no significant issues related to the capacity of water, stormwater, or sewer systems that would
preclude future housing development as anticipated by the General Plan.
As a largely urbanized community, most housing sites in South San Francisco are infill in nature
and present few environmental issues. In recent years, developers of multi-family housing have
submitted Negative Declarations rather than EIRs for their projects, e.g., Park Station Lofts
development. An Environmental Impact Report was published to analyze the proposed
development under the Downtown Station Area Specific Plan, which contemplates a 25 percent
build out over a 20-year span.
Looking forward, certain sites in the downtown area are thought to have some level of
environmental contamination. Overall, such sites represent a small portion of the land available
for development in the City. These sites are discussed in more detail in the Housing Opportunity
sites section of this document.
4.5 Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and green
building features can contribute to reduced housing costs for homeowners and renters. In
addition, these efforts promote sustainable community design, reduced dependence on vehicles,
and can significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gases.
South San Francisco has been a leader in the promotion of green building techniques in new
residential construction and residential rehabilitation. The City renovated a formerly vacant
residential unit to transform it into a model demonstration project for green building materials
and techniques. This home is known as the Green X-Ray House and is used as an educational tool
for local homeowners and members of the local builders community to create healthier, more
energy-efficient homes.
At a minimum, new housing construction in South San Francisco must meet the standards
contained in Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations (Energy Efficiency Standards
for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings). These regulations were established in 1978 and
most recently updated in 2013 with amended standards going into effect in 2014. Energy

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
efficiency requirements are enforced by local governments through the building permit process.
All new construction must comply with the standards in effect on the date a building permit
application is made.
The City funds various minor housing rehabilitations programs using CDBG funds. As part of
these rehabilitation projects the City incorporates green retrofit improvements including
insulated windows, roof insulation, tankless water heaters, and other weatherization techniques.
Currently the City provides funding to CID (Center of Independence for Individuals with
Disabilities), Rebuilding Together Peninsula, and El Concilio of San Mateo County.
The City adopted a Green Building Ordinance, in line with the State standards, in 2014. This
ordinance applies to residential development as well as non-residential development and requires
new homes or substantial remodels to be constructed using sustainable building practices to
reduce environmental impacts. In addition to the design and construction of individual buildings,
the development industry is becoming increasingly aware of opportunities for energy
conservation at the site planning level and even at the community planning level. New
developments are increasingly being planned so that building orientations will take advantage of
passive solar energy benefits. Larger scale land use planning is increasingly considering benefits of
compact urban form (i.e., higher densities) as a means to reduce auto dependency for
transportation, and the benefits of mixed-use land use patterns to make neighborhoods more self-
contained so that residents can walk or bicycle to places of work, shopping, or other services.
Compact urban development patterns are also necessary to improve the effectiveness of buses and
other forms of public transit. If effective public transit is available and convenient, energy will be
conserved through reduced auto use. In the future, the City will consider incorporating these
and/or other sustainable development principles into new developments that are planned within
South San Francisco.
In addition, the City adopted a Climate Action Plan (CAP) in February 2014, which supports
these ideas as well. The CAP includes a Program of Reduction Strategies that promote energy
conservation. It also includes implementation tools that will be used by the City to track
greenhouse gas reductions. A Development Review Checklist will be used on a project-by-project
basis to track project-level contributions to the CAP target including energy conservation.

5        Housing Resources
5.1 Available Sites for Housing
The purpose of the adequate sites analysis is to demonstrate that the City of South San Francisco
has a sufficient amount of land to accommodate its fair share of the region’s housing needs during
this planning period. The State Government Code requires that the Housing Element include an
“inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having the
potential for redevelopment.” (Section 65583(a)(3)) It further requires that the Element analyze
zoning and infrastructure on these sites to ensure housing development is feasible during the
planning period.
Demonstrating an adequate supply of vacant or underutilized land is only part of the task of the
adequate sites analysis. The City must also show that this supply is capable of supporting housing
demand from all economic segments of the community and for various housing types, including
multi-family rental, manufactured housing, group housing, and transitional housing. High land
costs in the Bay Area make it difficult to meet the demand for affordable housing on sites that are
designated for low densities. The State has generally held that the most appropriate way to
demonstrate adequate capacity for low and very low income units is to provide land zoned for
multiple-family housing with an allowed density of 30 dwelling units per acre or more. Hence this
analysis focuses on the identification of sites that could accommodate this level of density, in
order to accommodate the need for lower-income housing units.
For the purposes of this analysis, housing sites in South San Francisco have been grouped into
two geographic areas. Each of these areas is described below, with accompanying maps and tables
to identify sites and quantify development potential. The following analysis of sites in South San
Francisco indicates the potential to develop 2,169 units of new housing with the adoption of the
Downtown Station Area Specific Plan (DSASP) (in February 2015).
Nearly all opportunity sites would support housing densities of 30 units per acre or greater,
providing favorable prospects for affordable units. As discussed before, the City has a determined
need of 1,864 units during the planning period. Compared against the RHNA, the City’s housing
opportunity sites offer a development capacity that exceeds the needs determination by more than
300 units.
                                                                                                  77

The available sites inventory conducted for the Housing Element focuses on sites with near-term
development potential, where the site is currently vacant, highly underutilized, or where
developers have come forward with plans to redevelop existing uses. There may be additional sites
in South San Francisco with housing potential, including individual vacant lots and developed
sites with marginally viable existing uses.
Approximately 80 percent of the City’s near-term residential development potential is in the
Transit Village area, which is already zoned for medium (30 dwelling units per acre) to high (120
dwelling units per acre) density residential development.
Almost 20 percent of near-term residential development potential is in the Downtown area.The
City was engaged in preparation of the DSASP over the past two years, and it was adopted in
February 2015. The DSASP focuses on properties within 0.5 mile of the City’s Caltrain station.
The overarching aim of the Plan is to create a successful and vibrant downtown, including new
high-density, mixed-use development in areas that are best poised to take advantage of improved
access to the City’s Caltrain station and SamTrans bus routes; affirming the historic Grand
Avenue Corridor as the focus of the community; and providing improved connections to the East
of Highway 101 employment district. The DSASP includes pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly
upgrades, landscaped green spaces, widened sidewalks, new streets, and mass transit connections
designed to improve the business and residential quality of life in the City. The DSASP is a twenty
year policy document that is intended to govern development in the Downtown area. Under the
new Plan, residential development potential in the Downtown area has increased to 60 dwelling
units per acre, with up to 100 dwelling unit per acre allowed depending on the zoning district.
FARs have increased to range from 3.0 to 6.0 depending on the zoning district.
TRANSIT VILLAGE SITES
The Transit Village is located in the heart of South San Francisco, and it is well connected with to
transit services, regional crossroads, and I-280. This area has been a focus of some of the City’s
recent planning efforts, in support of the General Plan’s vision of the area as a distinct, vibrant
district and a regional destination. With the adoption of the BART Transit Village Plan in 2001,
the City of South San Francisco established zoning standards and design guidelines to promote a
vibrant mixed-use district consistent with the area’s role as an important transit hub. A key
element of the plan was to up zone various parcels to allow for more intensive residential
development, and since the plan’s adoption, much housing has been built in the area. Additional
regulations were adopted in 2010 for a specific area in the Transit Village; the South El Camino
Real General Plan Amendment, Zoning, and Design Guidelines targeted higher intensities and
mixed-use development in the Transit Village area along El Camino Real.
78

                                                                                Housing Resources
The City adopted the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan in 2011, which focused on
another area within the Transit Village. This plan provided specific principles, policies, design
standards and guidelines, and recommendations for implementation to guide the development of
the area into a vibrant, mixed use district. It included locations for land uses, a classification
system, density/intensity standards, and total development potential for each land use type. This
plan included detailed block-by-block development projections for a focus area in the Transit
Village to determine probable environmental impacts and infrastructure needs, but they were not
adopted as part of the plan. To the extent that any future development project is consistent with
the plan’s land use designations and development intensities and standards, any necessary
environmental review will be limited to site-specific impacts, rather than cumulative and area-
wide impacts (which were fully evaluated in the program EIR prepared on the plan).
Many of the sites in and around the Transit Village area are vacant or underutilized parcels that
present an excellent opportunity for housing development. The sites are composed of
combinations of vacant and underutilized parcels, and the table that follows takes their current
status into account in determining realistic capacity. The fact that many of these sites are owned
by a single entity makes them especially good candidates for housing development during the
planning period. The largest property owners in the area are the City, Kaiser Permanente, and
BART. Listed in Table 5.1-2 and shown in Figure 2, these five sites in the Transit Village contain
16.9 acres of land with combined capacity for 1,731 units of housing.
                                                                                                79

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
Capacity Analysis
This section contains analysis of the realistic development capacity of the five housing
opportunity sites in the Transit Village area. This analysis considers factors including vacant and
underutilized site status, recent regulatory changes and development trends, lot size, physical
constraints, and infrastructure.
The Zoning Ordinance was updated in 2010 and includes four districts specific to the Transit
Village area: Transit Village Commercial (TV-C), Transit Village Retail (TV-R), Transit Village
Residential High Density (TV-RH), and Transit Village Residential Medium Density (TV-RM).
One key housing opportunity site is in the TV-RM district. The High Density Residential (RH-30)
district covers one key housing site in the Transit Village area as well.
In addition, the El Camino Real/Chestnut District in the updated Zoning Ordinance provides
regulations, standards, and development review procedures to implement the El Camino
Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan. There are several sub districts in this zone: the El Camino
Real/Chestnut Mixed-Use Medium Density District (ECR/C-MXM), the El Camino
Real/Chestnut Mixed-Use High Density District (ECR/C-MXH), and the El Camino Real
Residential High Density District (ECR/C-RH). The ECR/C-MXH and ECR/C-RH districts
include three key housing sites in the Transit Village area.
The five key housing sites in the Transit Village total 16.9 acres and would accommodate 1,731
housing units.
Transit Village Residential Medium Density Zone
The TV-RM district permits multi-unit residential uses, with a maximum density of 30 units per
acre. The minimum site area per unit is 1,500 square feet and the maximum lot coverage is 75
percent. Setbacks of 5 feet on the side and 10 feet on the street side are required, as is a rear yard.
There are also controls over the pedestrian orientation and vehicle accommodations.
Site 1 is the housing site located in the TV-RM zone. It is composed of two parcels: one is 0.1
acres in size and has a vacant single family home, and one is 1.5 acres in size and is vacant. The
low density residential district RL-8 is adjacent to Site 1. At the TV-RM density of 30 units per
acre, Site 1 can comfortably accommodate 47 units.
El Camino Real/Chestnut District
The ECR/C-MXH designates sites for mixed-use development at high intensities, and it permits
single-unit attached and multi-unit residential development, except at the ground floor level
along key rights-of-way. The maximum FAR is 2.0, but can increase to 3.0 with the incentive
program. The maximum residential density is 80 units per acre, and the maximum can increase to
110 units per acre with the incentive program. There is no minimum residential density in the
ECR/C-MXH zone.
The ECR/C-RH zone provides for high density residential development in the form of high rises
and townhomes near the BART station. It permits single-unit attached and multi-unit residential
development, and it has no minimum or maximum FAR. The minimum residential density is 80
units per acre, and the maximum density is 120 units per acre, and up to 180 units per acre with
the incentive program.

                                                                                    Housing Resources
The building envelopes for both the ECR/C-MXH and ECR/C-RH zones are controlled by
minimum and maximum street wall heights, front building setbacks, and build-to lines.
Minimum setbacks apply to building walls with windows and facing side or rear yards, to provide
light and air for residential units. The maximum lot coverage is 90 percent for both zones, and
maximum tower dimension is 125 feet, with a minimum separation of 30 feet between towers.
Site 2 is 5.7 acres and is composed of three parcels, which are each zoned ECR/C-MXH. Two of
the parcels are vacant, while another is occupied by a lumber yard. Eighty dwelling units are
allowed per acre in this zone, and Site 2 would accommodate 456 residential units.
Site 3 was included in the Focus Area of the El Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan. Detailed
development projections were calculated for the Focus Area block-by-block, based on the
application of land use, density, and intensity regulations. This Housing Element relies on those
block-by-block projections for the build out assumptions. Site 3 is composed of seven parcels; six
are zoned ECR/C-MXH, while one is zoned ECR/C-RH. Together, these parcels total 7.6 acres
and would comfortably accommodate 1,113 housing units.
Site 5 contains one parcel that is 1.7 acres and zoned ECR/C-MXH, and it would accommodate
108 units.
Together, Sites 2, 3, and 5 in the ECR/C District would accommodate 1,677 units.
RH-30 Zone
The RH-30 is a residential zoning district that provides for high residential density at 30 units per
acre, with no minimum or maximum FAR. Single unit dwellings and multi-unit dwellings are
permitted in the RH-30 zone. The maximum building height is 50 feet, with a maximum of 4
building stories. Setbacks are required on all sides of the building. The maximum lot coverage is
65 percent is allowed. The only site in the Transit Village in the RH-30 zone, Site 4 is a small
parcel of 0.3 acres and is currently occupied by utilities. It is adjacent to multi-family residential
uses, and it is expected to accommodate 7 housing units.
Ownership
Publicly-Owned. Sites 3 and 5 were owned by the City’s Redevelopment Agency before it was
dismantled in 2012. In the Long Range Property Management Plan, the dissolution plan of the
City’s Redevelopment Agency, a number of the properties have been transferred to the City’s
Successor Agency, including Sites 3 and 5. These sites are among the best near-term opportunities
for housing development in South San Francisco, as they are primarily vacant and have been
identified for future housing and mixed-use development through the General Plan, the El
Camino Real/Chestnut Avenue Area Plan, and the Zoning Ordinance. The City has expressed an
intention and willingness to sell them in order to realize residential mixed-use development on
the sites. In total these sites measure 9.5 acres with a capacity for 1,215 dwelling units.
Privately-Owned. Site 2 is owned by Kaiser Permanente Medical Center. This site is composed of
three parcels and is currently occupied by a vacant motel, a lumberyard, and a vacant lot. Site 1 is
privately owned.
                                                                                               83

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
Environmental and Infrastructure Analysis
There are no known environmental issues that would limit development of the identified sites in
the Transit Village area. Recent residential developments in the area have submitted negative
declarations. The sites are outside of the airport noise contours, and no sites in the area are listed
with the State as having known or potential contamination.1 Periodic flooding occurs in certain
areas along Colma Creek in South San Francisco, which runs through the Transit Village;
however, improvement projects in this area have greatly reduced the concern of flooding, such
that it is not an issue that would limit development in this area.
The City Engineer has confirmed that infrastructure in the area is sufficient to support identified
levels of development, including the capacity of sewer, water, and wastewater treatment facilities.
As is common practice in the City, developers may be required to pay for intersection or other
infrastructure improvements to offset project-specific impacts.
DOWNTOWN SITES
Downtown South San Francisco is situated just west of Highway 101 and has retained a historic
character with fine-grained, mixed-use development. The City’s General Plan seeks to reinforce
the Downtown’s identity and role as the physical and symbolic center of South San Francisco.
General Plan strategies include increased residential development in the Downtown and better
connections to surrounding areas. The comprehensive Zoning Ordinance update has provided
zoning districts and development regulations to support this vision. Much of the Downtown
neighborhood is located within a half-mile of the City’s Caltrain commuter rail station, which is
located on the east side of Highway 101. As discussed above, the City adopted the DSASP in
February 2015, which identifies further development opportunities and allows higher densities.
The City’s historic Downtown area encompasses a range of underutilized publicly- and privately-
owned parcels that are suitable for either mixed-use or residential development. Even before
adoption of the DSASP, through the comprehensive Zoning Ordinance update in 2010 and
related efforts, the City has paved the way for housing on key parcels in the Downtown area in
keeping with the long-term goal of creating a vibrant and sustainable urban center. The DSASP
will continue to support those goals and will enhance this vision further. For this Housing
Element, the City has identified 12 key sites in the Downtown with near-term redevelopment
potential. The sites are composed of combinations of vacant and underutilized parcels, and the
table that follows takes their current status into account in determining realistic capacity. Listed
below in Table 5.1-3 and shown in Figure 3, all of these sites are owned by the City of South San
Francisco Successor Agency. In total, these sites represent 6.1 acres with a combined development
capacity for 438 units under the DSASP.

Capacity Analysis
This section contains an analysis of the realistic development capacity of housing opportunity
sites in the Downtown area. This analysis considers factors including vacant and underutilized
status, recent development trends, lot size, physical constraints, and infrastructure.
Under the DSASP adopted in February 2015, there are four new districts that cover the
Downtown opportunity sites identified in Figure 9: Linden Neighborhood Center, Downtown
Transit Core, Downtown Residential Core, and the Grand Avenue Core. Two of the sites would
be in the Linden Neighborhood Center, seven of the sites would be in the Downtown Transit
Core, two of the sites would be in the Downtown Residential Core, and one of the sites would be
in the Grand Avenue Core. In total, the opportunity sites total approximately 6.1 acres and would
accommodate 438 housing units.
Downtown Transit Core
The Downtown Transit Core (DTC) district allows for multi-unit residential construction, with a
minimum density of 80 units per acre and a maximum density of 100 units. The minimum FAR is
2.0 and the maximum FAR is 6.0. Within the DTC district, the main development standards
controlling the building envelope are maximum lot coverage of 100 percent and a maximum
building height of 85 feet. There is no setback requirement except for lots that abut a residential
district, which requires a 10 foot setback.
Sites 8, 11, and 13-17 are individual parcels or groups of assembled parcels that range from 0.2
acres to 1.1 acres in size in the DTC district. Surface parking lots or vacant buildings occupy many
of the sites, and no site is adjacent to a residential zoning district. Site 14 and Site 16 are adjacent
to the Public/Quasi Public District on Airport Boulevard. Based on the following development
standards for Site 17, which is representative of the sites in the DTC district, all of the sites in the
DTC district could comfortably accommodate approximately 80 dwelling units per acre:
     •    Lot size: 0.2 acres or 7,596 square feet
     •    Minimum Setback Requirement: 0 feet (No abutting of Residential districts)
     •    FAR: 6.0
     •    Maximum Building Size: 45,576 square feet (Lot size multiplied by FAR)
     •    Gross Residential Square Footage: 31,903 square feet (Assumes 70 percent of building is
          residential)
     •    Net Residential Square Footage: 22,332 square feet (Assumes 70 percent of gross
          residential square footage, with 30 percent of gross residential space devoted to common
          spaces)
     •    Average Unit Size: 1,400 square feet (Typical for a two-bedroom unit)
     •    Expected Number of Units: 16 units (Net residential square footage divided by average
          unit size)
     •    Maximum Density: 80 units per acre (Lot size divided by number of units)
                                                                                                  89

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
When this density is applied to all of the sites in the DTC district, 302 housing units could be
accommodated in the zone.
Downtown Residential Core
The Downtown Residential Core district (DRC) allows for multi-family residential construction.
The maximum FAR is 3.0, exclusive of structured parking. A minimum of 40 residential units per
acre is required, with a maximum density of 80 units per acre (up to 100 or 125 under the
incentive program). The main development standards controlling the building envelope are
maximum lot coverage of 90 percent and maximum building height of 65 feet. Setbacks are
required in the rear yard (20-foot setback) and when the lot abuts a residential district (10-foot
setback on the interior side).
Sites 9 and 10 are existing parking lots in the DRC district near City Hall in Downtown. These
sites are adjacent to residential and hotel uses. Site 9 is about 0.3 acres, while Site 10 is composed
of several smaller lots totaling 0.6 acres. Under the current density standards for the DRC district,
it is estimated that Site 9 would accommodate 19 units, while Site 10 would accommodate 38
units.
Linden Neighborhood Center
The Linden Neighborhood Center district (LNC) allows for multi-family residential construction
(except on the ground floor), with a minimum density of 40 units per acre and a maximum
density of 60 units per acre. The maximum FAR is 3.0 for development, exclusive of structured
parking. Within the LNC district, the main development standards controlling the building
envelope are maximum lot coverage of 90 percent and a maximum building height of 50 feet.
There are no setback requirements.
Both in the LNC Zone, Site 6 is a vacant lot and Site 7 is a surface parking lot. These sites are
corner lots at the intersection of Pine and Linden avenues, each situated on opposite sides of Pine
Avenue. These lots are adjacent to existing single and multi-family homes. Each site is about
13,000 square feet, and under the current density standards for the LNC Zone, it is estimated that
each site would accommodate 14 units.
Grand Avenue Corridor
The Grand Avenue Corridor district (GAC) allows for multi-family residential construction
(except on the ground floor). The required minimum density is 14 units per acre, with a
maximum density of 60 units per acre. The maximum FAR is 3.0 for development, exclusive of
structured parking, and the minimum required FAR is 1.5. The main development standards
controlling the building envelope in the GAC district are maximum lot coverage of 100 percent
and a maximum building height ranging from 45 to 65 feet. There are no setback requirements.
Site 12 is in the GAC district and is composed of multiple sites, which are currently vacant,
parking lots, or occupied by a commercial building. a vacant lot and Site 7 is a surface parking lot.
These lots are on Grand Avenue, which is intended to be the “main street” of Downtown. These
lots are adjacent to commercial uses, and they total about 0.8 acres. Under the current density
standards for the GAC district, it is estimated that Site 12 would accommodate 51 units.

                                                                                 Housing Resources
Ownership
Publicly-Owned. Many of these sites were owned by the City’s Redevelopment Agency before it
was dismantled in 2012. In the Long Range Property Management Plan, Sites 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15,
16, and 17 have been transferred to the City’s Successor Agency for ownership. These sites are
among the best near-term opportunities for housing development in South San Francisco. Sites 8,
9, 10, and 13 in the Downtown are owned by the City of South San Francisco. Under the DSASP,
the goals support creating a vibrant, transit-supportive, diverse downtown, and these sites can
provide opportunities for dense housing construction to contribute to the vitality of downtown.
These sites fall into three categories: vacant, occupied by surface parking lots, or occupied by
vacant buildings. Regardless of their present state, these sites have been identified for future
housing and mixed-use development through the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, as well as
in the DSASP. The City has expressed an intention and willingness to sell them in order to realize
residential and mixed-use development on the sites. In total, these sites measure 6.1 acres with a
capacity for 438 dwelling units under the DSASP.
Environmental and Infrastructure Analysis
The Downtown area is outside of the airport noise contours and any flooding hazard zones.
However, certain sites within the Downtown area have been suspected of environmental
contamination, which may require clean up, in order to facilitate housing development. These
include Site 14, which has undergone Phase I Environmental Site Assessments; Site 16, which has
undergone Phase I and II Environmental Site Assessments; and Sites 6 and 7, which have not
undergone environmental site assessments.
As with the Transit Village area, the City Engineer indicated that infrastructure in the Downtown
area is sufficient to support identified levels of development, including the capacity of sewer,
water, and wastewater treatment facilities.
In the past, one obstacle to development of public parking lots has been the need to first develop a
replacement garage. The City opened such a project, the Miller Avenue Garage, in 2010, thus
creating the potential for the redevelopment of City-owned parking lots in this planning period.
ANALYSIS OF ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE VARIOUS HOUSING TYPES
As described, housing opportunity sites in the Transit Village and Downtown areas are able to
accommodate a range of housing types.
     •   Lower Income Multi-family Residential. Nearly all sites identified can realistically
         accommodate densities of 30 dwelling units per acre or greater, which is a level of density
         that the State acknowledges is consistent with providing lower-income multi-family
         housing. Thirty dwelling units per acre is the “default density” assigned by HCD to
         jurisdictions with more than 25,000 people in San Mateo County. Housing sites that are
         zoned for a minimum of 30 dwelling units per acre are assumed to be able to
         accommodate lower-income housing.
     •   Residential Care Facilities, including Supportive Housing. This housing type would be
         permitted with conditional use permits and minor use permits on the housing
         opportunity site identified in the Transit Village area in the RH-30 zone and in the
         Downtown area sites in the DC and DMX zones.
                                                                                              91

South San Francisco Housing Element Update
April 2015
    •    Elderly and Long-term Care Facilities. These facilities would be permitted with a
         conditional use permit on the housing opportunity site in the Transit Village area located
         in RH-30 zone.
    •    Transitional Housing. As part of the Zoning Ordinance update, the City explicitly
         addressed transitional and supportive housing to assure it is allowed subject only to those
         restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. Thus,
         transitional housing would be a permitted use on all of the housing opportunity sites.
    •    Group Residential. Consistent with the Zoning Ordinance, Group Residential uses
         would be permitted with a Minor Use Permit in the RH-30 zone in the Transit Village
         and the DMX zone in the Downtown area. Group Residential is a broad category
         encompassing housing that is occupied by persons not defined as a family on a weekly or
         longer basis.
ANALYSIS OF ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE EMERGENCY SHELTER
FACILITIES
In accordance with the State Planning and Zoning Law, the City already has satisfied
requirements regarding emergency shelters by providing an existing emergency shelter facility
within its jurisdiction that can accommodate more than the City’s individual need for emergency
shelter space (see Gov’t Code, § 65583(a)(4)(C)). South San Francisco’s existing emergency shelter
provides 90 beds, accounting for more than half of emergency shelter capacity countywide. In
addition, as part of the Zoning Ordinance Update, the City identified the Mixed Industrial (MI)
district as a zone in the City where an emergency shelter would be permitted as an allowed use,
subject only to the same development standards applicable to other uses in the zone. Emergency
shelter facilities are also permitted with a Minor Use Permit in the Business Commercial district.
The MI combines the City’s previous industrial zoning districts to provide an area that is
appropriate for a range of uses, including manufacturing and related uses, small-scale retail and
service uses, live-work uses, and social service uses. The western portion of the MI district, west of
101, is adjacent to the City’s Downtown area, which allows residential, commercial, and retail
uses. The eastern portion of the MI district is adjacent to Business Commercial, Business
Technology Park, Freeway Commercial, and Public/Quasi Public districts. The City’s existing
shelter is located immediately adjacent to the MI district on a parcel zoned as Public/Quasi
Public, where the zoning does not allow new emergency shelters, but allows existing emergency
shelters to remain.
Adjacent to the Downtown, the MI district is situated near a full range of retail services and is
located near existing social service providers, including the San Mateo County Human Services
Office, Salvation Army, the St. Vincent De Paul Society, and the North Peninsula Neighborhood
Services office. Moreover, the district is served by several public transit routes, providing good
accessibility to local and regional destinations.
The MI district is large and provides numerous sites that are underutilized and could potentially
accommodate an emergency shelter. Conversations with commercial brokers in South San
Francisco indicate that there are several industrial properties for sale in the district, many of
which are marketed as “redevelopment opportunities.” This finding was confirmed through a
search of the LoopNet.com website, a commercial listing service for properties for sale, which
92

                                                                                      Housing Resources
showed multiple properties for sale with substantial additional built out potential or potential to
replace warehouse buildings with different uses.
A more detailed capacity analysis of sites in the MI district reveals that there are numerous vacant
and underutilized sites that could potentially be redeveloped with an emergency shelter. The
Needs Assessment in Chapter 3 determined that the unsheltered homeless population in South
San Francisco is 172 people. The existing emergency shelter in South San Francisco has 90 beds
and is in a single-story building that is estimated to be about 8,600 square feet in size. Thus, two
additional shelters of the same size as the existing shelter would be needed to provide beds for the
city’s unsheltered homeless population. Under current development standards in the MI district,
an additional emergency shelter that is the same size as the city’s existing shelter would fit
comfortably on a parcel that is about a half-acre in size. Table 5.1-4 shows the current vacant and
underutilized parcels in the MI district that could potentially be redeveloped with an emergency
shelter and accommodate the city’s need for two additional shelters.

5.2 Financial Resources
The City of South San Francisco has access to a variety of existing and potential funding sources
available for affordable housing activities, including programs from federal, State, local and
private resources.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM FUNDS
Through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, the U.S Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides funds to local governments for a wide range
of housing and community development activities for low-income persons.
Based on previous allocations, South San Francisco expects to receive approximately $2.8 million
in CDBG funds during the 2014 to 2022 period. In accordance with the policies established by the
City Council, South San Francisco is committed to increasing and maintaining affordable housing
in the City. CDBG funds can be used for site acquisition, rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer
                                                                                                   93

April 2015
assistance, emergency and transitional shelters, and fair housing/housing counseling activities.
Additionally, funds can be used for activities that support the new construction of affordable
housing such as site clearance and the financing of related infrastructure and public facility
improvements.
HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP ACT FUNDS
The HOME Investment Partnership Act authorized by Congress in 1991 under the National
Affordable Housing Act provides a source of federal financing for a variety of affordable housing
projects. The City of South San Francisco is a participating jurisdiction in the San Mateo County
HOME Consortium and is eligible to apply for funding from the Consortium’s annual grant
allocation. Funds are distributed on a competitive basis through a request for proposals process
administered by San Mateo County. HOME funds may be used by the City for direct expenditure
or may be issued as low-interest loans to a private or not-for-profit developer to jointly undertake
the production of housing units that will be affordable to low-income residents. Under the
program, 30-year rent regulatory restrictions are recorded with the property to ensure future
affordability.
HEART
South San Francisco is a member of the Housing Endowment and Regional Trust (HEART),
which raises funds from public and private sources to meet critical housing needs in San Mateo
County. Formed in 2003 as a public/private partnership among the cities, the County, and the
business, nonprofit, education, and labor communities, to date, HEART has received over $12
million in funding gifts and pledges to meet critical housing needs in San Mateo County.
LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS
Created by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) program
has been used in combination with City and other resources to encourage the construction and
rehabilitation of rental housing for lower-income households. The program allows investors an
annual tax credit over a ten-year period, provided that the housing meets the following minimum
low-income occupancy requirements: 20 percent of the units must be affordable to households at
50 percent of area median income (AMI), or 40 percent of the units must be affordable to those at
60 percent of AMI. The total credit over the ten-year period has a present value equal to 70
percent of the qualified construction and rehabilitation expenditure. The tax credit is typically
sold to large investors at a syndication value.
SECTION 8 ASSISTANCE
The Section 8 program is a federal program that provides rental assistance to very-low income
persons in need of affordable housing. This program offers a voucher that pays the difference
between the current fair market rent and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g. 30 percent of their
gross income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may cost above the payment
standard but the tenant must pay the extra cost. This program is administered by the San Mateo
County Housing Authority.

5.3 Summary
Consistent with the City’s long-term commitment to supporting high-quality residential
development, South San Francisco continues to make resources available for housing production.
These include primarily sites for housing development, and a variety of funding sources, as
summarized below:
    •   South San Francisco has an adequate number of sites to accommodate its share of the
        regional housing need in the planning period. The City has no carryover obligation
        because it was able to identify adequate sites to meet its RHNA for the 2007-2014
        Housing Element. There is sufficient land to support the production of 2,169 new
        housing units.
    •   Nearly all of the City’s development capacity consists of higher density housing sites
        (densities exceeding 30 units per acre), and all are located within developed areas already
        served with needed infrastructure, including sewer, water, stormwater, and
        transportation facilities.
    •   The City’s housing capacity is found primarily in two areas: the Transit Village and the
        Downtown area.
    •   South San Francisco has a variety of financial resources to support affordable housing
        production.
                                                                                             95

6        Housing Plan
Based on the needs, constraints and resources identified above, the following section of the
Housing Element sets forth South San Francisco’s housing plan for the 2015 to 2023 planning
period. The City has established this plan in consideration of its own local needs and priorities, as
well as its obligations under State Housing Element law.
The Housing Plan is structured as a series of goals and related implementing policies.
Accompanying each implementing policy are one or more programs that the City will implement
over the 2015 to 2023 planning period. These programs are summarized in an eight-year Action
Plan, which presents the programs together with implementing agencies, funding sources and
time frames for implementation. Finally, the Housing Plan sets forth quantified objectives for
housing construction, rehabilitation and conservation for the Housing Element planning period.
The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of goals, policies, implementation
programs, and quantified objectives as they are used in the Housing Element.
Goal: Ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature.
Implementing Policies: Specific statement guiding action and implying clear commitment.
Program: An action, procedure, program, or technique that carries out policy. Implementation
programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the action and an estimated time
frame for its accomplishment. The time frame indicates the calendar year in which the activity is
scheduled to be completed. These time frames are general guidelines and may be adjusted based
on City staffing and budgetary considerations.
Quantified Objective: The number of housing units that the City expects to be constructed,
conserved, or rehabilitated, and the number of households the City expects will be assisted
through Housing Element programs based on general market conditions during the timeframe of
the Housing Element. Quantified objectives for the housing plan overall are summarized in a
table at the end of this chapter, rather than being attributed to individual policies or programs.
