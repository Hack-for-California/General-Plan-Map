* There is overwhelming opposition in
Area D to roadway construction in the
West Valley Right-of-Way Corridor.
Light rail transportation should be
considered. Since almost all of the
corridor land has been acquired in
Saratoga, Area D supports pedestrian
pathways and bicycle trails and city park
sites. Unified pedestrian-bicycle access
could extend from Quito Road to
Prospect Road, passing through Areas C,
D, and E by using the corridor.

AREA K – GUIDELINES FOR AREA
DEVELOPMENT
1. The City should re-stripe the
crosswalks at McCoy and Quito and
Paseo Lado and Quito.
2. The City should study the feasibility
of painting a center turn lane down
Quito Road through this area. If it is
determined that such a center turn lane
will indeed increase traffic flow and
safety on Quito, such a lane should be
installed.       Staff should study the
feasibility of a left hand turn lane on
Quito for left hand turns on to Paseo
Lado.
3. The side of Quito Road should be
beautified through regular maintenance
of the existing landscaping and the
addition of new landscaping.             The
present bicycle path should be repaved.
Quito Road should be designated as a
heritage land from approximately
Saratoga-Los Gatos Road to Pollard
Road. No major improvements (street
widening) to Quito Road from Saratoga
Avenue to Pollard Road should be
allowed except for alterations needed for
public safety.

     It is the intent of the City that the emphasis on maintaining the character of

 and furthered by the goals, policies and implementation measures presented in the
 Year 2010 Circulation and Scenic Highway Element Update. Additionally, it is the
 intent of the City that the mandate expressed by the citizens of Saratoga to control
density, traffic, and noise be affirmed, preserved and furthered by the goals, policies
and implementation measures presented in this document. The City also pledges to :
      1) improve the transportation system by balancing the needs of bicyclists,
    pedestrians, and transit users with considerations for safe vehicular travel, 2)
promote a healthy and active community by providing transportation opportunities
for bicyclist and pedestrians, and 3) be a responsible partner in developing regional
       transportation solutions. Where any inconsistency or conflict appears in
interpreting this document, the strong value that Saratogans place on the character
             of the City shall weigh heavily in the resolution of such conflict.

Rail Service
The City is currently served by a single rail
line that extends generally parallel to SR 85
between Prospect Road and Quito Road. The
rail line crosses six streets in Saratoga with
one grade-separation (Saratoga Road), four
at-grade crossings with gates (Prospect Road,
Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road, Glen Brae Drive
and Quito Road), and one at-grade crossing
with lights but no gates (Cox Avenue).
The railroad is currently operated by Union
Pacific Company and is only used by the
Lehigh Permanente Quarry and Cement Plant
(formerly Kaiser-Permanente). Trains run
between Milpitas and the Quarry on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 9:00
am, and the trains return at around 2:00 pm.
Trains do not stop within the City and do not
substantially impact vehicular traffic.

restricted the methods by which jurisdictions
can require TDM measures for
developments. Typically, TDM measures are
included as part of a project through the
development agreement process for new
projects or through approval of use permit

City strongly supports methods that decrease
the overall vehicle travel demand and
encourages residents and employees to
maximize the use of TDM measures.

Background
The existing low-density residential land use
pattern combined with a limited amount of
commercial support services, entertainment
centers, and employment centers do not
strongly support the need for a complex
transit system. However, expanded transit
service is needed to provide transportation
opportunities for all residents and is an
important alternative to automobile use. The
use and expansion of other alternative
modes, including bicycling and walking, is
another key issue for providing a
comprehensive Citywide transportation
system. This approach is consistent with
other County, regional, and statewide efforts
to increase the use of non-automobile modes
to create more sustainable communities and
reduce the amount of pollutants and
greenhouse gases emitted.
The “backbone” of the City’s roadway
network is a set of major and minor arterial
roadways that provide the link between
neighborhoods and the City’s commercial
services, and also the regional freeway
system. Local and residential collector
streets represent the rural nature of Saratoga.
The pattern and design of local streets help
to shape the image and identity of

                      Santa Clara County Congestion Management Program (which are held to a
                      LOS E standard), and as otherwise specified pursuant to Policy 2.4.
      CI-Policy-2.4   Accept Level of Service E or F operations on City-maintained roadways
                      after finding that: 1) no practical and feasible improvements can be
                      implemented to mitigate the lower levels of service, or 2) vehicle capacity
                      enhancements would conflict with existing or planned bicycle, pedestrian,
                      or transit facilities and services. A proposed development that exacerbates
                      LOS E or F operations and causes a significant intersection impact should
                      also be considered for approval if it will provide a clear, overall benefit to
                      the City (e.g., library expansion or relocation, new community center).
      CI-Policy-2.5   Ensure that new development or redevelopment projects provide adequate
                      property dedication to accommodate future roadway and multi-modal
                      access improvements at key intersections and other potential conflict
                      areas.

      CI-Policy-2.7  Align and design collector streets to minimize adverse impacts on the
                     character of residential neighborhoods through which they pass, while
                     functioning efficiently to collect and distribute traffic.
      CI-Policy-2.8  Design new local streets to reduce travel distance, promote alternative
                     modes, and provide a more even distribution of traffic.
      CI-Policy-2.9  Establish the primary access for major traffic generators on arterial
                     roadways and design overall access to minimize traffic intrusion to
                     residential neighborhoods.
      CI-Policy-2.10 Strive to maintain traffic volumes and speeds on collector and local streets
                     that are compatible with the character of the adjacent land uses, the
                     function of the street, and bicycle and pedestrian access.
      CI-Policy-2.11 Protect the integrity of and improve existing hillside streets by planning
                     future development according to existing street function.
      CI-Policy-2.12 Focus future improvements on the most congested intersections to
                     maintain an acceptable level of mobility for all modes of transportation.
      CI-Policy-2.13 Require development projects to mitigate and reduce their respective
                     traffic and parking impacts by implementing practical and feasible street
                     improvements to improve multi-modal access.
      CI-Policy-2.14 Coordinate with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)
                     to comply with the Congestion Management Program (CMP) Guidelines
                     for CMP-designated facilities. Should the CMP-designated facilities
                     degrade below the CMP standard of Level of Service E, the City will
                     prepare a Deficiency Plan for the deficient facilities per the VTA’s
                     requirements.

      CI-Action-2.4 Install coordinated signal systems on all major arterial roadways in the
                     City to improve traffic flow as appropriate. Funding should be obtained
                     from all available City, County, State and Federal funding sources, and
                     developer contributions.
      CI-Action-2.5 Evaluate the need for upgrading or enhancing intersection control (e.g.,
                     signalization, stop signs) at existing intersections on arterial roadways and
                     collector streets to improve overall access and circulation.
      CI-Action-2.6 Install traffic signals to serve existing and projected traffic demand,
                     provide acceptable traffic operations issues, and enhance pedestrian safety.
      CI-Action-2.7 Require a transportation analysis for all development projects resulting in
                     25 or more net new peak-hour trips. As appropriate, the analysis shall
                     identify potential impacts to intersection and roadway operations, project
                     access, and alternative travel modes, and shall identify feasible
                     improvements or project modifications to reduce or eliminate impacts.
                     City staff shall have the discretion to only require focused studies
                     regarding access, sight distance, and other operational and safety issues, or
                     to require detailed studies that generate fewer peak hour trips.
      CI-Action-2.8 Evaluate development proposals and design roadway improvements based
                     on established Level of Service standards without negatively affecting
                     travel by other modes, and to be in conformance with Valley
                     Transportation Agency’s Bicycle Technical Guide.
      CI-Action-2.9 Require that roadway improvements identified as mitigation measures for
                     development projects be in place prior to issuance of occupancy permits.
      CI-Action-2.10 Require new development or redevelopment projects to dedicate property
                     to accommodate needed roadway improvements.
      CI-Action-2.11 Identify potential capacity improvements and access modifications to

      CI-Action-2.14 Design local streets to carry low traffic volumes at low speeds and to
                       function safely while minimizing the need for traffic control devices or
                       enforcement. Physical features should include gentle curves, changes of
                       grade, narrow widths, short lengths, and T-intersections where feasible.
      CI-Action-2.15 Design streets to minimize impacts to topography, riparian habitats and
                       wildlife corridors.
      CI-Action-2.16 Implement the action programs identified in the Hillside Specific Plan to
                       provide adequate vehicular access consistent with CI-Policy-2.11. Where
                       feasible, improvements will include widening of travel lanes, increasing
                       vertical clearance, installing additional signs, and providing new pavement
                       overlays to improve safety.
TRUCK TRANSPORTATION
Goal
CI.3    Limit the intrusion of commercial truck traffic on streets within the City.
Policies
      CI-Policy-3.1    Require trucks to only use the designated routes shown on Figure C-3
                       unless making a local delivery.
      CI-Policy-3.2    Encourage or require deliveries to be made during off-peak periods (i.e.,
                       outside the morning and evening commute periods), especially in areas
                       where intersections or roadways operate at LOS E or F during the peak
                       periods.
Implementation Actions
      CI-Action-3.1    Continue to strictly enforce the truck route ordinance by citing violators.
      CI-Action-3.2    Require as part of project approval for new projects with regular truck
                       deliveries that such deliveries be made outside the typical peak commute
                       travel periods (e.g., 7:00 am to 9:00 am and 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm) as
                       appropriate.

                       loading zones at other times.
      CI-Action-3.4    Require new or redevelopment projects to provide on-site truck loading
                       areas except for areas such as the Village with small commercial lots.
                       Enforcement will be provided by the Sheriff’s Department similar to other
                       on-street parking areas in the City.
TRANSIT
Goals
CI.4a          Promote local and regional transit as a viable alternative to automobile travel for
               destinations within and outside the City.
CI.4b          Promote the use of non-automobile modes of transportation by improving the
               capacity, safety, accessibility, and convenience of existing and planned transit,
               bicycle and pedestrian systems.
Policies
      CI-Policy-4.1    Coordinate with the Valley Transportation Authority to increase service
                       range and frequency within the City per VTA’s Transit Sustainability
                       Policy. Existing service is illustrated on Figure C-4.
      CI-Policy-4.2    Install transit improvements to improve service, increase safety, and
                       maintain traffic flow on streets serving as transit routes.
      CI-Policy-4.3    Encourage the public school districts, private schools, recreation groups or
                       other operators to develop a local bus system and to expand ride-sharing
                       activities that will help to reduce school-generated vehicle traffic in
                       neighborhoods and on City streets. Bussing should be one of the first
                       measures considered, along with walking and biking, to reduce school-
                       generated traffic before substantial roadway capacity enhancements are
                       implemented.
      CI-Policy-4.4    Investigate the feasibility of a local shuttle service within Saratoga to
                       reduce local traffic volumes on City streets and overall parking demand.
                       The feasibility study shall identify potential routes and funding sources.
Implementation Actions
        CI-Action-4.1 Require development projects to dedicate right-of-way for purposes of
                       constructing bus turnouts and/or bus shelter pads on major and minor
                       arterial roadways as appropriate.

        CI-Action-4.2 In coordination with the VTA, provide seating and shaded waiting areas at
                       transit stops, with stop locations near entrances of buildings to encourage
                       ridership.
        CI-Action-4.3 Coordinate with the Valley Transportation Authority when feasible to
                       provide new fixed route or shuttle service in underserved areas (e.g., Cox
                       Avenue).
        CI-Action-4.4 Improve the links of local transportation systems and alternatives such as
                       bicycling and walking with private and public regional transit such as bus
                       transit, light rail, and CalTrain. Bicycle and pedestrian improvements
                       should be funded as Capital Improvement Program projects or through
                       private development projects to further encourage the use of transit.
        CI-Action-4.5 Provide information to the public on available alternative transportation
                       choices and routes.
        CI-Action-4.6 Encourage local businesses to provide employees with transit passes or
                       other financial incentives to use transit to commute to and from the
                       workplace.
        CI-Action-4.7 Recommend potential stop locations for local school bus service and
                       provide minor street and landscaping improvements as appropriate.
        CI-Action-4.8 Commission a feasibility study of local shuttle service within Saratoga.
                       Funding for the study should be obtained from federal and state
                       grants/sources and private development projects.

        CI-Policy-5.2 Integrate the City of Saratoga bikeways system with the bikeways system
                      of adjacent communities, where economically feasible.
        CI-Policy-5.3 Pursue the expansion and continuation of the multi-use path along the
                      Union Pacific Railroad alignment (Joe’s trail) east of Saratoga Avenue and
                      west of Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road that will link the Stevens Creek
                      Recreational Trail in Cupertino with the Los Gatos Creek Trail in Los
                      Gatos.
        CI-Policy-5.4 Pursue other potential rights-of-way such as Santa Clara Valley Water
                      District and utility easements for bicycle, pedestrian, and/or equestrian
                      trail development.
        CI-Policy-5.5 Provide safe and direct pedestrian routes and bikeways between and
                      through residential areas linking transit centers and important community
                      centers such as local schools facilities and the Village.
        CI-Policy-5.6 Improve pedestrian and bicycle access to all public and private schools to
                      enhance safety.
        CI-Policy-5.7 Require adherence to the trails policies noted in the Open Space and
                      Conservation Element.
        CI-Policy-5.8 Develop a set of practical and realistic transportation demand management
                      (TDM) measures that can be used by employers in the City to reduce the
                      number of single-occupant vehicle trips. These measures would encourage
                      ride-sharing and transit alternatives.
Implementation Actions

                      access between residential areas, public uses, and community areas.
        CI-Action-5.9 Encourage non-residential development projects to include amenities such
                      as showers and lockers for employees to further encourage bicycling as an
                      alternative to automobile travel.
        CI-Action-5.10 Increase priority of pedestrian safety projects (i.e., pedestrian street
                      crossings, sidewalks or pathways) as part of the Capital Improvement
                      Program.
        CI-Action-5.11 Make bikeway improvements a funding priority by: 1) continuing to
                      consider financing bikeway design and construction as part of the City’s
                      annual construction and improvement fund; 2) incorporating bikeway
                      improvements as part of the Capital Improvement Program and pavement
                      management efforts; and 3) aggressively pursuing regional funding and
                      other Federal and State sources for new bikeways.
        CI-Action-5.12 Update the Open Space and Conservation Element to maintain and
                      expand the Citywide pedestrian path system. The plan should include the
                      proposed trails shown on Figure C-6.
        CI-Action-5.13 Assure implementation of the City's trails system by requiring trail
                      dedication, construction, and a method of trail maintenance pursuant to the

AESTHESTIC QUALITIES AND HERITAGE LANES
Goals
CI.6a          Protect the aesthetic, historic and remaining rural qualities of Saratoga through
               street design and landscaping.
CI.6b          Strive for aesthetically pleasing views from all roads in Saratoga and the Sphere
               of Influence.
CI.6c          Encourage the preservation of the width and appearance of those roads designated
               as heritage resources by the City.
Policies
        CI-Policy-6.1 Identify areas of critical need for beautification and coordinate plans with
                       revitalization or anticipated development of areas such as City gateways.
        CI-Policy-6.2 Adhere to minimum City street standards based on location, terrain,

                      character of areas and the anticipated function of the roadway.
        CI-Policy-6.3 Permit variation of the conventional City street development standards, as
                      described in the City's Subdivision Ordinance, in order to preserve
                      environmentally sensitive roadside features where traffic safety will
                      permit such variations.
        CI-Policy-6.4 Identify the function of a street in advance of construction, and apply
                      design criteria to minimize disruption to the area caused by through or
                      heavy vehicle traffic.
        CI-Policy-6.5 Encourage the planting of trees and plan the development of landscaped
                      medians along major arterial roadways.
        CI-Policy-6.6 Enforce ordinances to prevent the use of non-conforming roadside signs
                      on all roads and highways within the City, whether erected by private
                      individuals or business enterprises.
        CI-Policy-6.7 Require increased setbacks of up to 100 feet for structures, walls or fences
                      to be located on lots adjacent to officially designated scenic highways
                      where it is determined by the City that such increased setbacks are
                      necessary to preserve the scenic qualities of the highway.
        CI-Policy-6.8 Require increased setbacks and landscaping for commercial and multi-
                      family residential structures on corner lots adjacent to arterial streets, as
                      required, to reduce the visual impact of such structures and to enhance the
                      appearance of important intersections where it is determined by the City
                      that such increased setbacks are necessary to preserve the scenic qualities
                      of the highway.
        CI-Policy-6.9 Approve designs for new hillside streets that maximize the use of natural
                      terrain for roadbed construction and minimize “cuts and fills.”
Implementation Actions
        CI-Action-6.1 Review Subdivision Ordinance street standards for adequacy and prepare
                      illustrations of corresponding roadway cross-sections
        CI-Action-6.1 Require a sight distance analysis to ensure adequate site access for
                      variances from street design standards proposed by the City or by private
                      developers.
        CI-Action-6.2 Encourage residents of streets and roads believed to have historic merit to
                      nominate those rights-of-way for designation as heritage lanes through the
                      Heritage Preservation Commission.

                       street parking to create inviting environments.
        CI-Action-6.4 The designation of Heritage Lane shall not preclude City action necessary
                       to guarantee safe access for emergency vehicles while maintaining the
                       integrity of the existing heritage lane.
PARKING SUPPLY AND MANAGEMENT
Goals
CI.7a          Provide adequate parking for non-residential uses to minimize intrusion into
               adjacent neighborhoods.
CI.7b          Provide on-street parking spaces in commercial areas that provide direct access to
               abutting properties while requiring off-street public and private parking lots to
               serve the majority of the demand.
Policies
        CI-Policy-7.1 Review on-street parking policies and utilization in the Village area
        CI-Policy-7.2 Designate curb parking in the Village area for short-term use by those
                       visiting businesses and public facilities.
        CI-Policy-7.3 Encourage the location of parking lots behind buildings to emphasize the
                       buildings’ physical and visual connections to the street and to maximize
                       pedestrian access and safety.
        CI-Policy-7.4 Encourage the use of carpools and vanpools by providing preferential
                       spaces as appropriate.
        CI-Policy-7.5 Allow reduced parking supplies for parcels, where appropriate, in order to
                       utilize the area-wide parking supply.
Implementation Actions
        CI-Action-7.1 Enforce parking time limits and zones.
        CI-Action-7.2 Establish time limits for on-street parking in commercial areas.
        CI-Action-7.3 Adopt design standards for parking stalls, aisles and driveways for on-
                       street and off-street facilities.

Chapter 1: Introduction
A.      Introduction
The Housing Element of the General Plan identifies and analyzes existing and projected
housing needs and contains the official policies for the preservation, conservation,
rehabilitation, and production of housing in the city of Saratoga. This Housing Element
covers the Planning Period from January 2015 through June 2023.
B.      Purpose and Content
                                               The Housing Element addresses housing
                                               opportunities for current and future
                                               Saratoga residents through 2023 and
                                               provides the primary policy guidance for
                                               local decision making related to housing.
                                               The Housing Element is the only General
                                               Plan Element that requires review and
                                               certification by the State of California.
                                               The Housing Element provides a detailed
                                               analysis of the city’s demographic,
economic, and housing characteristics as required by State law. The Housing Element
also evaluates the City’s progress in implementing the 2007-2014 policy program and
actions related to housing production, preservation, conservation, and rehabilitation.
Based       on    community      housing    needs,      available     resources,     housing
constraints/opportunities, and analysis of past performance, the Housing Element
identifies goals, objectives, and action programs that address existing and projected
housing needs in Saratoga.
C.      Housing Element Update Process
The California State legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and
suitable living environment for every Californian as a State-wide goal. Local planning
programs play a critical part in achieving this goal. Therefore, the Legislature mandates
that all cities and counties prepare a Housing Element as part of their comprehensive
General Plans.
                                                                                       1-1

  D.     State Law and Local Planning
      1. Consistency with State Law
The Housing Element is one of the seven Elements of the General Plan required by State
law (Sections 65580 to 65589.89 of the California Government Code). Each jurisdiction’s
Housing Element must contain “identification and analysis of existing and projected
housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled
program actions for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.” The
Housing Element plans for the provision of housing for all segments of the city’s population.
Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth specific requirements regarding the
scope and content of each Housing Element. Table 1-1 summarizes these requirements
and identifies the applicable sections of the Housing Element where these requirements
are addressed.

    2. General Plan Consistency
The California Government Code (Section 65300.5) requires internal consistency among
each Element of the General Plan. The General Plan Elements shall provide an integrated,
internally consistent, and compatible statement of policy. The City of Saratoga
continuously reviews the General Plan for internal consistency when updates or
amendments occur. The City has reviewed the other Elements of the General Plan and
determined that the Housing Element is internally consistent.
    3. Relationship to Other Plans and Programs
The Housing Element identifies goals, objectives, policies, and actions for the 2015-2023
Planning Period that directly addresses existing and future housing needs in Saratoga.
City plans and programs work to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the
Housing Element.
                                                                                    1-3

 F.      Citizen Participation
 The Housing Element was developed through the combined efforts of City staff and
 consultants, the Planning Commission, and the City Council. Citizen input was received
 through public workshops and public hearings conducted by consultants, the Planning
 Commission and the City Council. Notices for these workshops and hearings were
 published on the City’s website and posted at City Hall and other public facilities. In
 addition, housing stakeholder-organizations involved in the development of housing or
 representing the interests of lower income and special needs households were contacted
 directly to participate in public workshops.
     1. Community Workshops and Public Study Sessions
 The following community workshops were advertised and open to the general public:
        Study Session #1: January 21, 2014 – Planning Commission
        Workshop #1: February 25, 2014, Joan Pisani Community & Senior Center
        Workshop #2: March 11, 2014, Joan Pisani Community & Senior Center
        Study Session #2: March 25 – Planning Commission
        Study Session #3: June 24, 2014 – Planning Commission – Draft Housing Element
         Review
 During the community workshops, participants were provided with an overview of the
 Housing Element update process and content. Participants were then asked to identify
 and discuss challenges, opportunities and resources related to housing in Saratoga.
 Comments received through the outreach activities have been considered in the
 development of the Housing Policy Program provided in Chapter 4 of this document. A
 summary of the comments is provided in Appendix A of the Housing Element.
                                                                                    1-6

Chapter 2: Housing Needs Analysis
A. Introduction
When preparing the Housing Element, jurisdictions must evaluate both existing and future
housing needs for all segments of the population.
                                                     This section analyzes demographic,
                                                     economic and housing characteristics that
                                                     influence the demand for and availability of
                                                     housing. The analyses form a foundation for
                                                     developing programs and policies that seek
                                                     to address identified housing needs
                                                     according to income, tenure and special
                                                     needs groups.

                                                    Primary data sources utilized in this analysis
include the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census, the California Department of Finance (DOF), the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG). These data sources are the most reliable for assessing existing
conditions and provide a basis for consistent comparison with historical data and for
making forecasts.
B. Community Profile
 1. Population Trends and Characteristics
Housing needs are generally influenced by population and employment trends. This
section provides a summary of the changes to the population size, age and racial
composition of the city.
          a.        Historical, Existing and Forecast Growth
The city of Saratoga is one of 15 cities in the County of Santa Clara. The 2010 Census
reports a population of 1,781,642 in Santa Clara County. Table 2-1 shows the population
of other Bay Area counties relative to Santa Clara. Santa Clara County experienced a
higher percent change in population growth compared to the cumulative regional
population growth rate in the Bay Area.

According to the U.S. Census, Saratoga experienced a 7 percent population increase
between 1990 and 2000, and less than 1 percent increase between 2000 and 2010.
Table 2-2 compares Saratoga’s population growth trends with those of the County.
Despite a slower growth rate over the past decade, ABAG predicts that growth rates will
increase and the city will have nearly 3,000 more residents in 2040. In 2013, The California
Department of Finance estimated Saratoga’s population to be 30,706. Figure 2-1 shows
population growth projected by ABAG.

                  b.     Age Composition
 Between 2000 and 2010, Saratoga experienced a proportional decline in the younger and
 prime working age population groups and a proportional growth in older age groups. The
 number of residents of “Preschool” (0-4 years) and “School” (5-17 years) age decreased
 over the decade. The majority of Saratoga’s working age population, “Prime Working”
 (25-54 years) age, experienced a decrease from 41 percent of the population in 2000 to
 37 percent in 2010. Saratoga’s “Retirement” (55-64 years) age and “Senior Citizen” (65+
 years) age populations increased over the decade. In 2000 these age groups combined
 to make up 29 percent of the population. In 2010 they had grown to 35 percent of the
 population. The growing proportion of older residents and the decreasing proportion of
 younger residents was reflected in the higher median age in 2010 (47.8 years) compared
 with that of 2000 (43.2 years).
                                                                                  2-3

              c.       Race and Ethnicity
  Saratoga residents who identified themselves as non-Hispanic White represented a
  majority in 2010. Their population had decreased since the 2000 Census while the Asian
  and Pacific Islander population had grown. White residents represented 52 percent of
  the population in 2010, down from 65 percent in 2000. The group experienced the largest
  population decrease among various groups in terms of absolute numbers, with 4,003
  fewer White residents reported in 2010 than in 2000. In contrast, the Asian and Pacific
  Islander population experienced the largest growth in absolute numbers, gaining 3,668
  during the same period. The Asian and Pacific Islander population increased from 29
  percent of the population in 2000 to 41 percent in 2010. Table 2-4 shows the city’s racial
  and ethnic distribution.

   2. Employment Trends
  Employment characteristics and trends can shed light on relationship between jobs and
  housing in the city. Census data since 2000 shows a decreasing number of employed
  residents, correlating to the increase in retired and senior residents. However, the number
  of jobs in the city remained steady between 2007 and 2011 and the 12,500 employed
  residents, shown in 2011 American Community Survey data, outnumbered the 7,609 job
  opportunities in the city. Saratoga has limited opportunities for extensive commercial and
  employment growth because there are few remaining vacant parcels in the city.
  In Saratoga, the top five industries have remained the same between 2007 and 2011 but
  their employment figures have changed. Educational services has remained the top
  industry over the 5 year period and had a 12 percent increase in employment
  opportunities. Health Care and Social Assistance, the second largest employer,
  experienced a 13 percent increase in the number of employment opportunities.
  Accommodation and Food Services grew by 42 percent to become the third largest
  employer in 2011. Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (down 18%) and Other
  Services (down 14%) had fewer opportunities in 2011 than in 2007 but remained within the
  top five industries in the city.
                                                                                                             2-5

 Several of the major employers were in the Education industry, which corresponds to data
 showing that it has been the industry with the largest employment in Saratoga. The City
 of Saratoga’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report FY2012-2013 listed the top 10
 employers in 2013 shown in Table 2-6. The Education industry will likely continue to provide
 large number of employment opportunities in the city.

 Overall employment among Saratoga residents had a slight decline between 2000 and
 2011 but has grown since 2011. Saratoga had approximately 12,500 employed residents
 according to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, eight hundred fewer than
 reported in 2000. More residents were employed in Manufacturing than any other industry
 between 2000 and 2011. Nearly four hundred fewer residents held jobs in this industry in
 2011 than in 2000 (down 9 percent). The industry that employed the second largest
 number of residents in 2000 – Professional, Scientific, Management, Administrative, and
 Waste Management services – experienced a 5 percent increase by 2011. Despite
 moderate increases in this industry and other industries such as Whole Sale Trade and
 Retail Trade, fewer residents were employed in other industries, which offset some of the
 increases. By 2011, fewer residents were employed in Construction (-186); Finance,
 Insurance, Real Estate, and Rental and Leasing (-295); and Public Administration (-101).
 Table 2-7 shows the breakdown of occupational data by industry for Saratoga and Santa
 Clara County residents. The California Employment Development Department data,
 shown in Table 2-8, indicates that employment has grown in Saratoga since 2011,
 however occupational distribution is not shown. The Census and American Community
 Survey best convey the occupational trends, though not as current as the EDD data.

As economic recovery brings improved job prospects to the Bay Area, employment among
Saratoga residents will continue to increase. The California Employment Development
Department reports that employment numbers were able to keep pace with growth in the
labor force, causing the unemployment rate to drop every year since 2010. Table 2-8 shows
labor trends between 2008 and 2013.
                                                                                                         2-8

  Most Saratoga residents worked with in Santa Clara County. According to U.S. Census
  OnTheMap, only 5 percent of Saratoga residents worked in the city. About 63 percent
  worked elsewhere in the County, with San Jose as a major employment center for more
  than 23 percent of residents. Five percent of residents worked in San Mateo County. Four
  percent worked in San Francisco. Six percent worked in the East Bay.
  About 90 percent of Saratoga residents relied on automobile transportation for their
  commute. According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, 84 percent of
  residents drove alone and 6 percent carpooled. One percent of residents walked and
  less than one percent used public transportation or other means. Eight percent of
  residents worked from home. The average commute among all residents was 25.5
  minutes. Since 95 percent of residents worked outside of the city, driving has been the
  predominant means of travel.
  The Association of Bay Area Governments forecast predicts that job opportunities in
  Saratoga will grow from 9,910 in 2000 to 11,640 in 2040, but a more conservative growth
  scenario should be expected. Table 2-9 shows the ABAG projections for job growth in
  Saratoga and Santa Clara County over the next 3 decades. The City believes that
  employment figures may be lower than those generated by ABAG. U.S. Census
  OnTheMap 2011 estimated an employment figure (7,373) that was lower than ABAG’s
  2010 projection number (9,910). As a result, projections using the larger 2010 number may
  be inflated. Further, the largely residential character of Saratoga does not provide
  significant land area for commercial and employment growth. Job growth is more likely
  to take place elsewhere in Santa Clara County, as illustrated by ABAG projections.

   3. Household Characteristics
  This section describes Saratoga’s household characteristics. The U.S. Census Bureau
  defines a “household” as all persons living in a single housing unit, whether or not they
  are related. One person living alone is considered a household, as is a group of
  unrelated people living in a single housing unit. The U.S. Census Bureau defines “family”
  as related persons living within a single housing unit.
          a. Household Formation and Composition
  In 2013, the Department of Finance reported 10,778 households in Saratoga, which
  marked less than a 1 percent increase from 10,734 households in 2010. As a point of
  reference, the rate of growth over the previous decade (from 2000 to 2010) was 3
  percent. In Santa Clara County, the total number of households increased 1 percent
  between 2010 and 2013. Between 2000 and 2010, the population increased 7 percent.
  The number of households corresponds to the number of occupied housing units.
  The increase in renter households contributed to Saratoga’s overall household growth.
  Between 2000 and 2010, renter households grew 41 percent, from 1,044 to 1,476
  households. During the same period, owner households decreased by 2 percent. Despite
  the growth in renter households, owner households still accounted for 86 percent of
  households in 2010. Table 2-10 shows household growth over the past decade, and Table
  2-11 shows the change in owner and renter households.
                                                                                      2-10

The average number of persons per household in Saratoga was 2.8 in 2010. Household
sizes remained about the same in the city and county between 2000 and 2010. As shown
in Table 2-12, the average number of persons per household in Saratoga continued to be
lower than the County average.

Owner households comprised 86 percent of households in Saratoga, and total household
size distributions in the city closely followed the owner household distribution. Two-person
households made up 37 percent of owner households. Four-person households accounted
for 22 percent of owner households, while three-person households accounted for 19
percent of owners. Total household distributions similarly followed this pattern because of
the overwhelming number of owners compared to renters. For instance, more than one-
third renters were single-person households. The small proportion of renters to owners did
little to affect the total household distribution pattern. Table 2-13 shows household sizes by
tenure.

          b. Household Income
  Saratoga’s overall median income was $155,182 in 2011. There was a large difference in
  median incomes between owner and renter households. Owner households in 2011 had a
  median income of $166,602. The median income of renters was $77,932, less than half of
  the owner median income. Nearly 70 percent of all households had incomes of $100,000
  or more, the majority of which were owners. Income distribution of Saratoga’s households
  is shown in Table 2-14. The large number of owner households, which typically have higher
  incomes, hides the disparity in median incomes between owner and renter households.

  The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) calculates
  an annual median family income (MFI), with reference to the U.S. Department of Housing
  and Urban Development (HUD), for the purpose of determining program eligibility. The
  State of California uses five income categories to determine housing affordability based
  on the MFI. Table 2-15 shows the income ranges for each income category based on the
  2013 State Income Limits for Santa Clara County.

  According to the 2006-2010 CHAS database developed by HUD, nearly three-quarters of
  households in Saratoga earned above moderate incomes but some disparity existed
  between owner and renter households. Nearly 80 percent of owner households had
  above moderate incomes. Less than half of renter households had above moderate
  incomes. Owner households also had a much smaller proportion in the very low income
  classification (10%) compared to renter households (34%). Table 2-16 shows the
  proportion of households in each income level by tenure.

  In 2011, Saratoga had the third highest median household income in the County, as
  shown in Table 2-17. At $155,182, Saratoga’s median household income was nearly twice
  the countywide median household income.

  The annual incomes of many that serve the community fell well below Saratoga’s median
  income. The 2013 California Occupational Employment Statistics, compiled by the
  California Employment Development Department, lists the average salaries by
  occupations. The salaries of vital service occupations, such as home health aides,
  elementary school teachers and firefighters, were below the county-wide median
  income level. More options for affordable workforce housing would be needed for those
  employed in Saratoga that cannot afford to live in the community they serve. With the
  average rent of a 1-bedroom apartment at nearly $2,000 and a 2-bedroom apartment
  at nearly $3,200 in 2014 (craigslist.com rental survey 2/18/2014 and 3/14/2014), workers in
  lower income occupations may encounter difficulty in finding affordable rental units.
  Table 2-18 shows the occupational salaries in the San Jose, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara
  metropolitan statistical area.

           a.        Housing Stock Profile
  According to the 2000 U.S. Census and the State Department of Finance, 2 percent of all
  housing units in Santa Clara County are within Saratoga’s boundaries. The city had 10,667
  housing units in 2000. The housing stock grew to 11,123 units in 2010. Table 2-19 summarizes
  the number of housing units from 2000-2010.

  During the 2007-2014 period, eighteen new second units were constructed. Thirteen of
  these units were deed restricted and available for Low Income households. The other five
  second units were non-deed restricted and available to Moderate Income households.
  During the first half of 2014 the City has estimated that an additional two deed restricted
  units will be permitted and another two non-deed restricted units will be permitted.
                                                                                             2-16

  A survey (Craigslist May 9, 2014 & May 20, 2014) of second unit rentals in Saratoga and
  surrounding cities showed rents ranging from $850 to $2,000. The median rent for a 1-
  bedroom unit was $1,600 and the median rent for a studio was $1,360. These rents are in
  the range of Very Low to Moderate affordability for Santa Clara County.
  Based on feedback from owners of second units, City staff understands that a large
  percentage of second units are occupied rent free by family members or domestic
  workers. While the City does not maintain records on rents for second units other than
  deed restricted units, surveys done in San Mateo County for the cities of Woodside,
  Portola Valley, Los Altos Hills and Hillsborough indicate that between 62 and 74 percent
  of all second units are available to very low or extremely low income households. These
  cities are demographically similar to Saratoga.
  In Saratoga, the majority of recently constructed second units have utilized the floor area
  and site coverage bonus provisions which require that the unit be deed restricted for rent
  to below market rate households. Since 2001 the City estimates that there were 41
  second dwelling units constructed, of those units 20 were deed restricted.
  Most building permits in the city were issued for remodels and additions to existing single-
  family dwellings. During the 2007-2014 planning period, 127 new homes were built
  including replacements of existing homes. An additional, 22 second dwelling units were
  built during the planning period. This represents 51 percent of the total 292 housing units
  planned for during the 2007-2014 Housing Element cycle.
            i.    Unit Size
  In 2011, the most common type of renter-occupied units were 1-bedroom units. The
  most common types of owner-occupied units were 3-bedroom and 4-bedroom units.
  These were also the most common types of housing units overall. Table 2-21
  summarizes the distribution of unit size by tenure in 2011.

         ii.    Unit Type
  Single-family homes constitute the majority of the city’s housing stock. In both 2000 and 2010,
  the combined total of single-family attached and detached units made up more than 90
  percent of the housing stock in Saratoga. Table 2-22 presents the proportional distribution of
  the housing stock. One notable change between 2000 and 2010 was the increasing number
  of multiple family dwellings that were constructed.

As the predominant housing type in Saratoga, single-family units comprised the majority of
owner-occupied units and a significant proportion of renter-occupied units. Owner-occupied
housing units are predominately single-family detached, comprising 93 percent of all owner-
occupied units. Single-family detached units also made up the majority of renter- occupied
units (38 percent). The largest proportion of renter-occupied housing units were multifamily
complexes with 5 or more units, which comprised 43 percent of renter-occupied units.

        b. Tenure
   Approximately 86 percent of Saratoga’s housing units were owner-occupied and 14
   percent were renter-occupied in 2010. As shown in Table 2-24, the percentage of owner-
   occupied units in Saratoga was comparatively higher than Santa Clara County and
   California.

       c. Vacancy Rates
  Vacancy rates are an indicator of housing supply and demand. Low vacancy rates
  influence greater upward price pressures; a higher vacancy rate indicates downward
  price pressure. A vacancy rate of five percent for rental housing and two percent for
  owner housing is generally considered healthy in regards to the balance between
  supply and demand. In 2010, the citywide residential vacancy rate in Saratoga was
  3.5 percent. The renter vacancy rate was 4.3 percent, and the homeowner vacancy rate
  was 0.7 percent. Both rates have increased since 2000 but are still lower than the
  benchmark for healthy vacancy rates. These lower vacancy rates suggest that
  competition for units may place upward pressure on rents and for-sale housing prices.
  Table 2-25 summarizes vacancy rates in Saratoga from 2000 to 2010.

       d. Age of Housing Stock
  The age of a housing unit is often an indicator of housing conditions. In general, housing
  that is 30 years or older may exhibit need for repairs based on the useful life of materials.
  Housing over 50 years old is considered aged and is more likely to exhibit a need for
  major repairs. The U.S. Census provided data on the age of t h e housing stock through
  the 2007-2011 American Community Survey. In Saratoga, 81 percent of housing units
  were built before 1980 and 32 percent were built before 1960. Table 2-26 provides a
  summary of housing stock age.
                                                                                                              2-19

      e. Housing Conditions
  Housing is considered substandard when conditions are found to be below the minimum
  standard of living conditions defined in the California Health and Safety Code.
  Households living in substandard conditions are considered to be in need of housing
  assistance, even if they are not seeking alternative housing arrangements, due to the
  threat to health and safety.
  In addition to structural deficiencies and standards, the lack of infrastructure and utilities
  often serves as an indicator for substandard conditions. According to the 2007-2011
  American Community Survey 74 units in Saratoga lacked complete plumbing facilities
  and 140 units lacked complete kitchen facilities. It should be noted that there may be
  some overlap in the number of substandard housing units, as some units may lack both
  complete plumbing and kitchen facilities. Table 2-27 summarizes the number of units
  lacking plumbing or complete kitchen facilities.
   The age of the city’s housing stock can be a valuable indicator of housing conditions. In
   Saratoga, approximately 80 percent of the housing units were built prior to 1980 and 32
   percent prior to 1960. It is expected that housing older than 30 years may require basic
   repairs and housing older than 50 years is considered “aged” and likely to require more
   extensive repairs. A spike in home construction occurred in the 1960s when 3,074 homes
   were built, which translates to 28 percent of the present housing stock. Assessor data
   indicates that there are 4,124 residences that were built over 50 years ago and have not
   had a significant remodel. Given the historically high values of homes in Saratoga the vast
   majority of older homes are maintained in good condition. The City estimates that less
   than one percent, or approximately 20, of those homes older than 50 years will need some
   form of rehabilitation during the planning period. The City will continue to utilize code
   enforcement practices to identify housing in need of rehabilitation and work with property
   owners to rectify sub-standards housing.
                                                                                         2-20

          f. Housing Costs and Rents
  This section evaluates housing cost trends in Saratoga. The analysis covers the
  affordability gap, home price trends, ownership affordability, rental prices and rental
  affordability.
         i.     Home Price Trends
  In 2013, the median value for all owner-occupied units in Saratoga was $1,600,000,

  Housing prices vary by housing type and the number of bedrooms in a unit. Overall, the
  median price of a single-family home was more than twice the value of a townhouse or
  condominium in Saratoga. The median price difference is significant even between
  single-family homes and condominiums with comparable sizes and the same number of
  bedrooms.

        ii.   Ownership Affordability
  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual household
  income surveys nationwide, including Santa Clara County, to determine the maximum
  affordable payments of households and their eligibility for federal housing assistance. The
  2013 median income limit for a four-person household in Santa Clara County was
  $105,500. Table 2-23 presents affordable home purchase prices for moderate income
  households.
                                                                                             2-23

                                           The median sales price for homes in 2013
                                           generally exceeded the affordability range for
                                           moderate income households, however
                                           condominiums were a more affordable
                                           alternative to single-family homes. The
                                           affordability gap between the maximum
                                           affordable purchase price of a moderate
                                           income 4-person household and the median
                                           single-family home purchase price is $870,000.
                                            This gap is more than two times the difference
The Saratogan Condominiums
                                            between the affordable price and the median
                                            condominium purchase price ($320,000).
Although the gap in affordability is still significant for condominiums, it is a more viable
option than single family homes, which are out of reach for moderate income
households.
                                                                                       2-24

          iii.    Rental Prices
  As a city where 85 percent of the housing stock consists of single-family detached homes,
  small affordable apartment rentals are difficult to find. Table 2-33 shows that the number
  of homes available for rent outnumbered apartments for rent in 2014. This leaves renters
  with fewer options for affordable apartment rentals. Rents for single-family homes were
  upwards of $5,000 per month. The average rent for a 3-bedroom home was $4,510, and
  the rent for a 4-bedroom home was $5,460. In comparison, the average price of a 1
  bedroom rental unit was $1,960. A small stock of multifamily units gives renters few choices.
  Second units offer an affordable alternative to apartment and home rentals. These

  According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, 37 percent of renter
  households in Saratoga spent 30 percent or more of their household income on rent
  in 2011. Twenty percent of households spent 50 percent or more of their household
  income on rent. Table 2-34 shows the number of households by percentage of household
  income spent on rent.

          iv.     Rental Affordability
 As shown in Table 2-35, the median rents for 1-bedroom apartments were affordable to
 moderate income households but not low income households. A 1-bedroom unit was
 affordable to a 2-person moderate-income household, which could pay up to $2,435,
 after utilities, without exceeding the affordability limit defined as 30 percent of income.
 With an affordable limit of $1,600, low income renter households would have to spend
 more than 30 percent for their income. Although the affordability gap for low income
 renters was $150 for a 1-bedroom apartment, the gap greatly widens for units with 2-
 bedrooms or more. The difference between the median rent for a 2-bedroom unit and
 affordable rent for a low-income household was $1,600. In addition to the low supply of
 1-bedroom units, households face the challenge of finding affordable rental units. Units
 that have more than one bedroom would no longer be affordable to low income or
 moderate income households.
 Rental prices for larger units, namely single-family homes, exceeded affordable levels for
 moderate income households. Single-family homes make up a large supply of 3-bedroom
 rental units. The median rent for a 3-bedroom home was $4,540, but a 4-person moderate
 income household could only spend up to $3,037 on housing until housing was no longer
 considered affordable. This affordability gap between the median price and an
 affordable rental price was $1,500. To rent a median priced 3-bedroom home in
 Saratoga, moderate income households would have to spend more than 30 percent of
 their income on rent.

  B. Housing Needs
  This section provides an overview of existing housing needs in Saratoga. It focuses on the
  following categories:
          Household overpayment;
          Overcrowding;
          Estimated new construction;
          Replacement of units lost; and
          Special needs groups.
   1. Households Overpaying for Housing
   Overpayment is defined as households paying more than 30 percent of their gross
   income on housing related expenses, including rent or mortgage payments and utilities.
   High housing costs can cause households to spend a disproportionate percentage
   of their income on housing. This may result in repayment problems, deferred
   maintenance or overcrowding.
   Overpayment is an issue affecting owners and renters. Thirty-two percent of all
   households were owners that overpaid for housing. As shown in Table 2-36, housing
   overpayment not only affected lower income households but had a noticeable impact
   on above moderate income households as well. With median home values and market
   prices exceeding $1 million, housing payments presented a burden for many households.
   Table 2-37 shows overpayment among renter households. About 5 percent of all
   households were renters who overpaid for housing. Renter households represent a small
   proportion of all households in Saratoga, so overpayment is a more significant issue than
   is represented by the data.

   2. Overcrowding
   An Overcrowded Housing Unit is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a housing unit
   occupied by more than one person but less than 1.5 persons per room (excluding
   bathrooms, kitchen, hallway and closet space). A Severely Overcrowded unit is defined
   as a unit occupied by more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding can affect public
   facilities and services, reduce the quality of the physical environment and create
   conditions that contribute to deterioration. Overcrowding is not a significant issue in
   Saratoga. Table 2-38 summarizes overcrowding in Saratoga. According to CHAS 2006-
   2010 data, the only overcrowding recorded was for 15 severely overcrowded renter units.

   3. Units At-Risk of Conversion
   The State Housing Element law requires local governments to prepare an inventory of all
   assisted multi-family rental housing complexes that are eligible to be converted from low
   income to market-rate units. Assisted housing units are multifamily units that have
                                                                                                                 2-29

   received government assistance (any combination of rental assistance, mortgage
   insurance, interest reductions, and/or direct loan programs). The conversion may be
   triggered by termination of a rent subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiration
   of use restrictions. The inventory must cover a ten-year evaluation period following the
   statutory due date of the Housing Element.
   Saratoga has two rent-restricted properties totaling 170 units. These include Fellowship
   Plaza with 150 units and Saratoga Court with 20 units. Both properties provide affordable
   housing for seniors and are owned and managed by non-profit housing providers and
   are thus considered at low risk of conversion to market rate. Analysis of at-risk unit
   conversions is covered in Appendix B.
   4. 2014-2022 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
   The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is responsible for allocating housing
   needs to each jurisdiction in its region, including Saratoga. A local jurisdiction’s “fair
   share” of regional housing need is the number of additional housing units needed to
   accommodate the forecasted growth in the number of households, to replace
   expected demolitions and conversion of housing units to non-housing uses, and to
   achieve a future vacancy rate that allows for healthy functioning of the housing market.
   The allocation is divided into five income categories: Extremely-Low, Very-Low, Low,
   Moderate, and Above-Moderate. The allocation is further adjusted to avoid an over-
   concentration of lower-income households in any one jurisdiction.
Table 2-39. Regional Housing Needs Allocation
                     Extremely          Very                                        Above

*It is assumed that 50 percent of the RHNA Very Low Income allocation qualifies as Extremely Low Income.
   5. Special Needs Groups
   Certain segments of the population have more difficulty finding decent, affordable
   housing due to special needs. This section identifies the needs for elderly persons, large
   households, female-headed households, persons with disabilities, homeless persons and
   farmworkers.
   In addition to the data from the 2010 U.S. Census, this section uses data from the 2006-
   2010 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) published by HUD. The CHAS
   provides information related to households with housing problems, including
   overpayment, overcrowding and/or without complete kitchen facilities. The CHAS data
   are based on Census data files and mostly comprise a variety of housing need variables
   split by HUD-defined income limits and HUD- specified housing types.
                                                                                                          2-30

             a. Elderly Persons
  Elderly persons are considered a special needs group because they are more likely to
  have fixed incomes. Elderly persons often have special needs related to housing
  location and construction. Because of limited mobility, elderly persons typically need
  access to public facilities (i.e. medical and shopping) and public transit. In terms of
  housing construction, elderly persons may need ramps, handrails, elevators, lower
  cabinets and counters, and special security devices to allow for greater self-protection.
  The U.S. Census reports the characteristics of Saratoga’s senior population and
  households. Nearly 6,100 residents, or 20 percent of the population, were age 65 or older.
  Senior households, which are headed by a senior resident, made up 32 percent of
  Saratoga’s households. The tenure of senior households, shown in Table 2-40, consists of
  15 percent renters and 85 percent owners.

  The HCD Area Median Income for Santa Clara County was $105,500 in 2013. Based
  on the 2007-2011 American Community Survey data shown in Table 2-41, 21 percent of
  senior households earned less than $30,000, and therefore fell within the Extremely Low
  Income category. Within the Very-Low and Low Income categories Twenty-six percent
  earned $30,000 to $74,999. The 2007-2011 American Community Survey also reports that
  35 percent of senior households were living alone, which may present additional
  challenges of housing affordability for those with low and fixed incomes.

  The senior poverty rate as a whole was comparable to the poverty of the city’s entire
  population. However, poverty rates for seniors under 75 and seniors over 75 were very
  different. About 1 percent of seniors between ages 65 and 74 fell below the poverty level,
  which was less than half of the poverty rate for the city’s entire population. However,
  more than 6 percent of seniors age 75 and over fell below the poverty level, which was
  nearly double the rate for the city’s population as a whole. Poverty rates are summarized
  in Table 2-42. Supportive housing policies and affordable housing options can address
  some of the difficulties that aging seniors face, including housing maintenance needs,
  physical disabilities and living on fixed incomes.

  Affordable housing for seniors continues to be a need in Saratoga. Maintaining a supply
  of affordable units is crucial in meeting the needs of low income seniors.
  The U.S. Census Bureau provides information on the number of persons with disabilities of
  varying types and degrees. The types of disabilities included in the Census are:
         Sensory: Blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment.
         Physical: A condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical
          activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
         Mental: A condition lasting 6 months or more that made it difficult to perform
          certain activities including learning, remembering, or concentrating.
         Self-care: A condition lasting 6 months or more that made it difficult to perform
          certain activities including dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home.
         Go-outside-home: Only asked for population 16 and older; a condition lasting 6
          months or more that made it difficult to perform certain activities including going
          outside the home alone to shop or visit a doctor's office.
         Employment: Only asked for the population aged 16 to 64; a condition lasting 6
          months or more that made it difficult to perform certain activities including working
          at a job or business.
  In 2011, about 15 percent of the elderly population had one type of disability. As shown
  in Table 2-43, at least 14 percent had two or more types of disability. With disabilities
  becoming a greater concern as senior residents age, supportive services and housing
  environments will be in greater demand.
                                                                                          2-32

   A number of city and countywide resources serve senior residents in Saratoga. The
   Saratoga Area Senior Coordinating Council (SASCC) serves the needs of seniors in
   Saratoga and sponsors two key programs: the Saratoga Senior Center and the Adult
   Care Center. The Saratoga Senior Center hosts a variety of programs and activities
   including education, art, physical fitness, entertainment and social events. In addition,
   the Saratoga Senior Center provides services in health, finance, legal assistance and
   library lending. The Adult Care Center provides structured activity programs for seniors
   ages 60 and older with physical and cognitive limitations who are unable to use the
   services of the Saratoga Senior Center.
   Seniors in Saratoga have access to several residential care facilities. As of April 2014, the
   Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services listed
   five providers of residential care facilities for seniors in Saratoga. The Saratoga Home for
   the Elderly, April Garden Villa of Saratoga and Bon Homie Saratoga each have the
   capacity for 5-6 persons. Our Lady of Fatima Villa serves up to 74 persons. The largest
   facility is the Saratoga Retirement Community (Fellowship Plaza), which can
   accommodate 418 persons. Dementia care is available at Saratoga Retirement
   Community and at Cedar Creek Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care Center in nearby Los
   Gatos.
  Health care services are available within and around Saratoga. In addition to a number
  of physicians, dentists, optometrists and chiropractors working in Saratoga, El Camino
  Hospital of Los Gatos offers a comprehensive set of health services. Saratoga Walk-In
  Clinic offers urgent care and provides family practice care.
  In-home care is available to seniors through several organizations with offices near
  Saratoga. Through in-home care, seniors have an opportunity to remain at home with the
  assistance of caregivers who help with daily activities. The Home Instead Senior Care
  office in Campbell and the Visiting Angels Senior Homecare office in San Jose are local
  options that connect seniors with caregivers.
  The charitable foundation Health Trust has operated various programs and provided
  services to Santa Clara County residents. The local Meals on Wheels program is one of
  the programs operated under Health Trust that serves Santa Clara County residents who
  are physically limited and homebound, including seniors and persons with disabilities.
  Heath Trust programs offer access to high quality, affordable health services for seniors
  through their Healthy Aging Initiative.
                                                                                                                   2-33

              b. Large Households
   State housing law defines large households as households having five or more persons
   living within the same household. Large households are considered a special needs
   group because they require homes with more bedrooms. In 2010, there were 1,033
   households in Saratoga with at least five persons, representing 10 percent of the total
   households in the city. Large owner households represented 8 percent of all households
   and large renter households represented 1 percent of all households.
   One of the unique facets of Saratoga’s population that is not clearly reflected in the
   available data, is the number of multi-generational households. Anecdotally, this appears
   to be most true of new residents among the growing Asian population. Table 2-44 shows
   the number of large owner and renter households.

          c. Female-Headed Households
  Female-headed households are a special needs group due to the comparatively low
  rates of homeownership, lower incomes and high poverty rates they experience. With
  limited resources available, many female-headed families have a need for affordable
  housing in close proximity to services such as schools, day care and recreation programs.
  According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, female-headed family
  households represented 5.2 percent of all households in Saratoga. Female-headed families
  with children accounted for 2.8 percent of all households. Table 2-46 shows the change in
  female-headed households between 2000 and 2011.

In times of need, emergency shelters and transitional housing can provide one source of
support for women facing heavy financial burden, domestic abuse or other instabilities in their
lives. During their stay, they are given opportunities to regain physical and emotional health.
Financial burden may also be reduced during the stay, which allows them to more easily
transition back to financial and housing stability. Although there are no shelters for women in
Saratoga, ten shelters that provide a variety of services to women are located within 10 miles
of      Saratoga,       according        to      the     Women’s          Shelters       California     directory
(www.womanshelters.org).
           d. Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities often spend a disproportionate amount of income to obtain housing.
Access and affordability are the primary challenges for persons with disabilities. Access,
both within the home and to/from home, is important for persons with disabilities. This
group often requires specially designed housing units. Persons with disabilities may require
residential care facilities or be located near specialized services. Housing locations near public
facilities and public transit are important for this special needs group.
The U.S. Census Bureau provides information on the number of persons with disabilities of
varying types and degrees. Table 2-48 shows the number of Saratoga residents over the age

of Saratoga residents reported having at least one type of disability. A more detailed
description of disability types among persons with disabilities is shown in Table 2-49.

*Person may have more than one type of disability
  Persons with developmental disabilities have special housing needs. The State defines
  developmental disability as one that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old,
  or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and presents a substantial disability for that
  individual. Conditions include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. Table
  2-50 shows developmental disabilities among Saratoga residents as surveyed in 2013.

  In Santa Clara County, nearly 74 percent of persons with developmental disabilities lived with
  a parent or guardian. Almost 16 percent lived in a community care facility. Table 2-51 shows
  living arrangements for persons with developmental disabilities in Santa Clara County.
   The lack of financial resources is an obstacle to independent living for persons with
   developmental disabilities. Living in an integrated community setting is crucial in promoting
   long-term health and stability. About 7 percent of persons with development disabilities lived
   independently in Santa Clara County. The provision of safe, affordable housing with access
   to supported living services can improve the viability of independent living.

   Residential facilities and services for persons with disabilities are largely provided at the
   county- and regional level. The Community Care Licensing Division of the California
   Department of Social Services has recorded no providers of residential care facilities for
   persons with disabilities in Saratoga. However, residential care facilities are available
   throughout the Santa Clara County. Rental subsidies are also available through the Housing
   Authority of Santa Clara County. The Silicon Valley Independent Living Center (SVILC) serves
   Santa Clara County residents who have disabilities. The nonprofit organization provides
   services related to information, referrals, peer support, independent living skills training,
   housing and assistive technology. SVILC maintains a database of accessible and subsidized
   housing to help its clients find affordable housing in the County. Resources for persons with
   disabilities are provided at the regional level.
           e. Homeless Population
   Enumeration of the homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature of this
   population and the existence of “hidden homeless” or persons that move among temporary
   housing situations.
   The 2013 Santa Clara County Homeless Census and Survey identified 35 homeless individuals
   in Saratoga. The 2013 Census and Survey comprised a point-in-time count of homeless and
   a series of one-on-one interviews with about 850 homeless individuals. Thirty-five unsheltered
   homeless and no sheltered homeless residing in Saratoga were reported in 2013. In
                                                                                                               2-38

comparison, 7 unsheltered homeless and no sheltered homeless were reported in 2011. The
increase of homeless persons suggests that there may be a growing need for supportive
programs to prevent homelessness and help individuals find permanent housing.
Emergency shelters, transitional housing and permanent housing are needed to address the
countywide need of available shelters for the large number of unsheltered homeless. The 2013
Homeless Census found that 74 percent of homeless in the County were unsheltered. A total
of 7,631 homeless individuals were identified in the survey, of which 5,674 individuals were
unsheltered. Of the 26 percent who were sheltered, 12 percent stayed at emergency shelters,
13 percent occupied transitional housing and less than 1 percent were in the Safe Haven
program. Shelter stay was not guaranteed to homeless individuals. The 2013 Homeless Census
reported that 27 percent of respondents had been turned away from an emergency shelter
within the prior 30-day period and two-thirds of those individuals were turned away due to a
lack of beds. Although Saratoga’s entire homeless population in 2013 was unsheltered, the
number of homeless residing within the city was a small proportion of the County’s unsheltered
homeless population.
There are no permanent shelters located in Saratoga; however, two local churches
participate in the Faith In Action Rotating Shelter Program which provides emergency
shelter, food and other services. A number of regional resources are also available to
homeless individuals. Saratoga is a supporting partner of the West Valley Community Services
program which assists homeless individuals and families with referral and placement services.
InnVision Shelter Network operates a number of transitional housing programs in Santa Clara
County. The programs include job search assistance and training on the management of
household finances.
In the 2013 Homeless Census, 40 percent of respondents indicated that job loss was the
primary factor leading to their homelessness. Programs related to job training help
reintegrate individuals into the workforce and access to transitional housing provides
temporary shelter during the process. The Housing Authority of Santa Clara County offers
rental assistance and supportive services to homeless persons with long-term disabilities
through providers in the Shelter Plus Care Program. Home First (formerly EHC Lifebuilders)
connects individuals with emergency shelter, transitional housing and permanent housing
opportunities, along with supportive services, throughout the Santa Clara County. Homeless
individuals are referred to regional resources and organizations. A list of homeless service
facilities is provided in Chapter 3 (Table 3-7).
The 2013 Homeless Survey revealed that one-third of the homeless population were
chronically homeless. Chronic homelessness is characterized as being homeless for one or
more years or experiencing 4 or more episodes of homelessness in the past 3 years. Nine
percent of the homeless population were veterans, more than two-thirds of which
experienced one or more conditions including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, depression,
mental illness and physical disabilities. Fourteen percent of the homeless population were
families. Programs provided to homeless individuals in Saratoga and Santa Clara County
should consider unique circumstances and housing needs among different homeless
                                                                                     2-39

  subgroups.
          f. Farm Workers
  Farm workers are defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through seasonal
  agricultural work. According to the USDA Census of Agriculture, Santa Clara County had
  4,237 farmworkers in 2012. However, Saratoga is not an agricultural community. Eighteen
  persons at most, less than 1 percent of Saratoga’s labor force, were employed in
  agriculture, according to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey. It is assumed that only
  a small percentage of persons employed in this industry are involved in active agricultural
  production and harvest. Therefore, there is no apparent or recognized need for farmworker
  housing.
          g. Extremely Low-Income Households
  Extremely Low-Income households are defined as households earning 30 percent or less of
  the Median Family Income. In accordance with Chapter 891, Statutes of 2006 (AB 2634),
  cities must quantify the number of existing and projected Extremely Low-Income
  households and analyze their needs. According to the CHAS 2006-2010 dataset from HUD,
  7.4 percent of total households in the city were Extremely Low-Income households.
  Saratoga will have 2,354 Extremely Low-Income Household in 2040 assuming a population of
  32,700 by 2040 (2013 ABAG projections) and applying the same proportional distribution of
  income levels. The City will need to be prepared to meet the specific housing needs of
  Extremely Low-Income households, which may include housing with supportive services,
  single-room occupancy housing, shared housing, or rent subsidy vouchers. Table 2-52 shows
  Extremely Low-, Very Low-, and Low- Income household distributions.

  Housing problems can significantly impact Extremely Low-Income households, who may
  have limited means to improve their housing conditions. The CHAS 2006-2010 database
  identifies households at various income levels that are affected by at least one of four
                                                                                           2-40

   housing problems: incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than 1
   person per room, and cost burden greater than 30%. Housing problems affected 285 renter
   and 190 owner households in the Extremely Low-Income category. Tables 2-53 and 2-54 show
   that housing problems affect the majority of Extremely Low-Income and Very Low Income
   Households, regardless of whether they own or rent.

Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
 Constraints to housing include both governmental and environmental. Saratoga is
 bounded to the south and west by the Santa Cruz Mountain Range, and to the north
 and east by the communities of Los Gatos, Campbell, San Jose and Cupertino. The low-
 lying, relatively flat portions of the city are almost exclusively built out with single-family
 development. Highway 85 and Highway 9 bisect the city and bring commuter traffic
 through to the high tech jobs in the nearby cities of Cupertino, Sunnyvale, and Mountain
 View. These factors, as well as the high cost of land, and limited public transportation
 outside of the main thoroughfares, are viewed as constraints to affordable housing by
 the residents of the city.
A. Governmental Constraints and Resources
Governmental constraints are policies, standards, requirements and actions regulated by
various levels of government upon land and housing ownership and development. These
regulations may include various building codes, land use controls, growth management
measures, development fees, processing and permit procedures, and site improvement
requirements. While state and federal agencies play a role in imposing constraints on the
development and provision of housing, they are beyond the influence of local
government and are, therefore, not addressed in this analysis. Governmental resources
include programs that provide funds for housing-related activities, as well as, incentives
provided by the local jurisdiction for the provision of housing.
 1. Land Use Controls
Land use controls include General Plan policies, zoning designations (and the resulting
allowed uses, development standards, and permit processing requirements), and
development fees.
     a. General Plan
As required by state law, every city in California must have a General Plan, which
establishes policy guidelines for all development within the city. The General Plan is the
foundation of all land use controls in a jurisdiction. The Land Use Element of the General
Plan identifies the location, distribution, and density of the land uses within the city.
The Saratoga General Plan land use densities are expressed per net area, which is
generally defined as the remaining portion of the gross site area after deducting portions
within the right-of-way of existing or future public or private streets, easements, quarries,
or areas that are classified by the City Geologist as "M" or "Ms." Residential densities are
expressed in dwelling units per net acre (du/ac) and are limited by the maximum intensity
of building and impervious site coverage.
                                                                                           3-1
 The City of Saratoga General Plan identifies six residential land use designations and two
 open space designations that permit residential uses. In addition, mixed use
 developments that include residential uses are allowed by conditional use permit in
 commercial districts within the city. Table 3-1 summarizes Saratoga’s residential land use
 designations by total acre, permitted density ranges, and maximum intensity of building
 and impervious surface coverage.

  As of January 2013, the State Department of Finance (DOF) reports that 11,169 dwelling
  units exist in Saratoga. Depending on land costs, certain densities are needed to make a
  housing project economically feasible for people at various income levels. According to
  the State of California, the densities identified below are generally sufficient to
  accommodate construction affordable to specific income levels.
              Extremely Low-, Very Low-, and Low-Income: 20 dwelling units per acre minimum
              Moderate-Income: 11-20 dwelling units per acre minimum
              Above Moderate-Income: Up to 11 dwelling units per acre
  In addition to the generally accepted densities, California Government Code Section
  65583.2 establishes “default” density standards. If a local government has adopted
  density standards consistent with the established population criteria, sites with those
  density standards are accepted as appropriate for accommodating the jurisdiction’s
  share of regional housing need for lower-income households. Pursuant to Government
                                                                                                  3-4

    Code Section 65583.2, Saratoga is considered a “suburban” jurisdiction with a “default”
    density of 20 dwelling units per acre.
b. Zoning Code
    The Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. Its purpose is to
    protect and promote public health, safety, and welfare. Additionally, it serves to promote
    quality design and quality of life. The City of Saratoga’s residential zoning designations
    control both the use and development standards of each residential parcel, thereby
    influencing the development of housing.
   Table 3-2 summarizes permitted residential uses in agricultural, residential, professional
   and administrative office, and commercial districts. Single-family residential zoning
   includes eight districts: A, R-1-40,000, R-1-20,000, R-1-15,000, R-1-12,500, R-1- 10,000, HR,
   and R-OS. Single-family units are permitted as a matter of right in all single-family
   residential districts. Multi-family residential zoning consists of the R-M-5,000, R-M- 4,000, and
   the R-M-3,000 districts. Multi-family and single-family dwellings are permitted by right in the
   R-M districts. Mixed residential/commercial uses are permitted in the Professional and
   Administrative Office (P-A) and Commercial (C-N, C-V, CH-1, CH-2) districts subject to
   conformance with the mixed-use development standards specified in Article 15-58 of the
   zoning code and approval of a conditional use permit. Mixed residential/commercial
   uses are permitted by right in the Commercial C-N(RHD) district.

  Table 3-3 summarizes the single-family residential zoning designations and their
  requirements. Table 3-4 summarizes the multi-family residential designations and
  requirements. Table 3-5 summarizes the requirements for mixed-use development. Based
  on residential construction in compliance with these standards, the City has determined
  that minimum and maximum lot coverage, maximum building height standards and
  setback standards do not unreasonably impact the cost and supply of housing nor the
  ability of projects to achieve maximum densities.
  The city of Saratoga is predominantly comprised of single-family residential units; as such
  there are not a significant number of multi-family housing projects to provide an analysis
  of the impacts of these development standards on multi-family development. However,
                                                                                        3-6

to address any impacts in the future, the City will ensure that development standards in
the C-N(RHD) zoning district (refer to Appendix B, Table B-5) will not be a constraint to the
development of multi-family housing.

 Village                                               units per acre. In addition, the City has a
                                                       history of approving horizontal mixed use
developments along Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road with commercial uses fronting the road
and small lot single family units on the rear of the sites. For example a 12 unit mixed-use is
being developed on Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road at a density of 12 dwelling units per acre,
with 1,835 square feet of commercial space fronting the road and the townhouses in the
back Based on the history of mixed use development in Saratoga, the City has
determined that lot coverage, pedestrian open space (requirement in the CH District),
private open space, height and setback standards do not unreasonably impact the cost
and supply of housing nor the ability of projects to achieve maximum densities.
 As a new policy action for the next planning period, the City will amend the C-N(RHD)
 district to increase density from a minimum of 20 dwelling units per acre to a minimum of
 30 units per acre and increase the maximum height limit from 30 feet to 35 feet to reduce
 constraints to development on these sites.

      c. Parking Requirements
  Table 3-6 summarizes the residential parking requirements in Saratoga. Parking requirements
  do not constrain the development of housing directly. However, parking requirements may
  reduce the amount of available lot areas for residential development.

    d. Planned Combined District
The purpose of the Planned Combined District (P-C) is to provide the City the authority
to modify standards of development in an underlying zoning district so as to achieve the
following objectives:
(a) To provide a means of guiding development or redevelopment of properties in areas
    of the city that are uniquely suited for a variety of design and development patterns
    and standards.
(b) To provide greater flexibility of land use and design for a development that provides
    a public benefit that would not otherwise be attainable through strict application of
    the zoning regulations. A public benefit could include, but is not limited to, buildings
    that exceed the City's green building standards, provides community facilities that
    are open to the public, or allows for innovative in-fill design.
(c) To encourage innovative design in a development that achieves one or more
    specific goals and policies of the General Plan that would otherwise not be
    attainable through strict application of the zoning regulations.
In certain instances, the objectives of the zoning ordinance may be achieved by the
development of a residential community primarily for a common green development or
for persons desiring smaller residences or dwelling units than economically feasible under
existing zoning districts, and which combines a number of uses in order to develop a living
environment in conformity with the General Plan. The P-C District may include a
combination of single or multiple dwelling uses together with ancillary uses of recreational
centers, social halls, restaurants, medical centers and other related facilities.
The P-C district allows single-family, two-family, or three-family dwellings or a combination
thereof, together with all other permitted uses in either an R-1 district or an R-M district,
depending on which underlying district it is combined with (R-1 or R-M). The dwelling units
shall be single-story unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. In addition,
community centers, private recreational centers, social halls, lodges, clubs, restaurants,
and medical centers to be used by the residents and their guests are allowed.
Standards for site area and dimensions, site coverage, density of dwelling units, setback
areas, types of structures, etc. shall in the aggregate be at least equivalent to the
standards prescribed by the regulations of the district that the Planned Community District
is combined with. Any P-C area shall contain a common green unless specifically waived
by the Planning Commission.
                                                                                        3-17
 2. Density Bonus Ordinance
In order to encourage the construction of affordable housing developments for Very Low-
and Low- Income households, and in accordance with Chapter 4.3 Section 65915 et. seq.
of the California Government Code, the City of Saratoga has adopted a Density Bonus
Ordinance (Article 15-81 of the Zoning Code). Upon receipt from the applicant, the City
reviews an application requesting a density bonus or incentive or concession. The
Community Development Director has 90 days from receipt of the application to notify
the applicant in writing regarding the status of the application. The application and all
associated project approvals shall be considered by the Planning Commission which shall
make a recommendation to the City Council. Prior to the issuance of a building permit
for any dwelling unit in a development that a density bonus has been awarded for, the
applicant shall enter into a written agreement with the City for the duration of the
affordability.
     a. Density Bonus for Affordable Units in Mixed-Use Projects
The City allows the total site coverage to be increased by 10 percent over the underlying
zoning district maximum for mixed-use projects containing deed restricted below market-
rate housing units.
     b. Reduced Parking Standards
The garage requirement for a second dwelling unit may be waived if the second
dwelling unit is deed restricted so that it may only be rented to below market rate (very-
low, low, and moderate income) households. An on-site open parking space must be
provided in lieu of a garage.
 3. Institutional Facilities and Nursing Homes
The City's Zoning Code defines an “Institutional facility” as a place, structure, or area
operated by a public or private organization or agency, used for and providing
educational, residential, or health care services to the community at large. The term
includes residential developments and health care facilities operated by non-profit
organizations and both public and private schools or colleges. The City’s Zoning Code
defines a “Nursing home” as a residential structure in which nursing, dietary, and other
personal services are rendered to six or more convalescents, invalids, or elderly persons
residing at the facility, and in which surgery or other medical treatment customarily given
in hospitals is not performed.
The City deems a convalescent home or rest home as a nursing home. Institutional
facilities and nursing homes are permitted in all residential districts, except for the
Residential Open Space District, as well as in the Professional and Administrative Office
(P-A) district, subject to approval of a conditional use permit. Institutional facilities are also
permitted in the Commercial district, subject to approval of a conditional use permit.
                                                                                            3-18

 4. Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive Housing, and Single-Room
 Occupancy Units
     a. Emergency Shelters and Transitional and Supportive Housing
State Housing Law (Government Code Section §65583) requires that cities identify sites
that are adequately zoned for emergency shelters and transitional and supportive
housing. Additionally, cities must not unduly discourage or deter these uses. The City of
Saratoga permits emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing, and Single-
Room Occupancy Units in the C-N(RHD) District by right. Article 15-19.035 of the City
Zoning Code includes regulations and development standards regarding Single-Room
Occupancy Units. This Housing Element update includes Policy Action 4-4.3 in Chapter 4
to amend the Zoning Code to permit transitional and supportive housing as a residential
use in all residential zones in compliance with State Housing Law.
Santa Clara County has approximately 23 emergency shelters, providing close to 800
beds year-round, with an additional 300 beds available during the winter months
(November through March). There are also over 1,100 transitional housing beds
throughout the County that offer a combination of stable housing and intensive, targeted
support services for the mentally ill, those with chronic substance abuse, developmental
disabilities, and other factors that prevent the homeless from returning to permanent
housing situations. Transitional housing includes both single site and "scattered site"
programs. Table 3-7 provides a summary of emergency shelters and transitional housing
near the City of Saratoga.
                                                                                    3-19

  5. Adequate Sites for Emergency Shelters/Transitional/Supportive Housing
  According to the 2013 Santa Clara County Homeless Survey, 35 unsheltered individuals
  were identified within Saratoga, representing an increase of 28 individuals from the 2011
  Homeless Survey. In April 2010, the City of Saratoga amended its Zoning Code to permit
  emergency shelters/transitional/supportive housing in the C-N(RHD) District by right.
  Presently, one six acre area in the city has this designation. The area is located at Prospect
  Road and Lawrence Expressway. However, development standards for shelters were not
                                                                                           3-20

defined in the City Code at that time. As permitted under the provisions of Government
Code 65583, the City will establish written, objective development standards for
emergency shelters such as number of beds, security, and location from other
emergency shelter facilities. This will assist potential emergency shelter facility providers
and the City alike when processing a proposal.
The City has also adopted provisions in its Code for transitional and supportive housing
within the C-N(RHD) zone district. However, further direction since that time by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) clarifies that SB 2 requires
these uses be permitted in all zone districts where residential uses are permitted. To
address this deficiency, the City will amend the Code to identify transitional and
supportive housing as a permitted use in all residential and mixed use zones subject to
the same development standards as similar housing in these zones.
     a. Single Room Occupancy Units
 Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residences are small, one-room units occupied by a
 single individual, and may either have a shared or private kitchen and bathroom
 facilities. SROs are rented on a monthly basis typically without rental deposit, and can
 provide an entry point into the housing market for Extremely Low-Income individuals,
 formerly homeless, and disabled persons.
 Single-room occupancy units are defined and included in the City’s Municipal Code to
 be permitted in C-N(RHD) Districts. Development standards and regulations are
 included in Article 15-19.035.
6. Second Dwelling Units
Second dwelling units provide additional opportunities to provide housing for people of
all ages and economic levels, while preserving the integrity and character of single-
family residential neighborhoods. The City of Saratoga permits second units in the A, R-1,
and HR zones, provided certain requirements are met, such as minimum net site area,
minimum floor area, minimum parking requirements, number of bedrooms, and site
access.
                                             Second Dwelling Units have been a successful
                                             means of providing affordable housing in
                                             Saratoga. The City should seek ways to reduce
                                             constraints for the development of additional
                                             Second Dwelling Units.
                                             As a Policy Action for the next Planning period,
                                             the City will amend the Second Dwelling Unit
                                             standards to eliminate the minimum square
                                             footage requirements and reduce the
Historic home with second dwelling unit
                                             minimum lot size for Second Dwelling Units to
90% or more of the standard lot size for the underlying zoning district. In addition, the City
                                                                                        3-21

 shall create an informational brochure regarding Second Dwelling Units to disseminate
 to the public.
     a. Density Bonus for Second Dwelling Units
A one-time 10 percent increase in site coverage and allowable floor area may be
granted by the Community Development Director if a new second dwelling unit is deed
restricted so that it may only be rented to below market rate (very-low, low, and
moderate income) households.
 7. Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The U.S. Census Bureau defines persons with disabilities as those with a long-lasting
physical, mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for a person
to perform activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or
remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the
home alone or to be employed.
As a matter of State Law (Government Code §65583), cities are required to analyze
potential and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement
of housing for persons with disabilities, and demonstrate local efforts to remove
governmental constraints that hinder the locality from meeting the need for housing for
persons with disabilities. Cities are required to include programs that remove constraints
and provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with
disabilities. The City of Saratoga includes reasonable accommodation procedures within
the Municipal Code (Article 15-80.025) to address the requirements of State Law.
     a. Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
The ways in which the City of Saratoga facilitates housing for persons with disabilities
through its regulatory and permitting procedures include:
    The City of Saratoga allows “institutional facilities” that provide “residential health
     care services to the community at large” in all residential districts as well as in the
     Professional and Administrative Office (P-A) and Commercial (C) districts, subject
     to approval of a conditional use permit.
    The City of Saratoga allows “nursing homes” for six or more “convalescents, invalids,
     or elderly persons” in all residential districts as well as in the Professional and
     Administrative Office (P-A) district, subject to approval of a conditional use permit.
    The City defines family as “an individual or two or more persons occupying a
     dwelling unit and living together as a single housekeeping unit in which each
     occupant has access to all parts of the dwelling unit. A family shall be deemed to
     include necessary household help. The term shall not include a group of persons
                                                                                        3-22

     occupying a hotel, motel, bed and breakfast establishment, nursing home, or
     institution of any kind.” This definition does not pose a constraint of the development
     of housing for persons with disabilities.
    With the City’s Reasonable Accommodations provisions, the City allows some
     variation from the application of its parking standards to allow the Community
     Development Director to determine parking requirements for housing for persons
     with disabilities, based upon the requirements for comparable use and upon the
     particular characteristics of the use.
    The Planning Commission may grant a use permit as applied for or in modified form
     if, on the basis of the application and the evidence submitted, the Commission
     makes all of the following findings:
        o That the proposed location of the conditional use is in accord with the
            objectives of the Zoning Ordinance and the purposes of the district in which
            the site is located.
        o That the proposed location of the conditional use and the conditions under
            which it would be operated or maintained will not be detrimental to the public
            health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements
            in the vicinity.
 8. Building Codes and Enforcement
The intent of building and safety codes is to preserve public health and safety, and ensure
the construction of safe and decent housing. These codes and standards also have the
potential to increase the cost of housing construction or maintenance.
     a. Building Codes
The City of Saratoga has adopted the 2013 California Building Code, which establishes
construction standards for all residential buildings. The City amends the Code as needed
to further define requirements based on the unique local conditions. The Code is
designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare of Saratoga’s residents. Code
enforcement in the city is performed proactively and on a complaint basis.
     b. Federal Fair Housing Act and Americans with Disabilities Act
The federal Fair Housing Act of 1998 (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
are federal laws intended to assist in providing safe and accessible housing. ADA
provisions include requirements for a minimum percentage of units in new developments
to be fully accessible for persons with physical disabilities. Compliance with these
regulations may increase the cost of housing construction as well as the cost of
rehabilitating older units, which may be required to comply with current codes.
However, the enforcement of ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is
mandated under federal law.
                                                                                         3-23

  9. On and Off-Site Improvements
 On and off-site improvements may be required in conjunction with development based
 on the location of the project and existing infrastructure. Dedication and construction of
 streets, alleys and other public easements and improvements may be required to
 maintain public safety and convenience.
 The City’s standards and requirements for streets, sidewalks, and other site improvements
 are found in the Municipal Code. Table 3-8 summarizes the City’s standards for roadway
 and right-of-way widths.

Source: City of Saratoga Municipal Code Article 14-10.320 Table 1, definition for “Subdivision”
The on- and off-site improvements required by the City are necessary to adequately
provide the infrastructure and public facilities that support housing development. These
requirements ensure public safety and health, are not jeopardized by increased
development and do not unduly hinder housing development.
10. Development Fees
The Community Development Department of the City of Saratoga is self-funded. Various
development and permit fees are charged by the City and other agencies to cover
administrative processing costs associated with development. These fees ensure quality
development and the provision of adequate services. Often times, development fees
are passed through to renters and homeowners in the price/rent of housing, thus
affecting the affordability of housing. Table 3-9 compares the development fees in
Saratoga with development fees of neighboring cities.
Table 3-10 summarizes the typical development fees for single-family and multi-family
developments. Based on the residential projects constructed in Saratoga, the City has
not found the development and permit fees to hinder the supply of housing.
                                                                                                                3-25

  11. Local Processing and Permit Procedures
  Delays in development and building permit processing can be associated with
  considerable holding costs that may affect the price of housing. Table 3-11 summarizes
  the approximate processing time for development applications. Because the City
  processes permits concurrently, projects that require a conditional use permit can be
  approved in approximately the same timeframe as projects that do not require
  discretionary approvals.
  The Planning Commission may grant a conditional use permit as applied for or in modified
  form if, on the basis of the application and the evidence submitted, the Commission
  makes all of the following findings:
              That the proposed location of the conditional use is in accord with the
               objectives of the Zoning Ordinance and the purposes of the district in
               which the site is located;
              That the proposed location of the conditional use and the conditions
               under which it would be operated or maintained will not be detrimental
               to the public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties
               or improvements in the vicinity; and
                                                                                                                  3-31

            That the proposed conditional use will comply with each of the
             applicable provisions of Chapter 15 of the Municipal Code.
            That the proposed conditional use will not adversely affect existing or
             anticipated uses in the immediate neighborhood, and will not adversely
             affect surrounding properties or the occupants thereof.

 Table 3-11 summarizes the estimated processing timelines for planning application by
 development type. Processing timelines often occur concurrently. Based on recent
 residential projects constructed in Saratoga, the City has not found the local
 development processing timeline to hinder the development of housing.
 The following describes each process and corresponding decision-making body:
 Design Review
        The Community Development Director grants design review approval when
             an application is found in compliance with the City’s Municipal Code.
            If the Community Development Director intends to approve the application,
             a "Notice of Intent to Approve" will be mailed to all property owners within two
             hundred fifty feet of the subject property and to others as deemed
             appropriate. All interested parties will have fifteen calendar days from the
             date of the "Notice of Intent to Approve" in which to review the application
             and provide written comments to the Community Development Director. The
             Community Development Director approves or denies the application within
             fifteen days of the close of the review period and mails notices of the decision
             to the applicant and to any party that has requested a copy. The Community
             Development Director's decision can be appealed to the Planning
             Commission within fifteen calendar days of the Director's decision to approve
             the application. The Planning Commission at a public hearing will review any
             appeal.
                                                                                           3-32

       In reviewing applications for design review approval under, the Planning
        Commission is guided by the following criteria:
             1. Site development follows the natural contours of the site, minimizes
             grading, and is appropriate given the property’s natural constraints.
             2. All protected trees shall be preserved, as provided in Article 15-50
             (Tree Regulations). If constraints exist on the property, the number of
             protected trees, heritage trees, and native trees approved for removal
             shall be reduced to an absolute minimum. Removal of any smaller oak
             trees deemed to be in good health by the City Arborist shall be
             minimized using the criteria set forth in Section 15-50.080.
             3. The height of the structure, its location on the site, and its
             architectural elements are designed to avoid unreasonable impacts
             to the privacy of adjoining properties and to community viewsheds.
             4. The overall mass and the height of the structure, and its architectural
             elements are in scale with the structure itself and with the
             neighborhood.
             5. The landscape design minimizes hardscape in the front setback area
             and contains elements that are complementary to the neighborhood
             streetscape.
             6. Development of the site does not unreasonably impair the ability of
             adjoining properties to utilize solar energy.
             7. The design of the structure and the site development plan is
             consistent with the Residential Design Handbook, pursuant to Section
             15-45.055.
             8. On hillside lots, the location and the design of the structure avoid
             unreasonable impacts to ridgelines, significant hillside features,
             community viewsheds, and are in compliance with Section 15-13.100.
General Plan Amendment
     The Community Development Department reviews the application and
        prepares a report, which shall be submitted to the Planning Commission.
       The Planning Commission holds at least one public hearing on the
        proposed amendment.
       Following the conclusion of the public hearing, the Planning Commission
        determines whether the proposed amendment should be adopted. The
        Commission transmits its recommendation to the City Council in writing,
        together with a copy of the application, if any, and the documents submitted,
        the report to the Commission from the Community Development Director, the
                                                                                      3-33

         minutes of proceedings conducted by the Commission and the resolution and
         findings, if any, adopted by the Commission with respect to the proposed
         amendment.
        Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission, the City
         Council conducts a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
        The City Council may approve, modify or reject the recommendation of the
         Planning Commission.
Tentative Subdivision Map
       Applications for tentative subdivision map approval are filed with the
         Community Development Director who examines the application and the
         documents submitted. The time of filing the application is the date on which
         the application is accepted by the Community Development Director as
         being complete.
Variance
       The Planning Commission is designated as the approving authority to grant
         variances from the regulations prescribed in the Municipal Code.
        The Community Development Department reviews the application and
         prepares a report, which shall be considered in determining whether to
         approve or deny the variance.
        The Planning Commission conducts a public hearing on the application for a
         variance.
        Any determination or decision by the Planning Commission can be appealed
         to the City Council.
Conditional Use Permit
       The Community Development Department reviews the application and
         prepares a report, which shall be considered in determining whether to
         approve or deny the conditional use permit.
        Except for those uses identified in Section 15-55.065 of the Municipal Code, the
         Planning Commission considers all applications for conditional use permits and
         conducts a public hearing.
        Any determination or decision by the Planning Commission may be
         appealed to the City Council.
Final Map
       Prior to the expiration of a tentative map approval or extension, the owner
         has the property accurately surveyed and a final map prepared substantially
         in accordance with the tentative map as approved. The applicant files three
                                                                                     3-34

              copies of the final map, with any and all alterations and changes required,
              with the City Engineer for approval.
             Once the final map is filed with City Clerk, at the next available regular
              meeting, the map shall be either approved or disapproved by the City
              Council.
             The applicant, or any interested person, may appeal to the City Council any
              determination or decision by filing with the City Clerk a notice of appeal that
              clearly identifies the determination or decision from which the appeal is taken
              and states the grounds for the appeal.
 Arborist Review
          The City arborist conducts a field survey of the property and notes tree
              locations, assigns tree numbers, draws outlines of tree canopies and
              locations for tree protective fencing, and proposes alternate locations for
              trenching, lighting, or irrigation lines, and any other pertinent information
              deemed necessary.

  12. Measure G
  The voters of Saratoga approved Measure G in March 1996, which reaffirmed and
  readopted until December 31, 2025, the provisions of the Land Use Element of the City’s
  1983 General Plan with amendments through August 7, 1995. Certain amendments to
                                                                                              3-35

 the Land Use Element, including changing certain designations on the General Plan Land
 Use map, may only be made by a vote of the people. The initiative does not affect the
 City's existing regulations that authorize the creation of second dwelling units, nor does it
 interfere with the City's obligation under State law to revise the Housing Element.
 13. Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
     a. Environmental Constraints
                                                      Environmental hazards affecting housing
                                                      units include geologic and seismic
                                                      conditions, flooding, fire hazards, toxic and
                                                      hazardous wastes, and noise. The following
                                                      hazards may impact future development of
                                                      residential units in the city. Most identified
                                                      sites in Appendix B: Land Resources, do not
                                                      contain environmental constraints to the
                                                      development         of    housing.     Where
                                                      environmental constraints exist, the City of
                                                      Saratoga has identified measures for
    Residential development in the Saratoga foothills mitigation.
        i.    Seismic Hazards
The topography of Saratoga generally consists of the low-lying, relatively flat valley floor
and the northwestern foothills. Outside the city limits, but within the City's Sphere of
Influence, are the Castle Rock portions of the Santa Cruz Mountains. These mountains are
very rugged, comprised of steep canyons and sharp rounded ridge tops.
The dominant geologic feature within Saratoga's Sphere of Influence is the San Andreas
Fault zone, which bisects the mountainous portion of the terrain. The fault zone determines
the geology and topography of the area by separating two different rock assemblages
and their associated erosion characteristics. A complex system of fault traces and
fractured rock compose the fault zone. The location of the San Andreas Fault, along the
ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains, subjects the hillside region of the city to potentially
severe lateral displacement and ground shaking should an earthquake occur. However,
a major portion of the city is underlain by the relatively flat valley floor that is considered
a geologic stability zone.
There are two "potentially active" faults within the city limits. The Berrocal Fault belongs to
the Sargent Fault zone, a complex system of interconnecting faults extending northwest
between San Andreas and the Calaveras Faults. The fault trace crosses Congress Springs
Road and continues into the southeastern portion of the Sphere of Influence. The
Shannon Fault, part of the Monte Vista fault system, closely parallels the Highway 85
corridor from Regnart Creek in Cupertino to the north, crosses Saratoga Avenue, and
continues to Almaden Expressway in the southeast portion of San Jose. Although there is
                                                                                               3-36
a remote chance that ground rupture could occur on either one of these fault traces, it
is more likely to occur on the San Andreas Fault. However, little rural residential
development has occurred within the San Andreas fault zone in Saratoga's Sphere of
Influence, so the present risk of structural damage due to fault rupture is minimal.
The San Andreas Fault zone is the only area within the city and its Sphere of Influence that
the State has designated as a Special Studies Zone. Special Studies Zones are areas along
faults considered to be active or potentially active as established by the California
Division of Mines and Geology in compliance with the Alquist Priolo Geologic Hazard
Zones Act. When development for human occupancy is proposed within these zones,
special studies relating to seismic hazards are required and must be submitted to the City
or County Geologist for review.
As required by the State of California, the Saratoga General Plan contains policies
regarding land instability and seismic hazards within the Safety Element (updated in 2013).
In addition, the General Plan identifies the general location of the areas of potential
seismic hazards, as well as potentially active faults, 100-year flood areas, and hazardous
fire areas in the Safety Element.
The goal of the geologic and seismic policies is to protect residents from injuries and
minimize property damage resulting from land stability, geologic and seismic hazards. To
that end, the General Plan identifies specific policies that prohibit development without
site-specific geotechnical investigations; prohibit development of structures for human
habitation in areas proven to be unsafe (to the maximum extent permitted by law); and,
enforce strict earthquake construction and soil engineering standards in order to select
the most stable building sites, and to compensate for soil instabilities through the use of
approved engineering and construction techniques. In addition, zoning regulations for
residential development in hillside areas identify specific mandatory development criteria
including the preparation of a site development plan and geologic and soils report;
specific procedures for grading and siting structures; and, additional studies (soil and
foundation engineering investigation, slope stability studies, investigations addressing
seismic hazards of nearby fault traces) as necessary.
      ii.   Landslides
The hillside region of the city contains some rock formations conducive to landslides.
These areas primarily lie west of Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road, pass through a portion of the
Northwestern Hillsides Residential District, and continue past Big Basin Way. The zone is
also present within the Sphere of Influence, along the city's northwestern boundary and
across Bohlman Road. Landslides and unstable slopes may occur in this area, and can
create hazards within the city limits as the slide debris and rock move down the incline
toward the city's valley floor.
Landslides and slope instability are the major non-seismic geologic hazards in Saratoga.
Although most of the hillside areas experience these hazards to some degree, the most
severe risks are found in the vicinity of the Congress Springs area and the upper
                                                                                      3-37
Calabazas Creek watershed. As noted above, the General Plan includes specific policies
to protect residents from injuries and minimize property damage resulting from land
stability, geologic and seismic hazards. Moreover, the Zoning Ordinance includes specific
regulations for residential development in the hillsides designed to protect human life and
property.
      iii.  Soil Creep and Expansive Soils
Soil creep and expansive soils are most prevalent in the western hillside regions of the city.
Soil creep is the slow, down slope movement of near surface materials. The rate of soil
creep is a function of slope angle and soil thickness and texture. It can be regarded as a
continuous process, and may cause retaining walls, foundations, and paved roads to fail
over a period of time. Expansive soils contain high proportions of clay and alternatively
absorb and release large amounts of water during wet and dry cycles.
Structures built on expansive soils can experience rising foundations during the wet
season, resulting in cracked foundations, distorted frameworks, and warped windows and
doors. To address adverse effects associated with soil creep and expansive soils, the City
requires geotechnical investigations and soil reports in areas where soil creep and
expansive soils exist. The presence of soil creep should not have a prohibitive effect on
land use, but should alert the City to require appropriate geotechnical investigations to
evaluate conditions and to impose engineering solutions to mitigate problems.
      iv.   Flooding
Three major drainage basins lie within the city, the San Tomas Aquino, Saratoga, and
Calabaza Creeks. Several tributaries of the San Tomas and Calabaza Creeks are located
within the city, as well. These include Wildcat, Vasona, and Sobey Creeks, (tributaries of
San Tomas Creek), and Prospect and Rodeo Creeks, (tributaries of Calabaza Creek).
Areas adjacent to the San Tomas Aquino, Saratoga, and Calabaza Creeks are located
within the 100-year floodplain. In addition, the Wildcat and Vasona Creeks are also
subject to the 100-year flood hazard.
Saratoga participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The City adopts
and enforces certain floodplain management ordinances and, in return, residents can
purchase Federally-backed flood insurance. In addition, the City has an extensive review
procedure in conjunction with the Santa Clara Valley Water District, which addresses
flooding potential and the impact on development.
       v.   Toxic and Hazardous Wastes
Existing regulations in Saratoga severely limit uses involving hazardous materials. Thus, no
major chemical handlers are located within the city. The storage, use, and disposal of
hazardous materials is limited to gas stations. The hazardous materials generated typically
consist of anti-freeze, brake fluid, motor oil, and gasoline.
                                                                                        3-38
Saratoga has a Hazardous Materials Storage Ordinance (Chapter 8 of the Municipal
Code) to protect "health, life, resources, property through prevention and control of
unauthorized discharges of hazardous materials." The ordinance includes regulations
governing administration and enforcement of the code, which is performed by the
County; the list of specific materials covered; containment standards; and, preparation
of hazardous materials management plans.
      vi.   Fire Hazards
The Saratoga Fire Protection District and the Central Fire District of Santa Clara County
serve the city of Saratoga. All area fire departments cooperate in mutual aid agreements,
which loosen the strict adherence to district boundaries when adjacent communities are
in need.
The City's Subdivision Ordinance (Chapter 14 of the Municipal Code) requires a peakload
water supply of 1,000 gallons of water per minute for two hours for all housing
developments. However, areas with higher site elevations decrease the 35-pound
minimum pressure needed to provide 1,000 gallons per minute, which has caused a
severe problem with providing adequate fire protection in the Northwestern Hillsides
Residential District, where several of the homes currently do not meet the City
requirement.
Hazardous fire areas within the city are located within the Northwestern Hillsides area and
extend to the Lower Hillsides in the southwestern portion of the city. Special building
regulations exist for the hazardous fire areas, including the requirement for fire retardant
roofs and the installation of an electronic fire detection system (Early Warning Fire Alarm
System).
The Early Warning Fire Alarm System, which is required in all new homes or existing homes
expanded by more that 50 percent, consists of heat and smoke detectors which when
activated, will transmit a signal directly to a receiver panel in the Saratoga Fire District
Station. The fire district will then receive the earliest possible warning of fires, decreasing
response time to remote areas and thus reducing the possibility of death, injury, and
property damage.
The City also requires anti-fire buffer areas and sufficient clearance around each house
in the Northwestern Hillsides area. The minimum setbacks in this area are 30 feet in the
front yard, 20 feet in the side yards, and a minimum of 50 feet in the rear. Finally, the City
has a Weed Abatement Ordinance that requires property owners to remove weeds and
other combustible materials that become a fire menace.
     vii.   Noise
Traffic is the primary source of noise in Saratoga. In addition, commercial activities,
recreation complexes, and other sites of outdoor public assembly such as churches and
school sites, have been identified as periodic sources of noise complaints. The City’s
Planning Department currently considers noise in the project review process and works
                                                                                          3-39

with the applicant to use site planning and other design strategies to reduce noise
impacts.
     b. Infrastructure Constraints
The following presents the analysis of existing and future water and sewer capacity in
Saratoga. The City has found that based on population projections and housing growth
needs, there is adequate water and sewer capacity.
        i.  Water
The city of Saratoga receives its water supply from the San Jose Water Company. San
Jose Water Company obtains water from three major sources: groundwater, imported
surface water, and local mountain surface water. Groundwater is pumped from over 100
wells that draw water from the Santa Clara Groundwater Basin. Groundwater accounts
for approximately 40 percent of supply. Imported surface water is provided by Santa
Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD), the wholesale supplier. Surface water imported from
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and purchased from the Santa Clara Valley Water
district accounts for approximately 50 percent of supply. A majority of this water originates
as Sierra snowmelt, and travels through the State and Federal water projects before
treatment at SCVWD's three water treatment plants. A smaller portion is impounded in
local reservoirs in Santa Clara County. Local mountain surface water is collected in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, and treated at San Jose Water Company's two water treatment
plants. Local surface water accounts for approximately 10 percent of supply. These
sources are often blended together in the distribution system. Consequently, different
sources are dispersed to Saratoga from day to day as customer usage changes.
Saratoga will continue to meet its future demands with imported water, groundwater,
and local mountain surface water supplies.
Portions of the higher elevations of the Santa Cruz Mountains within the City’s Sphere of
Influence provide water runoff into local streams and recharge wells that provide a
portion of the City’s water supply. These areas should be protected from significant
urbanization in order to maximize continued production of the local water supply.
       ii.  Sewer
The city of Saratoga is served by two sanitation districts: the Cupertino Sanitary District
and the West Valley Sanitation District.
The Cupertino Sanitary District covers an area of approximately 15 square miles,
serving a population of over 50,000 people. The District owns and manages over 1
million feet of sewer mains, 500,000 feet of sewer laterals, and 15 pump stations. The
District has been maintained with a proactive capital improvement program aimed at
extending the reliability and life of the system beyond 100 years. Currently, the District
discharges 4.6 million gallons per day, and has rights to discharge over 8.6 million gallons
per day. The District anticipates being able to accommodate expected growth within
areas served.
                                                                                        3-40

The West Valley Sanitation District covers over 30 square miles, serving a population of
over 120,000 people. The District facilities include over 400 miles of sewer mains and over
250 miles of sewer laterals. The District has a fixed capacity allocation of 13.05 million
gallons per day. Based on population growth projections for 2030, the District would not
exceed the current fixed capacity allocation.
B. Non-Governmental Constraints
 1. Vacant and Underutilized Land
 A thorough analysis of vacant and underutilized land within the city of Saratoga is
 provided in Appendix B.
 2. Land Prices
Land cost increases have a significant influence on the cost of housing and the
availability of affordable housing. A number of factors determine land prices, the most
important of which are land availability and permitted development density. As land
becomes less available, the price of land increases. Based on review of a few multi-family
property sales in Saratoga over the past several years, land costs average $100 per
square foot.
 3. Construction Costs
Construction costs are primarily determined by the cost of materials and labor. They are
also influenced by market demands and market-based changes in the cost of materials.
Construction costs depend on the type of unit being built and the quality of the product
being produced. Table 3-13 summarizes the estimated construction costs based on type
of development in Saratoga.
    Table 3-13. Construction Cost Estimates
                                           Table 3-13 Construction

      2Based on average square foot reported by RealFacts.
      3Assumes $150 per square foot construction costs and $100 per square foot multi-family land costs.
 4. Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
                                                                                                             3-41
 The availability of financing in a community depends on a number of factors, including
 the type of lending institutions active in the community, lending practices, rates and fees
 charged, laws and regulations governing financial institutions, and equal access to those
 institutions. Through analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on the
 disposition of residential loan applications, an assessment can be made of the availability
 of residential financing within a community.
 Table 3-14 summarizes HMDA data for both Saratoga and Santa Clara County as a
 whole, providing information on the approval status of all home purchase and home
 improvement loan applications during 2012. Of the 521 applications for home purchase
 loans in Saratoga, 79 percent were approved, 12 percent denied, and nine percent (9%)
 withdrawn or incomplete.
 In comparison to the County-wide average, mortgage loan approval rates were fairly
 comparable in Saratoga (79%) and overall Santa Clara County (78%). In contrast,
 approval rates for home improvement loans were higher in Saratoga than Santa Clara
 County as a whole, at 75 percent compared to 70 percent County-wide. Review of loan
 denial rates by census tract does not identify any areas in Saratoga where loan denials
 differed markedly from the citywide average.

Figure 3-1 shows the average interest rates in 2013. Interest rates are determined by
national policies and economic conditions and there is little that a local government can
do to affect these rates. However, in order to extend home buying opportunities to lower-
income households, jurisdictions can offer home buying assistance programs such as
interest rate write-downs and consider government insured loan programs that may be
available to reduce mortgage down payment requirements.
                                                                                         3-42

  As a result of the recent recession, there have been changes in the qualifications and
  lending standards for home loans. Nationally, because there was a large increase in the
  number of delinquencies and foreclosures in the residential market, lenders have more
  stringent qualifications for home loans; and lower-income households may find it more
  difficult to qualify.
  C. Resources
The ability of the City to achieve its housing goals and objectives will, to a large extent,
depend on the availability of financial resources for implementation. Two primary sources
of funds – Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and Community Service Grants
– are currently used to support housing activities in Saratoga. Each of these is described in
the following section.
   1. Community Development Block Grant Program
  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program funds are the largest sources of
  Federal funding for housing and housing related activities in Saratoga. While Saratoga
  does not have a large enough population to be a CDBG Entitlement City (minimum
  population of 50,000), the City has joined with other smaller cities and Santa Clara County
  to form an Urban County under the CDBG Program. The participating cities jointly
  develop funding priorities and assist the County Board of Supervisors in determining CDBG
  funding allocation across the Urban County. Table 3-15 lists the Urban County CDBG
  funded activities approved for the 2015 fiscal year.
                                                                                        3-43

      2. Community Services Grant
      Through Saratoga’s annual Community Service Grant Program funding application and
      Ongoing Community Service Support Grants, the City allocates General Fund monies to
      a variety of service organizations that support its commitment to the provision of a social
      service safety net for the most vulnerable members of the community. In 2013/2014 the
      City Council allocated $22,825 in funds through its Grant Program and $107,915 in funds
      through its Ongoing Grant program. Similar amounts were allocated in prior years. The
      City utilizes its annual Community Service Grant Program allocations and Ongoing Grant
      Program to fund a variety of agencies and services including:

 3. Energy Conservation
Energy conservation remains a major priority in the city of Saratoga. The City requires
compliance with Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations on the use of energy
efficient appliances and insulation. Through compliance with Title 24, new residential
development has reduced energy demands.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which provides electricity service in the city
of Saratoga, offers public information and technical assistance to homeowners regarding
energy conservation. PG&E also provides numerous incentives for energy efficiency in
new construction and home remodeling. Remodeling rebates exist for projects installing
three or more upgrades from a flexible menu of options that earn points towards
incentives and rebates. This program’s incentives range between $1,000 and $4,500.
The City of Saratoga requires the submittal of a Cal Green checklist with applications for
Design Review for single- and multi-family existing and new residential construction
projects. The Cal Green checklist is based on standards produced by the California
Building Standards Commission.
One of the more recent strategies in building energy-efficient homes is following the U.S.
Green Building Council’s guidelines for LEED Certification. LEED-certified buildings
demonstrate energy and water savings, reduced maintenance costs and improved
occupant satisfaction. The LEED for New Construction program has been applied to
numerous multi-family projects nationwide. The LEED for Homes program was launched in
2005 and includes standards for new single-family and multi-family home construction.
The LEED certification standards are one piece of a coordinated green building program.
A green building program considers a broad range of issues including community design,
energy efficiency, water conservation, resource-efficient material selection, indoor
environmental quality, construction management, and building maintenance. The end
result will be buildings that minimize the use of resources; are healthier for people; and
mitigate the effects of the environment.
The following presents a variety of ways in which Saratoga can promote energy
conservation:
       Provide information regarding rebate programs and energy audits
        available through Pacific Gas and Electric;
       Refer residents and businesses to energy conservation programs such as Build It
                                                                                     3-45

  Green and LEED for Homes;
 Develop incentives, such as expedited plan check, for developments that
  are utilizing green building;
 Promote funding opportunities for green buildings, including available rebates
  and funding through the California Energy Commission; and
 Provide resource materials regarding green building and conservation programs.
                                                                              3-46

Chapter 4: Policy Program
This section describes the City of Saratoga’s Policy Program for the 2015-2023 Housing
Element. The Policy Program describes the specific policy actions necessary to address
present and future housing needs, meet the specific requirements of State law, and
consider the input by residents and stakeholders. In developing the Policy Program, the
City assessed its housing needs, evaluated the performance of existing programs, and
received input from the community through participation in housing workshops (see
Chapter 2 and Appendices A and C).
  A. Policy Action Areas
The Policy Action Plan for the 2015-2023 Housing Element is organized into five areas:
               New Production
               Rehabilitation of Existing Housing
               Design and Livability
               Access to Housing Opportunities
               Coordinated Housing Efforts
  B. Policy Actions
Policy Area 4-1: New Production
The City strives to ensure an adequate supply of housing is available to meet future and
existing housing needs of all economic segments of the community.

affordable housing. The City currently has reduced standards for one-bedroom units and
units that are exclusively occupied by seniors or students. To ensure that the existing multi-
family parking requirement is not a constraint to the development of affordable housing in
the CN(RHD) zone, the City shall consider additional reductions to parking requirements for
affordable and higher density housing developments including removal of garage
requirements and further reductions to guest parking requirements.
                                                                                        4-3

housing to meet needs of families with children, elderly households, persons with disabilities,
the homeless and all other segments of the community.
Policy Action 4-4.1: Encourage Development of Second Dwelling Units
The City understands that second dwelling units provide a viable tool to enhance the
availability of affordable housing opportunities in Saratoga. The City currently provides
policies and procedures for the development of second dwelling units within the Saratoga
Municipal Code. To ensure the City’s existing policies and procedures for second dwelling
units are effective in providing additional affordable housing opportunities, the City shall
review the existing Second Unit Ordinance and amend the Second Dwelling Unit standards
to eliminate the minimum square footage requirements and reduce the minimum lot size
for Second Dwelling Units to 90% or more of the standard lot size for the underlying zoning
district. The City will consider additional incentives including: a fee reduction, and
exemption of a portion of second unit floor area from lot coverage requirements. In
addition, the City shall create an informational brochure regarding Second Dwelling Units
to disseminate to the public.

Policy Action 4-4.2: Zoning Code Amendment for Special Needs Housing
In April 2010 and pursuant to SB 2, the City adopted provisions within its Code for transitional
and supportive housing within the C-N(RHD) zone district. However, further direction since
that time by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
clarifies that SB 2 requires these uses be permitted in all zone districts where residential uses
are permitted. To address this deficiency, the City will amend the Code to identify
transitional and supportive housing as a permitted use in all residential zones subject to the
same development standards as similar housing in these zones.
As part of the SB 2 Zoning Code amendments, the City also adopted provisions to allow
emergency shelters by right within the C-N(RHD) zone. However, development standards
for shelters were not defined in the Code at that time. As permitted under the provisions of
Government Code 65583, the City will establish written, objective development standards
for emergency shelters to regulate the following:
           The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by the
            facility.
           Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need, provided that the standards
            do not require more parking for emergency shelters than for other residential or
            commercial uses within the same zone.
           The size and location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and client intake
            areas.
           The provision of onsite management.
           The proximity to other emergency shelters, provided that emergency shelters are
            not required to be more than 300 feet apart.
           The length of stay.
           Lighting.
           Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
Having these standards in place will facilitate the permitting process.
  Objective:                    Facilitate Permitting Process for Emergency Shelters, Transitional
                                and Supportive Housing

San Andreas Regional Center (SARC) is a community-based, private nonprofit corporation
serving individuals and their families who reside within Monterey, San Benito, Santa Clara,
and Santa Cruz Counties. The SARC reports that 78 percent of their clients with
developmental disabilities live with a parent or guardian. As these parents age and
become frailer, their adult disabled children will require alternative housing options. The
SARC has identified several community-based housing types appropriate for persons living
with a developmental disability including licensed community care facilities and group
homes; supervised apartment settings with support services; and rent subsidized affordable
housing for persons able to live more independently. The City will coordinate with SARC to
implement an outreach program informing Saratoga families of housing and services

Policy Area 4-5: Coordinated Housing Efforts
The City of Saratoga has limited local resources to provide for housing and housing-related
activities. Therefore, to maximize use of limited local resources, the City strives to build
partnerships and coordinate housing efforts with outside agencies and organizations.
Policy Action 4-5.1: Promote Fair Housing Efforts
The City currently disseminates fair housing information packets about Fair Housing
Regulations and refers discrimination complaints to the Mid-Peninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing or to the County of Santa Clara County Office of Consumer Affairs. The City will
continue to participate in the County’s mediation program and will continue to support
these organizations which provide fair housing assistance including landlord/tenant
counseling, homebuyer assistance, and amelioration or removal of identified impediments.
  Objective:                  Continue Support of Fair Housing Efforts
  Responsible Agency:         Community Development

                              community events and locations including the Saratoga
                              Library, City Hall, the City’s Website and West Valley College.
Policy Action 4-5.2: Develop a Comprehensive Community Outreach Strategy for Housing
To ensure the Saratoga community is provided the highest level of access to housing
information, the City shall evaluate the effectiveness of existing outreach and community
education efforts and develop a comprehensive outreach strategy. The outreach strategy
will consider various methods of delivery, including print media, mailers, web-based
information and other methods that consider the economic and cultural considerations in
Saratoga.
                                                                                              4-10

Policy Action 4-5.3: Partnerships with Development Community
The City supports cooperation in the development of affordable housing through working
with local housing trust and non-profit agencies. The City will continue to cooperate with
developers to provide housing opportunities for lower income households; prioritize efforts
and resources to the identified sites for rezoning to promote a variety of housing types, such
as rental units that are affordable to lower income households. The City shall also evaluate
the effectiveness of its partnerships with housing developers and seek ways to expand and
foster its partnerships as appropriate.

Policy Action 4-5.4: Healthy Community
The City supports residential development that promotes healthy life styles (i.e. recreational
activities, encourages pedestrian and bicycle use and continued support of the Farmer’s
Market). In September 2012, the City adopted bicycle parking requirements for retail and
financial institutions within commercial districts (except C-H District). The City should
continue to evaluate ways to promote healthy life styles.

2015-2023 Quantified Objectives
While Saratoga cannot control the amount of housing built during any specific time period,
the City intends to make a good faith effort to achieve housing production at a level
consistent with its regional housing needs allocation (RHNA). The Quantified Objectives for
new construction will be the same as the RHNA. The Quantified Objectives for Housing
Rehabilitation and Preservation of At-Risk Rental Housing will be based on available
resources and past trends. Table 4-1 Housing Element Quantified Objectives 2015-2023
shows Saratoga’s objectives for new construction, housing rehabilitation and preservation
of at risk housing.

income), an estimated half of these units are assumed to be occupied by Extremely Low Income households, and half
occupied by Very Low Income households.
                                                                                                                         4-12

The City’s Quantified Objective for New Construction will be met through a combination
of strategies. The total capacity within the Very Low Income and Low Income categories
accommodates up to 276 units, where 242 units is the Quantified Objective. These will be
addressed through:
           Opportunity Sites providing 173 units (Prospect Road sites)
           The by-right zoning for the affordable senior housing at the Fellowship Plaza
            Retirement Community for 75 units
           Second Units providing 18 units (50% of 35 units)
The total sites capacity within the Moderate Income category accommodates up to 104
units, which is the Quantified Objective. These will be addressed through:
           Opportunity Sites providing 87 units (Gateway + Village site)
           Second Units providing 17 units (50% of 35 units)
The total sites capacity within the Above Moderate Income category accommodates up
to 110 units where 93 units is the Quantified Objective. These will be addressed through:
           Approved Projects providing 33 units
           Opportunity Sites (vacant parcels) providing 77 units

 Appendix A: Community Outreach
 A.      Introduction
 During 2014, the City of Saratoga conducted community outreach activities to ensure
 the Housing Element update reflected the issues and opportunities identified by the
 community. The workshops were advertised through flyers and notices on the City’s
 website. In addition, the City invited stakeholder groups such as affordable housing
 developers, professional and community organizations, housing advocacy groups and
 supportive service providers to participate.
 The following community workshops were advertised and open to the general public:
        January 21, 2014, Planning Commission Study Session, City Hall Conference Room
        February 25, 2014, Community Workshop #1, Saratoga Community Center
        March 11, 2014, Community Workshop #2, Saratoga Community Center
        March 25, 2014, Planning Commission Study Session, City Hall Conference Room
 During the first Planning Commission Study Session, the Planning Commission and
 community members were given an overview of the Housing Element update process,
 the City’s Regional Housing Need Allocation, and affordability categories.
 During the first Community Workshop, participants were provided a more in depth
 overview of Housing Element law. Participants identified and discussed challenges,
 opportunities and resources related to housing in Saratoga.
 At the second Community Workshop, participants discussed potential opportunity sites
 and strategies for providing affordable housing in Saratoga. Several opportunity sites
 were identified from all of the potential sites discussed, and strategies to encourage
 second unit development were seen as a favorable way to provide affordable units.
 At the second Planning Commission Study Session, participants discussed the pros and
 cons of the opportunity sites identified at the previous Community Workshop. Based on
 this discussion the Planning Commission chose the opportunity sites that were determined
 to be the most suitable.
 Any future revisions to the draft Housing Element, including any revisions made to respond
 to HCD’s review comments will be provided to the public on the City’s website. Prior to
 the City Council’s adoption of the Housing Element, the document will be made
 available for formal public review for a period of at least 30 days.
The following notes were taken during the January 21, 2014 Study Session, February 25, 2014
and March 11, 2014 Community Workshop and March 25 Planning Commission Study
Session.
                                                                                       A-1

                                                                                    A-2

Summary of 2-25-14 Community Workshop
Questions from Participants
   1. What is “Housing Need”?
   2. Do all of the city’s Regional Housing Need Allocations need to be built during the
       time period?
   3. What are the impacts of SB 375 and SB 2 on the city’s RHNA?
   4. What are the impacts of not completing the Housing Element?
   5. What is the timeframe for completion of the Housing Element?
   6. What is the percent of low income housing in Saratoga?
   7. Would owners of commercial properties identified for housing opportunities be
       forced to sell their properties?

       current housing element?
   12. Does Saratoga have Section 8 housing?
   13. Is there state funding available for affordable housing development?
Comments
   1. The City needs to take a creative approach to providing affordable housing in
       Saratoga.
   2. The City should encourage more homeowners to provide second units.
   3. The City should annex Saratoga Springs Park where low income people are
       already living.
   4. The City should find a way to get credit toward the RHNA for the many households
       that have multiple generations living under one roof.
                                                                                     A-3

Summary of 3-11-14 Community Workshop
Questions from Participants
    1. What is an affordable unit? How much would it rent for? How much would it sell
        for? What income would a person earn to be considered low-income? What does
        affordable mean? Can we mandate rental vs. for-sale units?
    2. What is a mixed use development? How much residential vs. how much
        commercial development would be built?
    3. How is the RHNA count allocated? How does Plan Bay Area and the Sustainable
        Community Strategy figure into the Housing Element update? How does SB1 and
        SB33 factor into Housing Element update?
    4. Will the City rezone large lot residential neighborhoods for smaller lots? What is the
        reality that any of the sites identified will be developed during the time frame of
        the Housing Element?
Comments
Not enough people are present tonight to make a decision on what sites should be
selected to accommodate housing.
Why aren’t property owners of these sites here tonight?
How will development impacts be addressed?
What is the maximum height a fire truck ladder can reach?
Why did 75 units recently get approved at the Odd Fellows property?
Potential Sites Discussed
Village
Meaningful development in the Village is limited by small lot sizes
Can city parking lots be used for podium style housing development?
Argonaut Center
Why use Argonaut shopping center (Safeway) as a site when there are only 2 grocery
stores in Saratoga?
Why not build a shopping center like the Safeway in Los Gatos with parking below and
housing above?
Safeway site is not near transit and would create too much traffic.
Properties that are in good shape with newer/viable commercial are harder to make
feasible as housing sites.
General consensus that Safeway was not a good site.
Quito Center
Can we convert Roku buildings into housing units?
Roku is doing very well and actually needs room to expand. It wouldn’t be suitable to
convert these buildings to housing; but the site would be viable for redevelopment with
mixed use.
                                                                                         A-4

The neighborhood is very concerned about traffic issues with new development.
Residential development creates less traffic than office development
Prospect Sites
Why limit the height at Prospect to just 35 feet & 3 stories? Because this is the highest limit
of any zone in the city.
How do these sites compare to development in adjacent San Jose sites? San Jose
standard in the area is 55 dwelling units/acre for residential development.
Let’s look at the triangular site at the intersections of Hamilton and Campbell Ave in San
Jose as an example of affordable housing. 4 stories over podium parking.
Abrams Site
What are zoning and height limits at Abrams site? 20 units/acre and 2 story/30 foot height
limit.
Mr. Abrams is holding on to the property and wants the site to be used for office
development.
Second Units
How do we keep track of how many 2nd units we have? Can we institute an Amnesty
program to try and get all unpermitted 2nd units permitted?
Prioritization of Sites
22 units at Saratoga Village Center
58 at Southwest Gateway sites
108 at Abrams site
Increase height and density at Prospect site to accommodate an additional 96 units
                                                                                          A-5

Summary of 3-25-14 Planning Commission Study Session
All Planning Commissioners were present at the meeting; and approximately 25
community members were in attendance.
CDD James Lindsay began the meeting giving a recap of the information that has been
shared to date about the Housing Element Update. He then discussed proposed
changes to the Second Unit ordinance to encourage greater development of 2 nd units,
including eliminating the minimum square footage requirement for 2 nd units and
reductions to the minimum lot size required for 2nd units. (See attached Meeting Poster
notes with proposed Zoning Ordinance amendment language).
Mr. Lindsay further discussed proposed Zoning Ordinance amendments to require a
minimum of 30 dwelling units per acre in the C-N(RHD) zone and allow for a building
height of three stories up to a maximum of 35 feet, with a corresponding General Plan
amendment.
Consultant Geoff Bradley discussed why planning in an allowance of additional housing
units as a buffer is recommended for this cycle of Saratoga’s Housing Element Update.
Mr. Lindsay summarized the following housing candidate sites where no rezoning would
be necessary:
Housing Candidate Sites:
Saratoga Village Center          22 units (@20 du/ac)
Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road 65 units (@15 du/ac)
Saratoga Avenue @ Cox            81 units (@15 du/ac)
Several comments were submitted to the City since the last community workshop
regarding traffic impacts from development of the Saratoga Avenue @ Cox site. Mr.
Lindsay presented different peak hour traffic comparisons to illustrate the differences in
trip generation of office and residential uses.
Saratoga Avenue @ Cox - Conceptual Peak Hour Traffic Comparisons:
100% Office            118,000 SF (25% FAR)         180± Trips

Several community members asked questions of the Planning Staff and consultants. The
following summarizes those questions and responses where appropriate:
    1. Can we designate the Bellicitti properties on Quito and Allendale for additional
        housing? – No, although they are already zoned for residential, they are both tied
        up in long term Williamson Act contracts for continued agricultural use.
    2. Our prior RHNA was only around 230 units, why did it double? – It is a calculation
        prepared by ABAG, based on our “fair share” of the regions housing needs.
    3. Why does the City need to be in compliance with State Law? – Primary reason is to
        avoid lawsuits.
    4. What are deed restricted units?- Units that have restrictions recorded on the title
        requiring that they be rented or sold to lower and moderate income people.
    5. Are lost revenues from conversion of commercial property factored into selection
        of these sites for housing? -Generally not, due to the fact that these sites are
        underutilized and not generating significant revenue for the city. Additionally,
        since these units will likely be condominiums or townhomes, they have a higher
        turnover rate, and could potentially generate more property tax revenues than
        other office uses.
    6. Why can’t the City designate the Prospect site for 40 to 50 units per acre to satisfy
        all the RHNA? – The site is proposed at a minimum of 30 dwelling units per acre
        and could potentially be developed higher, but the City still needs to
        accommodate moderate income people and families at lower densities.
The Planning Commission began the conversation of which sites they think would be the
best to accommodate the city’s housing needs. The Saratoga Village Center was
accepted as a Candidate Site. Several concerns were raised about both of the other
sites including; traffic, impacts to schools, loss of commercial sites, and impacts to
neighboring residents. The Planning Commission then opened the discussion back up to
the community to hear the pros and cons for each of the sites.
                                                                                         A-7

Saratoga Avenue@ Cox Site
 Pros                                          Cons
    1. Plan for the site now vs. face           1. If it’s developed for housing it could
        development pressures in the future        never be used as a park
    2. Professional Office is not a high        2. Traffic is terrible on Saratoga Avenue
        demand land use                            because it is near the Hwy 85
                                                   interchange
    3. Development pressure currently           3. Site might be used for future lightrail
        exists                                     parking
    4. The site can accommodate more            4. Identifying site for housing limits future
        units than the Saratoga-Sunnyvale          development, such as for a Roku

Summary of 6-24-14 Planning Commission Study Session – Draft Housing Element Review
All Planning Commissioners, except Commissioner Grover, were present at the meeting;
and approximately 5 community members were in attendance.
The Planning Commission Chair, Mary Lynne Bernald gave an overview of Housing
Element law and Consultant Heather Bradley presented the Draft Housing Element.
Community members had the following questions which were answered by City Staff and
the Consultants.
  1. Will residential uses displace commercial properties?
  2. Do students in existing housing count as student housing?
  3. Vacancy rates on page 218 do not add up.
  4. The age of housing stock not relevant to Saratoga when properties are worth so
      much.
  5. Why should the city have to provide affordable housing when people cannot afford
      to live here – people could move somewhere else to buy a house?
  6. The City Council should contact state to object RHNA.
  7. There are not enough people attending this meeting to decide the fate of the entire
      city of Saratoga.
  8. Was the potential for student housing at West Valley College reviewed?
  9. There is a water shortage and there is not enough water for all these new homes
      that are to be built.
  10. Is highlighting underutilized sites cost driven?
  11. How much of the new housing will really be affordable?
  12. When do the new policies take affect?
  13. Are we lowering our standards in this city?
                                                                                   A-9

  A. Sites to Accommodate the 2014-2022 RHNA
State law requires each jurisdiction in California to demonstrate the availability of
adequate sites through appropriate zoning and development standards and the
availability of public services and facilities. These available sites must provide the
necessary policy and regulatory guidance to accommodate a variety of housing types
at a variety income levels. The City must demonstrate through policies and regulations
that the estimated capacity of adequate sites will be able to accommodate the
projected housing need for the 2015-2023 Planning Period.
The State Department of Finance (DOF) is responsible for projecting the total State-wide
housing demand, with the State Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) apportioning this demand to each of the State’s regional governing bodies. This
demand represents the number of additional units needed to accommodate the
anticipated growth in the number of households, to replace expected demolitions and
conversions of housing units to non-housing units, and to achieve a future vacancy rate
that allows for healthy functioning of the housing market.
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is the Metropolitan Planning
Organization (MPO), for determining and allocating the region’s projected new housing
demand to municipalities within the MPO’s jurisdiction. The allocation of projected
housing demand is divided into four income categories:
       Very Low-Income: 0 percent to 50 percent of the area median income;
       Low-Income: 51 percent to 80 percent of the area median income;
       Moderate-Income: 81 percent to 120 percent of the area median income; and
       Above Moderate-Income: more than 120 percent of the median income.
Pursuant to AB 2634 (Statutes of 2006), the City of Saratoga must also address the
projected housing need for Extremely Low-Income (ELI) households. ELI households are
defined as households earning less than 30 percent of the area’s median income. The
projected Extremely Low-Income need can be assumed as 50 percent of the total need
for Very Low-Income households.
Through the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) process, regional-level housing
growth needs are allocated to individual cities and counties comprising the Metropolitan
Planning Organization (MPO). The allocation takes into account factors such as market
demand for housing, employment opportunities, the availability of suitable sites and
public facilities, commuting patterns, type and tenure of housing need, and others. In
determining a jurisdiction’s share of new housing needs by income category, the
allocation is adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower income households in any
one jurisdiction.
                                                                                     B-1

The current RHNA prepared by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) allocates
housing needs for the period from January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2022. The RHNA identifies
439 units as the city of Saratoga’s share of the region’s housing for the 2015-2023 planning
period. This section documents the availability of sites for future development and the
adequacy of these sites to address Saratoga's regional housing needs. The City plans to
fulfill its share of regional housing needs through:
          Residential projects in process with occupancy post January 1, 2014;
          Vacant and underutilized sites currently zoned for residential and mixed use
           development; and
          Second units.
1. Projects in Process
           a.      Approved Units
Several residential projects with development entitlements will contribute towards
addressing Saratoga's housing needs. Projects range in size from several small 2 to 3 unit
projects to a 12 unit condominium development, and will provide a total of 23 new units.
As indicated in Table B-1, all of these units are market rate and would thus be suitable for
Above Moderate Income households.

           b.    Approved Subdivisions
In addition to the projects with entitlements described above, as of March 2014, the City
has approved 10 new single family residential parcels which remain to be developed.
Given current market demand, the City anticipates applications for these units to be
approved and the units to be constructed within the 2015-2023 Housing Element planning
period. Table B-2 shows the locations of these pending units. These units would be
affordable to Above Moderate income households.
                                                                                           B-2

2. Sites Capacity to Meet Regional Share Goals
To enable the City of Saratoga to meet RHNA goals, the City must evaluate its capacity
to provide available sites to meet projected future housing needs. Subtracting the 33 units
in approved projects and subdivisions described above, the City has a remaining RHNA
need of 406 units. The City must demonstrate it has or will make available adequate sites
with appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities to
accommodate the remaining RHNA need.
As presented in the following section, the City has identified sufficient vacant and
underutilized sites to accommodate its regional growth needs, and will adopt
supplemental zoning and development standards to specifically encourage and
facilitate housing for lower income households.
         a.        Vacant Land
Most of the vacant land in the city of Saratoga is located in hillside areas. Table B-3
summarizes the vacant land in the city currently zoned for residential use. It is assumed the
estimated capacity of 77 dwelling units would provide residential units suitable to Above-
Moderate Income households.
                                                                                             B-3

          b.       Prospect Road Candidate C-N(RHD) Sites for Mixed-Use Development
As part of the 2007-2014 Housing Element, the City identified six adjoining parcels located
on Prospect Road between Saratoga Avenue and Lawrence Expressway suitable for multi-
family development. These parcels were rezoned from Commercial Neighborhood (CN)
to Commercial Neighborhood Residential High Density C-N(RHD) during the 2007-2014
planning cycle to encourage mixed-use development with a minimum net density
standard of 20 du/ac, allowing units to be counted towards the City’s lower income site
requirement pursuant to the default densities specified under AB 2348. Mixed-use
development is permitted by right in the in the C-N(RHD) district.
The potential development capacity was planned at 87 dwelling units on the identified
underutilized sites utilizing the 20 du/ac density standard. The City has determined that
these parcels can accommodate additional development beyond 20 du/ac given the
density of existing development in the vicinity. Parcels in the city of San Jose border the
candidate sites on three sides. City of San Jose development regulations for this area allow
residential densities starting at 55 du/ac. To make this accommodation the City of
Saratoga will modify the existing C-N(RHD) ordinance to allow for increased height from 30
feet to 35 feet and increase the permitted number of stories from two to three in order to
allow mixed-use development with a residential density of at least 30 du/ac. There is
potential to develop 183 units on the sites utilizing the 30 du/ac density standard. Table B-
4 describes the realistic development capacity for each of the six parcels.
                                                                                                  B-4

Prospect Road Sites Realistic Capacity
Existing uses within the six underutilized parcels consist of single-story retail, fast food
restaurant and carwash uses surrounded by parking. The uses are located in older single
story structures built between the 1960s and 1980’s. The structures are characterized by
outdated architectural styles consisting of flat roofs with interior court parking offering
limited retail exposure.
These sites are well-suited for higher density residential development. The parcels are
located along a major transportation corridor and easily accessed by bus transit with
proximity to an expressway. Across from these parcels is a grocery store, retail mall and
high school. The parcels contain adequate infrastructure to support residential
development and no environmental constraints have been identified with the potential
to limit residential development.
                                                   The six parcels are located near higher
                                                   density developments in the neighboring city
                                                   of San Jose. These projects illustrate the
                                                   development trends occurring in the area.
                                                   The City of Saratoga adopted ordinance
                                                   amendments to permit mixed-use with high
                                                   density residential on these six Candidate
                                                   Sites under the new C-N(RHD) zoning district
                                                   (15-19.035). The minimum residential density is
                                                   20 units per net acre conforming to the
    Existing development at the Prospect Road Site design  standards of the Mixed-Use ordinance
                                                   (15-58).    This  C-N(RHD)     district  also
accommodates emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing for
homeless individuals and families. To further encourage development of mixed-use high
density housing in Saratoga, this Housing Element update includes policy actions that
amend the existing zoning standards for these parcels to allow for increased densities at
a minimum of 30 dwelling units per net acre with height allowance increases of three
stories and 35 feet. This Housing Element update continues to include policy actions to
support partnerships with the development community to provide housing opportunities
for lower income households; and encourage lot consolidation of smaller parcels.
Consistent with SB 2, the City has adopted provisions for Emergency Shelters within the C-
N(RHD) zoning district. In order to reserve C-N(RHD) acreage for potential emergency
shelter use, the City has reduced the total acreage on these six parcels available for
mixed use development by 0.3 acres and reduced the corresponding unit potential by
ten units. The City has determined that there is a potential capacity of 173 dwelling units
on these parcels given the following considerations:
          Site size,
          Accommodation of ground floor commercial uses fronting the street,
          Recent development trends occurring in the area,
          Availability of adequate infrastructure and services,
          Acreage reduction for emergency shelters, and
                                                                                            B-7

            Ordinance amendments to require a minimum net density of 30 du/ac.
           c.          Saratoga Village Center Candidate Sites for Mixed-Use Development
    The City has identified two adjoining parcels with potential for residential development on
    Big Basin Way (known as the historic Saratoga Village). These parcels are located between
    Highway 9 and Third Street, and are zoned Commercial Historic District 1 (CH-1). Mixed-use
    development is a conditionally permitted use in this zone. The potential redevelopment
    capacity for these parcels was determined through an evaluation of the longstanding
    retail vacancies at the site, past development interest in the site and existing capacity
    under current zoning regulations. The site can accommodate 22 units at a density of 20
    dwelling units per net acre with a mix of commercial uses. Table B-5 describes the realistic
    development capacity for each of the three parcels that make up the site. Exhibit B-1
    shows the location of the three parcels.

    Saratoga Village Center Sites Realistic Capacity
    Existing uses within the two underutilized parcels consist of retail and service uses setback
    from the street and surrounded by parking. The uses are located in single story structures
    built in the 1950’s and 1960’s. The structures have been predominately vacant for a number
    of years following the discontinued operation of a small grocery market. The shopping
    center is characterized by outdated ranch style architecture and building orientation that
    provides limited retail exposure. The large surface parking lot in the front of the property is
    inconsistent with the development pattern and character of the Village along Big Basin
    Way.
                                                                                                          B-8

                                                 The City reviewed an application for mixed-use
                                                 development on the site in 2009 that included
                                                 25 residential units and 21,571 square feet of
                                                 commercial space. For economic reasons the
                                                 development was not pursued at that time.
                                                 However, the City has determined that the
                                                 current market conditions and the site’s prime
                                                 location near the gateway of the downtown
                                                 make the site well suited for increased
                                                 commercial density mixed with medium density
 Existing development at Saratoga Village Center residential development.
The City had determined that the Saratoga Village Center sites are suitable for
development of 22 units. The sites are located in close proximity to other multi-family
development, bus transit and Highway 9.
         d.       Saratoga Gateway Candidate Sites for Mixed-Use Development
The City has identified four adjoining parcels with potential for residential development on
Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road (known as the Gateway Area). These parcels are located on
the west side of Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road to the north of the Southern Pacific Railroad
line, and are zoned Commercial Visitor (C-V). Mixed-use development is a conditionally
permitted use in this zone. The City has determined the potential redevelopment capacity
for these parcels based on the underutilized nature of the site, past and current
development trends in the vicinity, and existing capacity under current zoning regulations.
The site can accommodate 65 units at a density of 15 dwelling units per acre with a mix of
commercial uses. The unit potential was determined through an evaluation of the site’s
proximity to a moderate density housing development located adjacent to the site, and
the development trend within the city’s Gateway Area of housing units located behind a
new commercial building. Table B-6 describes the realistic development capacity for each
of the four parcels that make up the site. Exhibit B-1 shows the location of the four parcels.

                                                    The City has identified Fellowship Plaza as
                                                    having     the    greatest    potential      to

       f.          Second Unit Potential
City records show that a total of 65 Second Dwelling Units were constructed between 2001
and 2014, with 22 approved during the most recent 2007-2014 planning period (Table 2-
20). The City anticipates that demand for future Second Dwelling Unit permits will increase
with modifications to the City’s Second Unit Ordinance through adoption of the 2015-2023
Housing Element. Ordinance modifications will include elimination of the minimum unit size
and reductions to the requirements for minimum lot size. To further encourage second unit
development, the City will prepare an informational brochure as part of an overall
program to encourage second unit development. Taking into consideration the strong
support for second units expressed at the Housing Element community workshops, and past
construction achievements, the City anticipates receiving applications for an average of
4 to 5 second units per year. The City’s goal is to achieve 35 Second Dwelling Units over the
course of the eight year planning period.
                                                                                               B-11

A survey (Craigslist May 9, 2014 & May 20, 2014) of second unit rentals in Saratoga and
surrounding cities showed rents ranging from $850 to $2,000, with a median rent for a 1
bedroom of $1,600 and $1,360 for a studio. These rents are in the range of Very Low to
Moderate affordability for Santa Clara County. Based on feedback from owners of second
units, City staff understands that a large percentage of second units are occupied rent
free by family members or domestic workers. The City does not maintain records on rents
for second units other than deed restricted units. Surveys done in San Mateo County for the
nearby cities of Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos Hills, and Hillsborough indicate that
between 62 and 74 percent of all second units are available to Very Low or Extremely Low
households. These cities are demographically similar to Saratoga. In Saratoga, the majority
of recently constructed second units have utilized the floor area and site coverage bonus
provisions which require that the unit be deed restricted for rent to below market rate
households. During the 2007-2014 Housing Element Cycle, the City issued permits for 18
second units, 13 of which were deed restricted second units. The City estimates that the
deed restricted units would be available for Low income households and the non-deed
restricted units would be available for Moderate income households.
3. Sites Summary
State Housing Element Law requires local governments to prepare an inventory of land
suitable for residential development, including vacant sites, sites having the potential for
redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning, public facilities, and services
to these sites. The inventory of land suitable for residential development must be used to
identify sites that can be developed for housing within the planning period. In terms of
evaluating the adequacy of these sites to address the affordability targets established by
the RHNA, State Housing Element law provides for the use of “default densities” to assess
affordability. Based on its population, Saratoga falls within the default density of 20
units/acre for providing sites affordable to Very Low- and Low-Income households. For
Moderate-Income households, a threshold of 12 units/acre is used to reflect a reasonable
density for achieving moderate income development.
Table B-8 summarizes the City of Saratoga’s capacity to meet RHNA goals.

 B. Assisted Units “At-Risk” of Conversion
 The State Housing Element Law requires jurisdictions to analyze government-assisted
 housing that is eligible for conversion from lower income to market rate housing over the
 next 10 years. State Law identifies housing assistance as a rental subsidy, mortgage
 subsidy, or mortgage insurance to an assisted housing development. Government
 assisted housing converts to market rate housing for a number of reasons including
 expiring subsidies, mortgage repayments, or expiration of affordability restrictions .
 This section will address:
           An inventory of assisted housing units that are “at-risk” of converting
            to market rate housing;
           An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing these units;
           Resources that could be used to preserve “at-risk” units;
           Program efforts for preservation of at-risk housing units; and
           Quantified objectives for the number of “at-risk” units to be
            preserved during the Housing Element Planning Period.
                                                                                                           B-13

1. Inventory of At-Risk Units
As presented in Table B-9 below, Saratoga has two rent-restricted affordable housing
projects within its jurisdiction. Fellowship Plaza, owned by the not-for-profit California Odd
Fellows Foundation, provides 150 apartments for very low income seniors. Saratoga Court
Senior Apartments was acquired in 1982 by the non-profit Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition
(Mid-Pen) and provides 20 very low income independent living units for seniors; the City of
Saratoga provided Mid-Pen with $274,000 in CDBG funds to assist in the acquisition.
                                                       Both of these projects are considered
                                                       potentially at-risk of conversion during the
                                                       ensuing ten years due to expiring use restrictions
                                                       and Section 8 contracts subject to periodic
                                                       renewals. However, both projects are owned
                                                       and managed by non-profit organizations that
                                                       have a public purpose to develop and
                                                       maintain affordable housing for low income
                                                       and special needs populations; and are thus
Saratoga Court Complex
                                                       considered at low risk of conversion.

2. Preservation and Replacement Costs
As both at-risk projects in Saratoga are already owned by non-profit entities, their
conversion to market rate rentals is highly unlikely. Nonetheless, as the HUD Section 8
contracts and/or capital subsidies have the potential to expire within the next ten years,
for purposes of the Housing Element, these projects are technically considered at potential
risk of conversion.
Preservation or replacement of Saratoga's at-risk projects can be achieved in two primary
ways: 1) provision of rental assistance using other sources of funds; or 2) replacement or
                                                                                                   B-14
development of new affordable rental units. These options are discussed below, along with
a general cost estimate for each.
     a. Rental Assistance
The long-term availability of funding at the federal level for Section 8 contract renewal is
uncertain. If terminated, rent subsidies using alternative State or local funding sources
could be used to maintain affordability. Subsides could be structured similar to the Section
8 program, whereby HUD pays the owners the difference between what tenants can
afford to pay (30% household income) and what HUD establishes as the Fair Market Rent
(FMR).
The feasibility of this alternative, in the case of the property owners, depends on their
willingness to continue to accept rental vouchers and limit rents to fair market levels. Non-
profit owners are more likely to be willing to accept other rent subsidies, while for-profit
owners will compare the negotiated rents to market rents.
As depicted in Table B-10, the cost of providing rent subsidies to all 170 at-risk units in
Saratoga (the difference between HUD Fair market Rents and maximum affordable rents
for very low income households) is generally estimated at $516,000 per year, translating to
roughly $10 million in subsidies over a 20-year period.

         b. Replacement Cost
Saratoga may consider the cost of unit replacement with new construction. Construction
cost estimates include per unit land costs and all hard and soft costs associated with
construction. The analysis assumes the replacement units are garden-style apartments
with parking provided on-site, with an average construction cost of $150 per square foot;
podium style development is typically twice the cost. Square footage estimates are
based on the average unit size per the prevailing sales in the region. Land costs have
been estimated based on a handful of multi-family property sales in Saratoga over the
past several years, which average $100 per square foot.
                                                                                                           B-15

3 Assumes $150 per square foot construction costs and $100 per square foot multi-family land costs.
c.       Cost Comparison
Given their non-profit ownership, it is highly unlikely that either of the two “at risk” projects
will convert to market-uses. Nevertheless, the above analysis attempts to estimate the cost
of preserving the at-risk units under various options. The annual cost of providing rental
subsidies required to preserve the 170 assisted units is relatively low at $516,000. However,
long-term affordability of the units cannot be ensured in this manner, unless it was
structured as a one-time rent buy-down. The option of acquiring or developing 170
replacement units is very costly at an estimated $33 million and constrained by a variety of
factors, including limited purchase opportunities of large multi-family properties and the
scarcity of land for new development. The best option to preserve the at-risk units thus
appears to be the purchase of affordability covenants through a one-time rent buy-down.
3.       Resources for Preservation
A variety of programs exist to assist cities acquire, replace, or subsidize at-risk affordable
housing units. The following summarizes financial resources available to the City of
Saratoga.
           i.     Federal Programs
               HOME Investment Partnership – HOME funds are granted by formula basis
                from HUD to increase the supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable
                housing to lower income households. Eligible activities include new
                construction, acquisition, rental assistance and rehabilitation.
               Section 8 Rental Assistance Program – The Section 8 Rental Assistance
                program provides rental assistance payments to owners of private, market
                rate units on behalf of very low-income tenants.
               Section 811/202 Program (Supportive Housing for Person with
                Disabilities/Elderly) – Non-profit and consumer cooperatives can receive no
                                                                                                              B-16

       interest capital advances from HUD under the Section 202 program for the
       construction of very low-income rental housing for seniors and persons with
       disabilities. These funds can be used in conjunction with Section 811, which
       can be used to develop group homes, independent living facilities and
       immediate care facilities. Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation,
       new construction and rental assistance.
 ii.   State Programs
      California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) Multifamily Programs – CalFHA’s
       Multifamily Programs provide permanent financing for the acquisition,
       rehabilitation, and preservation or new construction of rental housing that
       includes affordable rents for low- and moderate- income families and
       individuals. One of the programs is the Acquisition Finance Program, which is
       designed to facilitate the acquisition of at-risk affordable housing
       developments and provide low cost funding to preserve affordability.
      Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) – This program provides tax credits to
       individuals and corporations that invest in low-income rental housing. Tax
       credits are sold to those with high liability and proceeds are used to create
       housing. Eligible activities include new construction, rehabilitation and
       acquisition of properties.
      California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC) – The California
       Community Reinvestment Corporation is a multi-family affordable housing
       lender whose mission is to increase the availability of affordable housing for
       low-income families, seniors, and residents with special needs by facilitating
       private capital flow from its investors for debt and equity to developers of
       affordable housing. Eligible activities include new construction, rehabilitation
       and acquisition of properties.
iii.   Local Programs
      Monitoring At-Risk Units – Through the Community Development Department,
       the City continually monitors the eligibility of affordable housing to convert to
       market-rate housing. Constant monitoring allows the City to anticipate the
       timeframe by which affordability covenants would expire, allowing the City to
       implement various resources to ensure the continued affordability of the
       housing units.
iv.    Qualified Entities
The following lists qualified entities who are interested in purchasing government-
subsidized multi-family projects within Santa Clara County.
      Affordable Housing Foundation
      BRIDGE Housing Corporation
                                                                                      B-17

           Cambrian Center, Inc.
           Charities Housing Development Corporation
           Christian Church Homes of Northern California, Inc.
           Community Home Builders and Associates
           Community Housing Developers, Inc.
           Matinah Salaam
           Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition
           Palo Alto Housing Corporation
           Palo Alto Senior Housing Project, Inc.
           Satellite Housing, Inc.
           South County Housing, Inc.
      a. Quantified Objectives
Housing Element law requires that cities establish the maximum number of units that can
be preserved over the planning period. Two assisted projects with a total of 170 units are
at-risk of converting to market-rate housing within the planning period. Should either of
these properties lose their current funding subsidies and be at real risk of conversion, the
City of Saratoga will explore appropriate funding opportunities to assist in their
preservation.
                                                                                        B-18

Program 2.5: Review In-Lieu Park Facilities Fee for Affordable Housing Development
                         To ensure that the existing in-lieu park facilities fee is not a
                         constraint on the development of affordable housing, the City
                         shall review the fee and revise, as appropriate. If the City does
Program Activity         not revise the fee, alternative strategies will be considered to
                         address any potential future constraints to the development of
                         housing.

                         provisions.
                         Second dwelling units are a source of housing for low income
                         households. The City encourages their development by providing
                         a 10 percent increase in floor and lot coverage if the units are
Level of Achievement     deed restricted, thereby limiting their rental to below market rate.
                         Thirteen deed restricted units and five non-deed restricted units
                         were permitted during this period.

                       The City Council adopted Ordinance 277 on April 21, 2010 that
Level of Achievement   included a new zoning district C-N(RHD) that allowed the siting
                       of emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive
                       housing for homeless individuals and families.
Program 5.4: Reasonable Accommodations
                       To comply with State law (SB 520), the City will analyze
                       existing land use controls, building codes, and permit and
                       processing procedures to determine constraints they impose on
                       the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing
                       for persons with disabilities. Based on its findings, the City will
Program Activity       develop a policy for reasonable accommodation to provide
                       relief to Code regulations and permitting procedures that have
                       a discriminatory effect on housing for individuals with
                       disabilities. The policy shall include procedures for requesting
                       accommodation, a timeline for processing and appeals, and
                       criteria for determining whether a requested accommodation
                       is reasonable.
                       The City Council adopted Ordinance 277 on April 21, 2010 that
Level of Achievement   established a process for reasonable accommodations to
                       provide relief to Code regulations and permitting procedures to
                       individuals with disabilities.
                                                                                            C-8

Program 5.5: Zoning to Encourage and Facilitate Single-Room Occupancy Units
(SRO’s)
                        The City understands the importance of single-room
                        occupancy units to provide housing opportunities for lower-
                        income individuals, persons with disabilities, the elderly and
                        formerly homeless individuals. The City shall amend the Zoning
Program Activity        Code to establish explicit definitions for and regulatory
                        standards addressing single- room occupancy units. The
                        Zoning Code will include development standards and
                        permitting procedures that encourage and facilitate
                        development of SRO housing, consistent with State law.
                        The City Council adopted Ordinance 313 on February 5, 2014
Level of Achievement    to amend the Zoning Code to include development standards
                        for Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing.
Program 5.6: Monitoring and Preservation of Existing Affordable Housing
                        The City s hall continue to maintain a data base to provide
                        for the regular monitoring of deed-restricted units that have
                        the potential of converting to market- rate during the
                        planning period. Additionally, the City will review funding
                        opportunities for owners of these units to extend and/or renew
Program Activity        deed restrictions and/or covenants.
                        To proactively address the conversion of affordable units to
                        market-rate units concern, the City will investigate strategies
                        to preserve the affordable units. The City shall ensure
                        compliance with noticing requirements and provide for
                        tenant education when a notice of conversion is received.
                        The City maintains a list of the affordable units within the City
                        and along with the County of Santa Clara Office of Affordable
Level of Achievement    Housing is prepared to ensure compliance with noticing
                        requirements and tenant education when notice of conversion
                        is received. No deed restricted units were converted during this
                        period.
                                                                                          C-9

                        evaluate the effectiveness of its partnerships with housing
                        developers and seek ways to expand and foster its
                        partnerships as appropriate.
                        The City is prepared to cooperate with developers in the
Level of Achievement construction of affordable housing by helping to identify possible
                        sites that could be rezoned to promote a variety of housing
                        types, such as rental units, affordable to lower income
                        households.

Ordinance. A law or regulation set forth and adopted by a governmental authority,
usually a city or county.
Overcrowding Housing Unit. A housing unit in which the members of the household or
group are prevented from the enjoyment of privacy because of small room size and
housing size. The U.S. Bureau of Census defines an overcrowded housing unit as one
which is occupied by more than one person per room.
Parcel. A lot or tract of land.
Planned Unit. Development (PUD) A self-contained development, often with a mixture
of housing types and densities, in which subdivision and zoning controls are applied
to the project as a whole rather than to individual lots, as in most subdivisions. Densities
and lot sizes are calculated for the entire development, usually permitting a trade-off
between the clustering of houses and provision of common open space or other
amenities.
Planning Area. The area directly addressed by the general plan. A city’s planning area
typically encompasses the city limits and potentially annexable land within its sphere of
influence.
Policy. A specific statement of principle or of guiding actions that implies a clear
commitment but is not mandatory. A general direction that a governmental agency
sets to follow, in order to meet its objectives before undertaking an action program. (See
“Program.”)
Poverty Level. As used by the U.S. Census, families and unrelated individuals are
classified as being above or below the poverty level based on a poverty index that
provides a range of income cutoffs or “poverty thresholds” varying by size of family,
number of children, and age of householder. The income cutoffs are updated each
year to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index.
Program. An action, activity, or strategy carried out in response to adopted policy to
achieve a specific goal or objective. Policies and programs establish the “who,” “how”
and “when” for carrying out the “what” and “where” of goals and objectives.
Redevelop. To demolish existing buildings; or to increase the overall floor area existing
on a property; or both; irrespective of whether a change occurs in land use.
Regional. Pertaining to activities or economies at a scale greater than that of a single
jurisdiction, and affecting a broad geographic area.
Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). A quantification by ABAG of existing and
projected housing need, by household income group, for all localities within a region.
                                                                                       D-6

Rehabilitation. The repair, preservation, and/or improvement of substandard housing.
Residential. Land designated in the General Plan and zoning ordinance for building
consisting of dwelling units. May be improved, vacant, or unimproved. (See “Dwelling
Unit.”)
Residential Care Facility. A facility that provides 24-hour care and supervision to its
residents.
Residential, Multiple Family. Usually three or more dwelling units on a single site, which
may be in the same or separate buildings.
Residential, Single-Family. A single dwelling unit on a building site.
Retrofit. To add materials and/or devices to an existing building or system to improve its
operation, safety, or efficiency. Buildings have been retrofitted to use solar energy and
to strengthen their ability to withstand earthquakes, for example.
Rezoning. An amendment to the map to effect a change in the nature, density, or
intensity of uses allowed in a zoning district and/or on a designated parcel or land area.
Second Unit. A self-contained living unit, either attached to or detached from, and in
addition to, the primary residential unit on a single lot. “Granny Flat” is one type of
second unit.
Section 8 Rental Assistance Program. A federal (HUD) rent-subsidy program that is one
of the main sources of federal housing assistance for low-income households. The
program operates by providing “housing assistance payments” to owners, developers,
and public housing agencies to make up the difference between the “Fair Market Rent”
of a unit (set by HUD) and the household’s contribution toward the rent, which is
calculated at 30% of the household’s adjusted gross monthly income (GMI). “Section 8”
includes programs for new construction, existing housing, and substantial or moderate
housing rehabilitation.
Shared Living. The occupancy of a dwelling unit by persons of more than one family in
order to reduce housing expenses and provide social contact, mutual support, and
assistance. Shared living facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted in all
residential districts by §1566.3 of the California Health and Safety Code.
Single-family Dwelling, Attached. A dwelling unit occupied or intended for occupancy
by only one household that is structurally connected with at least one other such
dwelling unit. (See “Townhouse.”)
                                                                                      D-7

Single-family Dwelling, Detached. A dwelling unit occupied or intended for occupancy
by only one household that is structurally independent from any other such dwelling unit
or structure intended for residential or other use. (See “Family.”)
Single Room Occupancy (SRO). A single room, typically 80-250 square feet, with a sink
and closet, but which requires the occupant to share a communal bathroom, shower,
and kitchen.
Subsidize. To assist by payment of a sum of money or by the granting to terms or favors
that reduces the need for monetary expenditures. Housing subsidies may take the forms
of mortgage interest deductions or tax credits from federal and/or state income taxes,
sale or lease at less than market value of land to be used for the construction of housing,
payments to supplement a minimum affordable rent, and the like.
Substandard Housing. Residential dwellings that, because of their physical condition, do
not provide safe and sanitary housing.
 Supportive Housing. Housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the
 target population as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 53260(d),
 and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident
 in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her
 ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. “Target population" means
 adults with low incomes having one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or
 AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for
 services provided under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act and
 may, among other populations, include families with children, elderly persons, young
 adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings,
 veterans, or homeless people. [California Health and Safety Code Sections 50675.14(b)
 and 53260(d)]
Target Areas. Specifically designated sections of the community where loans and grants
are made to bring about a specific outcome, such as the rehabilitation of housing
affordable by very-low and low-income households.
Tax Increment. Additional tax revenues that result from increases in property values
within a redevelopment area. State law permits the tax increment to be earmarked for
redevelopment purposes but requires at least 20% to be used to increase and improve
the community’s supply of very low and low income housing.
Tenure. A housing unit is “owned” if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it is
“owned only if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. A cooperative or condominium unit
is “owned only if the owner or co-owner lives in it. All other occupied units are classified
as “rented,” including units rented for cash rent and those occupied without payment
of cash rent.
                                                                                          D-8

Townhouse. A townhouse is a dwelling unit located in a group of three (3) or more
attached dwelling units with no dwelling unit located above or below another and with
each dwelling unit having its own exterior entrance.
Transitional Housing. Shelter provided to the homeless for an extended period, often as
long as 18 months, and generally integrated with other social services and counseling
programs to assist in the transition to self-sufficiency through the acquisition of a stable
income and permanent housing. (See “homeless” and “Emergency Shelter.”)
Undevelopable. Specific areas where topographic, geologic, and/or superficial soil
conditions indicate a significant danger to future occupants and a liability to the City
are designated as “undevelopable” by the City.

I.    INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element of the General Plan provides a basis for comprehensive local programs to control and
abate environmental noise and to protect citizens from excessive exposure. The Noise Element has been
prepared to meet the requirements of California Planning law Section 65302 (f), which requires a Noise
Element as one of the seven mandatory elements. The Noise Element has been prepared in recognition
of the guidelines adopted by the State Office of Noise Control pursuant to the Health and Safety Code.
The Noise Element quantifies the community noise environment in terms of noise exposure contours for
both the near and long-term levels of growth and traffic activity.
P urpose and Goal of Noise Elem ent
The purpose of the Noise Element is to characterize existing and potential future environmental noise
levels for use in various land-use planning processes. The Noise Element is intended to be used by the
community in the goal of preserving the quiet residential environment of Saratoga. This is done by
controlling noise in all zone districts to levels that are compatible with existing and future land uses.
II. ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE FUNDAMENTALS
Airborne sound is a rapid fluctuation of air pressure above and below atmospheric pressure. Noise is
usually defined as unwanted sound. Environmental noise is a part of modern society, such as noise from
transportation vehicles, machinery, people, and other devices. Some sounds that are desirable to one
person might be noise to another individual. Therefore, objective measures have been developed to
characterize noise environments. These measures include the following aspects of sound:
•     The frequency spectrum of the sound
•     The time-varying character of the sound
•     The intensity or level of the sound
Frequency Spectrum
The “frequency” of a sound refers to the number of complete pressure fluctuations per second in the
sound. The unit of measurement is cycles per second (cps) or hertz (Hz). Most of the sounds we hear in
the environment do not consist of a single frequency, but rather of a broad band of frequencies, differing
in level. The frequency and level content of a sound is called its sound spectrum.
To permit comparisons of sounds having quite different spectra, frequency weighting methods have been
devised to correlate with human response (i.e., perceived loudness). “A-weighting” progressively
de-emphasizes the importance of frequency components below 1,000 Hz and above 5,000 Hz. This
frequency weighting reflects the fact that human hearing is less sensitive at low frequencies and at
extreme high frequencies relative to the mid-range. The unit of A-weighted sound levels is sometimes
abbreviated “dBA.”
                                                                                                           Page 4

City of Saratoga                                                                               Noise Element
Variation of Sound w ith Tim e
Although a single sound level value can adequately describe environmental noise at any instant in time,
community noise levels vary continuously. Most environmental noise is a conglomeration of distant noise
sources, which results in a relatively steady noise having no identifiable source. These distant sources
could include traffic, wind in trees, or continuous industrial processes and are relatively constant from
moment to moment but usually vary from hour to hour with community activities (e.g., traffic levels).
Superimposed on this slowly varying background is a succession of identifiable noisy events of brief
duration. These might include nearby activities such as single vehicle passbys, train horns, or aircraft
flyovers that cause the environmental noise level to vary from moment to moment.
To describe the time-varying character of environmental noise, statistical noise descriptors were
developed. “L10” is the A-weighted sound level equaled or exceeded during 10 percent of a stated time
period and is considered a good measure of typical maximum sound levels caused by discrete noise
events. The “L90” is the A-weighted sound level equaled or exceeded during 90 percent of a stated time
period and is commonly used to describe the noise.
A single number called “Leq” is also widely used. The term “Leq” originated from the concept of a so-called
Equivalent Sound Level that contains the same acoustical energy as a varying sound level during the
same time period. In other words, the Leq is the average A-weighted sound level in a stated time period.
In determining the daily measure of environmental noise, it is important to account for the different
response of people to daytime and nighttime noise. During the nighttime, exterior noise levels are
generally lower than in the daytime. However, most household noise also decreases at night; thus,
exterior noise intrusions become noticeable. Further, most people trying to sleep at night are more
sensitive to noise. To account for human sensitivity to nighttime noise levels, a special descriptor was
developed. The descriptor is called the DNL (Day-Night Average Sound Level), which represents the
24-hour average sound level with a 10 dB “penalty” for noise occurring at night.
Level of Sound
It has been found that the human ear responds logarithmically to changes in sound pressure levels.
Therefore, sound levels are usually measured and expressed in decibels (dB), with 0 dB corresponding
roughly to the threshold of hearing. A decibel is a logarithmic unit used to describe the intensity or level
of a sound with respect to a standardized reference sound level.
With regard to increases in noise level, knowledge of the following relationships will be helpful in
understanding the quantitative sections of this report:
1. Except in carefully controlled laboratory experiments, a change of only 1 dB in sound level cannot be
      perceived.
2. Outside of the laboratory, a 3 dB change is considered a just-noticeable difference.
3. A change in level of at least 5 dB is required before any noticeable change in community response
      would be expected.
4. A 10 dB change is subjectively heard as approximately a doubling in loudness, and would almost
      certainly cause an adverse community response.
                                                                                                      Page 5

5. Sound levels do not combine arithmetically. Instead, they sum logarithmically, in a manner similar to
      the Richter scale, which is used for measuring the intensity of earthquakes. The following two
      examples illustrate this:
      -    If the existing noise level at a particular location is 60 dB, and a new source of sound with a
           similar spectrum is introduced that also measures 60 dB, the result is not 120 dB; it is 63 dB.
      -    If the existing noise level at a particular location is 60 dB, and a new sound source with a similar
           spectrum is introduced that measures 50 dB, the result is not 110 dB; it is still 60 dB. The new
           source is so much quieter than the existing one that it does not significantly contribute to the
           resulting sound level.
Additional definitions of acoustical terms are listed in Appendix A. Common sound levels found in the
environment are identified in Figure NE-1.

P ropagation of Sound
As sound propagates away from a source, the level is attenuated with increasing distance. In general,
sound radiating from a single object (called a “point” source), like a train horn or rooftop fan, is reduced
by 6 dB for every doubling of distance. Noise radiating from a long single source or long continuous
series of similar sources (called a “line” source) is attenuated by 3 dB for every doubling of distance. A
roadway with varying levels of continuous traffic behaves similar to a line source with noise levels
attenuated by between 3 and 4.5 dB per doubling of distance in typical conditions.
Noise levels can also be reduced by intervening structures. For example, a noise barrier wall or even a
single row of buildings between the receptor and the noise source reduces the noise level by about 5 dB
to 10 dB. Structures also act to insulate people inside these structures from exterior noise. Common
home construction methods generally provide a reduction of exterior-to-interior noise levels of about
20 dB to 30 dB with closed windows.
Effects of N oise on P eople
The typical effects of noise on people are summarized below. The sound levels associated with
environmental noise usually only produce effects in the first four categories.
•     Annoyance is the most difficult of all noise responses to describe. Annoyance is a very individual
      characteristic and can vary widely from person to person. What one person considers acceptable can
      be intolerable to another of equal hearing capability. For example, some people like the sound of
      trains, while others do not.
•     Physiological responses are those measurable noise effects on the human body, such as changes
      in pulse rate, blood pressure, etc. While such effects can be induced and observed, the extent to
      which these physiological responses cause harm or are a sign of harm is not known.
•     Sleep interference is a major concern with respect to transportation-generated noise. Sleep
      disturbance studies have identified interior noise levels attributed to transportation noise as a key
      factor of sleep disturbance. However, sleep disturbance does not necessarily equate to awakening
      from sleep; rather, it can refer to disruption of the sleep pattern and stages of sleep. Train and
      aircraft noise is a major source of complaints.
•     Speech interference is one of the primary concerns associated with environmental noise. Normal
      conversational speech is in the range of 60 to 66 dB. Steady elevated noise levels can interfere with
      speech. Depending on the distance between the speaker and the listener, raised voice levels may be
      required to overcome the background noise.
•     Potential hearing loss is commonly associated with occupational exposures in heavy industry or
      very noisy work environments. Noise levels in neighborhoods, even near very noisy airports, are not
      considered sufficiently loud to cause hearing loss.

III. NOISE ENVIRONMENT IN SARATOGA
Noise exposure in the City of Saratoga is principally generated by vehicular traffic on highways and
arterial roads. Other sources of noise include a spur rail line, distant aircraft, and commercial activities.
Road Traffic
Traffic noise levels depend primarily on vehicular speed and total traffic volume, but also the type of
vehicle. The primary source of noise from automobiles is high-frequency tire noise. Trucks, older
automobiles, and motorcycles produce significant engine and exhaust noise, and trucks can also generate
wind noise. Descriptions of major roadways in the City of Saratoga are found in the Circulation Element
of the General Plan.
Rail
The Southern Pacific rail network includes a spur line extending from San Jose, across Saratoga from
Prospect Road in the north to Quito Road in the southeast. Train passbys occur occasionally. For
example, during a one week survey in 2013, only two train passbys were identified. Often the loudest
noise source associated with rail lines is horn blasts at grade crossings which occur at Arroyo De Arguello,
Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road, Cox Avenue, Glen Brae Drive, and Quito Road. Locomotive, rail car, and wheel
contact are other sources of noise during passbys.
Aircraft
Occasional aircraft flyovers are generated by facilities such as San Jose International Airport, San
Francisco International Airport, and Moffett Field. Aircraft noise in Saratoga is a relatively small part of
the City’s noise environment. Flyovers of large aircraft from San Jose International Airport are at altitudes
that make their noise noticeable, but not intrusive at ground level.
Com m ercial
Commercial concentrations and community and neighborhood shopping centers are located on Saratoga
Avenue and Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road at intersections with other arterial streets. There is also a
neighborhood center on Cox Avenue. The Village is also a concentration of business activities and is the
historic commercial core. Activities such as truck unloading, trash collection, landscape maintenance,
HVAC equipment, and events are sources of environmental noise associated with commercial and
community centers. Facilities located in the Saratoga hills are also associated with event-related noise
that contributes to the noise environment in the City.
Ex isting Traffic N oise Levels
Existing traffic noise levels in the City of Saratoga are assessed via noise measurements and computer-
generated noise contours. The contours are based on both traffic data and noise measurement results.
A noise measurement survey was conducted in Saratoga during July 2013 to determine noise levels
throughout the community. The noise survey consisted of long-term (seven-day) noise measurements at
six locations along major roadways. The noise monitors were installed at a height of 12 feet above grade.
Additional short-term (15-minute) measurements were conducted at an additional six associated locations
along the subject roadways to compare various roadway segments. Results of the survey are listed in
Table NE-1 below. Measurement locations are shown in a map in Appendix B.
                                                                                                          Page 8

City of Saratoga                                                                                   Noise Element
The Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Traffic Noise Model (FHWA-RD-77-108) was used to
calculate traffic noise levels along major roadways in Saratoga using traffic data from Circulation Element
traffic study. Appendix C provides a summary of the results and calculated nominal distances to several
noise contour levels for the existing condition. The analysis of city-wide traffic noise levels and associated
policies were primarily based on these annualized average daily traffic data. The noise measurement
results were used to verify these calculations. The measurements were in-line with calculation results.
The noise contour map of existing conditions generated for highways and major arterials in Saratoga is
contained in Appendix C. The map indicates the noise exposure levels associated with these roadways.
Actual conditions on each property will vary from the contours, particularly at longer distances, due to
such factors as elevation, terrain, noise barriers, and screening. In establishing noise contours for
land-use planning, it is customary to ignore noise attenuation afforded by such factors. The result is a
worst-case estimate of the noise environment. The assumption is that it is preferable to overestimate the
potential noise at a site than to underestimate the noise environment and allow for potentially
incompatible land-use development. However, Saratoga noise contours do account for the depression of
Highway 85 and the virtually continuous noise barriers flanking the roadway since these features have a
significant effect on the traffic noise levels in the surrounding areas.
Future Traffic N oise Levels
Projected future traffic noise levels in the City of Saratoga were calculated based on projected traffic
volume data for major roadways. Estimated future traffic volume data for City roadways in 2030 are
published in the Circulation Element of the General Plan. Estimated future traffic volume for Highway 85
are based on a Caltrans estimate for growth of 3-percent per year. Appendix D provides a summary of
the results and calculated nominal distances to several noise contour levels for the future (2030)
condition and also a map illustrating the noise contours. From existing conditions, traffic noise levels are
expected to increase by between 1 and 3 dB.
IV. ACOUSTICAL STANDARDS
      A.    Land-Use Com patibility (Ex terior Noise I m pacts)
The exterior noise land-use compatibility guidelines shown in Table NE-2 are those recommended as
being environmentally acceptable for approval of new development in the City of Saratoga, consistent
with the previous noise element, and in line with communities similar to the City of Saratoga and State
guidelines.
Noise in the City of Saratoga is generated by a variety of sources. Land-use compatibility for new
development may take into account the nature of the sources and receivers under consideration. For
example, community uses and events within residential neighborhoods are commonly desirable features
even though such facilities may have a noise characteristic that varies from typical residential areas.
                                                                                                         Page 10

              Sound levels above are as measured at the exterior of the proposed location of the new
              development (e.g., residential unit, commercial building, etc.) rather than at the property
              boundary of the source or the property to be developed. Refer to Table LU-1 (Land-Use
              Element) for detailed descriptions of land-use categories and land-uses for which these
              guidelines apply. These guidelines are derived from the California Department of Health
              Services, Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of the Noise Element of the General
              Plan, 2003. The State Guidelines have been modified to reflect standards for the City of
              Saratoga.
              1
                 Normally Acceptable – Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption
                 that any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction. There are no special
                 noise insulation requirements.
              2
                 Conditionally Acceptable – New construction should be undertaken only after a
                 detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirement is conducted and needed noise
                 insulation features included in the design.
              3
                 Normally Unacceptable – New construction should be discouraged and may be denied
                 as inconsistent with the General Plan and City Code. If new construction or development
                 does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and
                 needed noise insulation features included in the design.
              4
                 Outdoor open space noise standards do not apply to private balconies/patios.
Land-use planning can provide an effective means of mitigating adverse noise impacts by separating
noise-sensitive areas from noise sources. Site-specific noise mitigation structures, such as sound walls or
structural soundproofing, can then be avoided or reduced. In developed areas, however, there is not
always sufficient land to allow adequate separation of population concentrations from transportation
systems, which are the major sources of noise. Site-specific noise abatement measures must be taken in
these instances.
Control of noise can be accomplished by controlling noise at the source in the new development,
buffering the pathway of sound waves with barriers or increased distance, controlling the transmission of
noise through structures, and by enclosing or protecting the receiver of noise.

Traditionally, the State of California Building Code has included sound insulation standards to reduce
exterior-to-interior noise intrusion to habitable rooms of multi-family residential buildings. An interior
noise level standard of DNL 45 dB is established for the City of Saratoga as the maximum allowable noise
level in all residential buildings including single-family homes (due to outdoor noise sources).
The State of California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen) includes interior noise standards for
non-residential buildings. Currently, the CALGreen Code prescribes an interior noise level standard of
Leq(h) 50 dB as the maximum allowable hourly average noise level during any hour of operation in certain
commercial/office buildings (due to outdoor noise sources). This standard is established for the City of
Saratoga as the maximum allowable noise level in all non-residential buildings (due to outdoor noise
sources).
      C.    M unicipal R egulations for Ex isting Noise Sources
Community responses to existing noise sources have centered on equipment, animals, and events. The
City of Saratoga City Code includes regulations on sources of noise to limit noise transfer across property
lines and administrative controls regarding animals. Typical limits address operating levels and restricted
hours. Further restrictions on equipment noise might be appropriate as improved technology is
developed.
Noise control standards are incorporated into the City Code to limit the level of noise from a source
which may be transferred at the property plane between adjoining properties in the City and are
described in greater detail below.
Noise control standards of the City Code (e.g., the Noise Control Ordinance at City Code Article 7-30 are
applied two ways. They are used to address potential noise from new/proposed equipment that is
submitted for permit. In addition, the standards are to address complaints of noise transfer between
properties. The objective limits contained in the Noise Control Ordinance are developed to establish
standards for unacceptable noise levels generated by equipment, animals, amplified sound systems and
other sources.
Zoning Standards The principal use of zoning standards is related to noise compatibility and separating
incompatible land-uses for new development.
In addition, zoning standards can regulate specific details of development design or construction, such as
limiting building heights, and requiring buffer strips, noise barriers, and sound-insulating constructions.
Physical noise reduction techniques that can be utilized fall into the four major categories shown below.
These physical techniques vary widely in their noise reduction characteristics, their costs, and in their
applicability to specific locations and conditions
      D. Noise R eduction Techniques
Education should be made available to increase awareness of noise compatibility issues and noise
control measures.
                                                                                                       Page 12
City of Saratoga                                                                                   Noise Element
Acoustical site planning uses the arrangement of buildings on a tract of land to reduce noise impacts
by capitalizing on a site’s natural characteristics. Opportunities for successful acoustical site planning are
determined by the size of the lot, the terrain, and the zoning restrictions. Acoustical site planning
techniques include:
•     Placing as much distance as feasible between the noise source and the noise sensitive activity.
•     Placing noise-compatible activities such as parking lots, open space, and commercial facilities,
      between the noise source and the sensitive activity.
•     Using buildings as noise barriers.
•     Orienting noise-sensitive buildings to face away from the noise sources.
For example, houses placed near the front of long narrow lots can have deep rear yards available to act
as noise buffers from a neighboring noise source.
Acoustical architectural design incorporates noise-reducing concepts in the layout of individual
buildings. The areas of architectural concern include building height, room arrangement, window
placement, and balcony and courtyard design. For example, in some cases, noise impacts can be reduced
if the building is limited to one story and if bedrooms and living rooms are placed in the part of the
building farthest from the noise source, while kitchens and bathrooms are placed closer to the noise
source.
Acoustical building construction is the treatment of the various parts of a building to reduce interior
noise impacts. It includes the use of walls, windows, doors, roof assemblies, and penetrations in the
building envelope that have been treated to reduce sound transmission into a building. The use of dense
materials, structural isolation, and air-spaces within assemblies are primary noise reduction techniques.
Acoustical construction is one of the most effective ways of reducing interior noise.
Noise barriers can be erected between noise sources and noise-sensitive areas. Barrier types include
berms made of sloping mounds of earth, walls, fences, and combinations of these materials. The choice
between these depends on a variety of factors including the desired level of sound reduction, space, cost,
safety, privacy, and aesthetics. Solid wall barriers might reflect sound from one side of a highway to the
other, slightly increasing sound levels. Earth berms deflect sound upward and tend to eliminate this
condition; a combination of the two is usually recommended where possible for this reason.

City of Saratoga                                                                                    Noise Element
Goal #2          Promote land-use compatibility by addressing noise exposure from existing noise sources.
                 Policy 2.1   An acoustical analysis is to be conducted for proposed Residential and
                              Quasi-Public development where the existing noise level exceeds Outdoor
                              DNL 60 dB to determine measures needed to reduce noise impacts to meet
                              City noise standards.
                 Policy 2.2   New residential development shall be designed and constructed to provide
                              an interior noise level of DNL 45 dB or less in habitable rooms (due to
                              outdoor sources).
                 Policy 2.3   Residential outdoor open space intended for use and enjoyment shall be
                              designed to meet Outdoor DNL 60 dB. This policy does not apply to private
                              exterior balconies. Where this level cannot feasibly be met by incorporating
                              reasonable measures, such as strategic site layout and noise barriers, DNL
                              65 dB may be approved.
                 Policy 2.4   New office/commercial development shall be designed and constructed to
                              reduce daytime interior noise levels in accordance with State CALGreen
                              standards prescribing an interior noise level standard of Leq(h) 50 dB as the
                              maximum allowable hourly average noise level during any hour of operation.
                 Policy 2.5   Parks and recreational areas should be protected from excessive noise to
                              permit the enjoyment of sports and other leisure time activities. Parks and
                              other recreational areas which are impacted by outside noise sources should
                              be provided with noise protection devices, including barriers and
                              landscaping. Park design should locate passive recreation areas away from
                              noise sources.
                 Policy 2.6   The City recognizes that certain community uses and events are inherent to
                              a suburban environment.
                              Implementation 2.6.1         Update City Noise Control Ordinance to
                                                           specifically address sources that would have an
                                                           impact on the community, such as noise
                                                           generated by equipment, animals and amplified
                                                           sound.
                 Policy 2.7   Noise generated by equipment, animals and amplified sound shall meet
                              adopted standards as amended from time to time.
                              Implementation 2.7.1         The City should continue to enforce the
                                                           restrictions in the Noise Ordinance of the

APPENDIX A: DEFINITIONS
Average Daily Traffic (ADT): The total volume during a given time period in whole days greater than
one day and less than one year divided by the number of days in that time period, commonly abbreviated
as ADT.
A-Weighting: A frequency weighting applied to sound pressure levels to better correlate with the
loudness of sounds as perceived by the human ear. All sound levels discussed in this Element are
A-Weighted. The unit of A-weighted sound levels is sometimes abbreviated “dBA”.
Continuous Noise: On-going noise, the intensity of which remains at a measurable level (which might
or might not vary) without interruption over an indefinite period or a specified period of time.
Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL): An A-Weighted sound level averaged on the basis of sound
energy for a 24-hour noise exposure including a 10 dB penalty added to sound levels occurring during
nighttime hours.
dB (Decibel): A standardized unit of sound pressure level. Increasing values related to louder sounds.
Decible represents the logarithm of the ratio of measured acoustical energy and a standard reference of
20 microPascals.
Frequency: The time rate of repetition of a periodic phenomenon (in cycles per second or hertz).
Hours, Daytime: Between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.
Hours, Evening: Between the hours of 7:00 p.m and 10:00 p.m.
Hours, Nighttime: Between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
Land-Use Area: Reasonably homogenous and identifiable areas composed of similar general types of
land uses such as residential, commercial, or industrial districts.
L10 and L90 Sound Levels: The sound level that is exceeded, cumulatively, during 10, 50, or 90 percent
of a specified time period, respectively. “L10” is the A-weighted sound level equaled or exceeded during
10 percent of a stated time period and is considered a good measure of typical maximum sound levels
caused by discrete noise events. The “L90” is the A-weighted sound level equaled or exceeded during 90
percent of a stated time period and is commonly used to describe the noise level.
Leq, Equivalent Sound Level: The average A-weighted noise level over a stated time period.
Loudness: The attribute of an auditory sensation relating to its intensity or magnitude. Loudness
depends primarily upon the sound pressure of the stimulus, but it also depends upon the frequency and
wave form of the stimulus.
Noise Exposure Contours: Lines drawn about a noise source indicating constant levels of noise
exposure. DNL is the metric utilized herein to describe community exposure to noise.
Sound Insulation: (1) the use of structures and materials designed to reduce the transmission of
sound. (2) The degree by which sound transmission is reduced by means of sound insulating structures
and materials.
                                                                                                       Page 17

APPENDIX B: METHODOLOGY AND REFERENCES
M ethodology
The Noise Element was prepared to accomplish two tasks. One was to comply with Section 65302 (f) of
the Government Code which states that a Noise Element is a mandatory element of a General Plan. The
other task is to establish a City-wide policy document that stipulates that the preservation of the City of
Saratoga’s “relatively quiet” acoustic environment is necessary and beneficial for the General health and
welfare of all residents.
To accomplish both of these tasks, the following methodology was utilized. During the writing of the
Noise Element some parts of the methodology were emphasized more than others due to the acoustical
characteristics inherent to the City of Saratoga.
•     Preliminary identification of problem noise areas
•     Collection of data on existing and proposed transportation sound sources
•     Collection of information on general sound levels throughout the City
•     Review of information from published sources regarding effects of sound on human activities, health,
      and well-being
•     Survey of noise control regulations from other jurisdictions
•     Preparation of standards that relate sound levels to types of land use and environmental factors
•     Formulation of policy statements and implementation alternatives
•     Citizen input and awareness
To update the Noise Element, additional transportation noise measurements were conducted throughout
the City, revised models of existing and projected future noise contours were generated, content was
refined to reflect updated State Guidelines on the preparation of Noise Elements, and updated community
feedback was gathered. The following notes summarize input received at two community meetings:
Noise Issues from 20 August 2013 meeting at Fireman’s Hall
•     Noise levels may be too low in current ordinance, needs to be real and practical
•     Motorcycles engines are too loud
•     Construction Noise – Sunday work, better information should be provided to contractors
•     Maintain existing noise standards for residential
•     Look at noise emitted from community functions – Schools, Clubs, Hakone
•     Leaf Blowers – compare with other cities (popular issue)
•     Garbage Trucks – time of pick up, too noisy in the morning
•     Barking Dogs – need better regulations and enforcement (popular issue)
•     The volume of outdoor music in the village is better this year than last
•     Review strict dB levels – children playing can exceed allowable noise levels
      Not all noise is the same – the type of noise can make a big difference
      Amplified noise vs. voices
•     Construction Noise – compressor can be less noisy than a hammer
Noise Issues from 27 August 2013 meeting at Saratoga Library
•     Create Noise Web Page

•     Resurface Highway 85 to reduce noise
•     Leaf Blowers – consider banning gas powered leaf blowers
•     Motorcycle noise
•     Allendale and Quito Bus – bus stopping in front of house with loud speaker being heard
•     Hakone – noise from events. Stop amplification of noise after certain hours
•     Construction noise – limit hours. Better information should be provided to contractors. Contact
      information should be made available to public/neighbors
•     Children’s Hospital – amplified music/excessive parties/children’s playground location, truck deliveries
•     Residential garbage pickup – limit hours
•     Backyard parties – live music
•     City should get out information to the community so everyone knows the rules
•     Tailor the type of measurement weight (A/B/C) to the type of noise
•     Low flying aircraft are too noisy
•     Declare Saratoga a Noise Adverse City
•     Updates should have “Common Sense”
•     Car key fobs and alarms are too loud

Public Participation
As part of the process of revising the Land Use
and Open Space/Conservation Elements, City
staff conducted numerous meetings of two
advisory committees, the Land Use Element
Advisory Committee and the Pedestrian,
Equestrian and Bicycle Trails Advisory Com-
mittee. Following preparation of the draft
elements in September 2006, four publicly
noticed study sessions were held with the
Planning Commission as well as two public                                  Heritage Orchard
hearings. The City Council held two publicly
noticed study sessions. During this time period,
the City posted the draft revised Elements on the
City’s website. The City Council adopted the
Land Use and Open Space/Conservation
Elements at a public hearing on June 6, 2007.

begins at the Saratoga Gap on the crest of the
Santa Cruz Mountains. The Skyline–to–the-Sea
trail winds through redwood forests into Castle
Rock State Park and down into Big Basin State
Park. The trail terminates 34 miles from the
mountain ridge on Waddell State Beach on the
Pacific Ocean. The trail would connect through
a 65-acre former quarry owned by the Santa
Clara County Roads and Airports Department,
which is on the eastern slope of the Santa Cruz
Mountains between Saratoga and Sanborn
County Park. The Santa Clara County Roads
and Airports Department and the City of
Saratoga will work together to enter into a joint
use agreement once the County determines
feasibility of developing a trail through the
abandoned quarry.

1846 when Bill Campbell and his sons estab-
lished a sawmill on Quito Creek. The discovery
of mineral springs in the area soon prompted
development of several luxurious spas, remind-
ing local residents of similar Eastern spas. From
this memory came Saratoga's name. Orchards
were planted and covered the land, until the late
1940s when they began to be replaced by homes.

a common metric used by other communities in
California to measure adequacy of parkland.
Parks maintained by regional entities are not
included in this goal.
City Parks
The City shall maintain, and where possible
improve city owned lands as appropriate to
increase the city’s supply of public parks. In
addition, the city will continue to encourage
dedication of lands for park use with subdivi-
sions of 4 or more parcels. In the year 2020,
with a population estimated to be 33,300, the
City would require 165.5 acres of parks. Cur-
rently there are 87 acres within the City. High
land costs and the limited amount of undeve-
loped land will pose challenges to the City in
seeking to attain its goal.
                                                                           San Marcos Open Space
The City will face particular challenges in the
northerly portion of Saratoga, which is currently
deficient in the amount of parks, primarily due
to planning policies in effect when this portion
of Saratoga was subdivided in the 1950s and
1960s.
City Trails
Development of a comprehensive trail system
has been a priority of the community for many
years. The Existing and Proposed Trails Map
identifies proposed trails which when completed
will provide the community with a trail system
network that provides open space linkages for
greater access to recreation activities and natural

                                                                            SAFETY ELEMENT
 I.     PURPOSE OF THE SAFETY ELEMENT
 The Safety Element describes natural and human activity-related hazards that exist in Saratoga
 and the measures to address them. Some naturally occurring hazards may be unavoidable, but
 the potential impact on Saratoga can be reduced through advance planning and preparation.
 Thus, the Safety Element addresses geologic, seismic, flood, and fire hazards, as well as
 hazards created by human activity such as hazardous materials and waste and incidents that
 call for emergency protection, at a policy level within the City. Anticipating emergencies will
 occur even when precautions are taken against hazards, the Safety Element describes the
 City’s efforts to prepare for and respond to emergencies; however, the Safety Element does not
 take the place of the City’s Emergency Operations Plan. For additional information regarding
 the Emergency Operations Plan, refer to Section II.E - Emergency Preparedness and Disaster
 Planning.
 Furthermore, California Government Code Section 65302(g)(1) requires that a General Plan
 include:
 “ . . . A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks
 associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground
 failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
 subsidence, liquefaction, and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8
 (commencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic
 hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and urban fires . . . .”
II.     HAZARD IDENTIFICATION
 The identification of hazards that affect the City is the initial step in the safety planning process.
 Hazard identification is the most important stage in this process since inaccurate hazard
 identification and the formulation of inadequate safety land use policies could result in
 unnecessary loss of life, injury and property damage.
 The types of natural hazards that have affected Saratoga in the past and those that may affect it
 in the future can be identified with a high degree of accuracy. Geologic, flood and fire hazards
 have all caused considerable damage within Bay Area communities in the past. Although the

extent of damage resulting from future natural hazards is unknown, it is likely that the
consequences will be similar to those produced in the past. Accurate hazard identification
utilizes historical information to predict future hazards and potential risks to current and
proposed land uses and activities.
A. REGIONAL SOILS AND LAND INSTABILITY HAZARDS
The physical and geologic characteristics of Saratoga have the potential to produce geologic
related problems for land development. Land development in areas of geologic instability can
expose life and property to hazards caused by seismic and non-seismic conditions. When
structures or roads are built on geologically unstable land, such as landslide areas or unstable
slopes and soils, there is a definitive risk to the community.
Geologic hazards are unavoidable in California. However, some geologic conditions represent
greater hazards than others. Faulting and unstable bedrock present great risks, while surface
instabilities can often be engineered to make construction safe. When unstable soil combines
with steep slopes, development conditions can be subject to landslide hazards. Recognizing
and delineating hazards that could result in injuries, property damage and economic or social
dislocations is an important function of the City planning process to protect the public health,
safety and welfare of the community.
Saratoga is located within the Santa Clara Valley, situated at the southern end of San Francisco
Bay.     The valley is characterized as a depression that has been subsiding and filling with
sediment during the Quaternary Period.1 Deposition of alluvial2 and fluvial3 sediments during
this time has been influenced by both subsidence and the climatic and base level changes
associated with past glaciations and sea level fluctuations.4 Research conducted within the San
Francisco Bay indicates that the valley floor within the San Jose region is blanketed by young

alluvial deposits since the last ice age. Older alluvial deposits5 underlie these sediments and
crop out along the margins of the valley.6
The Saratoga area is primarily underlain by Pleistocene alluvial deposits with some exposed
bedrock within the hillside areas. The existing soils and bedrock pose a potential landslide or
liquefaction hazard for future development. Refer to Exhibit 1, Geologic Map for a depiction of
the generalized geology of the City.
i.    General Geology and Physical Characteristics
Topography
The topography of Saratoga includes the low-lying relatively flat valley floor and the
northwestern foothills. Outside the City limits, but within Saratoga’s Sphere of Influence, are the
Castle Rock portions of the Santa Cruz Mountains.                                 These mountains are very rugged,
comprised of steep canyons and sharp to rounded ridge tops.
Vegetation
The mountain areas located within Saratoga’s Sphere of Influence are heavily vegetated.
Hardwood trees of oak and madrone are abundant in this area, as well as redwood and Douglas
fir. The canyon floors near streams are covered with sycamore, elder and maple trees. Much
of the area is densely covered with chaparral, with only a few areas covered with grass.
Geology
A fault zone is composed of a complex system of fault traces and fractured rock. The San
Andreas Fault Zone is a dominant geologic feature within the State of California. This fault zone
is the boundary between the Pacific and North American Tectonic Plates, which has played a
crucial role in California’s geologic history. The southwestern most corner of the Saratoga
Sphere of Influence is bisected by a northwest-southeast trending segment of the San Andreas
Fault zone. The location of this fault zone along the eastern side of the Santa Cruz Mountains
has played a major role in the geologic and topographic characteristics of the area by
separating two different rock assemblages and their associated erosional characteristics.

                                                                         SAFETY ELEMENT
The rock formations to the east of the San Andreas Fault are composed of sandstone, shale,
volcanic rocks, with minor amounts of diabase and gabbro. The mountain area is separated
from the flat area within the City limits by the Santa Clara Formation composed of
unconsolidated to semi-consolidated gravel, sand and clay.
The valley floor of Saratoga is comprised of alluvial deposits (varying in age) from the creeks
and streams flowing from the mountainous area. The alluvium is composed of unconsolidated
particles consisting of clay, silt, sand and gravel, which are classified as agricultural soils by the
United States Natural Resources Conservation Service.
ii. Landslide and Slope Instability
Most landslides occur naturally, however some damaging landslides can result from careless or
poorly planned construction. When construction is allowed in areas where landslides exist or
where landslide susceptibility is high, the potential for substantial property loss and human
endangerment increases.       The potential public costs for the repair of roads and utilities or
disaster relief make it imperative that the City restrict development in geologically hazardous
areas.
Most sloping land has some potential for landsliding. Slope stability is affected by several
interrelated factors, such as steepness of slope, weak unconsolidated soil units or formations
with a high clay content, water saturation, vegetation removal and seismic activity. Usually, a
combination of several factors will bring the hillside to the verge of failure and a single factor,
such as heavy rainfall or an earthquake, will be the catalyst responsible for initiating slope
failure.  The development of sites where these conditions exist may also trigger landslide
activity.
Landslides and slope instability are the major non-seismic geologic hazards in Saratoga. This is
due to the unstable nature of the geologic materials and the steep topography in areas of the
City. Although most of the hillside areas in the City experience these hazards to some degree,
the most severe risks are found in the western portion of the City within the vicinity of the
Berrocal Fault, where the topography becomes much steeper and geologic units are more
prone to larger landslides.

Exhibit 2, Landslide Areas, illustrates where major portions of the City of Saratoga are underlain
by materials that are subject to landsliding. These soils are moderately stable when dry, but
moderately unstable when saturated. Within the City boundaries, landslides are most likely to
occur where silt and clay have been eroded along stream channels traversing the City and
within large preexisting landslide deposits. Detailed geotechnical maps illustrating the areas
within the City most susceptible to instability issues are provided in Appendix C – Geologic and
Seismic Hazards Constraints Mapping.
The upper portion of landslide area(s) includes the hilly region south of Congress Springs Road,
part of the natural channel of Saratoga Creek, a section of the Congress Springs Road
alignment, and a considerable amount of the low foothills located north of the road. Slope
movements have been noted in this region for over 50 years. The Congress Springs Road
surface is significantly deformed and has been elevated approximately 14 feet since 1931 when
the present alignment was constructed. All man-made structures within or south of this area
have experienced extensive structural damage.
Saratoga also contains rock formations conducive to landslides. These formations are primarily
exposed within the hillside portions of the City and Sphere of Influence west of Saratoga-
Sunnyvale Road and southwest of Saratoga Los Gatos Road (Highway 9). Other areas within
the City susceptible to landslides include portions of the Saratoga Creek drainage area, and the
hillside areas west of San Tomas Aquinas Creek, east of Fruitvale Avenue, between Allendale
Avenue and Highway 9. Landslides and unstable slopes are prevalent in this area, and can
create hazards within the City limits as the slide debris and rock move toward the City’s valley
floor.
Active landsliding can also be traced across Belnap Way, Bohlman Road and On Orbit Drive
and private driveways at a number of locations within the hillsides around Congress Springs.
This area is considered an extremely high-risk area for development, even in those areas that
appear to be stable at the present time. The equilibrium of even the most stable ground within
this hillside could be destroyed by the advent of road construction, irrigation, alteration of natural
drainage, or the introduction of septic tank effluent. Rapid failure of these slopes could cause
considerable property damage, personal injury or loss of life.

The most extensive occurrence of landslide deposits is in the central portion of the watershed
located north and south of the Mt. Eden Road-Pierce Road intersection. Examples of these
large slide deposits are located on Pike Road. Within the same general area, the Quarry Road
slide adjacent to the Calabazas Creek has moved part of the roadbed into the creek. Updated
geotechnical maps identifying land instability issues within Saratoga are provided in Appendix
C.
iii. Soil Creep and Expansive Soils
Soil creep is the slow, down slope movement of near-surface materials. Soil creep is prevalent
in Saratoga, primarily in the western hillside regions of the City. The rate of soil creep is a
function of slope angle, soil thickness and texture. It can be regarded as a continuous process,
and may cause retaining walls, foundations and paved roads to fail over a period of time
unaccompanied by any obvious signs of slope failure. The presence of soil creep should not
have a prohibitive effect on land use, but should alert the City to require appropriate
geotechnical investigations to evaluate conditions and to impose engineering solutions to
mitigate problems.
Expansive soils contain high proportions of clay and alternately absorb and release large
amounts of water during wet and dry cycles. When structures are built on expansive soil,
foundations may rise during the wet season, resulting in cracked foundations, distorted
frameworks, and warped windows and doors. These adverse effects can be eliminated by
recognition of expansive soils and application of remedial measures for site development and
foundation design.      All applications for site development and building permits should be
accompanied by soil reports in areas where expansive soils exist.
iv. Regulatory Framework
Regulations regarding development in problematic geotechnical areas throughout the City are
intended to protect citizens from potential geotechnical related hazards.
Federal Regulations
The purpose of the Federal Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act (1977) (16 United
States Code Section 2001-2009) is to protect or restore the functions of the soil on a permanent
sustainable basis.

Local Regulations
The City of Saratoga requires detailed geotechnical investigations for all land use proposals
located within geologically hazardous areas. Standards for development are listed in Article 16-
15 of the City's Building Code, which incorporates the most recent California Building Code.
Article 16-15 enforces Title 24 California Regulations and Article 16-17, which outlines permitted
excavation and grading procedures.
B. SEISMIC HAZARDS
The identification of earthquake hazards in Saratoga can be categorized as primary hazards
(i.e. fault rupture and seismic shaking) and secondary hazards. These hazards may include
liquefaction, seismically induced landslides, subsidence, and seismically induced water
inundation. Hazards increase in areas where seismic activity is combined with the potential for
flooding, poor soil drainage, unstable surficial soil and steep slope, fire hazard and deteriorated
structures and can result in extensive property damage, personal injury or death.
i.   Primary Seismic Hazards
Identification of Active and Potentially Active Faults
The San Andreas Fault is the only known “active” fault in the vicinity of Saratoga. For planning
purposes, an “active” fault is one that has experienced displacement within the last 11,000
years and can be expected to move again. The proximity of the fault, which traverses the City’s
Sphere of Influence along the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains, increases the probability of
severe lateral displacement and ground shaking should an earthquake occur. Due to the active
status given to this fault, it has been located within an Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zone, which
requires specialized study to determine the location of the fault during the planning stage of the
development process.
The Berrocal, Monta Vista, and Shannon Faults located within the City limits are considered
three “potentially active” faults lying on the alluvial plain. A “potentially active” fault is one that
has moved within the last 2 million to 11,000 years, and because it is considered capable of
ground rupture or shaking, poses an unacceptable risk to a proposed structure.
These “potentially active” faults do not have reliable evidence of recent displacement along their
fault traces. For this reason, the Santa Clara County Geologist has placed them in a special
Draft February 2013                                                                                  11

                                                                                              SAFETY ELEMENT
study fault hazard zone consistent with the Santa Clara County Geologic Ordinance.7
Placement within this zone requires similar fault trenching studies as the Alquist-Priolo Special
Study Zones for properties within the unincorporated County areas. Since these faults are
located within the City of Saratoga, the City has the discretion to require studies deemed
adequate by the City’s Geologist, which may deviate from the County’s requirements.
The Berrocal Fault belongs to the Sargent Fault Zone, a complex system of interconnecting
faults extending northwest between the San Andreas and the Calaveras Faults. The fault trace
crosses Congress Springs Road and continues into the southeastern portion of the Sphere of
Influence.         At least 0.5 mile of the Berrocal Fault within the City of Saratoga displayed
sympathetic ground cracking in response to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
The Shannon Fault, part of the Monta Vista Fault system, closely parallels the State Highway 85
corridor from Regnart Creek (Cupertino) in the north, crossing Saratoga Avenue, and continuing
to the Almaden Expressway in the southeast portion of San Jose. Although there is a chance
that primary ground rupture could occur on either of these fault traces in the future, it is more
likely to occur on the San Andreas Fault. Exhibit 3, Fault Location Map and Earthquake Fault
Zones, illustrates the location of local faults that present a hazard to Saratoga.
Ground Shaking
The most widespread effect of an earthquake is ground shaking, or the movement of the earth’s
surface in response to seismic activity. Ground shaking is often the greatest cause of physical
damage.           Structures of all types, including buildings and utility facilities may suffer severe
damage or collapse if not properly designed to withstand the intensity of the shaking.
The major threat to people in both the City of Saratoga and its Sphere of Influence is structural
failure of buildings or failure of slopes due to shaking. Because of the steep slopes and network
of fault lines in the hillside areas closest to the San Andreas Fault Zone, it is essential to enforce
strict earthquake construction and soil engineering standards in order to select the most stable
building sites and to compensate for soil instabilities through the use of approved engineering
and construction techniques.

evaluation of land based on proposed land uses.

California has a long history of strong earthquakes that have affected communities in the
Saratoga area.8 The largest earthquake to occur within 10 miles of Saratoga was the 6.9 M
Loma Prieta Earthquake that occurred along the San Andreas Fault in 1989.9 Saratoga's close
proximity to the San Andreas Fault Zone and other potentially active faults suggests a high
probability that a strong earthquake will occur in the near future in the vicinity of the City.
Surface Rupture
Surface rupture, or a break in the ground’s surface and the associated displacement caused by
the movement of a fault, is directly correlated to earthquake magnitude. Earthquakes having a
magnitude of 5.5 or greater are required for such events to occur.                                 During the 1906 San
Francisco earthquake (magnitude 7.8), ground rupture occurred along 270 miles of the San
Andreas Fault, with a 20-foot offset occurring near the epicenter in Marin County.
In response to the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake, the State of California enacted the Alquist-
Priolo Fault Zoning Act in 1972, which is intended to prevent the construction of habitable
structures on top of an active fault line. In conformance with this act, properties located within
an Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zone are required to identify the location of any active faults and
establish appropriate setbacks, if deemed necessary.                          In addition to regional investigations
necessary to the basic understanding of faults and their histories, detailed site investigations are
needed prior to the approval of construction in any suspected or potentially active fault zone.
Utilities, roads and other linear features are particularly vulnerable to damage resulting from
ground displacement.            Little rural residential development has taken place within the San
Andreas Fault Zone in Saratoga’s Sphere of Influence, so the present risk of structural damage
due to fault rupture is minimal. However, utility facilities such as gas and electric lines that may
traverse the fault zone may be subject to damage from surface rupture.
ii. Secondary Seismic Hazards
Ground Failure
Ground failure is a secondary effect of earthquake shaking that can be potentially dangerous
and damaging. Ground failure effects include landslides, rock falls, subsidence, liquefaction

and ground lurching in areas not actually ruptured by a fault. All of these activities involve the
displacement of ground surface due to loss of strength or failure of the underlying materials
during earthquake shaking. Moisture content and groundwater levels play an important role in
the assessment of the potential for ground failure, as do soil type and slope instability.
The San Andreas Fault Zone and the hills to the northwest of the City are estimated to have a
high probability of landslide potential should an earthquake occur, while the likelihood of
subsidence and ground lurching in these areas is low.
The Bohlman Road area is known for unstable slopes and is considered to have a high potential
for seismically induced landslides.
The Santa Clara Valley floor, the most populated area of Saratoga, is relatively flat but is
traversed by several creeks. While this area may not experience landslide or ground lurching
during an earthquake, there is a moderate probability that subsidence and/or liquefaction could
take place due to the loosely compacted alluvial soil. Refer to Exhibit 4, Liquefaction Areas.
Structural Hazards Related to Seismic Activity
The majority of residential structures in the City of Saratoga are single-story wood framed
homes constructed post-1950. This construction tends to fare well during earthquakes because
of the flexibility of the building materials. While it is impossible to guarantee the safety of any
structure, a clearly defined and conscientious practice of structural reinforcement will greatly
reduce injury and loss of life. Establishing appropriate setbacks to prohibit development near or
on fault lines is another precaution to minimize structural damage.
Many commonly used building components, such as unreinforced stone or brick chimneys and
unreinforced masonry, are particularly susceptible to ground shaking. Among newly constructed
buildings, particularly those for commercial use, small steel frame buildings are generally
considered the safest, while unreinforced masonry and tilt-up structures are regarded as posing
a greater risk. Because Saratoga is predominantly a residential community, it does not have a
vast number of unreinforced masonry or tilt-up structures. At the present time, there are no tilt-

annex to the Santa Clara County Local Hazard Mitigation Plan; all existing unreinforced
masonry structures have been retrofitted.
Seismically Induced Flooding and Dam Failure
Should a dam fail during an earthquake, the released water could cause flooding downstream.
The resulting damage is dependent on the rate of water released and the volume of water in the
reservoir. Dam failure can either be caused by ground displacement along a fault trace, ground
shaking or overtopping of the dam by a large landslide splash wave.
The Lake Ranch reservoir located to the south of Saratoga’s Sphere of Influence is the most
likely reservoir to be affected by seismic activity. Operated by the San Jose Water Company,
Lake Ranch reservoir is located in a saddle-shaped depression near the southern portion of
Sanborn Road and was created by the construction of a small earthen dam at each end. Both
dams are traversed by the San Andreas Fault and withstood the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes on
this fault. Current estimates indicate that if dam failure occurs during an earthquake, up to 105
million gallons of water could be released into Saratoga Creek.                                    This volume of water is
expected to inundate the creek bed in a comparable manner to the flooding hazard from a 100
year flood.10 The southeasterly flow of the reservoir storage would impact areas outside of the
City’s Sphere of Influence near the Santa Cruz County line, while the northeasterly flow would
flood areas along Quito Creek.
Other flooding hazards resulting from the secondary effects of seismic activity could occur if
landslides are activated and advance into creek beds. Along Big Basin Way, near the San Jose
Water Company’s Saratoga filter plant, a landslide could conceivably block both the road and
Saratoga Creek during an earthquake. This area has experienced movement in the past, and
has required periodic maintenance and the construction of expensive drainage facilities at the
site. Refer to Exhibit 5, Dam Failure Inundation Areas.
10 Discussion of the 100-year flood conditions within the City is provided in Section C. Flood Hazards and depicted on Exhibit 6,
FEMA Flood Zones.

Other Potential Hazards Related to Seismic Activity
Public and quasi-public facilities such as utility systems may be at risk from the secondary
effects of seismic activity.            In the aftermath of a major earthquake, facilities of particular
importance, such as water tanks, pipelines including gas, water and sewer, electrical and
communications systems, and roads, bridges and freeways, are regarded as the “lifelines” of
the community for the provision of emergency services. Many of these utilities unavoidably
cross hazardous areas, and could be disrupted and seriously impaired in the event of an
earthquake. Water distribution, sewage disposal and gas systems are particularly vulnerable.
Disruption of these systems after an earthquake will be dependent not only upon the location
and magnitude of the earthquake and specific site conditions, but also on the condition of the
lines, pumps and plan facilities. Water pumps require electricity units to operate, so a system
could fail at multiple points. Pipelines and storage tanks containing flammable materials could
rupture igniting the contents and increasing fire hazards in parts of the City. The utilities that are
most likely to be disturbed in the City and its Sphere of Influence are in the San Andreas Fault
Zone and the Bohlman Road area.
Several safety measures have been used by the utility providers within the City to reduce the
risk of utility system or infrastructure breakdown during an earthquake. San Jose Water
Company provides back up power sources to critical facilities and pipelines that are degraded or
in disrepair on an annual basis are retrofitted or replaced through their Capital Improvements
Program.11        Water comes to Saratoga from infrastructure operated by San Jose Water
Company. Water sources include groundwater pumped from over 100 wells that draw water
from the Santa Clara Groundwater Basin, imported surface water provided by the Santa Clara
Valley Water District, and local mountain surface water from the Santa Cruz Mountains and
treated at San Jose Water Company's water treatment plants.12 While it is unlikely that all
sources would be shut off simultaneously, a limited reserve of replacement equipment might
delay the restoration of service. After an earthquake or disaster, San Jose Water Company
would implement its own emergency operating plan to serve Saratoga.

The problem of water supply and distribution in the hillsides and the Sphere of Influence could
become acute after an earthquake. In the summer, when streams are dry, dependence on
private sources might be inadequate for emergency needs. In addition, damage to roadways,
freeways and bridges can be expected during a major earthquake.                                     However, recently
constructed reinforced concrete bridges and overpasses are considered to be more resilient to
earthquake movement than older bridges and overpasses. Several local bridges13 in the City
could be subject to failure during an earthquake if they were not constructed in accordance with
current seismic design parameters. Facilities in the City are also in areas of high groundwater
levels and unstable creek beds: Springer Avenue at Big Basin Way, Fourth Street near Big
Basin Way, Sarahills Road near Pierce Road, and Chalet Clothilde Drive near Pierce Road.
One of the most critical concerns following an earthquake is the provision of emergency care for
the injured at major hospitals and health care facilities. Some hospitals may not be operational
after a major earthquake, especially if they are located near the San Andreas Fault. Two
hospitals are located in the vicinity of Saratoga that could provide emergency care post disaster:
El Camino Hospital Los Gatos on Pollard Road in Los Gatos and Good Samaritan Hospital on
Samaritan Drive, located in San Jose. In the event that an earthquake causes the City to
become isolated from the rest of the Santa Clara Valley, hospitals in San Jose region may not
be available if roadways are damaged. Schools in the City would be used as Emergency
Shelters where mass care and feeding could occur. Additionally, emergency planning and
training efforts with the Saratoga Union School District, the Los Gatos-Saratoga Union High
School District, Blue Hills and McAuliffe Schools from the Cupertino Union School District,
Prospect High School, St. Andrews School, and Sacred Heart School are active and continuous
so that these entities will be prepared and self-sufficient during a disaster.
iii. Regulatory Framework
State Regulations
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (California Public Resources Code, Chapter 7.5,
Section 2621-2699.6) was passed in 1972 to mitigate the hazard of surface faulting to structures
for human occupancy. The Act only addresses the hazard of surface fault rupture and is not
directed toward other earthquake hazards, such as subsidence or liquefaction. The Act requires

the State Geologist to establish regulatory zones, known as “Earthquake Fault Zones,” around
the surface traces of active faults and to issue appropriate maps.
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (SHMA) of 1990 (California Public Resources Code, Chapter
7.8, Section 2690-2699.6) provides a statewide seismic hazard mapping and technical advisory
program to assist cities and counties in fulfilling their responsibilities for protecting the public
health and safety from the effects of strong ground shaking, liquefaction, landslides, or other
ground failure, and other seismic hazards caused by earthquakes.
California building standards are published in the California Code of Regulations, Title 24,
known as the California Building Standards Code (CBSC). The CBSC applies to all applications
for residential building permits. The CBSC consists of 11 parts that contain administrative
regulations for the California Building Standards Commission and for all State agencies that
implement or enforce building standards.         Local agencies must ensure that development
complies with the guidelines contained in the CBSC.
Local Regulations
The City has standards for development listed in Article 16-15 of the City's Building code, which
incorporates the most recent California Building Code and enforces Title 24 California
Regulations.
C. FLOOD HAZARDS
Historically, periodic flooding has been a benefit to agricultural soil, wildlife and the general
ecological balance of a community. Flooding becomes a natural hazard when the flow of water
threatens life and damages personal property. Damages from flooding increase in proportion to
the growth of urban development and as subdivisions locate in areas prone to flooding.
Floods are primarily caused by excessive surface runoff resulting from intense or heavy rainfall
or from the failure of flood control or water supply structures, such as levees or reservoirs.
When prolonged rainfall exceeds the absorption rate of the soil or the waste storage capacity of
the watershed, the excess must flow downstream.              Although it is impossible to prevent
excessive rainfall that causes major floods, it is possible to develop methods and policies for the
management of areas subject to flooding and for the protection of life and property. Through

the use of hydrologic data in conjunction with regulatory and flood proofing measures, proper
land use planning can be effective in the control of flooding and its possible adverse effects.
i.  Historical Data on Flooding in Saratoga
All surface water originating in or passing through Saratoga ultimately discharges into the San
Francisco Bay. Runoff is collected in the City’s underground storm drainage system, which
discharges into the creeks throughout the City.        Three major drainages are located within
Saratoga and all drain from south to north. From east to west, these creeks are the San Tomas
Aquino, Saratoga and Calabazas Creeks. Wildcat, Vasona and Sobey Creeks are tributaries
within the San Tomas Aquino Creek drainage system, while Prospect and Rodeo Creeks are
tributaries of Calabazas Creek. San Tomas Aquino and Calabazas Creeks discharge into the
Guadalupe Slough near the Bay, with Saratoga Creek joining San Tomas Aquino north of the
City.
Floodplain mapping prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
indicates that several areas throughout the City are located within the 100-year floodplain.
Flooding in the early years was often viewed as an asset rather than a liability, since the need
for water to irrigate agricultural crops outweighed the damage done by floodwater. As urban
development has increased, damage became a more important consideration as population
growth and the completion of water retention facilities in the area combined to alter the pattern
of potential flooding.
The severity of floods in relation to urban development varies from year to year.          Several
significant flooding events have occurred in Saratoga, dating back as far as 1914. The Santa
Clara Valley Water District has made progress in improving the channels as funds became
available.    As a result, flood damage has been reduced over the years. During an average
year, residents of the area experience minor flooding events and most potential hazards are
now being proactively addressed through the development review process.
ii. Identification of Areas Subject to Flooding
Several creek areas in Saratoga have been identified as specific flood hazard areas, as shown
in Exhibit 6, FEMA Flood Zones. Saratoga Creek has the largest floodplain in width and length.
The widest portion of the floodplain is south of the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks. Wildcat,
Draft February 2013                                                                             25

Vasona and San Tomas Aquino Creeks also are subject to the 100-year flood hazards. Recent
improvements to these creek channels have greatly reduced the potential for flood damage in
adjacent areas.
Calabazas Creek’s 100-year floodplain within the City extends from Prospect Road to Wardell
Road, between Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road and Arroyo de Arguello, where the watershed
branches out in a westward direction. Although much of the terrain lying within the upper
Calabazas Creek watershed is characterized by steep hillsides, heavy rainfall during past years
has saturated unstable slopes and caused the groundwater level to rise, triggering landslides of
mud and debris into the creek channels. To address many of these flooding issues, the Santa
Clara Valley Water District has initiated the Calabazas Creek Flood Protection Project, which
proposes the construction of a detention basin adjacent to the creek, the modification of the
culvert beneath Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road, and replacement of the Union Pacific Railroad
bridge over the creek. These improvements are intended to provide 100-year flood protection
within the Calabazas Creek watershed.
iii. Flood Control and Land Development Review
The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation, which can result in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base., These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed,
or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood
hazards that increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. In response
to this, the City has implemented a Floodplain Management Plan, which is codified under City
Code Article 16-66.
The floodplain management plan includes methods and provisions to control the alteration of
natural floodplains, stream channels, and protective barriers; to control filling, grading, dredging
and other development that can increase flood damage; to regulate the construction of flood
barriers which can divert flood waters or increase flood hazards in other areas; and to require
that uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood damage at the time of their
construction. One of the provisions of this plan requires a development permit be obtained prior
to construction or development begins. Additionally, certain construction standards, such as

anchoring, building with flood resistant materials, and elevating and flood proofing, are required
within an area of special flood hazard. The plan requires new and replacement water and
sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize flood water infiltration and discharge
into flood waters. Standards are also included for subdivisions and manufactured homes.14
iv. Flood Control and Emergency Services
The City of Saratoga has participated in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) since
1973. As part of the City’s implementation of their NFIP requirements, City Code Article 16-66,
Flood Plain Management was adopted by the City Council in 1996 via Ordinance No. 71-167.
The City of Saratoga utilizes digital flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance studies, and
other studies supplied by applicants when developing properties located in flood hazard areas
to regulate development in flood hazard areas. The City has no repetitive flood loss properties.
v. Regulatory Framework
Federal Regulations
FEMA performs the following functions:
     •    Advises on building codes and flood plain management;
     •    Teaches people how to get through a disaster;
     •    Helps equip and prepare local and state emergency managers;
     •    Coordinates the federal response to a disaster;
     •    Makes disaster assistance available to states, communities, businesses and individuals;
     •    Trains emergency managers;
     •    Supports the nation’s fire service; and
     •    Administers the national flood and crime insurance programs
The Flood Plain Management Act (Cobey-Alquist Act of 1969) introduced the concept of
reserving areas along stream channels from future development for flood prevention projects.
At the city level, Saratoga has an extensive review procedure in conjunction with the County of
Santa Clara that addresses flooding potential and the impact on development.

Local Regulations
In addition, Article 16-66 of the City's Municipal Code governs floodplain management. All
development that could be affected by seasonal flooding is subject to the regulations and
standards of Article 16-66 to mitigate flood-related losses or damage to the fullest extent
feasible.
D. FIRE HAZARDS
Most fires are started by people, either intentionally or through carelessness. The places of
greatest concern for fire prevention are where people live, recreate, drive or work. Once ignited,
a fire can quickly blaze out of control when weather and physical site conditions are amenable.
In addition to the direct hazards to people and property, indirect damages and economic losses
may also occur, such as erosion and siltation of dams and flood control channels, increased
flood hazards, damage to watersheds, increased potential for mud slides, and losses to scenic
and recreational values.
Development in areas of fire hazard should be guided by prevention requirements, such as fire
resistant building construction and materials, adequate space between structures, available
water supply, fire resistant plant materials, quality of year-round firefighting service, available
evacuation routes, access routes level enough for fire equipment use, and creation and
maintenance of fire breaks in brush areas.
Access is a key component of fire hazard prevention; fire-fighting equipment must be able to
reach fires and residents and visitors must be able to evacuate during a fire. Private roads,
particularly in hillside areas, are less likely to meet access and maintenance standards required
for public roads. The most effective method for avoiding fire risk in hazardous areas is the
regulation of housing development and the provision of alternate access routes for developed
areas. Unmaintained county roads may fail to meet City road construction standards and may
not provide adequate or alternative means of access.
Although fire protection services in the City and the Sphere of Influence are considered
adequate for most emergencies, they may prove inadequate in the event of an earthquake.
Fires associated with an earthquake are often scattered and spread rapidly due to an impaired
water system. In such cases, Saratoga’s current level of fire services could be insufficient and

water could be unavailable if reservoirs are ruptured or streams are obstructed. During minor
emergencies, fire stations within the vicinity of the City could provide assistance, but major
emergencies, such as large-scale fires, would require mutual aid from surrounding Counties,
State, and Federal Agencies.
i.   Fire Protection in Saratoga15
Santa Clara County Fire Department
The Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District a.k.a. Santa Clara County Fire
Department (herein referred to as “SCCFD” or “County Fire”) is a county-dependent special
district providing fire suppression, basic and advanced rescue, advanced life support first
response medical services, hazardous materials and technical rescue response, fire inspection,
fire investigation, disaster preparedness, and public education.16
The Department is divided into five service divisions: Administrative Services, Fire Prevention
Division, Operations Division, Training Division, and Support Services Division.                                    The Fire
Department personnel serve the territory from 17 fire stations.17
The City of Saratoga is served by four fire stations, which include:

and provides oversight and administration of the City’s Early Warning Fire Alarm System, aimed
at reducing fire response times. The district is co-located with the Santa Clara County Fire
Department in the Saratoga Fire Station.
ii. Assessment of Fire Risk in Wildland Areas
Saratoga is susceptible to wildland fires due to the steep topography, abundant fuel load, and
climatic conditions, particularly along the western and southwestern edges of the City. The
areas most susceptible to fire hazard are located west of Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road and
southwest of Saratoga-Los Gatos Road (Highway 9). Based on the Fire Hazard Severity Zone
mapping prepared by Cal FIRE, this portion of the City is identified within Very High, High, and
Moderate Fire Hazard Zones.18 As a result of this condition, the City (in coordination with CAL
FIRE) has established a Wildland-Urban Interface zone, which covers a majority of the areas
within the City that have moderate to very high fire hazard potential. Most of these areas are
located in the southern and western portions of the City, as depicted in Exhibit 7, Fire Hazard
Zones. As a result of this potential hazard, special fire protection measures and planning are
necessary within these areas of the City before development occurs.
The hillside areas of the City are characterized by native brush, grasslands and trees which are
prone to wildfire.         While the low density of housing in these areas minimizes the potential
danger to humans and structures, there is a danger that fire in one structure will start a wildfire
which could consume significant areas of the City.
The Santa Clara County FireSafe Council encourages a defensible space around residences to
protect homes while providing a safe area for firefighters. This defensible space is typically split
into a “Lean, Clean, and Green" Zone (low lying irrigated landscaping), and a "Reduced Fuel
Zone" (natural vegetation thinned to reduce fuel load). The same requirements (as well as
additional development regulations) are reinforced by the Uniform Fire Code for wildland-urban
interface areas.
Access and parking for emergency vehicles and delays in response time are the major public
safety concerns in this area. All fire apparatus access roads are required to have a pavement

                                                                        SAFETY ELEMENT
width of 20 feet.      Buildings within the City's wildland-urban interface require fire access.
Driveways in excess of 150 feet in length shall be provided with turnarounds and driveways in
excess of 200 feet in length and less than 20 feet in width shall be provided with turnouts in
addition to turnarounds.
Given the wildland-urban interface condition within the City, the Santa Clara County Fire
Department trains and equips their personnel to provide structure protection and limited initial
attack on wildland incidents. The goal is to prevent a fire in wildland space from expanding into
other high fire hazards areas. The fire hazard in Saratoga’s Sphere of Influence outside the City
limits is considerably higher than in the City and its incorporated hillsides. The major problems
contributing to adverse firefighting conditions in the Sphere of Influence include: areas of steep
slope, lack of adequate water supply, and intense vegetative cover. Mutual Aid Agreements
with other fire jurisdictions are in place to provide as-needed assistance and coverage for fire
emergencies within Saratoga and its surrounding environs.
Saratoga Fire Protection District Early Warning Fire Alarm System
The Saratoga Fire Protection District is responsible for providing fire awareness information and
administering the Early Warning Fire Alarm System for Saratoga residents. Residents who
install fire systems and subscribe to the service can quickly notify fire personnel of any fires.
This keeps response times low and allows firefighters to suppress fire emergency situations
quickly.
New single-family residences constructed within the City are generally larger than the older
existing homes (typically in excess of 5,000 square feet). Because of the size of these newer
dwellings, a fire may be more difficult to extinguish and, therefore, could potentially cause more
damage than would normally occur. As a result, Saratoga requires that all new construction
include an automatic fire sprinkler system, and Early Warning Fire Systems be installed in the
following situations:
     •   All new single-family dwellings, commercial structures and community facilities located
         within the Wildland-Urban Interface Area.
     •   Any existing single-family dwelling, commercial structure or community facility which is
         expanded by fifty percent or more in floor area and is located within the Wildland-Urban
         Interface Area.

    •   All new single-family dwellings, commercial structures and community facilities having a
        floor area in excess of five thousand square feet.
    •   Any existing single-family dwelling, commercial structure or community facility that is
        expanded by fifty percent or more in floor area which, after such expansion, will exceed
        five thousand square feet in floor area.
    •   All new multi-family dwellings and other new structures having multiple sleeping units
        including, but not limited to, hotels, motels, apartments, condominiums or other
        community housing projects, townhouses and nursing homes.
    •   Any existing multi-family dwelling or other structure having multiple sleeping units that
        are expanded by fifty percent or more in floor area.
In the event of an urban fire, ladder trucks and response engines from the Santa Clara County
Fire Department are the designated responders on all first and second alarms within urban
areas.
Assessment of Fire Risk in Urban Areas
Fire hazards in the flat, urbanized areas of Saratoga are relatively low. Although these areas
are higher in population density than the hillside areas, excessive amounts of combustible
vegetation is not present. The City’s Fire Code and trash pickup service have contributed to
removing a large portion of combustible vegetation and trash in the City’s urban area.
Response time for fire protection services are only a few minutes to any of the City’s more
densely populated neighborhoods, and the peak load water supply requirement of 1,000 gallons
of water per minute for two hours is more than adequate for these areas.
The summer fire season poses the greatest threat to residential areas in the City, particularly
during periods of high temperatures accompanied by extremely dry vegetation. Residences
with wood shake shingle roofs are especially susceptible to fire. Their vulnerability increases
dramatically during periods of drought and high winds and become a major concern to the fire
personnel. The future adoption of standards for fire retardant roof materials and residential
sprinklers for all areas of the City should be considered.

iii. Regulatory Framework – Fire Protection
State Regulations
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) is dedicated to the fire
protection and stewardship of over 31 million acres of California’s privately-owned wildland.
Santa Clara County Regulations
The Santa Clara County Fire Department has multiple publications and pamphlets to educate
residents on the dangers of wild and urban fire, how to defend against a fire, and how to
eliminate hazards that could prove costly in the event of a fire. This information is readily
available to residents, businesses, and interested stakeholders within Saratoga and surrounding
communities.
City of Saratoga Regulations
Chapter 16 of the Saratoga Municipal Code includes the most recently adopted State codes
(Building Code, Fire Code, Residential Building Code, etc.) associated with fire regulations that
affect development within the City. The requirements include the installation of Early Warning
Fire Alarm Systems and fire sprinkler systems.
Chapter 14 of Saratoga's Municipal Code (Subdivision Ordinance) requires a peak load water
supply of 1,000 gallons of water per minute for two hours for all housing developments. All new
developments are expected to meet this requirement and would not receive development
approval until adequate infrastructure is in place to support the proposed use.
iv. Hazardous Materials Storage and Disposal
The Santa Clara County Department of Public Health administers the Hazardous Materials
Program for the County. The Hazardous Materials Program is part of the Hazardous Materials
Compliance Division (HMCD) within Santa Clara County Department of Environmental Health.
HMCD is the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for all areas of Santa Clara County
other than the cities of Santa Clara, Gilroy, and Sunnyvale. HMCD provides comprehensive
environmental regulatory compliance inspection services to protect human health and the
environment. Additionally, program personnel perform plan reviews and inspections associated

with the construction, upgrading, and closure of hazardous materials storage facilities and
equipment.19
Saratoga does not have an identified problem with hazardous materials storage and handling.
No major chemical handlers are located in the City. Storage, use and disposal of hazardous
materials is typically limited to automotive service stations located in the City and normally
consists of anti-freeze, brake fluid, motor oil, and gasoline.
The Santa Clara County Local Hazard Mitigation Plan indicates that hazardous materials spills
are not of particular concern to the City of Saratoga.                         Generally, hazardous materials are
transported through the City rather than to a location within the City limits for storage or use.
The main transportation routes for these materials are Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road, State Route 9
and State Route 85.               If a hazardous chemical spill occurs, surface and groundwater
contamination is possible.              Floodplains and creeks lie in close proximity to the primary
transportation routes and can become contaminated quickly between the time a spill occurs and
the clean-up process begins. Any spills that may occur within the City would be responded to
by the Santa Clara County Fire Department with the clean-up operation being the responsibility
of the County of Santa Clara and the State of California.
v. Regulatory Framework – Hazardous Materials
Federal and State Regulations
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), enacted in 1976, is the principal
Federal law in the United States governing the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste.
The responsibility for implementation of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) was given to California EPA’s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) in
August 1992. The DTSC is also responsible for implementing and enforcing California’s own
hazardous waste laws, which are known collectively as the Hazardous Waste Control Law.
In addition to the U.S. EPA and the DTSC, the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB),
San Francisco Bay Region (Region 2), is the enforcing agency for the protection and restoration

                                                                     SAFETY ELEMENT
of water resources, including remediation of unauthorized releases of hazardous substances in
soil and groundwater.
The California Accidental Release Prevention Program Law (Cal ARP Program) (California
Health and Safety Code Section 25531-25543.3) provides for consistency with Federal laws
(i.e., the Emergency Preparedness and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Clean Air Act)
regarding accidental chemical releases and allows local oversight of both the State and Federal
programs.
Transportation of hazardous materials/waste is regulated by California Code of Regulations
(CCR) Title 26, Toxics.     The Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) is the primary
regulatory authority for the interstate transport of hazardous materials. The DOT establishes
regulations for safe handling procedures (i.e., packaging, marking, labeling and routing). The
California Highway Patrol and the California Department of Transportation enforce Federal and
State regulations and respond to hazardous materials transportation emergencies.
Occupational safety standards exist to minimize worker safety risks from both physical and
chemical hazards in the workplace. The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health
is responsible for developing and enforcing workplace safety standards and assuring worker
safety in the handling and use of hazardous materials.
The “Unified Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials Management Regulatory Program”
(Program) was created in 1993 by California State Senate Bill 1082 to consolidate, coordinate,
and make consistent the administrative requirements, permits, inspections, and enforcement
activities for environmental and emergency management programs.               The Program is
implemented at the local government level by Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPA).
Under the authority granted by the state, the Santa Clara County Hazardous Materials
Compliance Division administers the following programs and implements the following
regulations:
     •   Hazardous Waste Generator Program (California Health and Safety Code Chapter 6.5)
     •   Hazardous Waste Tiered Permitting (California Health and Safety Code Chapter 6.5)

     •  Underground Storage Tank (California Health and Safety Code Chapter 6.7)
     •  Aboveground Storage Tank SPCC Plan (California Health and Safety Code Chapter
        6.67)
     •  Hazardous Materials Business Plans (California Health and Safety Code Chapter 6.95)
     •  California Accidental Release Prevention Program (California Health and Safety Code
        Chapter 6.95)
The HMCD is also responsible for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Oversight program,
which manages the cleanup of areas contaminated by UST releases. The County's Hazardous
Materials Program also implements the Hazardous Materials Storage Ordinance (County
Ordinance No. NS-517.31) and the Toxic Gas Ordinance (County Ordinance No. NS-517.44).
Local Regulations
Chapter 8 of the Saratoga Municipal Code regulates hazardous materials within the City. The
purpose of Chapter 8 is to protect the health, life, resources, and property through the
prevention and control of unauthorized discharges of hazardous materials. The City delegates
its authority over the regulation of Hazardous Materials to the County of Santa Clara.
E. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND DISASTER PLANNING
Effective safety planning involves the development of regulations to prevent and/or mitigate
hazards and the preparation of plans to respond to emergencies.            While prevention and
mitigation are the most effective and prudent methods to protect the public and property from
imminent danger, the City must be prepared when disasters occur. The City has prepared an
Emergency Operations Plan (maintained and administered by the Santa Clara County Fire
Department), which is reviewed and updated every year.           Updating the plan on schedule
maintains the City’s eligibility for FEMA funded programs.
The Saratoga Municipal Code asserts the obligation of the City to protect the life and property of
Saratoga residents, and supports the policy of mutual aid and coordination with Santa Clara
County. City expenditures are authorized for the protection and benefit of residents and their
property. Furthermore, the City of Saratoga Emergency Operations Plan has been prepared to
establish both proactive and reactive measures in the event of a declared emergency.

i.  Emergency Operations Plan Purpose and Organization
The purpose of Saratoga’s Emergency Operations Plan is to create a framework for Saratoga
response personnel who will make the continual planning process both very clear and relatively
easy while identifying the hazards that exist in Saratoga. The Emergency Operations Plan also
enhances the development of Local Hazard Mitigation Planning on an ongoing basis and
addresses the needs of all people located in Saratoga. The primary hazards identified in the
Emergency Operations Plan are included in Table 1 – Hazard Analysis Likelihood of
Occurrence, below, according to their likelihood and severity:

The Emergency Operations Plan is organized into eight sections:
    I.   Introduction
    II. Hazard Assessment
    III. Prevention/Mitigation
    IV. Preparedness
    V. Response
    VI. Recovery
    VII. Appendices
Potential emergency situations are assessed and mitigation measures for those situations are
discussed in the various sections of the Emergency Operations Plan. Hazard-Specific Actions
are included to prevent potential hazardous situations and lessen the impacts of hazards should

an emergency situation occur.        For example, an earthquake is identified as a hazard.
Earthquakes are impossible to prevent, but mitigation measures to lessen the impact of
earthquakes can be implemented in advance of an earthquake, such as inspecting all structures
for weaknesses and providing emergency preparedness training to City employees and
volunteer responders.     Applicable preventative measures are also listed for wildfire, flood,
weather, public health, hazardous materials, and terrorism emergency situations.               The
Emergency Operations Plan includes measures that can be taken to prepare the community for
emergencies, such as training, public awareness, records protection, adherence to various
programs and policies (such as weed and brush abatement or adherence to setbacks from flood
zones), appointing field personnel, cross-jurisdictional preparedness, and maintaining relations
and communication with neighboring, State, and Federal Agencies. In the event of a disaster,
the plan contains response checklists and detailed responsibilities for emergency personnel to
follow depending on the level of the emergency or disaster situation. Recovery techniques and
protocols are also discussed in the Emergency Operations Plan to restore all systems back to
normal working order following a disaster or emergency.
ii. Emergency Evacuation Plan
An important emergency preparedness function within the City is the development of evacuation
plans which readily and effectively relocate residents from hazardous areas to safer locations.
An integral part of evacuation planning is the identification of evacuation routes and shelter
spaces. Exhibit 8, Evacuation Routes, illustrates the routes of movement on local collector and
arterial streets and the designated evacuation routes that should be followed in order to promote
safe and efficient evacuation of residents out of the City. A secondary evacuation route has
been identified along Sarahills Drive and Verde Vista Lane, which would be necessary if
evacuation along Pierce Road becomes difficult or requires re-routing.
This map shows that the majority of the City’s evacuation routes are located in the area
between Prospect Avenue and Saratoga-Los Gatos Road, and Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road and
Quito Road, where the population is of a higher density than in the hillside areas. Depending on
the nature of the disaster, some access roads in the hillside areas may be closed or impeded,
creating the necessity for residents to evacuate from the area along substandard emergency
access roads or by helicopter.

It is important to know the locations of places of assembly that can accommodate significant
numbers of people. The American Red Cross establishes facility agreements with schools,
churches, recreation halls and large facilities in order to take in evacuees and provide mass
care, feeding, and sheltering. It also provides casework services for those who have suffered
losses, and physical and mental health services for the victims of disasters.
Anticipated Red Cross emergency locations within Saratoga (shaded) and surrounding
communities are listed in Table 2 – American Red Cross Shelters, below. In the event of a major
disaster or emergency, if deemed safe for public use, these facilities would house residents as
"primary places of assembly." Following an earthquake, all facilities will be inspected prior to
being designated as a shelter or gathering location. However, it should be noted that after an
emergency/ disaster event other facilities within Saratoga and surrounding areas may offer
evacuation shelter services outside of those listed in Table 2.

iii. Regulatory Framework
State Regulations
Through the California Emergency Services Act of 1970, the California Office of Emergency
Service provides the basis for local emergency preparedness.         The Office of Emergency
Services is responsible for preparing the California State Emergency Plan and for coordinating
and supporting emergency services conducted by local governments. The responsibility for
immediate response to an emergency, such as fires, landslides, earthquakes or riots, rests with
local government agencies and segments of the private sector, with support services provided
by other jurisdictions and/or State and Federal agencies.      In accordance with their normal
operating procedures, the initial response to an emergency will be made by local Fire, Law
Enforcement, Medical or Maintenance (Public Works) districts or departments.
Local Regulations
The City of Saratoga implements its Emergency Operations Plan, which provides an overview of
prevention and operational concepts, identifies components of the City’s emergency
management organization within the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)
and by extension, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and describes the overall
responsibilities of the federal, state and county entities and the City for protecting life and
property and assuring the overall wellbeing of the population.
 III.   GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
A. CONTEXT FOR SAFETY ELEMENT POLICY
The development of policies within the Safety Element is based upon a broad understanding of
the issues and hazards that affect the City of Saratoga. The City prides itself on its ability to
provide a high level of service to its residents and collaborates with County Agencies in
community education and outreach to create a safer environment. The following provides the
policy context for developing the goals, policies, and implementation measures for the City of
Saratoga Safety Element:
Draft February 2013                                                                           46

                                                                         SAFETY ELEMENT
i.   Land Instability Hazards
Given the close proximity to several active and potentially active faults and the steep
topographic relief within the western and southern portions of the City, site-specific geologic
review is necessary to evaluate geologic and seismic hazards that may affect developments
within particular areas of the City. Many areas of the City are susceptible to unstable land
conditions either from earthquake faults, steep topography, poor soil conditions, or any
combination thereof. In response to this, the City requires geotechnical engineering reports for
development within areas known for geologic or seismic hazards.            In addition, issuance of
grading permits for hillside development areas and critical uses such as hospitals and utilities
require additional study and evaluation to further ensure public safety. The City may preclude
development within hazard areas through the use of open space land use designations, where
necessary.
ii. Flood Hazards
The City of Saratoga has three major drainages that traverse through the City, draining from
south to north and ultimately emptying into the San Francisco Bay. These creeks are the San
Tomas Aquino, Saratoga and Calabazas Creeks. In addition to these creeks, several smaller
creeks tributary to the San Tomas Aquino and Calabazas creeks are also located within the
City. These three drainages and several of their tributaries are located within the FEMA 100-
year floodplain, which could impact properties adjacent to these drainages during a significant
flooding event. In addition, the entire City is also located within the FEMA 500-year floodplain.
Along with flooding associated with weather related events, Saratoga Creek is also susceptible
to flooding by dam inundation in association with the failure of Lake Ranch Reservoir located
outside of the City’s Sphere of Influence. Inundation is anticipated to stay within the Saratoga
creek bed; however, several roadways that cross this drainage could be impacted by flood
waters.
As a participant in FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program, the City has adopted a
Floodplain Management Ordinance. Through this ordinance, General Plan policies and other
regulations during the City’s development review process, all new developments are required to
mitigate potential flooding impacts.         This, in conjunction with potential flood control
improvements made by the City, will ensure that future impacts are reduced or minimized.
Draft February 2013                                                                             47

                                                                       SAFETY ELEMENT
Furthermore, the City will work closely with the Santa Clara County Development Services office
to implement regional improvements that benefit Saratoga as well as surrounding areas by
improving regional flooding and drainage impacts.
iii. Fire Hazards
The City is currently served by the Santa Clara County Fire Department and Saratoga Fire
Protection District. The major fire concern for the City is the proximity of existing developments
to high fire hazard areas within the southern and western portions of the City.            Effective
management of these areas and implementation of proper development controls that reduce
risk to fire hazards (wildland-urban interface [WUI] area) is an important component of this
Element.
Working closely with the Fire Department, the City of Saratoga can emphasize the need for
adequate training of firefighting personnel to address the changing needs of the community. As
part of this effort, it will also be very important that the residents and businesses within the
community understand their role in fire prevention and impact reduction activities that could
save lives.
Preventive measures will continue to be an important part of fire protection in Saratoga,
including conditions of development, fuel modification, and weed abatement activities/
landscaping maintenance to deter the spread of wildland/urban interface fires.                Other
preventative measures include Fire Department review of site plans / development application,
community education and outreach and code enforcement activities aimed at reducing potential
hazards in the WUI areas. The primary preventative measure administered by the Saratoga
Fire Protection District is the City’s Early Warning Fire Alarm System that is required for most
new residential construction. This system alerts the Fire Department as soon as a fire occurs,
with the intention of reducing fire response time and potential damage to the structure and
surrounding area.
Protecting Saratoga residents and businesses from the harmful effects of hazardous materials
and waste is a high priority. Although the City does not have a significant amount of hazardous
materials/ waste generators or businesses that store these materials, there is still some risk
associated with the release of hazardous materials into the environment.               Through the
Draft February 2013                                                                               48

                                                                        SAFETY ELEMENT
promotion of effective handling, use, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and waste,
as well as the education of Saratoga residents on these issues, the City is committed to
maintaining a safe community for existing and future residents and businesses. The entitlement
review/ approval process and adherence to current and future State and Federal regulations will
also help ensure that new developments within the City incorporate the necessary protections
and improvements to reduce the risk and exposure of hazardous materials release and
minimize impacts of a release. Prevention of future releases is of great importance due to the
City’s reliance on groundwater resources for drinking water.
iv. Emergency Preparedness
The City of Saratoga desires a high level of emergency preparedness and response services to
its residents. Working closely with the Santa Clara County Office of Emergency Services, Fire
Department and Sheriff’s Office, the City strives to promote safer development of the hillside
areas and facilitate effective notification and response to emergency situations through their
development review processes. Understanding that many aspects of the Fire Department’s and
Sheriff’s Office operations are beyond City control, ongoing collaboration with these agencies on
existing and future training and equipment needs will be a priority.
The Emergency Operations Plan is the master document that organizes emergency
preparedness and response efforts in Saratoga. The Emergency Operations Plan provides a
framework for coordination with other agencies at the regional and state levels.             Each
department involved in implementation of the Emergency Operations Plan has the responsibility
to internalize the plan in its own operations, as well as keep the plan up-to-date. Dedicated staff
support from the Santa Clara County Fire Department has assisted the City in ensuring regular
update, maintenance, and implementation of the Emergency Operations Plan.
Public awareness and education is a critical part of emergency preparedness. An educated
public will know how to prevent injury and property damage during and after emergency events,
and also know how to find and offer help to their neighbors. Through collaboration with the
Santa Clara County Office of Emergency Services and promotion of educational programs like
Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), community members receive the training
needed to be self-sufficient during a major emergency. In addition to this, the City and the
Santa Clara County Fire Department work to disseminate basic emergency preparedness
information to the residents and businesses of Saratoga.
Draft February 2013                                                                             49

                                                                           SAFETY ELEMENT
B. GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
The following goals, policies, and implementation measures have been developed to guide
development within the City of Saratoga. The purpose of this information is to establish a policy
framework that is consistent with the City’s vision, that meets the community’s needs and that
effectively addresses the potential hazards that could impact the City. In addition, the City of
Saratoga Annex to the Santa Clara County Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP) is hereby
incorporated into this Safety Element by reference. The LHMP, last adopted by the City of
Saratoga on February 15, 2012, is required to be updated every five years to maintain eligibility
for Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs administered by FEMA pursuant to the
Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The LHMP contains a vulnerability analysis highlighting specific
facilities at risk to natural hazards and outlines strategies for reducing risk to the identified
hazards.

21.2 INTERNAL PLANNING PROCESS
The City of Saratoga participated in the regional planning process coordinated by ABAG and the
local planning process coordinated by Santa Clara County OES as noted in Section 3 of this plan.
The City of Saratoga participated in one City/County workshop sponsored by ABAG, as it was most
relevant to the City’s size and operations.
For more information on meetings held by ABAG and for rosters of attendees, please see Appendix
A and H in the ABAG Multi-Jurisdictional Local Hazard Mitigation Plan 2010 (MJ-LHMP). In
addition, the City of Saratoga has provided written and oral comments on the multi-jurisdictional
plan and provided information on critical facilities to ABAG.
Barbara Powell, Assistant City Manager, served as the City’s representative and lead for completing
this annex. Supported by Jim Yoke, Emergency Services Coordinator, the City was represented at
Local Planning Team meetings #1, #2, and #3. Barbara and Jim performed internal reviews and
collaboration in order to provide all of the required information for development of this annex.
Contact information: bpowell@saratoga.ca.us, 408.868.1215
Key staff met to identify and prioritize mitigation strategies appropriate for the City. Staff members
involved in these meetings included the Community Development Director, Building Official, Public
Works Director and Assistant City Manager. Representatives from the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s
Office, Santa Clara County Fire Department and Saratoga Fire Protection District were also present.

Public Outreach
The City provided the opportunity for the public to comment on the draft mitigation strategies
selected by City staff at the City Council meeting on November 4, 2009. The meeting is streamed
live on the City of Saratoga website and the draft mitigation strategies were available on the City
website. No public comments were received from either the meeting or the internet posting. A copy
of the meeting minutes are included in Saratoga Attachment 1: Outreach Materials.
The City Council will adopt the plan in a public meeting via an official Resolution upon approval by

Survey Results
On November 1, 2010, the Local Planning Team released an online survey to solicit public input
regarding concerns for hazard risk. The Local Planning Team also used this survey to gauge the level
of public preparedness for emergencies. The survey responses received from the City of Saratoga
residents are summarized below:
    1. 28 out of 541 survey respondents were from the City of Saratoga.
    2. Respondents were asked which five hazards, out of the 31 hazards the LPT identified, are of
        most concern to their neighborhood or home. Below are responses from the City of Saratoga
        (in order of most responses):

With a clear hazard mitigation strategy, as outlined in this Local Hazard Mitigation Plan, the City’s
departments are able to implement their ongoing policies and programs with consideration of the
identified hazard risks. In addition, these departments become aware of priority mitigation actions
and can offer resources (financial or staffing) to assist with the implementation of those actions.
21.3.2.2 Technical Capability
For a successful mitigation program, it is necessary to have a diverse breadth of staff and technical
capabilities. Planners, engineers, building inspectors, emergency managers, floodplain managers,
people familiar with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and grant writers are all essential to
implementing mitigation actions. The following table summarizes the staffing capabilities available
within the City of Saratoga.

21.3.2.4 Policy or Program Capability
The City of Saratoga has several plans and ordinances in place which provide ample opportunities for
implementing the hazard mitigation strategy outlined in this plan.
  21.3.2.4.1     Summary of Plans that Support Hazard Mitigation
Emergency Operations Plan
The City of Saratoga’s Emergency Operations Plan (EOP):
    • identifies hazards that exist in Saratoga and the likelihood that they will occur in the City,
    • outlines the strengths and weaknesses of the municipality in its preparedness activities, and,
    • guides the City and agencies through a response to any emergency and through the recovery
        process of a disaster.
Two purposes of Saratoga’s emergency plan are to enhance the development of Local Hazard
Mitigation Planning on an ongoing basis and to support collaboration efforts between municipal staff
and external partners such as fire services, law enforcement, utility organizations, colleges,
community groups, and volunteers. The plan is designed to address the needs of all people located in
Saratoga when a disaster happens. An outline of the EOP as it relates to hazard mitigation is
provided below.
Hazard Analysis- The EOP ranks hazards by their likelihood to occur in Saratoga and the severity of
the hazard if it were to occur. The hazards listed in the EOP include: aviation disaster, civil
disturbance, earthquake, extreme weather/storm, floods, landslides, HAZMAT, heat wave, public
health emergency, terrorism, transportation-highway, wildfire/forest fire.
Prevention & Mitigation- The EOP lists hazard specific mitigation actions to take in order to reduce
the severity of damage that may result from the hazards listed above. The hazards and the hazard
specific mitigation actions are listed below.
             1. Earthquake

                     Encourage school surveillance processes
            6. Hazardous Materials
                     Encourage familiarity with MSDS binders in the workplace
                     Train staff to store, use, and dispose of hazardous materials properly
                     Promote safe disposal of hazardous materials in the community
                     Promote education in large population buildings, shopping centers and
                        schools regarding the Shelter in Place protocol for hazardous materials
                        emergencies
            7. Terrorism
                     Train staff to recognize suspicious packages and/or boxes, particularly those
                        who process the mail.
                     Train residents to be aware of the surroundings and to be willing to report
                        suspicious activity to the Sheriff’s Office
Preparedness- The Preparedness section of the EOP details the City of Saratoga emergency
organization, including the role of the Disaster Council, City Council, Mayor, and Director of
Emergency Services. The plan also details the organization and roles of other City agencies and
volunteers working in the field and at emergency operations centers. The organization and role of
Santa Clara County, the State of California, and federal agencies is also documented in this plan.
The Preparedness section also provides brief explanations of other hazard mitigation related
documents; such as a Heat Wave Plan, Local Hazard Mitigation Plan, Saratoga Community
Emergency Response Team (CERT) Operations Plan and Communications Plan, Point of
Distribution Plan, Terrorism/WMD Plan, and a Volunteer Management Plan. Preparing and
educating the public is deemed a responsibility of the American Red Cross, Saratoga CERT, and
Santa Clara County Fire Department in this section of the plan. Also, methods to protect vital
records by using a backup system are documented. The City of Saratoga has designated the areas to
the west of Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road and south of Highway 9 as a high fire hazard area. New
construction in that area must comply with California Building Code Chapter 7A, which requires fire
safe construction standards. A Weed and Brush Abatement program, requiring property owners to
clear weeds and brush, also exists in Saratoga in an effort to reduce the risk of wildfire.

Response- The response section of Saratoga’s EOP defines three levels of emergency that can be
declared in the City and describes when the EOP and/or Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) are
activated. The location and functions of the EOCs in Saratoga are listed in this section.
Recovery- The mitigation aspect of recovery operations is critical in reducing or eliminating disaster
related property damage and loss of lives from reoccurring. The immediate post-disaster period
presents a rare opportunity for mitigation. During this time, officials and citizens are more
responsive to mitigation recommendations, and unique opportunities to rebuild or redirect
development may be available. Recovery plans would benefit from addressing mitigation planning
as part of the recovery process. Changes in building codes, variances or set-backs in construction,
zoning (to reduce types of construction in high hazard areas), and relocation or removal of structures
from high hazard zones are some forms of mitigation that may aid in hazard mitigation in the future.
General Plan
The General Plan charts the future of the City as expressed by the citizens and consists of goals,
policies, action programs, area plans, and basic information regarding the City of Saratoga.
Saratoga’s General Plan facilitates hazard mitigation in several ways. Following is a brief summary
of three General Plan Elements highlighting the capabilities for implementing and supporting hazard
mitigation.
         Safety Element
The City of Saratoga recognizes within the Safety Element that public safety is the overarching goal
in all new land-use planning in order to mitigate natural hazards. Housing development within
Saratoga is designed with safety as a priority being maintained through regular building safety
inspections. The community has identified its priority safety concerns, such as ensuring that gas,
water and sewer leaks are identified and are cleaned up. Precautions are undertaken for emergency
workers, in order to reduce exposure to toxic substances in the event of an emergency. Precautionary
planning is integrated into all the City’s planning in order to mitigate future risk. The Safety Element
is an integral component of Saratoga’s policy. No development will be permitted without an
individual site-specific geotechnical investigation to determine soil stability, location of rift zones
and the potential for other localized geotechnical problems. An early warning fire alarm system will
be installed in all new single and multi-family dwellings. The city continues to enforce flood control
regulations. It cooperates with the Santa Clara Valley Water District in regards to projects which
impact floodways, in order mitigate the impact of development on flood hazards.
         Land Use Element
The city’s land use planning policies, as outlined in the Land Use Element, address future growth

provisions to meet the demand for temporary shelters. The Land Use Element notes that all future
land use and planning shall be in accordance with mitigation of public safety hazards, such as natural
hazards impacted through increased development. The City of Saratoga aims to employ a wise use of
natural resources to avoid natural hazards. These uses include agriculture, mineral extraction, parks
and low intensity recreational facilities, land in its natural state, wildlife refuges and very low
intensity residential development.
         Housing Element
Housing in the City of Saratoga aims to address risks through use of appropriate building materials
and site location and regular inspection. The city has a Building Inspection Division which is
responsible for administering the Uniform Building Code requirements. This occurs through the
plan-checking and on-site inspection processes. The Code Enforcement Division is responsible for
enforcing the Municipal Code and for administering both special business license and event permit
requirements and parking fine and false alarm collections. The City of Saratoga’s building and fire
codes support hazard mitigation. The city participates in the National Flood Insurance Program and
Community Rating System. The city has facilities and infrastructure in place for the construction and
availability of emergency housing. Lines of communication have been developed and established to
work with appropriate federal agencies in order to obtain housing resources in the event of an
emergency. Accommodations have been made for rehabilitation to fair and low-income housing in
order to maintain residences in line with safety standards. The City aims to “assist low-income
property owners in improving substandard dwelling units”. High risk development areas will be
limited to development in order to protect the environment and public health. The City requires
installation of an early warning fire alarm system for all new housing. Future housing on hillsides
shall implement grading along natural contours to avoid erosion, flooding slides and other hazards.
Class “A” roof materials will be used in high fire zones to reduce risk. In addition, new development
shall incorporate materials which take into account seismic concerns.
Floodplain Management Plan
In an effort to reduce the risk of loss of life, health, and property due to periodic flood inundation, the
City of Saratoga has developed a floodplain management plan. The plan is designed to minimize the
expenditure of public money for flood control projects, the need for rescue and relief efforts, business
interruptions, and damage to public facilities and utilities. The floodplain management plan also
ensures that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard and that
those who occupy property in those areas are held responsible for their actions. A floodplain
administrator is responsible for the enforcement of this plan.
To reduce flood losses, the plan includes methods and provisions to control the alteration of natural
floodplains, stream channels, and protective barriers; to control filling, grading, dredging and other
development that can increase flood damage; to regulate the construction of flood barriers which can
divert flood waters or increase flood hazards in other areas; and to require that uses vulnerable to

floods be protected against flood damage at the time of their construction. One of the provisions of
this plan is that a development permit must be obtained before any construction or development
begins and that certain construction standards, such as anchoring, building with flood resistant
materials, and elevating and floodproofing, are required within an area of special flood hazard. The
plan also enforces that new and replacement water and sanitary sewage systems should be designed
to minimize flood water infiltration and discharge into flood waters. Standards are also included for
subdivisions and manufactured homes.
Capital Improvements Plan
There are several projects listed within the City of Saratoga’s Capital Improvements Plan,
particularly in the Streets Program section, the Facility Projects Section, and the Administrative
Projects Section, that may contribute to implementation of the mitigation strategy.
    Streets Program- The Streets Program includes projects that develop and maintain the City’s
    roadway system to provide safe and efficient traffic flows, street lighting for traffic safety,
    development and maintenance of street surfaces, storm drain systems, curbs, gutters and
    sidewalks, bridges and retaining walls, and utility undergrounding. Street repair and resurfacing
    keeps the streets in good condition and reduces liability expenses caused by roads in poor
    condition. Roadway safety projects and traffic calming are focused on reducing driver speed and
    making pedestrians more visible in order to reduce the number of traffic accidents in the City.
    Improvement to storm drains can mitigate the damage caused by floods, such as sink holes in
    roadways, damage to private property, and soil erosion. Improvement to and installation of
    sidewalk curbs, particularly vertical curbs that provide greater control of runoff water flow, can
    also reduce the potential for flooding and flood damage. Repairs to bridges and retaining walls
    can increase safety for pedestrians and vehicle users. Utility undergrounding projects, moving
    overhead utilities underground, can reduce safety risks associated with downed power lines.
    Fallen power lines can be especially problematic during winter storms.
    Facilities Project Section- The Facilities Project Section includes projects for purchasing,
    constructing or making capital repairs to City buildings, structures and equipment. The city-
    owned buildings that are funded by these projects include the civic center, Saratoga Prospect
    Center, Village Historical Park, and the library building. Repairs include installing alarm
    systems, security locks, and general maintenance and improvements. Ongoing maintenance and
    improvements helps to prevent larger problems and costs associated with deferred maintenance,
    and increases the longevity of City facilities. Safety-related maintenance reduces liability
    expenses.
    Administrative Improvement Projects Section- The Administrative Improvement Projects
    Section includes projects designed to improve the City’s information technology infrastructure
    and communication systems. Upgrading the City’s telecommunication system from PBX to
    Voice over Internet Protocol is expected to increase the reliability of the City’s phone system.

      This added reliability will be especially important during emergency situations. The City has
      also purchased and installed an emergency power supply to provide power to the City’s server
      room and the building during power outages. This project will ensure that City operations
      remain active during power outages and it is especially critical during emergency situations.

Saratoga
The City of Saratoga identified several ordinances and policies currently utilized for hazard
mitigation in the matrix of regional mitigation strategies prepared by ABAG as part of the 2010 plan
update. Below is a summary of these key ordinances and policies.
Floodplain Management Ordinance
The City of Saratoga has participated in the National Flood Insurance Program since 1973. The City
of Saratoga filed NFIP Regular Program (with base flood elevation) biennial reports for calendar
year 2007 and 2008 (filed in 2009). In 1996, the City’s Municipal Code Article 16-66 Flood Plain
Management via City Council adoption of Ordinance No. 71-167. The City of Saratoga utilizes
digital flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance studies, and other studies supplied by applicants
when developing properties located in flood hazard areas to regulate development in flood hazard
areas. The City has no repetitive flood loss properties.
Ordinance 256
Ordinance 256 adds Articles 16-16 and 16-17; repeals and replaces Articles 16-15 and 16-20—16-
35. Article 16-16 relates to repair and reconstruction, and Article 16-17 relates to excavation and
grading. The California Building Standard Code does not provide for damaged structures to be
repaired or reconstructed to a structurally safe level, accounting for upgrades in wind and seismic
standards. The ability to repair structures based upon the most recent industry knowledge is
necessary to prevent or mitigate unnecessary future damage or injury. Therefore, Article 16-16 is
added and referred to as the ‘Repair and Reconstruction Code’. The City of Saratoga’s dense
Santa Clara County Hazard Mitigation Plan
March 29, 2012                                                                                                       P a g e | 21-30

population is located in an area of high seismic activity and steep slopes susceptible to erosion. The
provisions in the 2007 California Building Code provide only general direction and therefore Article
16-17 ‘Excavation and Grading Code’ is added. It addresses areas of critically expansive soil and
other unstable soil conditions which create a need for soil retention and diversion or increased flow
of surface waters, particularly on steep slopes.
Ordinance 71-167
This ordinance repeals and replaces article 16-66 relating to floodplain management. The revised
article includes methods and provisions to:
 (a)Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
 (b)Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
 (c)Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
 (d)Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
(e)Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or
which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
Ordinance 71-193
Ordinance 71-193 amends Articles, 16-05, 16-15, 16-20, 16-25, 16-30, 16-35, 16-40 and 16-45, of
the Saratoga Code of Ordinances. And adopts “by reference the following building standards codes
comprising part of the California building standards code: The 1997 editions of the uniform building
code as amended, the uniform fire code as amended, the uniform plumbing code, the uniform
mechanical code as amended, the 1996 edition of the national electrical code and the 1997 editions of
the uniform housing code as amended and the abatement of hazardous buildings code, as amended...”
Ordinance 215
Ordinance 215 adds Sections 16-15.065 and 16-15.095; amends Sections 16-15.010, 16-15.030, 16-
25.010, 16-35.010 and Article 16-30; and repeals Section 16-05.020. These articles include the
General Provisions for Building Regulations, Building Code, Fire Code, Plumbing Code, Mechanical
Code, Electrical Code, Housing Code, and Abatement of Dangerous Building Code. Some of the
general implications of this ordinance include the following: California Building Standards Code
became effective for the City of Saratoga; the City of Saratoga has the right to amend the California
Building Standards Code where amendments are necessary because of local conditions; adoption of
the 2001 California Building, Plumbing, Mechanical, and Electrical Codes; defines types of
construction, correct designations and references in the Saratoga City Code.

21.3.3 National Flood Insurance Program
For decades, the national response to flood disasters was simply to provide disaster relief to flood
victims. Funded by citizen tax dollars, this approach failed to reduce losses and didn't provide a way
to cover the damage costs of all flood victims. To compound the problem, the public generally
couldn't buy flood coverage from insurance companies, because private insurance companies
consider floods too costly to insure. In the face of mounting flood losses and escalating costs of
disaster relief to U.S. taxpayers, Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
The goals of the program are to reduce future flood damage through floodplain management, and to
provide people with flood insurance. Community participation in the NFIP is voluntary.
The City of Saratoga has participated in the National Flood Insurance Program since 1973. All
residents of the City are eligible to purchase federal flood insurance. The City of Saratoga filed NFIP
Regular Program (with base flood elevation) biennial reports for calendar year 2007 and 2008 (filed
in 2009). In 1996, the City’s Municipal Code Article 16-66 Flood Plain Management was
implemented via City Council adoption of Ordinance No. 71-167.
The City of Saratoga utilizes digital flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance studies, and other
studies supplied by applicants when developing properties located in flood hazard areas to regulate
development in flood hazard areas.
21.3.3.1 Community Rating System (CRS)
The CRS is a voluntary part of the National Flood Insurance Program that seeks to coordinate all
flood-related activities, reduce flood losses, facilitate accurate insurance rating, and promote public
awareness of flood insurance by creating incentives for a community to go beyond minimum
floodplain management requirements. The incentives are in the form of insurance premium
discounts. CRS ratings are on a 10-point scale (from 10 to 1, with 1 being the best rating), with
residents of the community who live within FEMA’s Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) receiving
a 5% reduction in flood insurance rates for every Class improvement in the community’s CRS rating.
The City of Saratoga has not joined the Community Rating System.
21.3.3.2 Repetitive Loss Properties
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) insures properties against flooding losses
in the Bay Area through the National Flood Insurance Program.
As part of the process to reduce or eliminate repetitive flooding to structures across the United
States, FEMA has developed an official Repetitive Loss Strategy. The purpose behind the
national strategy is to identify, catalog, and propose mitigation measures to reduce flood losses to

the relatively few number of structures that absorb the majority of the premium dollars from the
national flood insurance fund.
A repetitive loss property is defined by FEMA as “a property for which two or more
National Flood Insurance Program losses of at least $1,000 each have been paid within any 10-
year period since 1978.”
The City of Saratoga has no repetitive flood loss properties.

Attachment 3: Saratoga Exposure Analysis.
21.4.2 Exposure Analysis
Exposure analyses are used to quantify assets which are “exposed” to risk. This is the first step
towards understanding the complete value of assets at risk to identified hazards. This section includes
an exposure analysis (discussion of assets at risk) for the profiled hazards in Section 4.
Overlay analyses (using GIS) were conducted for the mappable hazards such as wildfire, flood, and
the earthquake related hazards. These analyses compare the location of the critical facilities with the
mapped hazard area (i.e. floodplains, wildfire threat zones, shaking potential areas, etc.) and result in
a listing of which facilities are at most risk to which hazard. Not all hazards are mappable and some
hazards, such as drought, are equally likely throughout the entire County. For these hazards, a
general exposure summary is presented in Section 21.4.2.1.

21.4.2.2 Critical Facilities Exposure by Hazard
ABAG’s website (http://quake.abag.ca.gov/mitigation/cf2010/) presents the results of the regional
facilities exposure analysis through a searchable online database. Users can view the summaries of
how many facilities are exposed to the mappable hazards by category: health care facilities, schools,
critical facilities, and bridges/interchanges. For the purposes of developing a City specific mitigation
strategy, this section identifies which of the City’s critical facilities are located in the mapped hazard
areas.
The complete results from ABAG’s exposure analysis are available digitally in an excel spreadsheet
from the City. A complete printing of these results is included in Saratoga Attachment 3: Saratoga
Exposure Analysis.

21.6 PLAN MAINTENANCE
As required Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, the City of Saratoga will update this plan annex at least
once every five years, by participating in a multi-agency effort with ABAG and other agencies to
develop a multi-jurisdictional plan.
The City Manager’s Office will ensure that monitoring of this Annex will occur. The plan will be
monitored on an on-going basis. However, the major disasters affecting our City, legal changes,
notices from ABAG as the lead agency in this process, and other triggers will be used. Finally, the
Annex will be a discussion item on the agenda of the meeting of department leaders at least once a
year in April. At that meeting, the department heads will focus on evaluating the Annex in light of
technological and political changes during the past year or other significant events. The department
leaders will be responsible for determining if the plan should be updated.
The City Manager’s Office will contact ABAG four years after this plan is approved to ensure that
ABAG plans to undertake the plan update process. If so, the City again plans to participate in the
multi-jurisdictional plan. If ABAG is unwilling or unable to act as the lead agency in the multi-
jurisdictional effort, other agencies will be contacted, including the County’s Office of Emergency
Services. Jurisdictions should then work together to identify another regional forum for developing a
multi-jurisdictional plan.
The public will continue to be involved whenever the plan is updated and as appropriate during the
monitoring and evaluation process. Prior to adoption of updates, the County will provide the
opportunity for the public to comment on the updates. A public notice will be posted prior to the
meeting to announce the comment period and meeting logistics.

Valley Transportation Authority PAC – meets Thursday evening and may vote on a
couple items: Reorganization of small city groupings – specifically whether or not to add

representatives are appointed to the board. He noted VTA may be looking at additional
employee layoffs due to the downturn in the economy and reduced ridership.
Vice Mayor Kathleen King – reported:
West Valley Flood Control Zone & Watershed Advisory Committee – suggested Council
reconsider this committee as they only schedule four meetings a year and feels the
meetings have not been very productive overall.
SSC Cities Association Executive Board – will meet next Thursday and noted the Cities
Association will have “California Forward” come in to talk about the future Initiatives,
such as the City of San Jose’s efforts to ban plastic bags, CDC grants of $376 million
dollars that are available to the County Health Departments and only 40 grants will be
given out. These grants will be applied to improving access to community exercise
programs, quitting smoking, and general health plan coverage’s. She reminded Council of
the annual Christmas Party on December 3, 2009.
Councilmember Jill Hunter – reported:
Thanked KSAR for always attending every city function and for interviewing people.
Library Joint Powers Association – she attended the County Library meeting and noted
they will be conducting a survey of people that do not have library cards; adding that only
45% of Saratogans have a library card. She stated their goal is to increase the number of
library cards and circulation as this is what determines how much funding the Saratoga
Library receives. She added Saratoga was recognized for their donation of $50K to the
library. She thanked the Friends of the Library group for their continued fund raising
efforts.
Santa Clara County Valley Water District Commission – she attended the last meeting;
they discussed the new changes that will be effective January 1, 2010 and stated the
District’s goal is to have people cut back 20% in their water usage. She noted the County
in general has reduced water usage by 15%.
Councilmember Howard Miller – reported: he attended the HTC Policy Committee
meeting as an alternate and noted there are two items Council will want to be aware of
regarding CDBG Grants. He stated the downturn in the economy has caused the County
to look for ways to minimize the cost of their programs. For 2011 the County will try to
limit the amount of administrative overhead for public service grants by considering
having fewer grants at a larger amount. In addition they are considering retaining about
                                               7

$15,000 of administrative dollars that normally the City would use to administer the

for business; and they expressed their appreciation to the city for waiving the CUP fee.
KSAR – is looking at spending some of the PEG capital dollars to purchase some video
editing stations.
Santa Clara County Emergency Council – will be attending the meeting on Thursday.
Council Finance Standing Committee – met earlier today and noted Council did receive
an updated Financial Report. He added the new computer software system is now able to
generate reports for current revenue and expense by quarter, versus by budget. He stated
expenses are below what was expected at this point – which is good; and revenue is
difficult to determine as it is very seasonal, e.g. property tax dollars, which will be
coming later in the fiscal year and those tax dollars are at where we expected them; and
the Building Department has been issuing a lot of building permits, however, due to the
economy not as many projects are coming in right now.
Councilmember Susie Nagpal – Excused Absence.

                                            plan also reviews City-owned facilities (e.g. buildings and park facilities) to determine whether they are vulnerable to
                                            damage in the event of a natural disaster.
