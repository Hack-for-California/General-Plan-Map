1 INTRODUCTION
  Monte Sereno is a quiet residential community nestled in the hills of western Santa
  Clara County. Residents of Monte Sereno enjoy peaceful neighborhoods, abundant
  open space and a serene lifestyle within close proximity to a variety of high-quality
  urban amenities. The City has adopted this General Plan to maintain and enhance
  these community characteristics that are highly valued by Monte Sereno residents.
  This General Plan also strives to promote a way of life in Monte Sereno that is
  environmentally sustainable and in balance with the natural environment.
  A. Purpose of this General Plan Update
  The General Plan is the principal policy document to guide future conservation,
  enhancement and development in Monte Sereno. It represents the basic policy
  direction of the City Council on community values, ideals and aspirations to govern
  a shared environment through 2025. The General Plan addresses all aspects of de-
  velopment including land use, transportation, housing, public facilities and infra-
  structure and open space.
  California State law requires that the General Plan be comprehensive, internally
  consistent and long-term. Although required to address certain issues specified in
  State law, the General Plan may be organized in a way that best suits the City. The
  plan must be clearly written, accessible to all those concerned with the community's
  development and easy to administer.
  The General Plan is a public document that guides day-to-day decisions of the City
  Council, its commissions and City staff. The General Plan provides a framework
  for the City Council to compare and evaluate specific projects, to prioritize re-
  sources and to ensure that City policies and programs respond to residents’ needs,
  values and desires. As the “constitution” for development in Monte Sereno, all
  other policy documents, such as the City’s zoning ordinance, must be consistent
  with the General Plan.
                                                                                      1

B. History of Monte Sereno
Monte Sereno was established in the early 1900’s as a rural agricultural community.
The area was dotted with ranch houses, orchards, dairies and livestock, and the
mountain slopes of the southern portion of the city contained summer homes,
recreational properties and a few large estates. The beauty and tranquility of the
area attracted artists and writers, including John Steinbeck, looking for a peaceful
and inspirational place to pursue their craft.
Unlike many other cities in Santa Clara County, Monte Sereno did not form on a
crossroads or from an historical village. Consequently, a commercial core never
developed in the city, leaving Monte Sereno strictly residential. Monte Sereno was
incorporated in 1957 as a response to the ever-increasing pressure of annexation
from surrounding cities. Residents of the community joined together and decided
that incorporation rather than annexation was the best way to ensure the continued
way-of-life for the community. The desire of residents to maintain Monte Sereno
as a low-density residential community continues to this day.
C. The City and its Planning Area
The City of Monte Sereno is located in western San Clara County in the San Fran-
cisco Bay Area of Northern California. Monte Sereno is the smallest incorporated
community in Santa Clara County, containing approximately 1.6 square miles of
land. Monte Sereno is located adjacent to the towns of Los Gatos and Saratoga
and near the City of Campbell. The regional location of Monte Sereno is shown in
Figure I-1.
This General Plan applies to land within Monte Sereno city boundaries as well as to
areas within Monte Sereno’s Sphere of Influence. The Sphere of Influence (SOI) is
the area that, according to the Santa Clara County Local Agency Formation Com-
mission, can efficiently utilize public services provided by Monte Sereno. The SOI
also identifies areas outside of the city boundary that may be annexed into the City
in the future. Regulations and policies in this General Plan that apply to areas out-
side of city boundaries but within the SOI go into effect at the time that these areas
are annexed into the City. Prior to annexation, these areas are subject to the poli-
cies and regulations of Santa Clara County. Monte Sereno’s city boundaries and
SOI are identified in Figure I-2.

D. General Plan Contents
Beyond this introduction, the General Plan includes seven separate chapters or
“elements” that set goals, policies and actions for each given subject. Some ele-
ments are required by State law, others are included in this General Plan as optional
elements. A brief summary of topics included in the Monte Sereno General Plan
Update is provided here.
1.    Introduction. The introduction describes the history and location of Monte
      Sereno and provides an overview of the purpose and contents of the General
      Plan.
2.    Guiding Principles. This section identifies key community values that serve
      as a foundation to the General Plan.
3.    Land Use Element. The required Land Use Element identifies land uses and
      intensities of development that are permitted in Monte Sereno. A Land Use
      Map identifying the location of these permitted uses is included in this ele-
      ment. The Land Use Element also includes goals and policies relating to the
      character of the built environment in Monte Sereno.
4.    Housing Element. The Housing Element is unique among General Plan
      elements in that it must be reviewed by the State and is updated every five
      years. This Housing Element, which applies to a 2009-20141 planning period,
      includes policies relating to promoting housing opportunities for all income
      groups and preserving existing affordable housing in the city.
5.    Circulation Element. This required element specifies the general location
      and extent of existing streets, transit facilities and the bicycle and pedestrian
      network. As required by law, all facilities in the Circulation Element are corre-
      lated with the land uses foreseen in the Land Use Element.

6.    Open Space and Conservation Element. The Open Space Element and the
      Conservation Element are required under State law and are combined in this
      General Plan. Issues addressed in this element include the conservation, de-
      velopment and utilization of natural resources; the preservation of open space;
      and the provision of parks and recreational facilities.
7.    Public Services and Facilities. This optional element contains goals and
      policies to guide the provision of public services to maintain the quality of life
      in Monte Sereno.
8.    Health and Safety Element. The Health and Safety Element is required by
      State law and contains policies to protect the community from risks associated
      with the effects of fires, flooding, earthquakes and other natural and man-
      made hazards.
One of the guiding principles in this General Plan is environmental sustainability
and stewardship of the natural environment. This principle informs goals and poli-
cies found in all of the General Plan elements. Related to this principle is the issue
of climate change resulting from the emission of greenhouse gases. Goals and pol-
icies that specifically address greenhouse gas emissions are located in the Health
and Safety Element of this General Plan.
E. Organization of the General Plan Elements
Each element of this General Plan contains background information and goals,
policies and actions. The background information section of each element de-
scribes current conditions in Monte Sereno relative to the subject of the element.
The goals, polices and actions provide guidance on how to maintain and enhance
the city over the next 15 years. The goals, policies and actions in each element are
derived from a number of sources including other City Planning documents and
public input gathered at community workshops. Each is described as follows:
    A goal is a description of the general desired result that the city seeks to create
      through the implementation of its General Plan.
    A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making in working to
      achieve a goal. Policies represent statements of regulation and require no fur-
      ther implementation. The General Plan’s policies set the standards that will be
      used by City staff and the City Council in their review of land development
      projects and in decision-making about County actions in Monte Sereno.

   An action is a program, implementation measure, procedure or technique in-
     tended to help achieve a specified goal.
Figure 1-3 shows the relationship between each of the components described
above. As shown in the figure, policies and actions are at the same level; both poli-
cies and actions are intended to implement goals. In most cases, goals have both
implementing policies and actions. However, it is also possible for a goal to be
implemented exclusively through either policies or actions.

F. General Plan Update Process
The Monte Sereno General Plan Update was prepared by the City Council, City
staff and a consultant team, with extensive public input. The process featured
three tiers of public input: (1) public workshops, (2) City Council study sessions
and (3) a public review period.
1. Public Workshops
The City hosted three public workshops for the General Plan Update. These work-
shops, described below, enabled residents to learn about the General Plan and pro-
vide input through a variety of interactive exercises and meeting formats.
    Workshop #1 – October 15, 2007. At this workshop City staff and its con-
      sultants presented an overview of the General Plan Update process and facili-
      tated a discussion of general policy questions. Workshop participants separat-
      ed into four small groups to discuss questions relating to land use, annexation,
      housing, transportation, natural resources, public facilities and services and
      safety. Input received at this workshop was used to identify key policy issues
      for the General Plan Update.
    Workshop #2 – November 29, 2007. This workshop began with a presenta-
      tion that summarized the outcome of the first public workshop. Workshop
      participants then divided into three small groups to discuss specific land use
      and policy alternatives for the General Plan Update. The small groups dis-
      cussed 17 questions presented in an Alternatives Workbook.
    Public Informational Meeting – October 21, 2008. At this informational
      meeting the Draft General Plan was presented to the City Council and the
      public for the kickoff of the public review and comment period.
2. City Council Study Sessions
The City Council held two study sessions to discuss the General Plan prior to the
preparation of a draft document. On February 8, 2008 the City Council held the
fist study session to provide input on key policy questions that emerged from the
first two workshops. At the second study session on May 20, 2008, the City Coun-
cil reviewed four land use alternative maps and selected a preferred land use alter-
native for the Land Use Element.
3. Public Review Period
As required by State law, the General Plan will be circulated for a 30-day period
along with the associated environmental review. This review period will begin in

September of 2008 with the presentation of the Draft General Plan at Public In-
formational Meeting. During the review period residents and other community
stakeholders may submit written comments on the Draft General Plan. These writ-
ten comments along with additional verbal comments will be considered by the
City Council at public hearings on the Draft General Plan in the summer and fall of
2008. After making any necessary revisions to the Plan, it is anticipated that the
City Council will adopt the Final General Plan in the fall of 2008.
                                                                                      9

2 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
  The Guiding Principles chapter establishes the key community values that act as a
  foundation to this General Plan. These principles represent the primary goals to
  which Monte Sereno aspires. These principles are general in nature and relate to all
  goals, policies and actions contained in the individual elements of this Plan. The
  principles articulate a shared vision for the future of Monte Sereno to guide City
  decision-making throughout the life of this Plan.
  The following Guiding Principles serve as the foundation to this General Plan:
  1.   Community Character. Ensure that all new development preserves and en-
       hances the unique residential character of Monte Sereno.
  2.   Environmental Sustainability. Support a way-of-life in Monte Sereno that
       protects natural resources and minimizes residents’ impacts to the environ-
       ment.
  3.   Enhanced Mobility. Ensure that residents can safely travel to their destina-
       tions by automobile, public transit, bicycle or walking.
  4.   Quality Public Services. Provide high-quality services to residents in an effi-
       cient and cost-effective manner.
  5.   Community Safety. Ensure that Monte Sereno residents are prepared for
       and protected from natural and man-made hazards.
                                                                                  11

3 LAND USE ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Land Use Element is to plan for and shape the future physical
  development of Monte Sereno. This element seeks to preserve and enhance the
  residential character of Monte Sereno which is highly valued by residents. The
  Land Use Element is the central chapter of the General Plan.
  As required by State law, this Land Use Element contains text and maps that desig-
  nate the future use and reuse of land within city limits. The Land Use Element also
  includes standards of density and building intensity for the city, which are also re-
  quired by law.
  The Land Use Element sets forth specific goals, policies and actions to guide land
  uses for Monte Sereno. The General Plan Land Use Map, contained in this Ele-
  ment, graphically represents the City’s vision for the future enhancement and con-
  servation of Monte Sereno.
  A. Background Land Use Information
  This section provides details on the existing land uses in Monte Sereno to docu-
  ment the development pattern in Monte Sereno in 2008 and to provide background
  information for the Land Use Element. This section describes the development
  and land use pattern present at the time the General Plan was adopted.
  1. Existing Land Uses
  Monte Sereno is a community of low-density residential neighborhoods. Within
  these neighborhoods, the density of development ranges from one dwelling unit
  per acre to five dwelling units per acre. Residential neighborhoods feature de-
  tached single-family homes with some homes having either detached or attached
  second dwelling units.1 A description of the eight residential neighborhoods in
  Monte Sereno is provided in Section B below.
  Monte Sereno does not feature any commercial or industrial land uses. Non-
  residential uses in Monte Sereno are limited to a few public facilities and privately-
  owned open space. In 2008 non-residential land uses in Monte Sereno included:
     Daves Elementary at 17770 Daves Avenue.
     The Community Center with City offices and the U.S. Post Office at 18041
        Saratoga-Los Gatos Road.
     The First Baptist Church of Los Gatos at 17765 Daves Avenue.
             1 On August 6, 2013 the City Council created an additional Land Use designation
  to allow for multifamily zoning at a density of 3 dwelling units per acre.
                                                                                         13

C I T Y O F M O N T E S E R E N O
G E N E R A L P L A N
L A N D U S E E L E M E N T
   Privately-owned open space including Loma Serena and Tract 5970 subdivi-
      sion.
2. Development Potential
Monte Sereno is a largely built-out community with a limited supply of vacant land.
Additionally, many of the remaining vacant sites within the city boundary are locat-
ed on unstable, steep slopes and are not ideal for development. This General Plan
therefore anticipates limited additional development in Monte Sereno over the next
15 years. New development in Monte Sereno during this period is expected to
consist of redevelopment of single-family homes, new secondary dwelling units and
multi-family housing. As discussed further in the Housing Element, the Associa-
tion of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects that new development will ac-
commodate approximately 150 additional households in Monte Sereno by 2035.
No additional non-residential development is anticipated during this planning peri-
od.
3. Potential Annexation Areas
Monte Sereno’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) contains areas that the city may annex
during the planning period of this General Plan. The Santa Clara Local Area For-
mation Commission (LAFCo) has identified the following three areas (or “pock-
ets”) in the SOI as land most appropriate for annexation into Monte Sereno:
   Pocket #1, Karl Avenue, 9 acres
   Pocket #2, Highway 9, 125 acres
   Pocket #3, Upper Hillside, 68 acres
The location of these three annexation pockets is identified in Figure LU-1. An-
nexation of these pockets or any other areas within the City’s SOI requires approv-
al of both the Monte Sereno City Council and the Santa Clara LAFCo.
Within Annexation Pocket #2 is the La Hacienda Inn, located on Saratoga-Los
Gatos Road at Austin Way. The La Hacienda Inn, containing 20 guest rooms, a

C. Monte Sereno Neighborhoods
Monte Sereno is divided into eight neighborhoods, distinguished by their location
and unique characteristics, such as ambience, physical description, type of roadways
and vegetation. The neighborhoods are used as a basis for planning analysis and
policy formulation. The location of the planning areas are identified in Figure LU-
3.
The eight planning areas are described below. Each description is intended to
characterize the area, not establish land use policies. Goals and policies in Section
D below express the land use policies that affect the planning area.
    Bicknell. Bicknell, located in the northwest portion of the city west of Elm
     Park, has large, ranch style homes that have been built on expansive and flat
     converted farm land. The neighborhood is surrounded by open space, and the
     roadways are generally described as quaint and scenic. The focal point of
     Bicknell is the dairy farm.
    Daves. Daves, a neighborhood east of Palos Verdes Drive and Oak Knoll
     Drive, south of Vineland Avenue, and north of Bruce Avenue, is characterized
     by uniform, small lots with older homes with natural, unimproved landscaping
     and sections of newer homes with extensive landscaping. Daves Avenue
     School is located in this neighborhood, and the First Baptist Church of Los
     Gatos is the focal point of the neighborhood. Daves Avenue and Vineland
     Avenue are major collector streets, while additional traffic is generated by the
     church and school in the neighborhood.
    Foothill. Foothill is located in the southwest corner of the city, north of the
     Highway 9 Scenic Route. On a moderate slope, Foothill has a diverse housing
     stock varying from small to large-sized homes that are widespread and sit on
     irregularly-shaped lots of varying sizes. Many of the streets in Foothill are
     dead-end, private streets with some steep hillside roads. The San Tomas
     Aquinas Creek runs through the neighborhood.
                                                                                   19

 Hillside. Hillside is the neighborhood located west of Highway 9 in Monte
  Sereno. It is characterized by moderate to steeply sloping land and heavily,
  naturally landscaped and wooded evergreen areas. Homes are a mixture of
  smaller, older homes and larger, new homes with large setbacks. Lots are pri-
  marily large and irregularly-shaped because of boundaries resulting from natu-
  ral contours in the area. Roadways are narrow and winding with limited sight
  distance.
 La Rinconada. Rinconada, located north of Vineland Avenue, south of Golf
  Course Drive, east of Robin Ann Lane, and west of Winchester Boulevard, is a
  neighborhood of semi-rural character with mature oak and pine trees sur-
  rounded by large, open spaces. Rinconada has a diverse housing stock of vari-
  ous styles and sizes. Natural valley areas generally act as physical barriers with-
  in the neighborhood. There is limited through access in this neighborhood.
 Loma Serena. Loma Serena, located south of Bicknell Road, north of Daves
  Avenue, West of Robin Anne Lane and includes the streets of Via Palomino,
  Via Pinto, Via Encantada, Via Caballero, Via Vaquero and Equestrian Way.
  The neighborhood primarily surrounds a private open space well maintained
  by the Loma Serena Homeowners Association. Homes are of similar shape,
  larger size and style dating back to 1964. Most lots have views and vistas and
  an equestrian trail runs through the open space area.
 Rose/Andrews. Rose/Andrews is located north of the Highway 9 Scenic Route
  and west of Winchester Boulevard on flat lands. The Government Center is
  located here. Homes are a wide variety of styles. Properties commonly feature
  fences and distinct landscaping. Lots are small and inconsistently shaped. The
  character of the neighborhood is consistent with neighboring Los Gatos prop-
  erties. Roadways in Rose/Andrews are typically small, private dead-end
  streets. However, some roads may be used as a transportation link between
  Highway 9 and Winchester Boulevard.
 Twin Creeks. The Twin Creeks neighborhood incorporates Grandview Avenue
  and Viewfield Avenue, to the south of the Bicknell neighborhood and the
  north of the Foothill neighborhood. It is characterized by semi-rural neigh-
  borhoods, manicured landscapes, and large, grand homes on large lots. Eques-
  trian trails run through Twin Creeks set within abundant open space. This
  neighborhood embodies the typical style and character of Monte Sereno’s im-
  age.

  SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
A. Purpose of the Housing Element
  This 2015-2023 Housing Element represents the City of Monte Sereno’s intent to plan for the housing needs of the Monte
  Sereno community while meeting the State’s housing goals as set forth in Article 10.6 of the California Government Code.
  The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every
  Californian as the State’s major housing goal.
  The Monte Sereno Housing Element represents a sincere and creative effort to meet local and regional housing needs within
  the constraints of a fully established built-out community, limited land availability and extraordinarily high costs of land and
  housing.
  Pursuant to State law, the Housing Element must be updated periodically according to statutory deadlines. This Housing
  Element covers the planning period of January 31, 2015 through January 31, 2023.
  The Element must include the following components:
           Analysis of the City’s population, household, and employment base, and housing stock characteristics.
           Summary of the present and projected housing needs of the City’s households.
           Review of potential constraints to meeting the City’s identified housing needs.
           Review and evaluation of the City’s previous Housing Element (2009-2014).
           Evaluation of opportunities that will further the development of new housing.
           Description of the Housing Plan to address the identified housing needs.
  The 2015-2023 Housing Element replaces the City’s 2009-2014 Housing Element. The 2009-2014 Housing Element was
  adopted by the City in 2010 and was later in that same year found to be in compliance with State Housing Element Law by the
  California Department of Housing and Community Development.
B. Relationship to the General Plan
  The City of Monte Sereno General Plan was adopted in 2009 and is comprised of the following elements: 1) Land Use; 2)
  Housing Element; 3) Circulation; 4) Open Space and Conservation; 5) Public Services and Facilities; and 6) Health and Safety.
  The City’s Housing Element is being updated at this time in conformance with the 2014-2022 update cycle for jurisdictions in
  the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) region. The Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan
  elements and contains policies to ensure that it is consistent with other elements of the General Plan. As portions of the
  General Plan are amended in the future, the Plan (including the Housing Element) will be reviewed to ensure that internal
  consistency is maintained.
                                                                                                                            26

  SECTION 2. COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
A. Community Meeting
  A community meeting was held in the City’s Council Chambers on May 20, 2014. Public notice of this meeting was sent on
  May 5, 2014 to members of the City’s Site and Architecture Commission, City Council members, affordable housing
  organizations and legal advocacy groups, County of Santa Clara Planning Department and Housing Authority as well as
  everyone listed in the City’s email notification group, in a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic
  segments of the community. A list of the advocacy groups invited to the meetings is attached as Appendix E. An article on
  the proposed meeting was also included in the May 16, 2014 edition of the “Town News” (Los Gatos/Saratoga/Monte
  Sereno edition). The meeting date and location, a description of the Housing Element Update process, a list of “Frequently
  Asked Questions” and other relevant information was also posted on the City’s web site prior to the meeting.
B. Information Distribution
  The City distributed information and updates on the City’s website throughout the development of this Housing Element
  Update.
C. Review of Draft and Final Housing Element
  The 2015-2023 draft Housing Element was released for public review on September 5, 2014. An electronic copy of the draft
  document was published on the City’s website and a hard copy was available at City Hall for public review. The draft Housing
  Element was reviewed by the City Council at their October 7, 2014 meeting. Public notice of the October 7, 2014 meeting
  was posted on the City’s website on September 5, 2014 and notice was provided to individuals on the City’s email list as well
  as appropriate organizations/agencies. Please see Appendix E for a list of organizations/agencies that received public notice.
  In addition, public notice of the meeting was printed in the “Town News” (Los Gatos/Saratoga/Monte Sereno edition). At
  their October 7, 2014 meeting, the City Council took public comments on the draft Element and unanimously voted to
  submit the draft Element to the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). On October 10, 2014, the
  City submitted the draft Housing Element to HCD and requested a streamlined review of the document.
  On December 12, 2014, HCD sent a letter to the City, which contained comments on the draft Housing Element. In
  addition, HCD forwarded one letter dated December 11, 2014 from Wendel, Rosen, Black and Dean LLP on behalf of
  Hacienda Realty. Other than the December 11, 2014 letter, the City received no other comments on the draft Housing
  Element.
  The draft Housing Element was revised to respond to the comments and the Final Housing Element document was released
  for public review on February 9, 2015 and a Public Hearing was scheduled for February 17, 2015. On February 9, 2015, the
  document was available at City Hall and on the City’s web site. Notice of the document availability and the February 17, 2015
  Public Hearing was sent to the list of organizations contained in Appendix E of this document as well as anyone who had
  submitted comments either written or orally on the document. Further, notice of the document availability and Public
  Hearing was also sent to everyone on the City’s email notification list. The date and location of the February 17, 2015
  meeting was also published in the February 6 and 13, 2015 edition of the “Town News” (Los Gatos/Saratoga/Monte Sereno
  edition).
  The 2015-2023 final Housing Element was sent to HCD on February 23, 2015 and, following HCD’s review, the 2015-2023
  Housing Element was adopted by the City Council on May 19, 2015.
  Please see Appendix G of this document for a more detailed description of the public participation process.

          Age Composition
  Table HE-2 shows the 1990, 2000 and 2010 age distributions for the population in Monte Sereno. As shown in this table, the
  number of people age 65 or older increased by 28 percent from 2000 (505 people) to 2010 (647 people). This change is
  consistent with the region-wide trend of an aging population. The percentage of seniors living in Monte Sereno, however, is
  greater than the percentage of seniors living elsewhere in Santa Clara County. In 2010, 19% percent of the population in
  Monte Sereno was 60 or over, while in Santa Clara County, 16 percent of the population was 60 or over.
  The number of seniors in Monte Sereno is expected to increase in the future due to the aging of the baby boom generation.
  Detailed future age distribution projections for Monte Sereno are not available. However, as Table HE-2 below demonstrates,
  the percentage of people 65+ years has steadily increased in Monte Sereno from 1990-2010 and this trend is expected to
  continue.

          Employment
  Monte Sereno has a very small employment base that is made up of City employees, school district personnel and people
  involved in miscellaneous home occupations. The City does not have commercial, industrial or institutional centers; the
  majority of Monte Sereno residents who are in the workforce commute elsewhere to their jobs. According to ABAG, the
  number of employed adults 16 years of age and older in the City has remained relatively static since 2000. ABAG’s 2014
  Housing Element Data indicate that there were 1,501 employed adults in the City in 2000 and that number increased only
  slightly to 1,523 adults in the 2007-2011 period. The primary industries in which these residents were employed included
  manufacturing, professional services and education.
  ABAG’s ‘Projections 2013’ found only 450 total jobs in the City in 2010, projected to increase to 580 in 2040. Since Monte
  Sereno has more than three employed residents for each job in the City, it serves as a bedroom community for nearby job-rich
  communities such as Los Gatos.
B. Household Characteristics
          Household Size and Growth
  Monte Sereno households are slightly smaller than the average Santa Clara County household. In 2000, Monte Sereno’s
  average household size was 2.88 persons per household as compared to the county average of 2.92 persons per household.
  Average household size in 2007-2011 was 2.85 persons per household in Monte Sereno and 2.89 persons per household in
  Santa Clara County.
  The number of households in the City has remained at approximately 1200 households from 2000-2010. ABAG has
  predicted that the City will have a 3.2% growth rate in the decade between 2010-2020, resulting in a net increase of
  approximately 38 households.
          Housing Tenure
  Monte Sereno has a very high rate of home ownership. In 2010, approximately 90 percent of housing units in Monte Sereno
  were owner occupied. This figure decreased slightly from 1990, when approximately 92 percent of housing units were owner-
  occupied. In Santa Clara County, approximately 58 percent of housing units were owner-occupied in 2010.
                                                                                                                        29

                                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT 2015-2023
          Household Income Levels
  Monte Sereno is a relatively affluent community. The median household income in Monte Sereno was $181,719 in 2011. In
  Santa Clara County, the median household income was $89,064. From 2000 to 2011, household income decreased in both
  Monte Sereno and Santa Clara County. In 2000, the median household income was $208,262 (in 2011 dollars) in Monte
  Sereno and $100,352 in Santa Clara County. This decrease can probably be attributed to the recessionary period, which began
  in 2008.
  For planning purposes, the State Department of Housing and Community Development categorizes Monte Sereno
  households into five income groups based on the Santa Clara County Median Family Income (MFI). In 2014 the MFI in
  Santa Clara County was $105,500. Income levels for four-person households are defined as follows:
     Extremely Low Income: Households with incomes less than 30% of MFI (under $31,650)
     Very Low Income: Households with incomes between 31 percent and 50 percent of MFI ($31,651 to $53,050)
     Low Income: Households with incomes between 51 percent and 80 percent of MFI ($53,051 to $84,900)
     Moderate Income: Households with incomes between 81 percent and 120 percent of MFI ($84,901 to $126,600)
     Above Moderate Income: Households with incomes greater than 120 percent of MFI (over $126,001)
  In 2007-2011, approximately 16% of all City households or 190 households total were lower income households (extremely
  low, very low and low income). This is a slight increase from 2000 when 13% of the City’s households were lower income.
  This 3% increase could indicate that additional housing units in the City are providing housing for lower income households.
  Moderate income households accounted for 13.5% of all households in 2007-2011 and the remaining 70.5% of households in
  the City are considered above moderate income households.
                                  Extremely Low Income               60 households
                                        Very Low Income              60 households
                                             Low Income              70 households
                                        Moderate Income              165 households
                                 Above Moderate Income               865 households
                          TOTAL CITY HOUSEHOLDS                      1220 households
          Race and Ethnicity
  In 2010, 77 percent of the population in Monte Sereno was White, 14 percent was Asian, 5% was Hispanic and the remaining
  percent was other. In Santa Clara County, roughly equal percentages of the population were white and Asian (35 and 32
  percent, respectively) and 27 percent was Hispanic.
C. Housing Stock Characteristics
          Vacancy Rates
  The vacancy rate in Monte Sereno in 2010 was 1.6% (21 units) for units available for rent or sale. An additional 55 units were
  vacant but were either seasonal units or vacant for other reasons.
          Housing Types
   In 2014, there were 1,293 dwelling units in Monte Sereno. Approximately 97 percent of housing units in Monte Sereno are
  single-family detached homes and 2% are single-family attached units.
  These single-family homes are supplemented by a growing supply of secondary dwelling units or “Second Units.” The City
  estimates that there are 87 Second Units in Monte Sereno in 2014. As discussed further in Section 6 of this Element, Second
  Units are the primary form of affordable housing in Monte Sereno.

           Age and Condition of Housing Stock
  Monte Sereno’s housing stock includes a wide variety of units built throughout the past century. Listed below are the
  percentages of units built by age:
                                          Built in 1940s or earlier     19%
                                          Built in 1950s                18%
                                          Built in 1960s                21%
                                          Built in 1970s                25%
                                          Built in 1980s                3%
                                          Built in 1990s                6%
                                          Built in 2000 or recently     8%
  In 2014, ABAG data indicates that there are no units lacking complete plumbing or kitchen facilities in Monte Sereno. In
  2014, based on observations by the City’s inspectors responsible for code enforcement, while some units need deferred
  maintenance repairs, there are no or few units in need of substantial rehabilitation. Most code enforcement complaints to the
  City involve relatively minor repairs.
  In addition to age of unit, overcrowding is another factor that can affect housing condition. Overcrowding is defined as
  households that have more than 1 person per room. In Monte Sereno, there were no overcrowded owner units and 10
  overcrowded renter units. None of the 10 renter units were identified as severely overcrowded (more than 1.5 person per
  room).
D. Housing Costs
           Units for Sale
  Home prices in Monte Sereno are among the most expensive in the Bay Area. The Santa Clara County Association of Realtors
  reports that, as of December 2013, the average sales price of a home in Monte Sereno was $2,220.216 and the median sales
  price was $1,980,000.
           Rental Units
  It is difficult to determine an estimate of the average rental costs in Monte Sereno due to the limited number of housing units,
  especially rental units. Table HE-3 below includes average rental costs for three communities in proximity to Monte Sereno.
  Of the three communities, Saratoga and Los Gatos are more similar to Monte Sereno in terms of type of housing stock and
  size of units. It is estimated that rental costs in Monte Sereno are similar to those in Saratoga and Los Gatos.

E. Housing Affordability
  Housing costs are very high in Monte Sereno. As stated above, the median sales price was $1,980,000 at the end of 2013 – a
  price affordable only to a certain percentage of above moderate income households. Rental costs are also estimated to be high.
  Assuming that Monte Sereno’s rents are similar to Saratoga, a one bedroom rent is $2104 and a two bedroom unit rents for
  $3550. The chart below illustrates how “unaffordable” those rents are to typical lower income households.

                 “Affordable” amount calculated using City affordability formula as specified in Second Unit Program guidelines. (See Section B in
                 Appendix)
          Overpayment
  Households spending more than 30 percent of household income on housing costs are generally considered to be overpaying
  for housing. Households who spend more than 50% of their income for housing are considered to be “severely” overpaying.
  In Monte Sereno, it is estimated that 319 households are paying between 30-50% of their income for housing costs. Of those
  319 households, 289 are owner occupants and the majority of those owners (264) have incomes that are considered above
  moderate income. Of the 30 renter households who are overpaying, there are no lower income households and all 20 renter
  households have incomes of above moderate income.
  In the category of “severely” overpaying (paying more than 50% of income for housing costs), there are a total of 325
  households, of which 290 are owner occupants. These 290 households are divided among extremely low (30 households), very
  low (40 households), low income (60 households), moderate (90 households) and above moderate (70 households). The
  remaining 35 renter households with severe overpayment conditions include 10 extremely low income households, 10 very
  low income households and 15 moderate income households. The 644 total households overpaying for housing represent
  approximately 53% of all Monte Sereno households. This is not considered unusual given the fact that Monte Sereno’s
  housing costs are among the highest in the Bay Area and California.
          At-Risk Units
  The Housing Element is required to identify and develop a program for the preservation of affordable multifamily units
  assisted under various federal, State and local programs. The City is required to provide an inventory of assisted, affordable
  units that are eligible to convert to a market rate within ten years. In 2014 there are no assisted units within Monte Sereno’s
  boundaries that are subject to conversion to market rate within 10 years.
F. Special Needs Housing
  To provide adequate housing for all people, a community must consider the housing needs of those with specific limitations
  or challenges. Special need populations include seniors, persons with disabilities, female headed households, large households,
  farm workers and persons in need of emergency shelter.
          Seniors
  Seniors face many housing challenges as they age, including the likelihood of a fixed budget, higher medical costs and greater
  likelihood of disabilities. In addition, seniors’ income tends to decline as they age. Young seniors often have some retirement
  savings or employment income that can supplement Social Security. Older seniors are more likely to use up their savings and
  therefore are more likely to have more limited incomes.
                                                                                                                                          32

                                                                                                                    GENERAL PLAN
                                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT 2015-2023
In 2010 approximately 19% of the City’s population was 60-74 years and another 9% of the population was 75 + years. This is
an increase from 2000 data when 15% of the population was 60-74 years and an additional 5% was 75+ years. In total, 28% of
the population (975 persons) were 60 years or older in 2010. It is expected that the overall number of elderly residents will
continue to grow as members of the baby boomer generation age.
The 2009-2013 American Community Survey reported that 40% of the households in Monte Sereno had one or more people
65 years and older. Of those households, 25% were 1-person households. There were no senior households in Monte Sereno
with incomes below the poverty level. Following are the percentage distribution of incomes for senior households over the
age of 65 years in Monte Sereno
                                      Household Income               % of all Senior Households

                                        $75,000 – 99,999                          10%
                                        $100,000 or more                          45%
The overwhelming majority of seniors in Monte Sereno own their homes. In the age group of 65-74 years, 96% of senior
households own their homes. In the age group of 75-84 years, 98% of households are owners. And, in the age group of 85+
years, 89% of the senior households own their homes.
In regards to housing needs, seniors need housing that is accessible and affordable. Existing senior households living in
Monte Sereno will probably require accessibility modifications to their homes in order to continue to “age in place”
comfortably. They may also require caregivers, a situation where a Second Dwelling Unit could be very helpful in providing
affordable living quarters for the caregiver as well as 24 hour assistance for the senior. Other in-home care opportunities are
available in the area for seniors who wish to remain at home. The Home Instead Senior Care office in Campbell and the
Visiting Angels Senior Homecare office in San Jose are local options that connect seniors with caregivers.
The charitable foundation Health Trust provides services to Santa Clara County residents. The local Meals on Wheels
program is one of the programs operated under Health Trust that serves Santa Clara County residents who are physically
limited and homebound, including seniors and persons with disabilities. Health Trust programs offer access to high quality,
affordable health services for seniors through their Healthy Aging Initiative.
        Persons with Disabilities
The Census Bureau defines disability as, “A long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it
difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This
condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business.”
People with disabilities face many challenges when looking for housing. There is a limited supply of handicap accessible,
affordable housing generally. Additionally, because some people with disabilities, particularly developmental disabilities, live
with their parents they often do not have rental or credit history. This makes it harder to compete for the limited housing that
is available. Second Units are often a valuable resource for families with members who are disabled and need care but want to
live independently.
In 2000, there were 354 people five years old or older living in Monte Sereno with a disability. Of these, 68 percent were
active members of the workforce and approximately 19 percent were senior citizens. The 2014 ABAG Housing Element data
does not include disability estimates for communities under 5,000 in population. However, the U.S. Census American
Community Survey estimates that there were 232 individuals in Monte Sereno with a disability in the 2008-2012 survey period.
Of these 232 individuals or 79% of the total were 65 years and over.

        People with Developmental Disabilities
SB 812 signed into law in 2010, requires Housing Elements to include an analysis of the special housing needs of people with
developmental disabilities. Additionally, SB 812 requires that individuals with disabilities receive public services in the least
restrictive, most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.
California defines developmentally disabled as a “severe and chronic disability that is attributable to a mental or physical
impairment. The disability must begin before the person’s 18 th birthday, be expected to continue indefinitely, and present a
substantial disability.” Some development disabilities cause mental retardation and some do not. Common developmental
disabilities include Down’s syndrome, autism, epilepsy and cerebral palsy.
The San Andreas Regional Center (SARC) is a community based non-profit which serves the needs of the developmentally
disabled in Santa Clara County. The center reports that there were 10,019 developmentally disabled individuals in the County
in 2013. Of this total, 8,357 live at home and 1,590 live in care-giving facilities. SARC provides additional data on the type of
developmental disability as follows: 49% due to mental retardation, 10% due to autism, 11% due to cerebral palsy, 16% due to
epilepsy and 14% due to other causes. SARC reports that, in 2014, there were 66 developmentally disabled clients in Monte
Sereno.
In addition to the San Andreas Regional Center, the Silicon Valley Independent Living Center (SVILC) serves Santa Clara
County residents who have disabilities. The nonprofit organization provides services related to information, referrals, peer
support, independent living skills training, housing and assistive technology.
Many physically and developmentally disabled individuals are able to lead productive lives outside of institutional settings. The
lack of suitable supportive housing at an affordable cost is a persistent barrier to their quest for independence. In 2011, the
City revised the Municipal Code to include provisions for “Reasonable Accommodations” for persons with a disability.
Further, in 2012 the City also included provisions for transitional and supportive housing in residential districts. In addition,
as noted above, the City’s Second Unit program can be an important resource for families with members who have a disability
and want access to their families but in an independent housing unit.
        Female-Headed Household
Female-headed households may require special needs resulting from a combination of income and housing stock limitations.
At the time of the 2000 Census, there were 49 female-headed households in Monte Sereno (4 percent of total households). Of
these, 22 households included children under the age of 18. Six of these families were renters, and none were reported as
living in poverty. In 2010, there were 59 female-headed households or 5.9% of all households. Of those female-headed
families, 25 households had children less than 18 years. As in 2000, none of the female-headed families in 2010 were below
the poverty level.
                                                                                                                             34

        Large Households and Overcrowding
Large households are typically defined as those having 5 or more persons. Large households are considered a special needs
group because they require homes with more bedrooms and, typically, these larger homes are more expensive. In 2010, there
were 123 large households in Monte Sereno, approximately 10% of all households. Of these 123 households, 110 were owner
occupants and the remainder was renters.

Overcrowding is not a significant problem for most households due to the substantial supply of large housing units in Monte
Sereno. Approximately 57% of Monte Sereno’s housing stock is 4 or more bedrooms. Another 33% of the housing stock has
3 bedrooms. An “Overcrowded” unit is one occupied by 1.01 persons or more per room and a “Severely Overcrowded” Unit
is one occupied by more than 1.5 persons per room. The ABAG Housing Element Data indicates that there are no
overcrowded owner units in Monte Sereno and 10 overcrowded renter units. There are no severely overcrowded owner or
renter units.
        Farm workers
There are no identified farm workers residing in Monte Sereno and no commercial agricultural operations. However, in Santa
Clara County there are 4,425 persons who work in agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining. They primarily reside in San Jose,
Gilroy, and the unincorporated County. Farmworkers typically have relatively low incomes and generally face higher rates of
overcrowding and other substandard housing conditions. To the extent that agricultural workers may desire to live in Monte
Sereno, their need for affordable housing would be similar to that of other lower income persons, and affordable housing in
the City would serve farmworkers as well as others employed in low-wage jobs. Provisions required by State law regarding
employee housing may also assist farmworkers.
        Persons in Need of Emergency Shelter
The 2013 Santa Clara County biennial count of homeless persons did not find any homeless persons in Monte Sereno.
However, Monte Sereno is part of the larger Santa Clara County community where homelessness is present. The 2013 count
found 7,631 homeless persons in the County, 5,674 of whom 74% were unsheltered. Key causes of homelessness include
alcohol or drug use and economic factors such as job loss, unemployment and the inability to pay the rent or mortgage.
There is no data presently available documenting the increased level of demand for shelter in Santa Clara County during
particular times of the year. Due to the relatively mild climate, the only time of year when increased demand appears to be a
factor is during the winter months (November to March). The biennial homeless count always takes place in the last week of
January, a period when demand for shelter typically is at its highest. Since the year-round need described above is based on
that annual count, the need for emergency shelter either year-round or seasonally is not likely to be greater than that found
during the biennial homeless count.
Santa Clara County has approximately 23 emergency shelters, providing close to 800 beds year-round, with an additional 300
beds available during the winter months (November through March). There are also over 1,100 transitional housing beds
throughout the County that offer a combination of stable housing and intensive, targeted support services for the mentally ill,
those with chronic substance abuse, developmental disabilities, and other factors that prevent the homeless from returning to
permanent housing situations. Transitional housing includes both single site and "scattered site" programs. Table HE-6
provides a summary of emergency shelters and transitional housing near the City of Monte Sereno.

        Extremely Low Income Households (ELI)
Extremely Low Income Households are defined as households earning 30 percent or less of the Area Median Family Income.
In Santa Clara County, this amounts to an annual income of less than $31,600 for a family of four persons in 2014. Many ELI
households live in rental housing and most likely encounter overpayment for housing, overcrowding or substandard housing
conditions. Housing types available and suitable for ELI households include affordable rentals, Second Units, supportive and
transitional housing.
There are 60 ELI households in Monte Sereno according to 2010 CHAS data. Of those 60 households, 45 are owners and 15
are renters. ABAG projects that Monte Sereno’s households will grow by 6.5% between 2010 and 2030. Assuming the same
percentage increase to the ELI households, it is estimated that there will be a total of 64 ELI households in 2030.

  SECTION 4: REVIEW OF THE 2009-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
A. Overview
  The City of Monte Sereno is unique compared to other cities in California. Since its inception, the City has grown utilizing
  primarily one zoning classification, single-family residential (in addition to public and open space categories). Until only
  recently when a new multi-family residential zoning classification was established, the City has developed through the
  construction of single-family homes. The review of the 2009-2014 Housing Element below was completed within the
  backdrop of an already established and built out, small community seeking to refine existing regulations and programs so that
  housing goals can be better achieved. The purpose of the review is to evaluate past programs and actions and determine
  whether they should be retained, modified or other programs/policies added for the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
B. Significant Actions Accomplished in 2009-2014
  During the time period of 2009-2014, the City of Monte Sereno has revised their Municipal Code to include the following
  housing related changes:
  Reasonable Accommodations (March 2011): This section of the Municipal Code (MC 10.23) was added to provide a
  process for persons with disabilities for making a request for reasonable accommodations. In specific, this section applies to
  any person who requires reasonable accommodation in the application of a zoning law, which may be acting as a barrier to fair
  housing opportunities.
  Transitional and Supportive Housing (May 2012): Municipal Code Section 10.05 was revised to allow residential care
  homes, supportive housing and transitional housing as a use “by right” in all single-family residential districts.
  Emergency Shelters (June 2012): Emergency Shelters are now allowed as a use “by right” in areas zoned as “public”
  according to Municipal Code Section 10.05.045. Emergency shelters are those that meet the definition as contained in
  California Health and Safety Code 50801(e).
  Density Bonus (June 2012): Chapter 10.24 was added to the Municipal Code to allow for density bonuses under certain
  conditions. The density bonus program described in this chapter was developed pursuant to State Government Code,
  commencing with Section 65915 of Division 1 of Title 7.
  Establishment of New Zoning Designation (2013): The City was required to amend the Municipal Code to permit the
  development of a variety of housing types, in particular, multifamily housing. The Municipal Code was amended (MC
  10.05.043) to include a new zoning classification, RM- Multi-Family Residential District, which permits multifamily housing. A
  detailed discussion of this zoning district is included in Section 5 of this document.
  Revisions to Second Unit Program (2009-2014): The City has systematically introduced changes and improvements to its
  existing Second Unit Program. These include:
                 allowing Second Units of up to 1,200 square feet,
                 eliminating covered parking requirement,
                 waiving fees for rent restricted units,
                 improving data collection system,
                 increasing public awareness and knowledge of the program, and
                 establishing an amnesty program.
                                                                                                                             38

C. Summary of Housing Production (RHNA)
  The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) establishes specific housing production objectives for communities
  within their jurisdiction, which includes the City of Monte Sereno. These objectives are known as the Regional Housing
  Needs Allocation or RHNA and are further broken down by income classification. The City’s overall 2007-2014 RHNA was
  to plan for 41 units for the 4th RHNA cycle. This 41-unit objective by units affordable to specific income category is as
  follows:
                       13 very low income (extremely low and very low income combined) units
                        9 low income units
                       11 moderate income units
                        8 above moderate income units
                       41 TOTAL UNITS
  The City’s 2009-2014 Housing Element included these RHNA objectives. Table HE-12 in the 2009-2014 Housing Element
  (page 55) includes the 41 unit total RHNA objective and also includes estimates of units built during the period up to the
  completion of the Housing Element (June 30, 2008). Table HE-12 in that document shows a total of 9 single family and
  second units under construction or approved in the period ending June 30, 2008. From July 1, 2008 until December 31, 2013,
  an additional 21 units were built. The total number of units built during the 2007-2014 planning period was 30 units.

  * Units from lower income categories can be used in higher income categories to meet RHNA. For example, there is an excess of 2 units in the low
  income category. These 2 units can be added to the moderate income category for a revised total of 5 units instead of 3 units, thereby achieving a
  revised rate of 45%.
  The data in Table HE-7 above indicate several important facts. First, 2/3 of the units produced in the 2007-2014
  planning period were Second Units. Second, the City achieved 73% of its total RHNA goals, which is significant.
  This data is confirmed in ABAG’s January 2015 report on “Bay Area Progress in Meeting 2007-2014 Regional
  Housing Need Allocation.” ABAG reports the same unit production as noted in the table above for Monte Sereno
  and indicates that Monte Sereno’s 73% achievement rate exceeds the average for Santa Clara County communities,
  which was 64%.
  The City's 2009-2014 Housing Element directed that the City's RHNA obligations to provide 22 lower income units and 11
  moderate income units would be addressed through the provision of second units. The 2009-2014 document was very specific
  that the RHNA needs for lower and moderate income would be addressed through the Second Unit program and the
  remaining above moderate income need through new housing within the existing City limits. The City modified and
  provided additional incentives to the Second Unit Program in order to encourage Second Unit production, resulting in 2/3 of
  the units produced during 2007-2014 being Second Units. See Appendix A in this document for a complete review of
  program implementation actions for 2009-2014.

D. Progress in Implementation and Continued Appropriateness
  Appendix A of this document includes a detailed review and evaluation of each of the programs from the 2009-2014
  Housing Element. Following is an evaluation of the progress in implementing the housing goals from 2009-2014 and
  recommendations on whether to continue existing policies and programs.
          Production of New Units (Goals H-1 and H-3):
  Quantified Objectives
  The 2009-2014 Housing Element (Table HE-13, Page 56) identified an objective of 18 new single-family units and 30 second
  units, or 48 units total. During the 2007-2014 time period, 10 single family homes and 20 second units were produced, or 30
  units total. The 30 units represent 64% of the total 48-unit objective. It should be noted that the 48-unit goal was an ambitious
  goal and exceeded the RHNA objective of 41 units. The 48 units represent 7 more units than required by the RHNA and
  Housing Element regulations. At the time that the 48-unit goal was developed, construction activity in Monte Sereno was at
  an all-time high and it was projected that the trend would continue. However, the recessionary period that followed
  suppressed housing construction activity.
  During the 2009-2014 time period, the City undertook a series of actions to provide adequate sites and reduce governmental
  constraints towards the production of new units. The City revised its second unit program to encourage the development of
  more second units. Included in these changes were increasing the maximum square footage to 1200 square feet, eliminating
  covered parking requirements, creating an amnesty program, waiving fees for rent-restricted units, and increasing public
  awareness and knowledge of the program.
  In order to encourage a variety of housing types, the City established a new multi-family zoning designation. The City
  managed a multi-year project to prepare a multifamily residential zoning district and conducted an analysis (including
  preparation of an environmental impact report) for an approximate 4.45 acre site (APN 510-08-018 and -019) in the City’s
  sphere of influence. As a result of that analysis, the City pre-zoned the site with a newly established zoning category of multi-
  family, RM district that would allow the development of 13 multifamily units. The owner of that property, however, has not
  proceeded with initiating annexation at the time that this 2015-2023 Housing Element is prepared.
  Because the owner of the prezoned property has not filed an annexation application, the City has determined to provide
  opportunities for multifamily housing within the City limits by modifying the development regulations applicable to the P
  (Public) zone to allow multifamily development on a designated site. Additionally, the City desires to increase the production
  of Second Units by making additional revisions to its Second Unit ordinance.
  Please see Section 6 (“Housing Needs and Resources”) and Section 7 (“Housing Program Strategy”) for a detailed description
  of the actions that are proposed to address these two issue areas.
          Maintenance of Existing Housing and Energy Conservation
          (Goals H-2 and H-6):
  Quantified Objectives:
  The 2009-2014 Housing Element identified an objective of 10 rehabilitated units. This included 5 moderate and 5 above
  moderate income units. There were no specific objectives for energy conservation opportunities. There were approximately
  450 permits issued by the City for remodeling activities during the 2009-2014 time period. The income levels of households
  who remodeled are not available but it is assumed that the City’s quantified objectives were definitely achieved for both
  moderate and above moderate income units when compared to the number of permits issued.
  It is recommended that the 2014-2023 Housing Element include continued support for the maintenance of existing housing
  units through code compliance efforts and continue to comply with all State guidelines for energy conservation practices and
  include incentives for energy or other green building activities.
                                                                                                                            40

       Housing for Special Needs Population (Goal H-4):
Quantified Objectives:
The 2009-2014 Housing Element did not include any quantified objectives for special needs population groups.
During 2011-2012 the City revised its Municipal Code in order to address specific needs of certain types of households.
Transitional and Supportive housing is now allowed as a use “by right” in all R-1 neighborhoods. Emergency shelters are also
allowed in areas zoned P. Procedures for Reasonable Accommodations were adopted for persons with a disability who require
reasonable accommodation in the application of a zoning law, which may be acting as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.
These actions specifically address the goals of Programs H-4.2, H-4.3 and 4.4 of the 2009-2014 Element.
The 2015-2023 Housing Element should continue to include policies and programs that will support housing for all
population groups, including special needs. Because demographic trends indicate an aging of the Monte Sereno population
base, special emphasis should be placed on housing opportunities for 60+ year population groups.
       Equal Housing Opportunities (Goal H-5):
Quantified Objectives:
The 2009-2014 Housing Element did not include any quantified objectives for providing equal housing opportunities.
The City implemented Programs H-5.1, H-5.2 and H-5.3 during the 2009-2014 time period and should continue those efforts
in the policies and programs for the 2015-2023 Housing Element.

  SECTION 5: HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
  State law requires that Housing Elements include an analysis of governmental and nongovernmental constraints upon the
  maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels. Governmental constraints include land use
  controls, building codes and their enforcement, fees and exactions, and permitting procedures. Nongovernmental constraints
  are primarily market-driven and include land costs, construction costs and the availability of financing.
A. Governmental Constraints
          General Plan and Land Use
  The Monte Sereno General Plan is the City’s primary land use control policy document. The General Plan Land Use Element
  identifies permitted land uses and development intensities for all land within city boundaries. Permitted uses in Monte Sereno
  include residential, public and open space. The General Plan does not designate any areas in Monte Sereno as commercial or
  mixed-use. Table HE-8 identifies the residential land use designations and their maximum permitted densities.
          Table HE-8           Residential Land Use Designations
                                    Designation                                       Maximum Density
                         Low Density Residential (R-1-44)                         0 - 1 dwelling unit per acre
                        Medium Density Residential (R-1-20)                       1 - 2 dwelling units per acre
                         Higher Density Residential (R-1-8)                       3 - 5 dwelling units per acre
                           Multi-Family Residential (RM)                            3 dwelling units per acre
          Zoning Code
  The Monte Sereno Zoning Code (Monte Sereno Municipal Code Title 10 - Planning and Zoning) implements the General
  Plan by establishing standards and regulations for all development in Monte Sereno. To this end, the Zoning Code establishes
  four residential zoning districts: R-1-8, R-1-20, R-1-44 and RM. Development standards that apply to these districts are
  summarized in Table HE-10. In all districts single-family homes are permitted uses. In the RM zone multi-family housing is
  also a permitted use. The Municipal Code also includes a “Public” zone category. As described later in this document, one of
  the proposed program actions (Program H-2.5) for the 2015-2023 Housing Element planning period is to modify the Public
  zoning standards on a designated site to allow residential uses. This modification will facilitate additional opportunities for
  multi-family housing in the City.
  Structural Coverage
  The City's structural coverage limits of 20 to 40%, with higher coverage allowed on smaller lots, are not a constraint on the
  maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. Applying the structural coverage limit to the various zoning districts
  throughout the City would result in allowable structural footprints of at least 3,200 sq. ft. on the smallest single-family lots
  permitted in the City. In the RM multifamily zone, at least 5,800 sq. ft. of structure coverage is allowed on the minimum sized
  lot.
  Lot and Unit Size
  Originally, Monte Sereno developed as a large lot, residential community with minimum lot sizes of one acre and one-half
  acre. Typically, requirements for lots of this size may potentially act as a constraint to housing. But, because a majority of the
  City has been subdivided and already built at this density, a higher density cannot be achieved without drastic alterations to the
  City character and existing street and utility systems, both of which were designed for lower volumes.
                                                                                                                             42
  May 2015

                                                                                                                 CITY OF MONTE SERENO
                                                                                                                         GENERAL PLAN
                                                                                                            HOUSING ELEMENT 2015-2023
However, in the eastern part of the City, residential districts were designated with smaller minimum lot sizes, with 3-5 units
per acre and 8,000 sq. ft. lots permitted. The R-1-8 zone also allows for clustering which can reduce the minimum lot size
even further depending on slope calculations and street improvements. To facilitate multifamily development, Program H-2.5
in Section 7 of this document proposes to revise the “Public” zoning category to allow multifamily units. Design and
development standards are intended to be similar to those of the R-1-8 district, parking requirements are expected to be
similar to those required in the RM zone and there will be provisions for the clustering of units.
Allowable house size in Monte Sereno ranges from a maximum of 3,000 sq. ft. to 6,600 sq. ft. (including 400 square feet of
parking) depending on the lot size and zoning district, as shown in Table HE-10. There are no minimum floor area
requirements.
In regard to lots for Second Units, there are 1,222 parcels in Monte Sereno in 2014 (based on 2014 law enforcement parcel tax
assessment). Allowing for the 87 Second Units that currently exist on parcels (based on secondary dwelling unit use permits),
it is estimated that there are a remaining 1,135 residential parcels (City GIS data). It is further estimated that 71% of these
parcels are of sufficient size to accommodate a second unit. Therefore, the net number of parcels on which a Second Unit
could be built is 806, for a total capacity for 806 Second Units
Clustering of Units
Section 10.05.050 of the City’s Municipal Code allows special residential development exception to the minimum
development standards generally required in the R-1-8 and RM districts by allowing the clustering of homes on smaller sites.
This provision can assist in providing a variety of housing types and affordability levels.
         Analysis of Potential Constraints on Housing Types
         Second Units
Second units are allowed in the four residential districts if the units comply with all applicable development standards. The
approval process for Second Units is accomplished with an Administrative Use Permit and permits are issued by the City
Planner if the unit meets specified standards. For any structure over 120 square feet, the City requires a Site Development
Permit. This permit approval process has been identified as a possible constraint to the development of Second Units.
Program H-2.1 in Section 7 of this document contains a program action to revise the approval process so that it is ministerial
rather than requiring discretionary approval.
Although the City adopted substantial changes to its Second Unit ordinance during the last planning period to encourage
Second Units, staff and the public have identified additional constraints. In all R-1 zones, reducing setback requirements
would facilitate more Second Units. And, in the R-1-8 zone, more Second Units would be allowed if the City eliminated its
existing policy of deducting Second Unit square footage from the allowable maximum size of the principal dwelling on lots
smaller than 12,000 square feet. Both of these constraints have been addressed in Program H-2.1 in Section 7 of this
document.
Although not a constraint, the City has identified improved tracking of Second Units as a goal in the 2015-2023 planning
period. In particular, the City will collect information on affordability of Second Units and use of the units after construction
is completed. The City intends to survey owners of Second Units at least twice during the planning period with a survey form
to gather information on affordability and use of the unit. The first survey will be conducted concurrent with the evaluation
of progress towards RHNA goals as described in Program H-2.3 in Section 7 of this document.
          Multi-Family Units
During the 2009-2014 planning period, the City established a new multi-family zoning designation, described further in this
section, to provide all housing types in the City and prezoned an adjacent parcel to the RM zone. At the time the 2015-2023
Housing Element was prepared, the owner of the property had decided not to proceed with annexation. As a result, the City
has determined to provide opportunities for multifamily housing within the City limits by allowing residential uses on a
designated site in the “Public” zoning category, as described in Program H-2.5 in Section 7 of this document.
         Transitional and Supportive Housing
Municipal Code Section 10.05 allows residential care homes, supportive housing and transitional housing as a use “by right” in
all single-family residential districts. However, these uses were inadvertently omitted including in the RM zone. Program H-
2.6 in Section 7 of this document includes actions to correct this.
                                                                                                                              43

        Emergency Shelters
As described in Section 3 of this document (“Special Needs”), the 2013 Santa Clara County biennial count of homeless
persons did not find any homeless persons in Monte Sereno.
If there is a future need for homeless assistance in Monte Sereno, Emergency Shelters are allowed as a use “by right” in Public
Zones (“P”) in the City. There are 3 parcels in the City with a Public Zone designation, comprising approximately 12 acres.
Since the only other zoning categories in the City are residential, the Public Zoning category is the most appropriate if an
Emergency Shelter was to be considered.
Sites zoned P include City Hall; First Baptist Church; and the Daves Avenue Elementary School. Both the City Hall and
Church sites contain available land area that would be suitable for a homeless shelter as permitted by the City's Municipal
Code. The City Hall site is 26,171 square feet, has no development constraints, and could accommodate a small emergency
shelter in an accessory building. The First Baptist Church site is 3.48 acres and is partially developed with an existing church.
A shelter could be located either within the existing church building, especially if it was a rotating shelter in conjunction with
other churches or shelter facilities, or on the undeveloped portion of the site (discussed in the site inventory). As noted, there
are no retail businesses in Monte Sereno, nor any frequent bus service. However, these sites, which are associated with public-
serving institutions and located on a state highway (City Hall), are the most suitable sites in the City for an emergency shelter.
        Employee Housing
Generally, employee housing is privately owned housing, which houses five or more employees and meets one of the
following:
       Living quarters provided in connection with any work, whether or not rent is involved.
       Housing in a rural area which is:
                 1. Provided by someone who is not an agricultural employer, and
                 2. Provided for agricultural workers employed by any agricultural employer.
Program H-2.6 in Section 7 of this document includes an action item for the City to amend the Municipal Code to allow
employee housing serving 6 or fewer employees in any residentially zoned area.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
Single Room Occupancy residences consist primarily of very small studio units with minimal kitchen facilities that serve single
persons. These facilities would be considered multi-family housing. They are permitted in the RM zone and will be permitted
on the site of the First Baptist Church following implementation of Program H-2.5
Additionally, the City’s Municipal Code (Chapter 10.05) specifies that “renting of rooms and/or the providing of table board
to not more than two (2) persons so long as no kitchen facilities, other than those of the single kitchen of the main dwelling
are installed or used” is an allowable use in single family residential districts. Program H-2.6 includes an action to include this
section of the Municipal Code as applicable in the RM zone also.

                                                                                                                    GENERAL PLAN
                                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT 2015-2023
        Permitting Fees
Housing development is subject to permit processing and impact fees. These fees help to compensate the public for any impact
associated with the new development. These fees are collected by the City as well as other agencies providing public services in
Monte Sereno. An estimate of fees associated with the development of single family home with a building permit valuation of
approximately $1,000,000 (the average building permit valuation from 2013-2014 in Monte Sereno) is identified in Table HE-
10.
        Permit Processing Procedures
The construction of new single-family homes, major remodels of existing homes, and new multi-family uses in the RM zone
require a Site Development Permit and a public hearing before the City Site and Architecture Commission. Typical permit
processing times are one to two months for a remodel and two to three months for a new home, including a 10 day public
notice period. Additional processing time would be required if the project is not exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act.
Permit processing procedures for single family dwelling units require a design review approval. The design review does not
pose a significant cost impact because the cost of application ranges from $360 for a basic remodel to $2,750 for a complex
hillside home construction project. Compared with other construction costs such as the cost of materials, this application fee is
nominal.
Permit approval requires the Commission to find the application consistent with site and building design requirements and to
find that the proposed design retains the character of the neighborhood, mitigates significant visual impacts, meets City design
guidelines, and meets other standards regarding landscaping, grading, tree removal, and drainage.
The Site Development Permit process does not place a significant cost on the applicant, but more often requires minor
architectural alterations and/or landscaping to minimize unreasonable impacts on surrounding properties. The majority of
design review applications are approved within one month from the date of submittal. Consequently, permit processing
procedures and fees do not appear to be a constraint to housing development.
        Building Codes and Code Enforcement
Monte Sereno has adopted the 2013 editions of the California Building, Fire, Plumbing, Mechanical, Electric and Health and
Safety Codes. The City has not adopted any amendments to these codes that significantly increase housing costs; the
amendments recognize the City's location in a high fire hazard area near the San Andreas Fault and require fire-resistant roofs
in the Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Area, additional bracing in certain situations, and fire sprinklers. The City Building
Official regularly inspects development projects to ensure compliance with all applicable codes. . Inspections and approvals are
completed promptly and do not add unnecessary delays in the construction of new housing. Code enforcement is pursued as a
result of Building Official inspections and resident complaints and typically involves minor deferred maintenance. Building
Codes and Code Enforcement are not considered a constraint to development.
                                                                                                                         46

        On/Off-Site Improvement Standards
Due to the low-density and semi-rural character of Monte Sereno, the City typically requires only minimal on- and off-site
improvements as a condition of approval for new residential development, particularly compared to the requirements of
neighboring communities. Most new housing development occurs on existing lots that are already served by necessary
infrastructure. Fees associated with the provision of infrastructure to serve new development are identified in Table HE-10
along with other planning and development fees. The estimate below is for a home with a construction valuation of $1,000,000,
which was the average building permit valuation in Monte Sereno for 2013-2014.

As a comparison, listed below are estimated fees from three neighboring communities for a typical detached single-family unit.
          City of Cupertino $52,851
          City of Campbell $35,978
          City of Saratoga $33,900 (does not include school impact fees or building fees)
Total fees in Monte Sereno constitute only four percent of the building valuation on a typical home, and fees charged by the
City itself constitute only 2.5 percent of building permit valuation. This fee structure appears reasonable and comparable to
other surrounding communities and, as such, is not considered a constraint to development.

        Parking Requirements
Parking requirements are as follows according to zoning designation.
      Zoning Designation               Lot with on street parking       Lot without on street parking
               R-1-8                     2 covered/2 uncovered                2 covered/3 uncovered
              R-1-20                     2 covered/2 uncovered                2 covered/4 uncovered
              R-1-44                     2 covered/2 uncovered                2 covered/5 uncovered
                RM                       1 covered/1uncovered                 1 covered/1 uncovered
For single-family homes located on streets with on-street parking, the parking requirement can be met by a typical two-car
garage and two parking spaces on the driveway apron. The additional requirement for uncovered driveway parking for lots
without on-street parking is designed to ensure that fire access is not impaired. The requirement applies only to above
moderate-income housing.
The reduced parking requirement in the RM zoning designation is important to note and is designed to ensure that parking
does not serve as a constraint to multi-family development. Consequently, parking requirements appear reasonable and are not
considered a constraint.
        Environmental Constraints
Environmental hazards affecting housing units include geologic and seismic conditions, flooding, fire hazards, toxic and
hazardous wastes, and noise. The following hazards may impact future development of residential units in the City. Most of the
identified sites in Appendix F: Underdeveloped Land Inventory, do not contain environmental constraints to the development
of housing. Where environmental constraints exist, the City of Monte Sereno has identified measures for mitigation.
          Seismic Hazards
Monte Sereno is located within the seismically active San Francisco Bay region, one of the most seismically active zones in the
United States. The faults in the San Francisco Bay region are capable of generating earthquakes of at least 8.0 in magnitude on
the Richter Scale, producing very strong ground shaking in Monte Sereno.
The closest major fault is the San Andreas Fault, which passes through Monte Sereno’s SOI southwest of Lyndon Canyon. A
portion of Monte Sereno also is near the potentially active Shannon Fault, just north of Monte Sereno in Los Gatos.
To address these seismic hazards the City requires new construction to be built using the most recent building codes to
minimize potential damage to structures as a result of an earthquake. Development or substantial renovations in Monte Sereno
must comply with the Uniform Building Code (UBC), which outlines standards for seismic design, foundations and drainage
and requires that geotechnical engineering studies be undertaken for all major new buildings or earth works.
As required by the State of California, the Monte Sereno General Plan contains policies regarding land instability and seismic
hazards within the Health and Safety Element (updated in 2009). In addition, the General Plan identifies the general location of
the areas of potential seismic hazards, as well as potentially active faults, 100-year flood areas, and hazardous fire areas in the
Health and Safety Element.
          Landslides
The hillside region of the City contains some rock formations conducive to landslides. The landslide zone is also present within
the Sphere of Influence. Landslides and unstable slopes may occur in this area, and can create hazards within the City limits as
the slide debris and rock move down the incline toward the City's valley floor.
Landslides and slope instability are the major non-seismic geologic hazards in Monte Sereno. According to the County of Santa
Clara, approximately 75 percent of Monte Sereno is located in an area with a high potential for earthquake induced landslides.
As noted above, the General Plan includes specific policies to protect residents from injuries and minimize property damage
resulting from land stability, geologic and seismic hazards. Moreover, the Zoning Ordinance includes specific regulations for
residential development in the hillsides designed to protect human life and property.

          Soil Creep and Expansive Soils
Soil creep and expansive soils are most prevalent in the hillside regions of the City. Soil creep is the slow, down slope
movement of near surface materials. The rate of soil creep is a function of slope angle and soil thickness and texture. It can be
regarded as a continuous process, and may cause retaining walls, foundations, and paved roads to fail over a period of time.
Expansive soils contain high proportions of clay and alternatively absorb and release large amounts of water during wet and dry
cycles.
Structures built on expansive soils can experience rising foundations during the wet season, resulting in cracked foundations,
distorted frameworks, and warped windows and doors. To address adverse effects associated with soil creep and expansive
soils, the City requires geotechnical investigations and soil reports in areas where soil creep and expansive soils exist. The
presence of soil creep should not have a prohibitive effect on land use, but should alert the City to require appropriate
geotechnical investigations to evaluate conditions and to impose engineering solutions to mitigate problems.
          Flooding
Large-scale flooding is not a significant hazard in Monte Sereno. Most of the properties in Monte Sereno are built above the
base flood elevation. However, both surface and subsurface local drainage problems do exist in some parts of Monte Sereno.
Monte Sereno participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The City adopts and enforces certain floodplain
management ordinances and, in return, residents can purchase Federally-backed flood insurance. In addition, the City has a
review procedure in conjunction with the Santa Clara Valley Water District, which addresses flooding potential and the impact
on development.
          Toxic and Hazardous Wastes
Hazardous material usage and hazardous waste are primarily associated with residential uses in Monte Sereno. Household
hazardous materials including pesticides, fertilizers and oil are the most commonly occurring hazardous material in the City.
Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is authorized by the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce and
implement federal hazardous materials laws and regulations, including disposal and transportation of hazardous materials.
Santa Clara County operates a Household Hazardous Waste disposal program for incorporated and unincorporated residents
and small businesses. Household hazardous waste includes flammable, corrosive, toxic and oxidizer material and can be
dropped off at facilities located in Sunnyvale, San Jose and San Martin.
As stated in section 8.02.020 of the Monte Sereno Municipal Code, accumulation of hazardous material is prohibited. As
contained in the document, “No owner, agent, lessee or other person occupying or having charge or control of any building, lot
or premises within the City of Monte Sereno shall permit weeds, dirt, rubbish, rank growths and other hazardous material to
remain upon said premises, or public sidewalks, or streets, or alleys between said premises and the centerline of any public
street or alley.”
          Fire Hazards
Central Fire District of Santa Clara County serves the City of Monte Sereno. All area fire departments cooperate in mutual aid
agreements, which loosen the strict adherence to district boundaries when adjacent communities are in need.
Hazardous fire areas within the City are located within the hillside area and extend to flatter areas of the City that back up to
open space. Special building regulations exist for the hazardous fire areas, including the requirement for fire retardant roofs.
The City also requires anti-fire buffer areas and sufficient clearance around each house in the Wildland Urban Interface Zone.
Finally, the City has a Weed Abatement Ordinance that requires property owners to remove weeds and other combustible
materials that become a fire menace, or the City through partnership with Santa Clara County will abate the nuisance at the
expense of the property owner.
          Noise
Traffic is the primary source of noise in Monte Sereno. The City’s Planning Department currently considers noise in the project
review process and works with the applicant to use site planning and other design strategies to reduce noise impacts.

        Infrastructure Constraints
The following presents the analysis of existing and future water and sewer capacity in Monte Sereno. The City has found that
based on population projections and housing growth needs, there is adequate water and sewer capacity.
             Water
The City of Monte Sereno receives its water supply from the San Jose Water Company. San Jose Water Company obtains water
from three major sources: groundwater, imported surface water, and local mountain surface water. Groundwater is pumped
from over 100 wells that draw water from the Santa Clara Groundwater Basin. Groundwater accounts for approximately 40
percent of supply. Imported surface water is provided by Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD), the wholesale supplier.
Surface water imported from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and purchased from the Santa Clara Valley Water district
accounts for approximately 50 percent of supply. A majority of this water originates as Sierra snowmelt, and travels through the
State and Federal water projects before treatment at SCVWD's three water treatment plants. A smaller portion is impounded in
local reservoirs in Santa Clara County. Local mountain surface water is collected in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and treated at
San Jose Water Company's two water treatment plants. Local surface water accounts for approximately 10 percent of supply.
These sources are often blended together in the distribution system. Consequently, different sources are dispersed to Monte
Sereno from day to day as customer usage changes.
The Water Company's 2010 Urban Water Management Plan (adopted April 2011) found that the Water Company has more
than adequate supplies in a normal year. However, in a four- to six-year drought, mandatory water conservation measures may
be required. The Water Company has been ordered to achieve a 20 percent reduction in water use under emergency regulations
adopted by the State Water Quality Control Board.
There is adequate water availability and distribution to serve the 71 units projected for the 2015-2023 time frame as presented
in Table HE-15 of this document.
          Sewer
The City of Monte Sereno is served by West Valley Sanitation District. The West Valley Sanitation District covers over 30
square miles, serving a population of over 120,000 people. The District facilities include over 400 miles of sewer mains and
over 250 miles of sewer laterals. The District has a fixed capacity allocation of 13.05 million gallons per day. Based on
population growth projections for 2030, the District would not exceed the current fixed capacity allocation.
There is adequate sewer availability and distribution to serve the 71 units projected for the 2015-2023 time frame as presented
in Table HE-15 of this document.
As required by Section 65589.7, the City will provide copies of its Housing Element to the San Jose Water Company and West
Valley Sanitation District after adoption.
        Energy Conservation Opportunities
Energy conservation remains a major priority in Monte Sereno. The City requires compliance with Title 24 of the California
Code of Regulations on the use of energy efficient appliances and insulation. Through compliance with Title 24, new
residential development has reduced energy demand.
The City requires the submittal of a Cal Green checklist for new construction and remodeling. The Cal Green checklist is
based on standards produced by the California Building Standards Commission. Checklists for both new construction and
remodeling as well as instructions for completing the forms are available on the City’s website.
The City also provides incentives for the installation of solar panels. Streamlining of permit applications as well as permit fee
waivers are provided for solar panel installations in residential units.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which provides service in Monte Sereno, offers public information and technical
assistance to homeowners regarding energy conservation. PG&E also provides numerous incentives for energy efficiency in
new construction and home remodeling. Remodeling rebates exist for projects installing three or more upgrades from a
flexible menu of options that earn points towards incentives and rebates. This program’s incentives range between $1,000-
$4,500.
                                                                                                                          50

One of the more recent strategies in building energy-efficient homes is following the U.S. Green Building Council’s guidelines
for LEED Certification. The LEED for Homes program includes standards for new single-family and multi-family home
construction.
The following presents a variety of ways that Monte Sereno can promote energy conservation and are included in Program H-
3.3 in Section 7.
                  Continue to offer streamlining and fee waivers for solar panel installations,
                  Continue the “Build It Green” program and checklists,
                  Provide information regarding rebate programs and energy audits available through PG&E, and
                  Provide resource materials regarding green building and conservation programs.
        Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State law requires the Housing Element to include an analysis of governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
improvement or development of housing for persons with disabilities. Housing Elements also must include programs to
remove these constraints to the extent possible and to provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for and
occupied by persons with disabilities.
Chapter 10.23 of the Monte Sereno Municipal Code provides reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities, and
complies with the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act in the
application of the City’s zoning, land use laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, procedures, and practices.
A request for reasonable accommodation may include a request for modification or exception to the land use rules for the
siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a
person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of that person’s choice.
Chapter 10.05 of the Monte Sereno Municipal Code allows residential care homes, supportive housing and transitional housing
as uses “by right” in single family residential districts. The City does not have siting, separation, or separate parking
requirements for residential care homes, supportive housing, or transitional housing. Allowing residential care homes,
supportive housing and transitional housing was inadvertently omitted when the RM zoning regulations were drafted. Program
H-2.6 in Section 7 of this document includes a program action to amend the Municipal Code to allow these uses in the RM
zone.
The City's definition of 'family' does not limit the number of unrelated persons who reside in a residence.
        Summary of Governmental Constraints
Given the City’s already developed land use pattern, the governmental regulations identified above are a responsible and
thoughtful effort to maintain the character of already developed areas while providing opportunities for additional types of
housing that can be more affordable. The clustering provision for R-1-8 and RM properties, which allows smaller lot sizes, is
especially important in reducing constraints to the development of all housing types. Reduced parking requirements for RM
lots also make housing more affordable.
Those constraints that were identified have been addressed with specific program actions. In order to encourage more multi-
family opportunities, Program H-2.5 will provide modifications to the “Public” zoning category that will allow multi-family
residential uses with reduced lot sizes and modified parking requirements on a designated site, thereby ensuring that all housing
types are permitted in the City. Further, the City intends to reduce identified constraints to the development of Second Units,
using the actions outlined in Programs H-2.1 and H-2.3 And, in order to continue to facilitate a variety of housing types,
Program H-2.6 includes specific amendments to the Municipal Code .

B. Non-Governmental Constraints
         Land and Construction Costs
  Land is expensive in Monte Sereno due to the limited availability of buildable sites, as well as the scenic setting and the area’s
  existing upscale character. The current market price for unimproved land is over $1,000,000 per acre. Similarly, high
  construction costs in the Bay Area also contribute to the high cost of housing in Monte Sereno. Based upon City building
  permit data, construction costs for new single-family homes typically range from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. Land and
  construction costs in Monte Sereno represent the primary barrier to affordable housing in the community. The difficulty of
  building in Monte Sereno virtually guarantees that, even in the absence of governmental constraints, housing in Monte Sereno
  will be very expensive. Except for Second Units, it is extremely unlikely that housing affordable to low and moderate income
  households can be constructed in Monte Sereno under any circumstances without considerable subsidy, public or private.
         Availability of Financing
  As a stable and affluent community, private housing mortgage financing is readily available in Monte Sereno. There are no
  mortgage-deficient areas in the City and no identifiable underserved groups in need of financing assistance. At the time this
  Housing Element was drafted, interest rates for homebuyers were very low historically, in the approximate range of 3.5-4% for
  a fixed rate, 30 year mortgage.
                                                                                                                            52

    SECTION 6: HOUSING NEEDS AND RESOURCES
 A. Future Housing Needs
As identified earlier in this document, significant housing issues facing Monte Sereno in the 2015-2023 time frame are expected to
be:
 Growing senior population,
 Limited amount of vacant, developable land,
 Expensive housing costs, and
 Restricted City financial resources for addressing housing issues.
As specified in State Housing Element law, regional councils of governments identify specific housing objectives (known as the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation, or RHNA) for individual communities for a specified planning period. ABAG, the
Association of Bay Area Governments, has identified the following RHNA objectives for Monte Sereno for the period from
January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2022. These objectives are the minimum number of housing units necessary to accommodate the
City’s regional share of population growth for all household income levels. The City’s obligation is to provide zoning and adequate
land at sufficient densities to allow the following units to be built.
           Table HE-11             Regional Housing Needs Allocation: January 2014 - October 2022
                       Household Income                   Number of Units
                     Extremely Low Income                       11 units
                        Very Low Income                         12 units
                           Low Income                           13 units
                        Moderate Income                         13 units
                    Above moderate Income                       12 units

           Housing Produced January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014
As shown in Table HE-12 on the following page, building permits were issued for five units during 2014. One unit is a single-
family unit and assumed to be affordable to an above moderate income household. The four remaining units are Second Units,
one is affordable to a low income household and the other three are assumed to be affordable to an above moderate income
household, in two cases because their affordability level cannot yet be determined. The City’s methodology and process for
determining household affordability levels for Second Units is described in more detail in Section B of the Appendix to this
document.

    The remaining RHNA total for Monte Sereno for the 2014-2023 period equals 56 units. As discussed below, Monte Sereno can
    accommodate this housing need with existing underdeveloped parcels in the City as well as the City’s Second Unit Program.

  *Proposed zoning modification as described below and in Program H-2.5 in Section 7 of this document.
  The properties identified in the table above are described in more detail in the Appendix (Appendix F: Underdeveloped Land
  Inventory). Four of the five properties have residential single family zoning designations. However, the fifth property is a site
  that currently has a “Public” zoning category and is more fully described below.
  The fifth site is an underdeveloped property located at 17765 Daves Avenue (APN # 410-08-036). The site is approximately
  3.48 acres and is the location of the First Baptist Church. The church related buildings and surface parking are located on 2.30
  acres of the property and the remaining 1.18 acres are open space areas. The site is zoned for “Public” use. Program H-2.5 in
  the Housing Program Strategy section of this document describes modifying the Public zoning category to allow multifamily
  residential uses by right on this site as long as design and development standards are met. The development standards would
  contain incentives similar to the existing provisions in the R-1-8 and RM Districts and would allow clustering of units and
  reduction of lot sizes. It is estimated that the site could accommodate 15 residential units on the 1.18 acres that is currently
  open space area. This would achieve a net residential density on the site of approximately 15 units. This site with the
  accompanying zoning modifications as described below will ensure that the City's site inventory can accommodate all housing
  types, including multifamily housing.

Under Program H-2.5, the City intends to adopt design guidelines so that a proposed residential development conforming to
the guidelines may be approved 'by right' without the need for a discretionary PD-type or other approval, unless a subdivision
map is requested.
Developable Area:
The total square footage of the First Baptist Church site is 3.48 acres. It is estimated that the area proposed for development
would be the approximate 1.2 acres of currently open space area and possibly some of the existing parking area. Depending on
the actual configuration of any proposed project, the existing parking area could be re-designed to possibly allow more square
footage for the project while providing a revised and more efficient parking design.
Density:
The entire site would be designated with a gross density of 3-5 units per acre. However, clustering of units would be allowed
so that a maximum of 15 units could be developed in the 1.2 + acres of open space and possibly some of the existing parking
area – resulting in a net density of approximately 15 units per acre.
Type of Development:
It is assumed that the development would consist of townhomes, apartments, SROs or condominium units. Given the church
and the neighboring public school, the site is particularly suitable for employee housing serving school employees or senior
housing in studio or 1-bedroom unit. Senior housing could also complement the existing after school care program on the
Church site. Seniors could help to volunteer with the after school care program in a mutually supportive inter-generational
setting.
Building Height
Maximum height limitations
          Single story: 21’ Height
          Two stories: 30’ Height
Setbacks:
The required setbacks will be similar to the R-1-8 development standards. Reduced setbacks will be considered with a cluster
design.
Parking:
1 space per unit
Visitor parking could be accommodated in conjunction with the existing parking lot. The Church parking lot is an ideal spot
for shared parking as it is only used infrequently during the week.
Easement
The First Baptist Church parcel map shows an easement running along the back portion of the site between the paved parking
area and the open space area. The Santa Clara Valley Water District owns title to the easement. Any potential development
project would need to identify the current use of the easement, if any, and, as appropriate, either seek to have the easement
abandoned, relocate any utilities, or design to avoid encroaching into the easement. Because of its location, residences can be
designed to avoid the easement, and so it does not pose a significant constraint to development.
Other Issues:
In addition to finalizing standards and amending the General Plan to include a Public/Residential Multi Family Zone, the City’s
existing “Cluster Housing” regulations would need to be amended. Certain provisions of the Ordinance, such as minimum site
area of 4 acres and other provisions, would need to be amended to be consistent with the standards of the new
Public/Residential Multi Family zone district.
With flexible guidelines as identified above, it is not anticipated that a Planned Development Permit will be required for any
proposed project.

  Land Inventory (continued) In 2013 the City prezoned a 4.45 acre site in the City’s Sphere of Influence. The site is the
  location of the La Hacienda restaurant and is located at 18840 Saratoga Los Gatos Road. The site was prezoned RM-Multi
  Family Residential, which allows up to 3 units per lot, and the City completed an EIR on the prezoning so that environmental
  review of any future project could be streamlined. The minimum net lot size for a site containing multi-family housing is 14,520
  square feet per unit or the minimum as required by the City’s Slope Density formula; however, the units themselves may be
  clustered on the site. The total number of units that could be built is 12-13 units. Because the property owner has indicated that
  he does not intend to annex the property with this pre-zoning designation, the parcel is not included in the City's site inventory.
  Should the property be annexed in the future, this parcel could potentially provide additional multifamily housing.
C. Second Unit Program
  Second Units are independent homes located on the same lot as a primary, larger dwelling unit. Generally, Second Units are
  typically more affordable than other rental units.
  The City’s Second Unit programs allows for either attached or detached units. The unit must have its own kitchen and must
  meet all current building codes. Either the primary residence or the Second Unit must be the principal residence of a legal
  owner of the property.
          Incentives for Increased Second Unit Production
  The City has administered a Second Unit Program for over 15 years. During that time, the program has been evaluated on a
  periodic basis and revised as necessary to ensure its effectiveness. For example, in 2013-2014, the City refined its survey
  method and replaced mail questionnaires with person-to-person interviews to gather rent and occupancy information on newly
  approved Second Units. In the last planning period, the City also revised the program with the following changes:
                      1. Increasing allowable square footage to 1200 square feet
                      A very important change to the program in the last planning period was the increased allowance of up to a
                      maximum of 1200 square feet for Second Units. This change increases the probability that a Second Unit
                      can provide housing for families and larger households. Depending on the R-1 zone and whether attached
                      or detached, Second Units can be of a size that accommodates a range of household types and sizes.
                      Attached Secondary Dwelling Unit             Detached Secondary Dwelling Unit
                      Maximum Size                                 Maximum Size
                           R-1-8                600 sq. ft.              R-1-8                 900 sq. ft.
                           R-1-20               700 sq. ft.             R-1-20                1,000 sq. ft.
                           R-1-44               800 sq. ft.             R-1-44                1,200 sq. ft.
                      2. Eliminating Covered Parking Requirements
                      Another significant revision was the elimination of requirements to provide covered parking for Second
                      Units. This change can provide measurable cost savings in the construction of Second Units and is another
                      incentive to produce Second Units.
                      3. Waiving fees for rent restricted units
                      As an incentive to provide units with rent restrictions, the City will waive all planning and building
                      department fees.
                      4. Increasing public awareness of the Second Unit Program
                      In recent years, the City has provided additional outreach and written information about the Second Unit
                      Program at City Hall as well as on the City’s website and City newsletters.
                                                                                                                                56

                   5. Established an Amnesty Program
                   Starting July 1, 2013 the City began an amnesty program allowing units constructed legally and converted
                   illegally to be recognized by the City as legal Secondary Dwelling units. For units to be considered for
                   amnesty they must meet the following requirements:
                          Receive a successful health and safety inspection from an outside inspector that the unit meets all
                              State habitability requirements.
                          Must be a separate dwelling unit that provides complete and independent living facilities for one or
                              more people with its own kitchen (including, but not limited to stove, microwave oven or
                              equivalent).
                          Either the primary or secondary unit must be the principal residence of a legal owner of the
                              property. The other unit may be rented.
                          The lot or parcel must be served by the sanitary sewer system.
                   In August 2014 the City Council voted to extend the amnesty program unit through December 31, 2015.
                   The City has approved 6 units under the amnesty program and continues to conduct outreach to interested
                   parties.
                   6. Improved Tracking of Second Units
                   The City began conducting real time surveys in 2013, either in person or over the phone, of secondary
                   dwelling unit permit holders during the permitting process. This
                   was done to specifically document the affordability and occupancy of the unit at that time.
.
                   The City conducts an interview with homeowners during the building process. In the interview questions
                   are asked about the intended use of the unit and the estimated rent that will be charged. The planning
                   department has also been adding a note, when conducting preliminary plan check that attached units must be
                   used as secondary dwelling units and are not to be used to expand the livable area in the main house.
                   In addition to this initial survey at the time of construction, the City intends to survey owners of already-
                   built Second Units at least twice during the 2015-2023 Planning Period. As described in Section 7, Housing
                   Program 2.1 of this document, the City will collect information through the survey about affordability and
                   use of the unit. The first survey will be conducted in conjunction with the evaluation by the end of 2017 on
                   the progress being made towards achieving the City’s RHNA objectives.
The City is considering including additional incentives to the Second Unit Program. As described in Section 7 of this
document, Housing Program H-2.1, the City will review ordinance amendments to remove constraints to Second Unit
development, such as reducing setback requirements for Second Units in all R-1 zones and eliminating the existing policy that
deducts Second Unit square footage from the allowable maximum size of the principal dwelling on lots of less than 12,000
square feet in the R-1-8 zone. In addition, the City will revise the Second Unit approval process to be ministerial, rather than
discretionary.
                                                                                                                           57

        Affordability of Second Units
The City calculates the affordability of Second Units based on the rent and the size of the units. The rents are then compared
to household income limits defined by the State for very low, low and moderate income households. These income limits are
revised on an annual basis by the State and the City then updates their rent affordability levels accordingly. For example, in
2014, the City would identify a Second Unit studio as a very low income unit if the rent charged did not exceed $928 per
month. A Second Unit of 1 bedroom would be classified as a low income unit if the maximum rent was $1266 or less. A
detailed discussion of the City's methodology for determining affordability is included in Appendix B.

              ** The 3 second units in 2014 classified as “above moderate” income include two units that were issued building permits at the end of
                 calendar year 2014 but income levels had not been determined when this Housing Element was completed in February 2015. Once
                 those income determinations have been completed, these two units could possibly be reclassified from “above moderate” to lower
                 income categories.
Of all the Second Units produced between 2007-2014 (24 units total), following is the percentage breakdown by income level:
          Very Low Income                25% (6 units)
          Low Income                     50% (12 units)
          Moderate Income                12.5% (3 units)
          Above Moderate                 12.5% (3 units)
These percentages are similar to results of a study conducted in 2014 by the San Mateo County “21 Elements” task force 1. This
study looked at recent research on Second Units in the San Mateo County area (which borders Santa Clara County) and, in
particular, the community of Hillsborough (which is similar in demographics and housing costs to Monte Sereno). That study
concluded “overall secondary units are a more affordable option for lower income households” and determined that:
                approximately 25-60% of secondary units are affordable to extremely low income households,
                another approximately 10-25% of secondary units are affordable to very low income households,
                another approximately 15-20% of secondary units are affordable to low income households,
                approximately 10-20% more of secondary units are affordable to moderate income households,
                and approximately 5% of secondary units are affordable to above moderate income households.
The study varied its percentages depending on the income characteristics of a community—in particular, citing that wealthier
communities are more likely to make secondary units available at no rent to household members or domestic help and the units
are therefore affordable to extremely low income households.
As shown above, Second Units can be a critical component in the production of more affordable housing units in a
community. However, Second Units can also play other roles in a community, such as making more efficient use of land by
increasing density on already developed parcels. Please see Section 8: Appendix (Part C) for more information regarding why
Second Units are a vital part of Monte Sereno’s housing strategy.

        Second Unit Capacity
Second Units are built on already developed or newly developed residential parcels. They can be either attached or detached
from the main structures.
Based on 2014 assessor's parcel data, there are 1,222 parcels in Monte Sereno in 2014. Allowing for the 87 Second Units that
currently exist on parcels (based on secondary dwelling unit use permits), it is estimated that there are a remaining
1,135 residential parcels (City GIS data) that could theoretically accommodate Second Units. It is further estimated that 71% of
these parcels are of sufficient size to accommodate a Second Unit. Therefore, the net number of parcels on which a Second
Unit could be built is 806, for a total capacity for 806 units
        How the Second Unit Program Will Address the City’s Need for Lower Income Housing
The City estimates that an average of six Second Units will be built annually during the 8 year time frame of this Housing
Element, resulting in 46 new Second Units. Based on the affordability data described previously, 75 percent of these units, or
35 units, will be affordable to lower income households. This number matches the City’s remaining lower income RHNA of 35
units (23 very low and 12 low income).
The City is confident that the Second Unit Program will address the City's need for lower income housing for the following
reasons:
          1.   Current and historical demand for Second Units
               In the last two years (2013 and 2014) there were 10 Second Units approved for an average of 5 annually. This was
               an increase from the prior years and can be attributed to the changes that the City made to the Second Unit
               Program (e.g. increasing maximum square footage of Second Units to 1200 square feet, eliminating covered
               parking requirements, etc.) as well as the housing market recovery from the “Great Recession.” Residential
               construction has resumed, and this is reflected in the increased number of Second Units beginning in 2013.
               It is anticipated that this upward trend will continue. Beginning in January 2015, two additional Second Unit
               applications have been approved and it is anticipated that building permits will be issued for these units in 2015.
               One additional Second Unit application has been submitted for Site Development Permit review as of February
               2015. The City has also received three building permit applications for Second Units that were previously
               approved. Assuming building permits are issued for these six units and the units are constructed, the City will
               have already met the City's goal of 6 units for all of 2015.
               Historically, Second Units in Monte Sereno have either been newly constructed or owners have remodeled
               existing square footage or structures into suitable Second Units. When the City inspects Second Units, the unit
               must meet minimum standards for a habitable unit as a dwelling unit and adds to the City's housing supply as
               would any other dwelling unit.
          2.   Additional modifications to Second Unit Program will facilitate more Second Units
               As proposed in Section 7 of this document, the City will review modifications to the Second Unit Program to
               reduce setback requirements for Second Units in R-1 zoned properties and eliminate the existing policy in R-1-8
               zones that deducts Second Unit square footage from the allowable maximum size of the principal dwelling on
               lots of less than 12,000 square feet. There are several property owners who “check in” on a regular basis with the
               Planning Department to find out when these proposed changes will be made because they want to build a
               Second Unit on their property but cannot without these revisions. Consequently, the City is confident that these
               types of modifications and others, as the City continually improves the program, will increase the average annual
               number of Second Units to at least 6 per year.
                                                                                                                           59

                                                                                                                     GENERAL PLAN
                                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT 2015-2023
         3.   Demand for Second Units
              The percentage of people 65+ years has steadily increased in Monte Sereno from 1990-2010 and this trend is
              expected to continue in the future as “baby boomers” age. With more senior households who desire to stay in
              their homes and “age in place,” Second Units provide a convenient and affordable housing option for caregivers
              and personal assistants. In addition to seniors, other special need households such as disabled family members
              could benefit from the independent living opportunity that Second Units can provide.
              Further, Second Units are a perfect solution for families that desire multi-generational housing opportunities.
              Households who want to have their elderly parents live with them have traditionally created a demand for Second
              Units. But, with continually increasing housing costs in California, young adult children are returning to live with
              their parents and also create a demand for Second Units. With allowable square footages of up to 1200 square
              feet, Second Units in Monte Sereno can easily accommodate a range of multi-generational housing options.
         4.   Monte Sereno is the ideal community for a Second Unit Program
              Monte Sereno’s stock of large homes and large lots is the perfect environment for creating Second Units. Unlike
              other communities with small lot sizes and traffic/parking issues, Monte Sereno can easily accommodate Second
              Units without engendering some of the neighborhood issues that other communities encounter with Second Unit
              programs. Further, by adding small rental units to neighborhoods of large homeowner-occupied units, the
              Second Unit strategy leads to more ecological (and fiscal) sustainability by relying on existing infrastructure in a
              community otherwise unlikely to redevelop.
         5.   Second Units have consistently been affordable units
              From 2007-2014, approximately 75% of the Second Units built in the City have been affordable to very low and
              low income households. This historical data, and the experience of other cities, confirms that Second Units
              developed in the 2015-2023 time frame will be affordable. Applying the 75% figure to the 46 unit objective of the
              Second Unit Program, it is estimated that 35 of those units will be affordable to very low and low income
              households, matching the RHNA for very low and low income units.
In summary, all of the factors noted above demonstrate that the City can achieve its goal of at least 46 Second Units, if not
more, by 2023. The City is committed to monitoring the Second Unit program and its effectiveness on a regular basis in order
to achieve this goal. Program H-2.3 as described in the following section of this document, outlines a plan of action whereby
the City in 2017 will evaluate the progress in meeting the RHNA lower income goals and take immediate steps if certain
milestones are not met. This action reflects the City’s commitment to provide and facilitate opportunities for affordable
housing in the Monte Sereno community.
                                                                                                                           60

  SECTION 7: HOUSING PROGRAM STRATEGY
A. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Programs
  Following are the goals, policies, programs and quantified objectives for the City’s 2015-2023 housing strategy.
  Goals determine what should be done, and where. Policies and programs establish who will carry out the goals, how and
  when. Quantified objectives are required by Government Code to “establish the maximum number of housing units by
  income category that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over a five year time period.” Quantified objectives are
  noted for those programs where goals/objectives are specific and can be measured. Not all programs will have quantified
  objectives.
  The Goals, Policies and Programs adopted in the 2009-2014 Monte Sereno Housing Element have basically been retained.
  However, based on the City’s experience and success since then, some have been removed, others have been added, and text
  wording has been revised in some instances. (See Section 8: Appendix of this document for the full text of the 2009-2014
  goals, policies and programs.)
  GOAL H-1            PROVIDE HOUSING CONSISTENT WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE COMMUNITY.
  Policy H-1.1        Ensure that new residential development is compatible with the existing neighborhood character.
  Policy H-1.2        Require that residential development is well-integrated into the natural environment and physical landscape
                      of the site.
  Policy H-1.3        Ensure that new residential development preserves valued scenic qualities such as hills, ridgelines and views
                      and mitigates adverse visual impacts to the extent possible.
  Program H-1.1       Continue to require Site Development Permit approval for all new homes and to require project
                      consistency with the City Design Guidelines.

                      Quantified Objective: 10 above moderate income units
  GOAL H-2            CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL HOUSING TO MEET THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS OF ALL INCOME GROUPS IN
                      MONTE SERENO.
  Policy H-2.1        Encourage the construction of new Second Units through incentives, regulatory relief and increased public
                      outreach to meet the need for lower income housing in the City.
  Policy H-2.2        Remove constraints to the production and availability of housing, consistent with other General Plan
                      policies.
  Policy H-2.3        Expedite the review process, where appropriate, for special needs housing and affordable housing for
                      extremely low, very low, low- and moderate-income households.
  Policy H-2.4        Ensure that sites are provided as needed for a variety of housing types for all income levels.
                                                                                                                             61

Program H-2.1 The City will continue to administer and improve the Second Unit Program in order to encourage the
              construction of additional Second Units affordable to lower income households. Specific tasks that the City
              will undertake include:
                    Continue to survey affordability and use of Second Units at time of construction as well as
                       conduct a survey of existing Second Units at least twice during the Planning Period to determine
                       affordability and use of the unit. The first survey and results of that survey shall be completed by
                       the end of 2017.
                    Revise the approval process for Second Units so that it is ministerial, rather than discretionary,
                    publicize incentives for construction of new Second Units with a systematic approach utilizing all
                       forms of media and outreach, such as City’s website and email notification system, articles in
                       printed media as well as social media platforms, written information available at City Hall and
                       Planning Department counter, outreach to building contractors/architects, etc.,
                    continue the Second Unit amnesty program,
                    review and revise Second Unit Program to remove constraints to Second Unit development, such
                       as reducing setback requirements for Second Units in all R-1 zones and eliminating the existing
                       policy in the R-1-8 zone that deducts Second Unit square footage from the allowable maximum
                       size of the principal dwelling on lots of less than 12,000 square feet;
                    explore other innovative uses of Second Units such as providing housing for multi-generational
                       uses (small families, aging in place, etc.) and develop programs as feasible, and
                    further amend the Second Unit Program, such as by permitting junior second units, if necessary to
                       achieve RHNA production goals.
              Responsibility: City Staff and Council
              Time Frame:
              2015-2016:
              Approve Program amendments to remove identified constraints to Second Unit production, especially
              reducing setback requirement in all R-1 zones and eliminating square footage deduction in R-1-8 zoned
              properties.
              Revise approval process for Second Units so that it is ministerial, rather than discretionary.
              2016-2017:
              Conduct a survey of existing Second Units in order to determine affordability and use of units. Have
              survey results completed by the end of 2017 and utilize information in conjunction with actions in Program
              H-2.3 below to evaluate progress towards achieving RHNA.
              Annually, ongoing through the 2015-2023 planning period for other program actions and tasks
              Quantified Objective: 46 Total New Second Units, as follows:
               11 Extremely Low Income Units
               12 Very Low Income Units

Program H-2.2 The City will explore and implement if appropriate other options to provide additional affordable housing
              opportunities within its existing housing stock. For example, shared housing or renting rooms would be
              most appropriate for a community such as Monte Sereno that has many large housing units capable of
              housing more people. Shared Housing programs match persons needing housing with homeowners and
              others who have space to rent. At a minimum, the City will contact shared housing agencies and publicize
              opportunities to share housing.
              Responsibility: City Staff and Council
              Time Frame: Annually, ongoing through the 2015-2023 planning period
              Quantified Objective: 5 Extremely Low and 5 Very Low Income Persons
Program H-2.3 By the end of 2017, the City will evaluate progress towards meeting its RHNA, in particular new
              construction objectives for extremely low, very low, low and moderate income households. If the City
              determines that fewer than 12 Second Units are constructed every two years, the City will evaluate and
              implement revisions to the Second Unit program to meet the City's objectives. As part of this analysis, the
              City will consider revising its multi-family zoning and density standards. If changes are required that are
              inconsistent with the Housing Element, the City will amend the Housing Element as necessary.
              Responsibility: City Staff and Council
              Time Frame: 2015-2017; and every two years thereafter.
              Quantified Objective: If at least 12 affordable Second Units (25% of total 46 unit objective for the
              planning period) are not approved by the end of 2017, the City will evaluate and implement additional
              changes to the Second Unit ordinance as well as implement site development revisions to provide more
              affordable units. Of the 12 Second Units, at least 75% (9 units) shall be affordable to lower income
              households, reflecting the lower income proportions of the RHNA. If revisions required are inconsistent
              with the Housing Element, the City will amend the Housing Element as necessary.
Program H-2.4 The City will work with nearby communities to explore countywide housing needs and solutions. On an
              annual basis, the City Manager will provide a summary report of activities in cooperation with other
              jurisdictions/agencies to further increase the supply of affordable housing in the County of Santa Clara.
              Also, included in this report will be a description of the City’s efforts to meet its RHNA goals. This
              information will also be included in the City’s annual Housing Element update to HCD.

Program H-2.5 The City will revise the Municipal Code (Section 10.05.045) Public (“P”) zoning district by December 2016
              to allow multifamily residential uses by right on the First Baptist Church site (17765 Daves Avenue).
              Revisions will include development standards that include those described in Section 6 of this document
              (Site Inventory: “Proposed Guidelines for Public/Residential Multi Family Zone First Baptist Church
              Site).” The City will also complete any amendments to the General Plan that may be necessary to allow
              multifamily uses in the Public (“P”) zoning district by December 2016. If the necessary amendments are
              not adopted by December 2016 and not successful in encouraging multi-family development, the City will
              provide alternate multi-family residential opportunities and will amend the Housing Element as necessary to
              correct any inconsistencies.
              Further, in conjunction with Program H-4.1, the City will make specific outreach with developers of
              housing affordable to lower income and special need households, including incentives such as density
              bonuses, fee waivers or other incentives. The City will also assist with identifying and/or applying for
              project funding from other sources including, but not limited to, CDBG and HOME funds, at the request
              of the developer.

Description of Second Unit Verification Process:
The City began conducting real time surveys in 2013, either in person or over the phone, of secondary dwelling unit permit holders during the permitting process. This was
done to specifically document the affordability and occupancy of the unit at that time.
Affordability limits used in the survey correlate with the affordability limits published annually by the State. Affordability limits are based on the number of bedrooms in the
unit and median income levels in Santa Clara County. Based on these limits and the number of the bedrooms in the secondary dwelling unit the City uses the survey to
determine which income category the unit best fits within.
In 2012 the City conducted a secondary dwelling unit survey of all secondary dwelling unit holders. The results from this survey provided the City with aggregate data. The
data showed that over two-thirds of occupied one-bedroom units qualify as very low or low income units; while 60 percent of two-bedroom units qualify as very low or low
income units. These survey results were a one time survey and should be considered in light of the overall data from 2007-2014, which shows that 75% of Second Units
were affordable to lower income households.
As with all dwelling units constructed, the City cannot require homes to be rented or occupied on a permanent basis. This rule applies to second units, single-family homes,
and multifamily housing. The City is required to adopt planning and zoning standards permitting enough dwelling units to meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation.
Process for calculation of Second Unit Rents:
1. Use State Median incomes for Santa Clara County from HCD Memo, State Income Limits for 2014 (California Code of Regulations, Title 25, § 6932).                   See Table on
previous page for specific limits by household size.
2. Assume household size of 1 person for studio unit; 2 persons for 1-bedroom unit; 3 persons for 2-bedroom unit.
3. Calculate maximum rents based on Health & Safety Code Section 50053(b), as follows:
            Extremely low income maximum rent = 30% of 30% of median income for assumed household size, divided by 12.
            Very low income maximum rent = 30% of 50% of median income for assumed household size, divided by 12.
            Low income maximum rent = 30% of 60% of median income for assumed household size, divided by 12.
            Moderate income maximum rent = 30% of 110% of median income for assumed household size.
                                                                                                                                                                           80

Appendix C. Why are Second Units a Vital and Necessary Component of Monte Sereno’s Housing Program?
 Second Units, defined as a self-contained dwelling unit, complete with its own kitchen and at least one bathroom, is located
 on the same property as a single-family house, and is significantly smaller than the main dwelling unit. The Second Unit can be
 either attached to the main unit or detached.
 In communities such as Monte Sereno, Second Units can be an effective and vital component of the City’s housing strategy.
 Monte Sereno is a well-established community with scarce land availability, very high housing costs and limited public funding
 for housing programs. However, the existing land patterns and housing types are very conducive to a successful Second Unit
 program. Minimum lot sizes are larger than average in Monte Sereno thereby providing more opportunities for the
 construction of Second Units.
 Several recent articles and papers have established the importance and effectiveness of Second Units in communities such as
 Monte Sereno and in the San Francisco Bay area. The first article, published in the Journal of Urbanism: International
 Research on Placemaking and Urban Sustainability (“Hidden density in single-family neighborhoods: backyard cottages as an
 equitable smart growth strategy,” February 2014), provides data research on Second Units in the San Francisco Bay area. One
 of the conclusions of the article is
           Secondary units, or apartments added to low-density residential properties via either micro-infill or the partitioning of existing structures
           can potentially add as much or more density, at a fraction of the cost, as large scale development. Because secondary unit development is
           readily implementable in higher-income neighborhoods, the strategy contributes to neighborhood diversity and helps meet fair housing goals.
           By adding small rental units to neighborhoods dominated by large homeowner-occupied units, the strategy provides flexibility. For instance,
           more families are able to age in place. This in turn leads to more ecological (and fiscal) sustainability by relying on existing infrastructure
           in places otherwise unlikely to redevelop (Page 308).
 The article further concludes that:
           Backyard cottages (Second Units), then, could yield infill housing production levels exceeding the results of an aggressive conventional infill
           scenario that would take decades to realize. What is more, unlike market rate multi family development, backyard cottage projects require
           comparatively small injections of capital (frequently under US $100,000, as compared with millions of dollars for even a small five-unit
           project), and can be easily completed within a year. By contrast, multifamily projects take several years from conception to planning (Page
           316).
 In addition to addressing the effectiveness of Second Units in land utilization, the article
 also provides insight into the affordability of Second Units.
           Secondary units appear to be considerably likelier to bolster income diversity through addition to the stock of modestly priced rental
           apartments in high-opportunity neighborhoods than are other types of unsubsidized rental housing. In addition, and unlike absentee-owned
           rental housing, secondary units have the potential to provide an income stream to existing homeowners. Thus, in addition to facilitating the
           entry of non-affluent residents into otherwise unattainable neighborhoods, secondary units can further contribute to income diversity by
           helping existing homeowners age in place even amidst transformative life events such as job loss, retirement, and health setbacks (Page
           320).
 Another recent research paper also validates the importance of Second Units in providing affordable housing opportunities. A
 task force of communities (“21 Elements”) in the County of San Mateo produced a research paper titled “Affordability of
 Secondary Dwelling Units” (April, 2014). Their study assessed the affordability of secondary dwelling units throughout San
 Mateo County (located adjacent to Santa Clara County) and, in particular secondary dwelling units in the Town of
 Hillsborough. Hillsborough is very similar to Monte Sereno in terms of household income levels, type of housing stock and
 housing costs. The study found very high levels of affordability for existing second units, such as:
            Approximately 60% of secondary units are affordable to Extremely Low Income households,
            An additional approximately 10% of secondary units are affordable to Very Low Income households,
            Another approximately 15% of secondary units are affordable to Low Income households, and
            Approximately 10% more of secondary units are affordable to Moderate Income households.
  The report also concluded that the results noted above are “most applicable to wealthier communities where secondary units
 are more likely to be available to domestic help or family members at free or heavily subsidized rates.”
                                                                                                                                                 81

Both of the studies referenced above support the City of Monte Sereno’s decision to utilize Second Units as its primary
strategy to produce lower income housing. Because of the lack of commercial services and limited public transportation in
Monte Sereno, sites in the City will compete poorly for tax credits, the chief source of financing for affordable multifamily
housing. Unsubsidized multifamily construction will not be affordable to lower income households. Second Units have been
demonstrated to not only succeed in efficient utilization of available land and infrastructure but can also add much
needed housing units at a faster rate and a more affordable price than conventional multi-family housing units.

Appendix F. Underdeveloped Land Inventory
 Monte Sereno is an established community with limited development opportunities. The only lands available to accommodate
 the City’s share of the Regional Housing Need are underdeveloped parcels. Market conditions such as high land and
 construction costs, combined with a limited supply of available and developable land and a high demand for housing in the
 community suggest conditions are favorable for redevelopment of existing underutilized land. "Teardowns" are relatively
 common in the community, and, where the location of an existing home poses a constraint to the development of additional
 lots, the market value of the additional lots would likely compensate for the need to rebuild the home.
 The City has identified five sites that are underutilized and available for redevelopment. Although these sites are developed
 with existing residential or institutional uses, the existing uses are not considered to be a constraint to new residential
 development due to their age, their poor or fair condition, room for additional development on the site, and/or the developer
 interest that has been expressed in redeveloping the sites.
 The five sites include:

          *Proposed zoning modification as described in Program H-2.5 in Section 7 of this document.
 The first four sites are all zoned for R-1 use and all currently have an existing residential unit on the parcel. The table above
 identifies the number of additional units that could be accommodated on the parcels after approval of subdivisions.
 The fifth site is an underdeveloped property located at 17765 Daves Avenue (APN # 410-08-036). The site is flat and is
 approximately 3.48 acres in size. The First Baptist Church is located on the site. The church and related buildings and surface
 parking are located on 2.30 acres of the property and the remaining 1.18 acres are open space areas. The site is zoned for
 “Public” use. Program H-2.5 in the Housing Program Strategy section of this document describes modifying the Public
 zoning category to allow multifamily residential uses by right on this site as long as design and development standards are met.
 The development standards would contain incentives similar to the existing provisions in the R-1-8 and RM Districts and
 would allow clustering of units in one portion of the site. It is also anticipated that the parking standards would be similar to
 the existing RM parking standards. It is estimated that the site could accommodate 15 residential units on the 1.18 acres that is
 currently open space area. This would achieve a net residential density on the developed portion of the site of approximately
 15 units/acre.
 Realistic Capacity Assumptions
 In determining the realistic unit capacity of the five sites, the City reviewed existing uses on the site, the location of the
 existing structures, whether those structures were recently constructed, the slope of the property, subdivision requirements,
 and the allowable density based on the zoning district. The unit calculations were based on the maximum density allowed
 taking into consideration the City’s development standards for the appropriate zone (e.g. setbacks, square footage allowances,
 street and parking requirements, etc.).
 Monte Sereno is a very desirable residential community; consequently, market demand was not considered to be a constraint
 for additional units on the underdeveloped parcels. However, other non-governmental constraints such as the high cost of
 land and construction could influence the further development of these parcels.
 For the purposes of this land inventory, the potential units that could be achieved through a density bonus were not included
 in the realistic unit capacity. Site #5 (APN #410-08-03) is the only site that is likely to request a density bonus. At the time
 that this Land Inventory was prepared, there have been no specific plans submitted for this property and so it is unrealistic to
 consider a density bonus calculation on the site at this time.
 Listed on the following pages are more detailed descriptions of each of the five sites.

Appendix G: Public Participation Process
 As described in Section 2 of this document, there were significant efforts made to engage the community and encourage
 public participation in the Housing Element review process. Information was posted on the City’s website, written and email
 notifications were sent out, specific affordable housing organizations and agencies were notified of public meetings and public
 notices were posted in the local newspaper.
 The following describes the community meeting and public hearings in more detail.
         Community Meeting and Public Hearings
 1. Community Meeting - May 20, 2014
 Presentation and Public Comments
 Members of the City Council and staff were present at the May 20, 2014 meeting as well as several residents and members of
 the public. A PowerPoint presentation was delivered which included:
                 Overview of Housing Element Update process
                 Brief Summary of Housing Element Components
                 Current Housing Element Programs and Accomplishments
                 Possible Strategies for 2015-2023
                 Next Steps
 As part of the PowerPoint presentation, the following observations were noted:
                 Monte Sereno’s population is older than most of the County and the proportion of 60+ yrs. persons will
                     probably continue to increase.
                 Approximately 48% of Monte Sereno households are families without children.
                 Monte Sereno is generally a wealthy community, but approximately 16% of households are lower income.
                     This is an increase from the year 2000 when 13% of all households were lower income.
                 Housing values and costs are high and will probably continue to increase.
 Following the presentation, members of the audience were invited to provide comments. A flip chart was used to record
 comments. The following was recorded on the flip chart:
                1. Providing “offsets” as a mechanism to provide affordable housing
                2. Encouraging more multi-generational housing
                3. Providing affordable housing is difficult when market conditions (housing and land costs) are prohibitive
                4. Affordable housing is a regional responsibility
                5. Second Unit Program needs to be evaluated and possibly modified
 These comments were considered during the preparation of the Draft Housing Element Update (August, 2014). The
 response to each of the comments is as follows:
      1. Providing “offsets” as a mechanism to provide affordable housing
      This comment was basically a question as to whether affordable housing could be produced using an “offset.” The
      example given was how water districts in California were allowing additional development if the developer could provide
      proof of “offsets” such as replacing lawn/turf area, water saving toilets, etc.    With affordable housing, this type of
      process becomes more problematic. The closest example might be Inclusionary Housing Programs, where developers
      can either pay a fee into an affordable housing fund or actually develop affordable housing units. This type of program
      really only works where there is a possibility for substantial amounts of potential residential development. In a fully
      established and built out community such as Monte Sereno, most of the estimated new construction projects are very
      small in scale and limited in number.
                                                                                                                          92

                                                                                                           CITY OF MONTE SERENO
                                                                                                                    GENERAL PLAN
                                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT 2015-2023
     2. Encouraging more multi-generational housing
     A commenter noted that the East Coast of the U.S. had housing units that encouraged multi-generational housing and
     that might be a good example for Monte Sereno. Indeed, multi-generational housing is becoming more popular,
     especially as the aging population and “boomerang” children are becoming more a part of family households. As a
     response to this comment, the Draft Housing Element Update includes both the Second Unit Program (Program H-2.1)
     and the Shared Housing Program (Program H.2-2). Both of these programs encourage the provision of housing
     units/rooms to additional household members, such as aging parents, boomerang “kids” or children and grandchildren.
     3. Providing affordable housing is difficult when market conditions (housing and land costs) are prohibitive
     The Draft Housing Element acknowledges that housing and land costs are expensive in Monte Sereno. Home sales
     prices are in the median range of $2 million dollars. When rentals are available in Monte Sereno, rental costs are
     estimated to be unaffordable. Vacant/underdeveloped land is also expensive. Unfortunately, there is little to nothing
     that a local government can do in regards to changing market conditions.
     4. Affordable housing is a regional responsibility
     One commenter noted that the responsibility for providing affordable housing is a regional responsibility. The Draft
     Housing Element acknowledges this in two ways. First, the Draft utilizes the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
     (RHNA) developed by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The RHNA uses goals for statewide housing
     production and distributes those goals on a regional level to local communities. Second, the Draft also includes Program
     # H-2.4 which requires the City Manager to provide a summary report annually of activities in cooperation with other
     jurisdictions to further increase the supply of affordable housing in Santa Clara County.
     5. Second Unit Program needs to be evaluated and possibly modified
    A member of the audience made several comments in regards to the existing Second Unit Program. The comments
    included a concern that the existing program did not accurately collect/analyze data regarding affordability or production.
    These comments were considered as part of the Update process. General policies of the existing Second Unit Program
    were reviewed. Section 4 of the Draft Housing Element includes a review and evaluation of programs during the 2009-
    2014 period, including the Second Unit Program. This Section of the Housing Element Draft notes that several
    substantive changes were made to the Second Unit Program during the 2009-2014 time period including:
          increasing the maximum size of a second unit to 1200 square feet,
          eliminating the covered parking requirement,
          providing incentives to the Second Unit Program, such as fee reductions and fast tracking,
          revising the method in which information is collected, and
          initiating an amnesty program.
     Further, the Appendix to the Housing Element Update includes Section B, which contains the procedures by which
     affordable rents and household incomes are calculated for the Second Unit Program.
Generally, the primary discussion item was the City’s existing Second Unit program. In addition, recent revisions to the City’s
multi-family land use and zoning were discussed. Comments were noted and considered during the update process of this
Housing Element.
                                                                                                                         93

2. Public Hearing (Draft Housing Element) - October 7, 2014
A Public Hearing was held on October 7, 2014 to review and receive comments on the draft Element. The only oral
comment was made by representatives of Hacienda Realty, LLC and note was made of the letter sent on that same day from
Wendel, Rosen, Black & Dean LLP on behalf of Russel Stanley and Hacienda Realty, LLC. There were no other written
comments.
The City reviewed the letter after receiving it and following is the City’s response to those comments
1. Public Participation
The 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element was released for public review on September 5, 2014. An electronic copy of the draft
document was posted on the City’s website at that time and a hard copy was available at City Hall for public review. The
September 5 release provided a 32 day period for the public to review the document before the October 7, 2014 City Council
meeting. The City also provided notice of the draft Housing Element and October 7, 2014 meeting to individuals on the
City’s email list as well the following organizations/agencies:
Neighborhood Housing Services Silicon Valley
Housing Trust of Silicon Valley
Project Sentinel
Council on Aging Silicon Valley
Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County
Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley
County of Santa Clara Planning Department
Public Interest Law Firm, San Jose
These agencies were also sent notice of the May 20, 2014 community meeting.            The City has received no comments from
them.
Regarding Footnote # 1, the draft Housing Element was originally scheduled to be reviewed at the City Council’s September
2, 2014 meeting but was re-scheduled for October 7, 2014. This information has since been corrected in the draft Housing
Element.
2. Streamline Review
The City of Monte Sereno has requested that HCD conduct a streamline review of the 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element.
The City has acted to meet all of the requirements for a streamlined review, including the following:
       revised Municipal Code to provide for “reasonable accommodation” procedures for persons with disabilities (March
           2011),
       revised Municipal Code to allow residential care homes, supportive housing and transitional housing as a use “by
           right” in residential districts (May 2012),
       adopted a Density Bonus Program, which was developed pursuant to State Government Code (June 2012), and
       revised Municipal Code to allow Emergency Shelters as a use “by right” in areas zoned as public (June 2012).
In reference to rezoning, the HCD streamlining template asks “If a local government’s previous housing element included a
rezone program pursuant to GC Sections 65583(c), 65583.2 and 65584.09 to address a shortfall of adequate sites, has the
program(s) to rezone been completed?” Monte Sereno’s 2009-2014 Housing Element did not identify a shortfall of adequate
sites. In fact, the adequate sites analysis on pages 51-55 of the 2009-2014 Draft Housing Element demonstrates adequate sites
for the City’s RHNA and an additional “surplus” of 12 more units. Therefore, specific programs to rezone land are not an
issue and Monte Sereno is eligible to submit a request for a streamlined review.
In regard to achieving quantified objectives, Section 4 of the 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element, beginning on page 15,
contains a thorough review and analysis of the quantified objectives as identified in the 2009-2014 Housing Element.
                                                                                                                          94

                                                                                                                 GENERAL PLAN
                                                                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT 2015-2023
3. Multi Family Housing Program
Program H-3.10 in the 2009-2014 Housing Element describes the process whereby the City will evaluate parcels in the sphere
of influence and by a certain date establish “zoning to allow multi family development.” In 2013, the City adopted a new
multi-family zoning designation, RM-Multi Family Residential District. This zoning designation is described on page 19 of the
2015-2023 Draft Housing Element and in Section 5 of the Final Housing Element.
As required by State Housing Element Law, the 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element includes a review and evaluation of the
2009-2014 Housing Element programs and goals (Section 4, beginning on page 15). This review indicates that the City
achieved 73% of its RHNA goals for the 2009-2014 period. The majority of units produced during this time period were
Second Units. The City revised the Second Unit Program several times during 2009-2014 in order to encourage the
production of Second Units. The review of the Second Unit Program in Section 4 concludes that the Second Unit Program
has been effective in producing new units at affordable levels and should continue to be implemented in the 2015-2023 time
frame. In fact, the 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element also includes reference materials in the Appendix describing the
importance of the Second Units as a vital and necessary component of Monte Sereno’s Housing Program. The review and
evaluation of the 2009-2014 Housing Element was conducted as directed on page 2 of HCD’s January 22, 2014 letter.
As further assurance that the City is addressing its RHNA objectives, Program H-2.3 in the 2015-2023 Draft Housing
Element commits the City in 2017 to review its progress towards meeting the RHNA.
 4. Multi Family Zoning Within the City
Government Code Section 65583 (c) refers to Housing Element requirements to include an implementation plan with specific
objectives, time frames and programs. The 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element includes such an implementation plan, which
is described fully in Section 7, “Housing Program Strategy.”
5. Rezone Sites to Meet Affordable Housing Obligation
The statement that the 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element “double counts” units in the RHNA analysis is not correct. The
methodology used to determine RHNA production from 2009-2014 (Table HE-5 on page 17) and RHNA objectives for
2014-2023 (Table HE-11 on page 29) was reviewed and approved in September 2014 by staff at HCD. However, in the Final
Element, units built in 2014 will only be used in evaluating 2014-2023 RHNA production.
In regards to the reference to Government Code 65584.09 (AB 1233), this section of the Code applies to communities that:
                  failed to adopt a Housing Element in the prior planning period, or
                  adopted a Housing Element found out of compliance by HCD due to failure to substantially comply with
                       the adequate sites requirement, or
                  failed to implement the adequate sites programs identified in the Housing Element within the planning
                       period, or
                  failed to identify or make available adequate sites to accommodate the RHNA.
None of these scenarios apply to Monte Sereno. Monte Sereno’s current Housing Element (2009-2014) was adopted by the
City and found to be in compliance with State Housing Element law by HCD. The 2009-2014 Housing Element identified
adequate sites for the RHNA (pages 51-55). The adequate sites analysis included the Second Unit Program and land
availability for single-family units. Table HE-12 on page 55 of the 2009-2014 Housing Element provides quantified objectives
by household income levels towards meeting and, in fact, exceeding the RHNA.
6. Second Unit Program
Pages 31-33 of the 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element includes a thorough evaluation of the City’s Second Unit Program and
also includes summaries of other documents which evaluate Second Unit Programs (i.e. County of San Mateo “21 Elements”
and Journal of Urbanism, February 2014 article in the document’s Appendix). This additional documentation reflects Monte
Sereno’s understanding of Second Unit programs and their ability to create affordable dwelling units. Hence, the City has
committed to continuing its Second Unit Program as a critical component of its overall Housing Program Strategy.
In regards to comments regarding the documentation of affordability of second units, Appendix B of the 2015-2023 Draft
Housing Element identifies household income limits, second unit affordable rents and formulas used for calculation of
affordable rents. The City has continued to revise and improve its recordkeeping system and maintains documentation of
initial rents for all Second Units as they are approved in Monte Sereno.
                                                                                                                      95

7. Governmental Constraints
The 2015-2023 Draft Housing Element includes a discussion of the EIR and pre-zoning of the Hacienda site on pages 21-22
in the Governmental Constraints section. The Final Housing Element includes an expanded discussion of governmental
constraints.
3. Public Hearing (Final Draft Housing Element) February 17, 2015
A public hearing on the Final Draft Housing Element was held before the Monte Sereno City Council on February 17, 2015.
Notice of the public hearing was released to the public on February 6, 2015 and a copy of the Final Draft Housing Element
was available on the City’s web site on February 9, 2015. Written copies of the Final Draft Housing Element were also
available at City Hall on February 9, 2015. Notices of the public hearing were also sent to all of those on the City’s email
server list as well as the housing organizations listed in Appendix E of this document. Further, there was written public notice
in the local newspaper on February 6 and 13, 2015.
At the February 17, 2015 public hearing, several people presented oral testimony regarding the draft Element and there were 3
written letters submitted. The majority of written and oral comments concerned the proposed modification of the Municipal
Code to allow residential multi-family use on the First Baptist Church property on Daves Avenue. After closing the public
hearing, Council members discussed the concerns noted during public testimony. After their discussion, the City Council
then voted to approve the Final Draft Element as presented and to send it to HCD for their review.
4. Public Hearing (Revised Final Draft Housing Element- dated May, 2015) May 19, 2015
A public hearing of the revised Final Draft Housing Element was held on May 19, 2015. The revisions included in the May
Revised Final Draft included changes or additions to the text in response to comments received from HCD. City staff and
consultants discussed potential revisions with HCD staff in a telephone conference call on April 2, 2015 and later submitted
proposed written revisions on April 17 and 24, 2015 to HCD. After reviewing all proposed revisions, HCD provided a letter
dated April 24, 2015 in which the Final Draft with the revisions as reviewed by HCD was found to be conditionally in
compliance.
On May 1, 2015 the Revised Final Draft Housing Element was posted on the City’s website and public notice was provided to
all organizations/individuals as listed in Appendix E of this document as well as public notice published in the local
newspaper. The public comment period was May 1, 2015 to May 19, 2015.
On May 19, 2015, the public hearing on the Revised Draft Housing Element (and accompanying Mitigated Negative
Declaration) was opened by Mayor Huff and, after a detailed oral staff report, members of the public were invited to provide
comment. Several members of the audience spoke with an equal number of people supporting adoption of the document and
other speakers encouraging additional traffic studies to be completed in regard to the First Baptist Church property. It should
be noted that the traffic comments appeared to be in relation to the traffic studies conducted for the preparation of the
Mitigated Negative Declaration. After closing the public hearing, the City Attorney also reported to the City Council that a
letter had been received at 4:59 PM that day from the Wendel Rosen Law Firm, representing Russ Stanley and Hacienda
Realty, LLC. After members of the City Council provided oral comments, the City Council voted unanimously (5-0) to adopt
the Revised Final Draft Housing Element, dated May 2015.
                                                                                                                        96

5 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide the policy framework for
  regulation and development of the circulation system in Monte Sereno. This Ele-
  ment balances the need to provide safe ways to move people from one place to
  another with the goal of preserving the character of the community and creating a
  walkable and bicycle-friendly city.
  The Circulation Element must be correlated with the Land Use Element. As re-
  quired by Government Code Section 65302(b), this Element contains information
  on the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares
  and transportation routes. State law also requires that a Circulation Element in-
  clude data and policies related to the provision of the public infrastructure. For the
  purposes of this General Plan, these components have been moved to Public Ser-
  vices and Facilities Element.
  A. Background Information
  1. Regional Roadway System
  The regional roads near the borders of Monte Sereno are Highway 9, State Route
  85 and State Route 17, as shown in Figure C-1. Highway 9 becomes Saratoga-Los
  Gatos Road near Monte Sereno, running 11 miles from the Santa Cruz County line
  through Saratoga and Monte Sereno to the Los Gatos city limit. State Route 85,
  also called Highway 85, runs from downtown Mountain View through the northern
  border of Monte Sereno to San Jose. State Route 17, locally referred to as Highway
  17, runs between San Jose and Santa Cruz, often carrying commuter and holiday
  traffic.
  2. Local Street Classification Setting
  There are three types of roads in Monte Sereno: thoroughfares, collectors, and
  local streets. Thoroughfares are roadways that accommodate higher volumes of
  traffic at higher speeds, and connect Monte Sereno with adjacent communities.
  The three thoroughfares in Monte Sereno are Highway 9, Winchester Boulevard
  and Quito Road. Collector and local streets are designed for internal circulation
  within Monte Sereno and accommodate lower volumes and vehicle speeds. Figure
  C-1 shows the location of these types of streets along with local streets that are
  privately owned and not maintained by the City.
                                                                                     97

3. Level of Service Definitions
The operation of the roadway facilities is described with the term level of service
(LOS). LOS is a qualitative description of traffic flow based on such factors as
speed, travel time, delay and freedom to maneuver. Six levels are defined from
LOS A, the best operating conditions, to LOS F, the worst operating conditions.
LOS E represents “at capacity” operations. When volumes exceed capacity, stop
and go conditions result and operations are designated as LOS F. Table C-1 pro-
vides a description of each LOS for intersections in Monte Sereno.

4. Public Transit
Transit service in Santa Clara County is provided by the Santa Clara Valley Trans-
portation Authority (VTA). The VTA is also responsible for congestion manage-
ment, transit planning and some highway improvement projects. The basic transit
services currently available in Santa Clara County are the VTA light rail service and
regular, express and commuter bus routes.
                                                                                        99

Local Bus Line #48 runs through Monte Sereno with stops along Winchester
Boulevard. Although the VTA light rail does not run through Monte Sereno, the
closest light rail station stop is Winchester station at the southern end of the Moun-
tain View-Winchester line. The Winchester Station is located in Campbell, north-
west of Monte Sereno; a park-and-ride lot is available at the station. VTA also has
plans to extend the Mountain View-Winchester line to Los Gatos. Funding for this
rail extension has not yet been identified.
5. Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
As shown in Figure C-2, portions of Daves Avenue, Winchester Boulevard and
Poppy Lane as well as an extension from Eaton Lane have Class II dedicated bicy-
cle lanes. Class II bicycle lanes are paved facilities on the outer edge of a road that
are reserved for the exclusive use of bicycles. No other roads in Monte Sereno
have bicycle lanes, though the low levels of traffic on most streets allow for bicycles
to safely use local streets that do not have dedicated bicycle facilities.
Other types of bicycle facilities include Class I bicycle paths, which are paved facili-
ties that are completely separated from the road by space or a physical barrier, and
Class III bicycle routes, which are typically indicated by signs only and do not nec-
essarily include extra pavement width. Currently there are no Class I or Class III
bicycle facilities in Monte Sereno. The three types of bicycle facilities are summa-
rized in Table C-2.

  Class III bicycle routes
                                     include extra pavement width
Due to the rural-residential character of Monte Sereno, most streets in the city do
not have sidewalks. The only sidewalks in the city are located in the same places as
the bicycle lanes, as shown in Figure C-2, above.

An important issue for bicyclists and pedestrians is the safety of the Highway 9
corridor. The corridor is a popular route for bicyclists, but the design of roadway
and speed of traffic creates dangerous conditions for non-motorized forms of
transportation. To address these issues, Monte Sereno has partnered with the City
of Saratoga, the Town of Los Gatos and Caltrain on the Highway 9 Bicycle/Pedestrian
Improvement Project. The purpose of this project is to improve bicycle and pedestrian
safety along the portion of Highway 9 that runs through the participating jurisdic-
tions. Alternative designs for bicycle and pedestrian facilities along the corridor are
currently being evaluated as part of the project.
6. Scenic Roads
Highway 9 is officially designated a California State Scenic Highway. State Scenic
Highways are roadway corridors of outstanding natural beauty that are subject to
special regulations that preserve and enhance the scenic quality of the corridor.
Highway 9 starts at Skyline Boulevard in Santa Cruz County and runs through a
forested landscape, an abandoned pear-apple orchard farm, and later joins the Sara-
toga-Los Gatos Road at Blaney Plaza in the City of Saratoga.

6 OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Open Space and Conservation Element is to protect the natural
  environment, promote climate protection and ensure the preservation of open
  space land in and around Monte Sereno. This Element seeks to maintain the low
  density, residential character of the community and its high quality of life by pre-
  serving open spaces, protecting natural resource, reducing the impacts of global
  warming and providing recreational opportunities for city residents.
  This Element combines two State-mandated elements, the Open Space Element
  and the Conservation Element. The focus of the Open Space Element is the man-
  agement of open space resources, including cultural resources. Open space is de-
  fined as any parcel or area of public or private land or water that is essentially un-
  improved and undeveloped. State law identifies several types of open space, in-
  cluding Open space that 1) preserves natural resources, 2) manages production of
  natural resources, 3) provides outdoor recreation and 4) protects public health and
  safety.
  Similarly, the Conservation Element is concerned with the protection of natural
  resources, including plants and animal wildlife, water bodies, watersheds, forests,
  soils, minerals and energy conservation. Included in this element are goals and
  policies to reduce impacts to global warming caused by the release of greenhouse
  gases.
  A. Background Information
  1. Climate Protection
  Monte Sereno believes that global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions is a
  serious issue requiring immediate action. According to the California Climate
  Change Center, continued global warming is expected to result in significant im-
  pacts to California, such as substantial loss of snow-pack, a substantially increased
  risk of large wildfires, and reductions in the quality and quantity of agriculture
  products.
  Global warming is caused by the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon diox-
  ide and methane into the atmosphere. Monte Sereno directly contributes to global
  warming by its household usage of energy, vehicle trips, construction activities and
  the energy used in the operation of government and educational facilities.
  The City of Monte Sereno is committed to taking action to reduce greenhouse gas
  emissions and increase energy efficiency. On June 17, 2008 the City Council
                                                                                    107

G E N E R A L P L A N
O P E N S P A C E A N D C O N S E R V A T I O N        E L E M E N T
adopted Resolution 3304, which establishes Monte Sereno as a partner in the
ICLEI Cities and Counties Climate Protection Program. As a member of ICLEI,
Monte Sereno pledges to take a leadership role in promoting public awareness
about the causes and impacts of climate change. As stewards of climate protection,
the City will establish a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and will develop
an action plan to meet this target. With these goals in mind, Monte Sereno has
established a “Build it Green” checklist which is required for all new residential
development, and requires that all new public buildings be LEED certified.
The State of California also has taken several recent steps to address global warm-
ing. In 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger issued Executive Order S-3-05, which
officially recognized California’s vulnerability to global warming and set greenhouse
gas emission reduction targets for the state. A year later the Governor signed AB
32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which requires California
to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The legislation also
encourages entities to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions prior to 2012 by
offering credits for early voluntary reductions.
2. Watershed
Monte Sereno is part of the Guadalupe Watershed, managed under the Santa Clara
Valley Water District. The Guadalupe Watershed is 170 square miles in area and
includes the cities of San Jose, Campbell and Santa Clara, and the Town of Los
Gatos. The creeks located in the Guadalupe Watershed are the Guadalupe, Los
Gatos, Ross, Alamitos and Canoas creeks. Surface water in the Guadalupe Water-
shed ultimately flows into the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay.
3. Water Quality
The Santa Clara Valley Water District is the primary steward of water quality in the
Guadalupe watershed. The District protects water quality through creek restora-
tion programs, grants to community organization and other education and outreach
programs. One of the primary water quality issues in the Guadalupe watershed is
mercury toxicity that resulted from mining operations during the California Gold
Rush. The Water District oversees ongoing efforts to study and reduce mercury
levels found in streams and other water bodies throughout the watershed.
In Monte Sereno, water quality can be adversely impacted when stormwater runoff
contains toxic materials or other harmful substances. Common sources for these
harmful substances in Monte Sereno include motorized vehicles, household chemi-
cals and sediment discharge from construction activities.

4. Parks and Open Space
There are approximately 70 acres of privately-owned open space land in Monte
Sereno. The City itself, however, does not own or manage public parkland. Instead,
Monte Sereno residents utilize parks in neighboring Los Gatos and Saratoga as well
as Vasona Lake County Park, a 150-acre park including the Los Gatos Creek Park-
way located just east of the city. Southwest of Monte Sereno is the El Sereno Open
Space Preserve, a 1,412-acre preserve with hiking, biking and equestrian trails.
Monte Sereno has historically contributed Proposition 40 money to neighboring
communities and expects to continue to do so in the future.
5. Biological Resources
The California Department of Fish and Game maintains the California Natural
Database (CNDDB), which tracks the location and condition of California’s rare
animals, plants and natural habitats. A search of the database was completed for
Monte Sereno and a one-mile radius around the city to identify rare and sensitive
species and habitats with the potential to occur in Monte Sereno. Table OS-1 lists
the rare and sensitive species and communities that may occur within and near the
city.
Creeks in Monte Sereno provide important riparian habitat for a variety of plant
and animal species. In addition to providing natural habitat, well established vege-
tation along the waterways plays an important role in controlling erosion.
Oak woodlands provide additional important habitat for sensitive plant and animal
species in Monte Sereno. Oak woodland is found primarily in Monte Sereno’s un-
developed open space. The City attempts to preserve existing oak woodlands to
the greatest extent possible, especially when reviewing proposals for new develop-
ment.
6. Cultural Resources
The environmental setting in Monte Sereno includes properties with historic and
architectural significance. Properties in Monte Sereno are identified as historic
through either the National Register of Historic Places or local designation. The
following four Monte Sereno properties are designated as historic resources:
   Steinbeck House 16250 Greenwood Lane in which American author John
      Steinbeck wrote the Grapes of Wrath. This property is listed on the National
      Register of Historic Places.
   17981 Saratoga-Los Gatos Road.
                                                                                109

    17940 Saratoga-Los Gatos Road.
    17985 Saratoga-Los Gatos Road.
Archeological remains from Native American inhabitants may also be present in
Monte Sereno. These remains are often found in the alluvial areas near streams
and other water bodies although the City has no documented findings of such ar-
cheological remains.

7. Other Important Resources
The City of Monte Sereno does not contain any designated important mineral re-
sources that need to be protected pursuant to State law. In addition, due to the
mainly developed nature of the community, there is no on-going agricultural or
lumber production within the city. The State has not identified any important
farmlands within Monte Sereno that are in need of conservation.

The Santa Clara County Valley Water District and San Jose Water provide water
service to Monte Sereno. The District is responsible for designing and building
local water reservoirs and water distribution facilities and operating water treatment
plants. The District then sells treated water to local water retail agencies that serve
communities using their own distribution systems. San Jose Water Company is the

WVC&R is a joint venture between Green Team of San Jose and Green Waste.
Solid waste is picked up Monday through Friday weekly, depending on the Monte
Sereno neighborhood. Paper, plastic, metal, glass and green waste, such as lawn
trimmings, can be recycled. All recyclables collected are transmitted to the Material
Recovery Facility located in San Jose, where they are sorted and processed into new
materials. E-waste is not collected by WVC&R at this time but may be dropped off
by residents at the Material Recovery Facility.

               covering full actual costs from the US Postal Service contract
               payments.
Goal PS-3      Ensure that providing services and infrastructure for
               new development or annexation does not create an
               unreasonable cost burden for existing residents.
Policies
Policy PS-3.1  Require that services and facilities for new development or an-
               nexation are paid for by developers or property owners and not
               existing residents.
                                                                                123

8 HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT
  The Health and Safety Element provides information about risks in Monte Sereno
  due to natural and man-made hazards. The Element contains goals, policies and
  actions designed to protect the community and its property from fire, seismic,
  flooding and toxic material hazards. This Element also addresses noise within the
  community and general emergency and disaster preparedness.
  As required by State law, the Health and Safety Element addresses the protection
  of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the impacts of:
      Fires.
      Geologic and seismic hazards, including earthquake faults and ground shaking
       hazards.
      Flood hazards, including localized flooding, 100 year flooding and dam failure.
      Hazardous materials.
      Air Quality.
      General emergency and disaster preparedness.
  State law also mandates that a City’s General Plan address current and foreseeable
  noise impacts. As noted above, noise is not contained in a stand-alone element but
  is addressed in this Health and Safety Element.
  A. Background Information
  This section contains information on current risks due to natural and man-made
  hazards. Existing noise sources and their projected levels are also addressed in the
  background information section.
  1. Fires
  Open space areas that are heavily vegetated and grassy are especially vulnerable to
  fire hazards. The risk of fire is highest in the steep, heavily vegetated hillside area
  south of Highway 9. The risk of fire is also highest during the summer and fall dry
  seasons. Because most wildfires are caused by people, increased accessibility to fire
  hazard areas further increases the risk of fire. Figure HS-1 identifies the wildfire
  hazard areas in Monte Sereno.
                                                                                     127

G E N E R A L P L A N
H E A L T H A N D S A F E T Y E L E M E N T
To reduce fire hazards, Monte Sereno adopted a weed and brush abatement ordi-
nance in 2007. This ordinance, codified as Municipal Code Section NS-154, broad-
ly defines fire hazards as dry or dead shrubs, dead trees, combustible refuse and
waste, and any vegetation that could pose dangers. Monte Sereno residents are
required by this ordinance to remove and properly dispose of fire hazards from
their property.
2. Seismic Activity
Monte Sereno is located within the seismically active San Francisco Bay region, one
of the most seismically active zones in the United States. The faults in the San
Francisco Bay region are capable of generating earthquakes of at least 8.0 in magni-
tude on the Richter Scale, producing very strong ground shaking in Monte Sereno.
The closest major fault is the San Andreas Fault, which passes through Monte
Sereno’s SOI southwest of Lyndon Canyon and is shown on Figure HS-2. A por-
tion of Monte Sereno also is near the potentially active Shannon Fault, just north of
Monte Sereno in Los Gatos. As a potentially active fault, the Shannon Fault is not
shown on Figure HS-2.
To address these seismic hazards the City requires new construction to be built
using the most recent building codes to minimize potential damage to structures as
a result of an earthquake. Development or substantial renovations in Monte Sere-
no must comply with the Uniform Building Code (UBC), which outlines standards
for seismic design, foundations and drainage and requires that geotechnical engi-
neering studies be undertaken for all major new buildings or earth works.

3. Steep Slopes and Landslides
Landslides resulting from earthquakes are the greatest earthquake hazard concern
for residents of Monte Sereno. According to the County of Santa Clara, approxi-
mately 75 percent of Monte Sereno is located in an area with a high potential for
earthquake induced landslides. Despite this potential, few historic landslides have
been mapped in Monte Sereno. Figure HS-3 identifies incidence of mapped land-
slides in and around Monte Sereno.
4. Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a phenomenon primarily associated with saturated, cohesionless soil
layers located close to the ground surface. During liquefaction, soils lose strength
and ground failure may occur. Since soils must be saturated to be at risk of lique-
faction, areas with high groundwater levels are most susceptible to liquefaction.
Figure HS-4 shows that the majority of the city has a very low potential for lique-
faction. Areas with high liquefaction potential are located along the west border of
the city limit.
5. Flood Hazards
Large-scale flooding is not a significant hazard in Monte Sereno. Most of the
properties in Monte Sereno are built above the base flood elevation. However,
both surface and subsurface local drainage problems do exist in some parts of
Monte Sereno, and there is currently no drainage plan for Monte Sereno. Due to
its minimal danger of flooding, The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has withdrawn the City of Monte Sereno from the emergency program list
of the National Flood Insurance Program.
6. Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste
Hazardous material usage and hazardous waste are primarily associated with resi-
dential uses in Monte Sereno. Household hazardous materials including pesticides,
fertilizers and oil are the most commonly occurring hazardous material in the city.
The California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Toxic Substanc-
es Control (DTSC) is authorized by the Environmental Protection Agency to en-
force and implement federal hazardous materials laws and regulations, including
disposal and transportation of hazardous materials.
Santa Clara County operates a Household Hazardous Waste disposal program for
incorporated and unincorporated residents and small businesses. Household haz-
ardous waste includes flammable, corrosive, toxic and oxidizer material and can be
dropped off at facilities located in Sunnyvale, San Jose and San Martin.
                                                                                  131

As stated in section 8.02.020 of the Monte Sereno Municipal Code, accumulation
of hazardous material is prohibited. As contained in the document, “No owner,
agent, lessee or other person occupying or having charge or control of any building,
lot or premises within the City of Monte Sereno shall permit weeds, dirt, rubbish,
rank growths and other hazardous material to remain upon said premises, or public
sidewalks, or streets, or alleys between said premises and the centerline of any pub-
lic street or alley.”
7. Emergency Response
As required by law, Monte Sereno has established emergency preparedness proce-
dures to respond to a variety of natural and man-made disasters that could occur
within the area. The City participates in the Santa Clara County Operational Emer-
gency Plan (EOP or Plan) and the City has representatives on the Emergency Op-
erations Center (EOC) Steering Committee. The Plan is an all hazards document
describing the County’s Emergency Operations organization, compliance with rele-
vant legal statutes, other guidelines, and critical components of the Emergency
Response System. This system is activated during extraordinary emergency situa-
tions associated with large-scale disasters affecting Santa Clara County and/or the
Santa Clara County Operational Area. By definition of the State of California, the
Santa Clara County Operational Area consists of the cities, special districts, and the
unincorporated areas of the county. This plan is not intended to address specific
emergency responses.
The Plan continues the County’s compliance with the California Standardized
Emergency Management System (SEMS) and establishes compliance with the Na-
tional Incident Management System (NIMS), the National Response Framework
(NRF), and the National Preparedness Guidelines (NPG).
Monte Sereno residents also have an important role in responding to emergencies.
Many neighborhoods in Monte Sereno and Los Gatos have organized to plan and
prepare for disasters through the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT)
program. The CERT program educates people about disaster preparedness and
trains them in basic disaster response skills. In the event of an emergency, CERT
members can assist others in their neighborhood before professional responders
are able to arrive. The Town of Los Gatos currently offers CERT training courses
that are available to Monte Sereno residents.
8. Air Quality
The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) regulates air quality in
Santa Clara County. The county, including Monte Sereno, is part of a region-wide
134

                                                 C I T Y  O F  M O N T E S E R E N O

non-attainment area in which ambient levels exceed State or federal air quality
standard for ground-level ozone and airborne particulates (PM2.5, and PM10.) Addi-
tionally, ozone precursors generated in Santa Clara County often move to other
communities, where smog is formed several hours later. Thus, the BAAQMD tries
to minimize local emissions that will contribute to an existing violation of State and
federal standards in any part of the Bay Area.
The BAAQMD monitors air quality at numerous sites within the nine-county Dis-
trict, although not within Monte Sereno. The closest air monitoring station is in
Los Gatos, but the closest air monitoring station with complete annual data is in
central San Jose.
Local air pollutant levels measured over the past three years (2004 to 2006) at the
Central San Jose station are reported in Table HS-1. The air pollutants of greatest
concern are ground-level ozone, PM10, and PM2.5, because health standards for
these compounds are exceeded in the Bay Area. CO, lead, and NO 2 standards have
been achieved, primarily though cleaner fuels, more efficient motor vehicles, and
evolving regulations. As shown in Table HS-1, measurements of ozone in Central
San Jose exceeded air quality standards during the 2005 and 2006 monitoring peri-
od. Carbon monoxide measurements met federal and State standards during the
2004-2006 monitoring period. Measurements of PM10 exceeded California air qual-
ity standards on one day during the 2004-2006 monitoring period.

9. Noise
For the purpose of the General Plan, noise is defined as a sound or series of
sounds that are considered invasive, irritating, objectionable or disruptive to the
quality of life. Noise varies in its range, source and volume and can derive from
individual incidents such as a lawnmower, to sporadic disturbances such as a car
horn, to more constant irritants such as traffic along major arterials.
State Law requires that all City and County General Plans address noise to limit the
exposure of the community to excessive noise levels. To this end local govern-
ments are required to “analyze and quantify noise levels and the extent of noise
exposure” through field measurements or noise modeling, and “implement
measures and possible solutions to existing and foreseeable noise problems.”
Noise contours for current and projected conditions within the community are
required to be prepared in terms of either the Community Noise Equivalent Level
136

                                                   C I T Y   O F  M O N T E S E R E N O
                                                                  G E N E R A L P L A N

(CNEL) or the Day-Night Average Level (Ldn), which are descriptors of total noise
exposure at a given location for an annual average day. CNEL and Ldn are general-
ly considered to be equivalent descriptors of the community noise environment
within plus or minus 1.0 dBA. Table HS-2 provides definitions of the acoustical
terminology used in this document.
a. Land Use Compatibility
Land uses deemed noise sensitive by the State of California include schools, hospi-
tals, rest homes, long-term care and mental care facilities. Many jurisdictions also
consider residential uses noise sensitive since families and individuals expect to use
time in the home for rest and relaxation, and excess noise can interfere with those
activities. Monte Sereno considers residential uses as noise sensitive since the quiet
community character is one of attractions to living in the city.
Monte Sereno is generally a quiet, residential community. The primary noise gen-
erator that impacts Monte Sereno residents is vehicular noise from major roadways.
To ensure that future development is not adversely impacted by noise generators,
or is itself a negative noise source, the City will utilize land use compatibility guide-
lines as part of planning and development decisions. Figure HS-5 summarizes
which land uses are compatible with different noise levels.

                           prevailing ambient noise level.
b. Existing and Future Noise
Automobiles are the most common noise source in Monte Sereno. As shown on
Figure HS-5, automobile noise is greatest on Highway 9 and Winchester Boulevard.
Local and regional growth is not anticipated to create a large increase in traffic
noise during the next 20 years. Figure HS-5 depicts projected future noise levels
for sample roadways based on future traffic levels in 2030. These contours are very
similar to existing noise conditions, with a slight increase of noise levels occurring
during the next 20 years along the major regional roadways. The majority of traffic
increases will result from regional growth, over which the City has no control.
Noise levels are only shown for those roadways that were studied as part of the
General Plan traffic analysis or where traffic counts were available. Roadways that
were not modeled for noise contours also experience traffic noise, with noise levels
along local streets anticipated to be similar or quieter than those modeled streets.

Noise impacts also result from construction and landscaping activities. To limit
noise from these sources, Chapter 9.07 of the Monte Sereno Municipal Code estab-
lishes permitted hours for construction and mechanical blowers. Construction
requiring a building permit is permitted from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday
through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Saturday and prohibited on Sundays and
holidays. Construction not requiring a permit can occur at any time. The use of
mechanical blowers is limited to 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday through Friday, 9:00
a.m. to 5:00 pm Saturday and permitted from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Sundays
and holidays only if operated by a homeowner or tenant. The maximum volume
for mechanical blowers is 65 decibels as measured 50 feet from the blower for
backpack-mounted blowers, and 70 decibels as measured 50 feet from the blower
for handheld blowers.
                                                                                139

9 IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
  This Implementation Program summarizes the specific actions and programs need-
  ed to implement the goals and policies contained in the General Plan. This Pro-
  gram helps to ensure that the General Plan functions as a living document that
  guides City decisions and activities on a daily basis.
  A. Implementation Program Overview
  A general plan is often referred to as the “constitution” governing the future
  growth, development, and conservation of a community. As a constitution, this
  General Plan should guide all decisions and activities of the City Council, appointed
  committees and City staff. The General Plan should be a living document that is
  used on a daily basis to guide the implementation of key community goals and val-
  ues.
  This General Plan includes actions and programs as part of each Element to identi-
  fy specific measures needed to achieve the goals and policies of the General Plan.
  The success of this General Plan in achieving the community-wide goals and poli-
  cies will depend to a large extent on the effective implementation of the actions and
  programs in each element of the Plan. This Implementation Program provides a
  basis for the City to effectively put these actions and programs into effect, to moni-
  tor their success, and to make adjustments to reflect changing conditions and prior-
  ities in the years ahead.
  By adopting this Implementation Program as part of the General Plan, the City
  Council is making a commitment to put into action the General Plan and to ensure
  that all City decisions and actions are consistent with the General Plan. It is the
  City Council’s intention to initiate and, if possible, to complete all Housing Pro-
  grams prior to June 30, 2014. It is also the Council’s intention to initiate and, if
  possible, complete all other General Plan programs within ten years of the date of
  adoption of this General Plan.
                                                                                    147

Table IP-1 identifies the responsible party and timeframe for each action in the
General Plan. This table also identifies quantified objectives and funding sources
for programs in the Housing Element. This table is intended to serve as a guide for
the City when preparing the annual budget and its capital improvement program
(CIP). Table IP-1 also helps to identify amendments to the City Municipal Code
necessary to implement the General Plan and, in the case of the Housing Element,
comply with State law.

B.     Terminology
Action
An action is a program, implementation measure, procedure or technique intended
to help achieve a specified goal. (See “Goal”)
Affordable Housing
Housing capable of being purchased or rented by a household with very low, low,
or moderate income, based on a household’s ability to make monthly payments
necessary to obtain housing. Housing is considered affordable when a household
pays less than 30 percent of its gross monthly income (GMI) for housing including
utilities.
Archaeological Resource
Material evidence of past human activity found below the surface of ground or
water, portions of which may be visible above the surface.
Arterials
Major streets that primarily serve through-traffic and provide access to abutting
properties as a secondary function. Arterials are generally designed with two to six
travel lanes and have signals at major cross-street intersections. This roadway type
is divided into two categories major and minor arterials.
Bicycle Lane (Class II facility)
A corridor expressly reserved for bicycles, existing on a street or roadway in addi-
tion to lanes for use by motorized vehicles.
Bicycle Path (Class I facility)
A paved route, not on a street or roadway, expressly reserved for bicycles traversing
an otherwise unpaved area. Bicycle paths may parallel roads but are typically sepa-
rated from them by landscaping.
Bicycle Route (Class III facility)
A facility shared with motorists and identified only by signs, a bicycle route has no
pavement markings or lane stripes.
Bikeways
A term that encompasses “bicycle lanes” and “bicycle paths.”
                                                                                   153

C I T Y O F M O N T E     S E R E N O
G E N E R A L P L A N
G L O S S A R Y
Built-out; Build-out
Land developed to its full potential or theoretical capacity as permitted under cur-
rent or proposed planning or zoning designations.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
Legislation and corresponding procedural components established in 1970 by the
State of California to require environmental review for projects anticipated to result
in adverse impacts to the environment.
Collectors
Collectors are streets that provide land access and traffic circulation within residen-
tial areas. They connect local streets to arterials and are typically designed with two
travel lanes.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
A descriptor for the 24-hour A weighted average noise level. The CNEL concept
accounts for the increased acoustical sensitivity of people to noise during the even-
ing and nighttime hours. Sound levels during the hours from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. are
penalized 5 dB; sound levels during the hours from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. are penalized
10 dB. A 10 dB increase in sound level is perceived by people to be a doubling of
loudness.
Conditional Use Permit
A permit authorizing a use not routinely allowed on a particular site, subject to a
public hearing. If approval is granted, the developer must meet certain conditions
to harmonize the project with its surroundings.
Cultural Resources
Includes historic, archaeological and paleontological resources, as well as human
remains.
Decibel (dB)
A unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by the human
ear. The lowest volume a normal ear can detect under laboratory conditions is 0
dB, the threshold of human hearing. Since the decibel scale is logarithmic, 10 deci-
bels are ten times more intense and 20 decibels are a hundred times more intense
than 1 db.

                                                                 G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                                         G L O S S A R Y
dBA
The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels, which weighs or reduces
the effects of low and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing. Every
increase of 10 dBA doubles the perceived loudness even though the noise is actual-
ly ten times more intense.
Density, Residential (du/acre)
The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land.
Density Bonus
The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate additional
square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the
parcel is zoned, usually in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity
at the same site or at another location.
Development
The physical extension and/or construction of non-farm land uses. Development
activities include subdivision of land; construction or alteration of structures, roads,
utilities and other facilities; grading; deposit of refuse, debris or fill materials; and
clearing of natural vegetative cover (with the exception of agricultural activities).
Dwelling Unit (du)
The place of customary abode of a person or household, which is either considered
to be real property under State law or cannot be easily moved.
Element
California State Government Code Section 65302 requires each General Plan to
contain seven separate “elements” that set goals, policies and actions for each
mandated subject. Topics can sometimes be combined or included into other ele-
ments, as allowed by State law.
Exaction
A contribution or payment required as an authorized precondition for receiving a
development permit; usually refers to mandatory dedication (or fee in lieu of dedi-
cation) requirements found in many subdivision regulations.
Fault
A fracture in the earth’s cruse that forms a boundary between rock masses that
have shifted.
                                                                                     155

General Plan
A compendium of City policies regarding its long-term development, in the form
of maps and accompanying text. The General Plan is a legal document required of
each local agency by the State of California Government Code Section 65301 and
adopted by the City Council. In California, the General Plan has seven mandatory
elements (Circulation, Conservation, Housing, Land Use, Noise, Open Space and
Public Safety) and may include any number of optional elements the City deems
important.
Goal
A description of the general desired results that Monte Sereno seeks to create
through the implementation of the General Plan. Goals are included in each ele-
ment of the Plan and may include the key physical or community characteristics
that the City and its residents wish to maintain or develop.
Greenhouse Gases
Gases in the atmosphere that trap the sun's energy and thereby contribute to rising
surface temperatures; include carbon dioxide (byproduct of burning fossil fuels),
methane (from agricultural sources) and nitrous oxide (from industrial sources).
Habitat
The physical location or type of environment in which an organism or biological
population lives or occurs.
Impact Fee
A fee charged to a developer by the City according to the proposed development
project, typically by number of units, square footage or acreage. The fee is often
used to offset costs incurred by the municipality for services and infrastructure
such as schools, roads, police and fire services, and parks.
Impervious Surface
Surface through which water cannot penetrate, such as a roof, road, sidewalk, and
paved parking lot. The amount of impervious surface increases with development
and establishes the need for drainage facilities to carry the increased runoff.
Implementation
Actions, procedures, programs or techniques that carry out policies.

Infill Development
Development that occurs on vacant or underutilized land within areas that area
already largely developed.
In-lieu Fee
Cash payments that may be required of an owner or developer as a substitute for a
dedication of land for public use, usually calculated in dollars per lot, and referred
to as in-lieu fees or in-lieu contributions. (See “dedication”)
Land Use
The occupation or utilization of an area of land for any human activity or any pur-
pose.
Land Use Designation
One particular category in a classification series of appropriate use of properties
established by the General Plan Land Use Element.
Level of Service (LOS) Standard
A standard used by government agencies to measure the quality or effectiveness of
a municipal service, such as police, fire or library, or the performance of a facility,
such as a street or highway.
Level of Service (Traffic)
A scale that measures the amount of traffic that a roadway or intersection can ac-
commodate, based on such factors as maneuverability, driver dissatisfaction and
delay. Level of service are usually described on a scale of A to F, as described in
the Circulation Element.
Liquefaction
A phenomenon primarily associated with saturated, cohesionless soil layers located
close to the ground surface. During liquefaction, soils lose strength and ground
failure may occur.
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo)
A five- or seven-member commission within each county that reviews and evalu-
ates all proposals for formation of special districts, incorporation of cities, annexa-
tion to special districts or cities, consolidation of districts and merger of districts
with cities. Each county’s LAFCo is empowered to approve, disapprove or condi-
tionally approve such proposals.

Local Street
Local streets provide direct access to abutting residential properties as their primary
function. In Monte Sereno, the majority of streets are local streets.
Noise Contour
A line connecting points of equal noise level as measured on the same scale.
Non-Conforming Use
A use that was valid when brought into existence, but no longer permitted by later
regulation. “Non-conforming use” is a generic term and includes (1) non-
conforming structures (because their size, type of construction, location on land, or
proximity to other structures is no longer permitted); (2) non-conforming use of a
conforming building; (3) non-conforming use of a non-conforming building; and
(4) non- conforming use of land. Any use lawfully existing on any piece of proper-
ty that is inconsistent with a new or amended General Plan, and that in turn is a
violation of a zoning ordinance amendment subsequently adopted in conformance
with the General Plan, will be a non-conforming use. Typically, non-conforming
uses are permitted to continue for a designated period of time, subject to certain
restrictions.
Parcel
A lot, or contiguous group of lots, in single ownership or under single control, usu-
ally considered a unit for purposes of development.
Policy
A specific statement of principle or of guiding actions that implies clear commit-
ment but is not mandatory. A general direction that a governmental agency sets to
follow, in order to meet its goals before undertaking an implementing action. (See
“Action”)
Riparian Corridor
A habitat and vegetation zone which is associated with the banks and floodplains
of a river, stream or lake. Riparian trees and shrubs are typically phreatophytes,
plants whose root systems are in constant contact with groundwater.
Sensitive Receptors
Uses sensitive to noise such as residential areas, hospitals, convalescent homes and
facilities, and schools.
