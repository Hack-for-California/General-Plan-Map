General Plan
  2007 - 2025

                              Welcome and Overview
                              Ross will celebrate the 100th anniversary of becoming a town in 2008. While
                              the railroad and horses of 1908 are gone, the residential neighborhoods still
                              suggest a changeless quality.
                         Whether we represent a third generation Ross family or moved to Town
                         yesterday, we share many reasons for choosing Ross as our home: its historic
                         character, small-town charm, tree-lined streets, excellent school, wooded hillsides
                         and meandering creeks. We want Ross to retain these attributes and still be a
                         dynamic and evolving community.
General Plan
      2007 - 2025        We define stewardship as the careful and responsible management of something
entrusted to one’s care. This community shares a unique environment in which we foster, nurture and
protect our families. The founding principles of this place are joy in the physical environment, the
families who stand together and the education of the children who will learn and project these values
into the future. We have come to this valley in search of a better way to live. In every aspect this view of
the projected future, this General Plan, is grounded in the stewardship of these irreplaceable assets.
State law requires that all municipalities have a long-range general plan for their physical development.
More than just meeting this mandate, we want our plan to be a compelling and stimulating road map
for addressing the fundamental elements affecting our town. The Ross General Plan supports and
advances healthy, safe and sustainable principles that preserve Ross’ unique environmental qualities and
encourage participation from all Ross residents in Town government.
For the creation of the General Plan, the Town Council appointed a steering committee comprised of
seven Ross residents and a member of the Council. Over a period of more than two years, the committee
met with professional planners, local design professionals, Town staff and numerous experts on the
topics addressed in the plan. The process also included extensive opportunities for valuable community
involvement to reflect the best current ideas and a future vision for our community.
Among new ideas contained in the General Plan are:
n   Establish ADR (Advisory Design Review) comprised of an advisory group of local volunteer design
    professionals to provide design review assistance to staff.
n   Develop Detailed Design Guidelines to be applied during the application review process.
n   Prepare a Plan for the Downtown Area to address street design, parking, potential uses, design
    guidelines, pedestrian/bicycle access, and places for gathering.
n   Require Design Review of Larger Landscape Projects that include alterations that could affect the
    visual and/or physical character of a site or neighborhood.
n   Prepare a Pedestrian and Bicycle Master Plan to assure safe bicycle and pedestrian travel in Ross,
    including safe routes for children.

Our History And
Where We Are Today
 “In 1908, the residents of Ross voted to incorporate; the vote was 96-0.
 They wasted no time choosing trustees and instituting a number of laws.
 For example, dogs had to be licensed and lights were required on bikes
                                                                                                     Part I
 after dusk. The Townspeople also set an early standard of environmental
 advocacy by insisting that trees could not be cut down unless the Town
 granted permission. The Town purchased land across from the train depot
 for a park that eventually became Ross Commons.”1
How We Became A Town
 For thousands of years prior to 1800, the Coast Miwok Indians lived and
 were sustained by the land that is now called Ross Valley. The Coast Miwok
 revered the land, plants and animals of the Ross Valley through tribal cultural
 beliefs and practices. European diseases eventually decimated the Indian
 population. The settlement in 1817 of Mission San Raphael, with its vast
 land holding, also resulted in further incursions into areas occupied by the
 Coast Miwok Indians.
 After the Mexican Revolution of 1821, the “land grant” system of parceling
 out land gave rise to what we now know as Marin County. Ross was
 originally part of an 8,877-acre Mexican land grant to Juan B.R. Cooper in
 1840 known as Ranch Punta de Quentin Canada de San Anselmo. The Town
 of Ross itself was named in honor of James Ross, who purchased the land in
 1857 for $50,000. Ross built his home on Redwood Drive and moved there
 with his wife and three children. When James Ross died in 1862 his wife,
 Annie Ross, was forced to sell a portion of James Ross’ larger land holdings to
 pay each of their daughters $10,000. The 297 acres she had remaining make
 up part of the Town of Ross today.
 Once the Town was incorporated one of the first actions of the new Town
 Council was to make it illegal to cut down trees without Town approval.
 Soon the streets were paved, streetlights erected, concrete bridges built over
 the creek and a firehouse constructed. Thanks to the foresight of our early
 leaders, the Town today rests under a leafy canopy that is unique in Marin            1

                                           The History of Some of Our Important Places
                                             The Town of Ross is a quiet residential community with tree-lined, shady
                                             streets. The wooded ravines, open grassy areas and long avenues of large shade
                                             trees provide an unmistakable sense that you have arrived in a unique and
                                             historic place. So, too, do the important landmarks in Town.2

                                         Ross School
            Ross Grammar School was built in 1911
          and then replaced in 1941. In 1991, Child
         Magazine named Ross Elementary School as
        one of the top ten schools in the nation. The
          academic ranking is in the 99th percentile,
                  the highest any school can achieve.
                                The Branson School
 In 1922, The Branson School moved to Ross from
      San Rafael. It offered grades one to eleven and
        was co-educational through the fourth grade.

          The Cedars of Marin began as a school for
     children with special needs in 1919. It has since
      evolved into a nationally recognized residential
   and day programming community for adults with
      developmental disabilities. Currently, the Ross
    campus houses half of its 100 residential clients.
                                           Town Hall
          In 1926, the Town of Ross voted to spend
                 $100,000 to buy the Shotwell estate
            upon which the present Ross Town Hall
                 and Fire Station were built in 1927.
                                     Ross Post Office
      In 1958, the Ross Post Office was built on the
site of the old North Pacific Coast Railroad Station.

                                         In 1967, the family of Natalie Coffin Greene
                                         gave 25 acres of Phoenix Lake land for a park
                                         in her memory.

                                         in 1943 with the purchase of the property from
                                         A.J. Kittle, a member of the first Ross Town

Who We Are Today . . . And Tomorrow
 The Town of Ross is the second smallest of Marin’s communities, with 1.6
 square miles and slightly more than 800 residential parcels. At last census
 count (2000), we had 2,310 residents.3 Between 1990 and 2005,
 the population grew by 214 people, which is about the same rate
 of growth as Marin County as a whole. Over the next 25 years,                     2000 Census

    An Abundance of Green and Healthy
    Natural Systems
    Ross’ mystique lies in the beauty of its natural resources: the trees, hillsides,
    ridgelines and meandering creeks. These features have shaped the growth of
    Ross and affect how we experience the community. They provide habitat
    for wildlife, privacy between neighbors, and create scenic vistas around every
    bend.
   Definition
                              A Vision is a way of looking at the future and our ability to define a future state. A vision statement, in its
simplest terms, is one’s ability to define a future state. A community visioning event was held in 2005. The visioning ideas of the community
have been incorporated into each general plan section, as shown below.

                                                               Policies are the way we can turn our vision of Ross in the year 2025 into
                                    a reality. Policies are specific or general statements of principle, positions or approaches on a particular
                                    issue or subject. Policies motivate us, guide our actions and direct us toward the Ross we envision.
                                    Policies for Goal 1 (An Abundance of Green and Healthy Natural Systems) begin below.
                                                Ross General Plan Policies
                                                1.1 Protection of Environmental Resources. Protect environmental resources,
                                                such as hillsides, ridgelines, creeks, drainage ways, trees and tree groves,

                                                places,7 and other resources. These resources are unique in the planning
                                                area because of their scarcity, scientific value, aesthetic quality and cultural
                                                significance.
View of Bald Hill looking south                1.2 Tree Canopy Preservation. Protect and expand the tree canopy of Ross to
                                          enhance the beauty of the natural landscape. Recognize that the tree canopy is
                                          critical to provide shade, reduce ambient temperatures, improve the uptake of
                                          carbon dioxide, prevent erosion and excess stormwater runoff, provide habitat
                                          for wildlife and birds, and protect the ecosystem of the under-story vegetation.
                                          1.3 Tree Maintenance and Replacement. Assure proper tree maintenance and
                                          replacement.
                                          1.4 Natural Areas Retention. Maximize the amount of land retained in its
                                          natural state. Wherever possible, residential development should be designed
                                          to preserve, protect and restore native site vegetation and habitat. In addition,
                                          where possible and appropriate, invasive vegetation should be removed.
                                          1.5 Open Space Plan. Execute the Open Space Plan (See Figure 3 in Appendix
                                          A) for land in public and private ownership, including existing and future

    The Town has adopted additional design review requirements for projects with
    grading, filling, or retaining walls construction, further ensuring the preservation of
    the Town’s hillsides. Creek and drainageway setbacks and an expanded tree protection
    ordinance were added to the Town’s zoning regulations to protect waterways and
    vegetation for future generations. Applications to remove or alter trees are carefully
    scrutinized by the Town as part of any project review.

(i)	   Recycle building materials.
2.2 Incorporation of Resource Conservation Measures. To the extent consistent
with other design considerations, public and private projects should be
designed to be efficient and innovative in their use of materials, site
construction, and water irrigation standards for new landscaping to
minimize resource consumption, including energy and water.
2.3 Reduction in the Use of Chemicals and Non-Natural Substances. Support
efforts to use chemical-free and toxic-free building materials, reduce waste
and recycle building waste and residential garbage. Encourage landscape
designs that minimize pesticide and herbicide use.

2.4 Footprints of Buildings. Utilize smaller footprints to minimize the built area
of a site and to allow the maximum amount of landscaped and/or permeable
surfaces.
Overview of Our Past Accomplishments
The Town supports reducing consumption of water and energy through enhanced
energy efficiency, energy conservation, renewable energy, and green building practices.
The Town encourages include the use of energy efficient lighting, motors and
refrigerators that use less energy for the same or greater output, solar power, and
the the use of materials, design and construction practices that consider the energy
used to extract, produce and transport building materials and for ongoing building
operation and maintenance.
All new construction must meet the current California Energy Commission standards.
To the extent consistent with other design considerations, the Town has also
supported designs that are creative, efficient and innovative in their use of materials
and methods to minimize resource consumption. This has included drought-tolerant
planting selections in landscape plans and water-conserving irrigation systems, such as
drip irrigation, low flow sprinklers and automatic controls.

         Ross encourages architectural variety of buildings and the open feeling of the
         Town. Buildings recede into the background while landscaping and open
         space take center stage. Ross’ neighborhoods mix old and new construction
         through the use of appropriate building materials and landscaping, and
         through the appropriate design, scale, and siting of improvements.. We have
         come to expect an excellence of design that blends with the neighborhood
         setting.
         Our Vision of Ross in Year 2025
         The Town has encouraged diversity in home design. While design review                 Major New Ideas

                           Ross General Plan Policies
                           3.1 Building and Site Design. Design all structures and improvements to respect
                           existing natural topographic contours. Open areas and buildings shall be
                           located to protect land forms and natural site features, including cultural
                           places and resources, wherever possible. Where feasible, site development
                                              must avoid intact or previously disturbed cultural resources
                                              during excavation and grading.
                                              3.2 Landscape Design. Where appropriate, encourage landscape
                                              designs that incorporate existing native vegetation, enhance
                                              the cohesiveness of the Town’s lush, organic landscape and
                                              integrate new planting with existing site features. Plans shall
                                              recognize the importance of open space on a lot and shall
                                              address the look and feel of the space between structures so as
                                              to avoid overbuilding.
                                              3.3 Buildings on Sloping Land. New buildings and additions
Example of tree canopy and

historic bridge in Ross
                           designed to relate to the current landforms with the goal of integrating the
                           building with the site (e.g., step with the slope). Low retaining walls are
                           encouraged where their use would minimize uphill cutting, and large single-
                           plane retaining walls should be avoided. Cut and fill areas and on/off-hauling
                           should be minimized, especially in locations of limited or difficult access.
                           Special care should be taken to final grade all disturbed areas to a natural
                           appearing configuration and to direct stormwater runoff to areas where water
                           can naturally infiltrate the soil.
                           3.4 Bulk, Mass and Scale. Minimize the perception of building bulk and
                           mass so that homes are not out of scale, visually or structurally, with
                           neighboring residences and their setting. Consider building bulk and mass
                           during the design review process, and when applying requirements and
                           guidelines addressing Floor Area Ratio (FAR), maximum home floor area
                           and other development standards. Building heights should stay in scale with
                           surrounding vegetation and buildings.
                           3.5 View Protection. Preserve views and access to views of hillsides, ridgelines,
                           Mt. Tamalpais and Bald Hill from the public right-of-way and public
                           property. Ensure that the design look and feel along major thoroughfares
                           maintains the “greenness” of the Town.

3.6 Windows, Roofs, and Skylights. Window and skylight size, placement
and design should be selected to maximize the privacy between adjacent
properties. To the extent consistent with other design considerations, the
placement and size of windows and skylights should minimize light pollution
and/or glare.
3.7 Materials and Colors. Buildings should be designed using high-
quality materials and colors appropriate to their neighborhood and
natural setting.
3.8 Driveways and Parking Areas. Driveways and parking areas should
be designed to minimize visibility from the street and to provide
safe access, minimal grading and/or retaining walls, and to protect
water quality. Permeable materials should be used to increase
water infiltration. Driveways and parking areas should be graded to
minimize stormwater runoff.
Overview of Our Past Accomplishments
The Design Review Ordinance, adopted in 1993, requires Town Council
approval of all new houses and all additions over 200 square feet in size.
The design review process was developed to protect the design character of
the Town by providing design criteria and policies for reviewing proposed
development. The intent is to encourage excellence of design, minimize
environmental impacts, and ensure compatibility with the character of the
surrounding area — how a house presents itself from the street, fits into the
neighborhood, and blends with its setting.
In 2000, the Town adopted a guideline maximum of 10,000 square feet
of total floor area for homes. Allowances above 10,000 square feet are
permitted, but only if the Town Council finds that such development
intensity is appropriate and consistent with the Ross Municipal Code and
the Ross General Plan.
The Town has also had to address issues unique to different areas of Ross,
                                                                                           Examples of variations in street
such as maintaining privacy on small lots, minimizing excavation and retaining walls
                                                                                               frontage of homes in Ross
on steep sites, and avoiding the appearance of “looming” structures projecting out
from hillside sites. “Sub-areas of Ross” (neighborhoods) have been identified in the
Ross General Plan to establish a generalized method of understanding different areas
in the community. These areas are shown on the map in Appendix A (Figure 5) and
described below. They provide a starting point for area-appropriate design guidelines
and design review.

                                could affect the visual and/or physical character of the site and neighborhood.
                                Ensure that larger landscape projects include water efficient plant materials
                                                 and efficient irrigation design.

Goal 4
Protecting Historic Places and Resources
  History is alive in Ross. The history of our Town sets it apart from other
  places and makes it a unique place to live. As we move through our fast-
  paced, technology-driven lives, it’s comforting to have a special place to
  escape to that connects us to our past and reminds us of the simpler days of
  yesteryear.

  community.
  Ross General Plan Policies
  4.1 Historic Heritage. Maintain the historic feel of Ross by preserving
  and maintaining historic buildings, resources and areas with recognized
  historic or aesthetic value that serve as significant reminders of the past.
  4.2 Design Compatibility with Historic Resources. Require new construction
  to harmonize with existing historic buildings and resources, and ensure a
  compatibility of landscaping with Ross’ historic character.
  4.3 Town Bridges. Maintain and protect bridges as an important part of                              One of five historic bridges
  Ross’ heritage. If a bridge must be rebuilt or retrofitted, it should be done in a                         in the Town of Ross
  way that is compatible with its historic look.

                                   Town of Ross General Plan * 2007-2025
                                   4.4 Preservation of Existing Housing Supply. Discourage the demolition or
                                   combining of existing residential units that will reduce the supply of housing
                                   in Ross.
                                   4.5 Archaeological Resources. Implement measures to preserve and protect
                                   archaeological resources. Whenever possible, identify archaeological resources
                                         and potential impacts on such resources. Provide information and
                                         direction to property owners in order to make them aware of these
                                         resources. Require archaeological surveys, conducted by an archaeologist
                                         who appears on the Northwest Information Center’s list of archaeologists
                                         qualified to do historic preservation fieldwork in Marin County, in
                                         areas of documented archaeological sensitivity. Develop design review
                                         standards for projects that may potentially impact cultural resources.
                                         Overview of Our Past Accomplishments
Finished obsidian arrowheads,            Before 1993 we were losing residences that contributed to the charm and
knives and tools (Photo courtesy   character of our community. As a result, the Demolition Ordinance was adopted
of the Federated Indians of Graton requiring property owners to obtain Town approval before tearing down a residence.
Rancheria — see website)           A welcome consequence of the ordinance has been to encourage people to purchase
                                   houses because they want to retain them and enhance their historic character, rather
                                   than raze them. The Demolition Ordinance has helped to protect historic homes
                                   from demolition, but the Town has not had specific regulations or design standards
                                   for historic homes.
                                   The Demolition Ordinance was amended in 1998 to specifically discourage
                                   demolitions that reduce the number of housing units in Town and to combat the
                                   purchase of multiple adjacent residences to tear down and replace with a single
                                   oversized residence. It also protects historic residences from being altered without
                                   Town review. Since 1998 only one residence has been demolished without a
                                   replacement unit being built, and that was by the Marin County Flood Control
                                   District for Corte Madera Creek access.
                                   We are trying to preserve the rich historical record that lies beneath our topsoil.
                                   There are eight known archaeological sites in the Town of Ross. These are either
                                   temporary Native American campsites or permanently occupied sites located primarily
                                   along Corte Madera Creek. The Town requires that, if an archaeological site is
                                   uncovered during any construction, activity must be halted and an examination
                                   made by an archaeologist who appears on the Northwest Information Center’s list
                                   of archaeologists qualified to do historic preservation fieldwork in Marin County, in
                                   consultation with the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, Sacred Sites Protection
                                   Committee.

Action List of New Ideas
4.A Conduct Study to Identify Historic Resources. Identify potential districts and
significant properties that may be eligible for National Register or California
Historic Resources status, or which may have local significance or distinction.
4.B Adopt Historic Resources Regulations. Adopt guidelines, regulations and
requirements to protect historic resources, including buildings, accessory
structures, kiosks, gates, bridges, etc. Incorporate historic review into
ADR design guidelines and consider the development of findings as part
of the Town record for disclosure at resale, indicating that the home
or site carries special significance to the town and therefore has special
requirements for future renovation or alteration.
4.C Map Archaeologically Sensitive Areas. Consult with the Federated
Indians of Graton Rancheria, the Northwest Information Center of the                     St. Anselm Church
California Historical Resources Information System, and other resources to
develop a map of potentially sensitive archaeological areas that can be used to
identify locations where an archaeological inventory may be necessary prior to
approval of development activity.

     Part IV               Goal 5	
                           Protecting Community Health and Safety,
                           and Preparing for Emergencies
                           It is important to recognize that one of Ross’ greatest assets could become
                           one of its greatest liabilities. Our tree-covered landscape could become fuel
                           for fires that could char and destroy our land and homes. Our scenic hillsides
                           can fall victim to unrelenting winter rains, causing landslides, mudslides and
                           erosion. Like all of the Bay Area, we are also always at risk from earthquake.
                           Planning is needed to minimize the potential for loss of life, injury and
                           property damage from any natural disaster.

                           5.1 Location of Future Development. Development will only be permitted in
                           areas where risks to residents can be adequately mitigated.
                           5.2 Geologic Review Procedures. At the time a development is proposed, Ross
                           geologic and slope stability maps should be reviewed to assess potential
                           geologic hazards. In addition, suitability for development must be based on
                           site-specific geotechnical investigations.
                           5.3 Fire Resistant Design. Buildings should be designed to be fire defensive.
                           Designs should minimize risk of fire by a combination of factors including,
                           but not limited to, the use of fire-resistant building materials, fire sprinklers,
                           noncombustible roofing and defensible landscaping space.

    5.4 Maintenance and Landscaping for Fire Safety. Ensure that appropriate fire
    safety and landscaping practices are used to minimize fire danger, especially in
    steeper areas. Due to the high fire hazard in the steeper areas of Town, special
    planting and maintenance programs will be required to reduce fire hazards
    in the hills and wildland areas, including removal of invasive non-native
    vegetation such as broom, acacia and eucalyptus.
    5.5 Fire Safety in New Development. New construction will adhere
    to all safety standards contained in the Building and Fire Code.
    Hazards to life and property shall be minimized by such measures
    as fire preventive site design, fire resistant landscaping and building
    materials, and the use of fire suppression techniques and resources.

5.13 Town Responsibilities for Emergency Preparation and Response. Undertake
emergency preparedness planning in cooperation with other public agencies
and local organizations. Publicize emergency plans, provide information on
disaster preparedness to residents and businesses, and continue essential Town
emergency public services during natural disasters.
Overview of Our Past Accomplishments
As development has been proposed on the least developable hillside lots in Ross,
the Town has required thorough review by outside hydrologists and geologists to
ensure that potential hazards such as erosion, landslide and debris flow are fully
addressed and mitigated. New development in geologically hazardous areas is not
approved without first demonstrating that the proposed construction will not
result in on-or off-site dangerous conditions.
Fire risk in Ross is high due to vegetation, steep topography and climactic
conditions. The Town’s Fire Department reviews all development applications,                 Heavy vegetation can
and new construction must meet fire safety standards and provide adequate access for        also create fire hazards
emergency vehicles. The Town’s Hillside Lot Ordinance further requires clearing of
brush, installation of class “C” roofing, and replacement of inadequate water lines and
fire hydrants to ensure a sufficient water supply for fire fighting.
Action List of New Ideas
5.A Prepare Water System (Pressure) Master Plan. Coordinate with the Marin
Municipal Water District (MMWD) to evaluate water pressure and
water lines to ensure adequate fire protection. Identify locations where
improvements are needed and adopt requirements and funding mechanisms
in coordination with MMWD to implement these improvements.
5.B Implement Ross Valley Emergency Preparedness. Initiate discussions with
other Ross Valley jurisdictions to consider opportunities to jointly respond
to emergencies such as flood, fire, earthquake or other emergency situations.
Cost savings and coordination opportunities could include the creation of a
Town staff disaster planning coordinator, formation of a disaster preparedness
committee reporting to Town staff (resident volunteers, Town official),
sharing of resources and development of outreach programs to residents and
businesses to provide training and information about disaster preparedness.

                            Protecting Creek Habitat and Reducing
                            Flooding Hazards
                               Fueled by heavy winter rains, Corte Madera Creek can turn from a peaceful
                               stream in the summer and fall months into a raging river in the winter
                               months. Throughout history, and most recently during the New Year’s Eve
                               Flood of 2005, there was massive and widespread flooding in the low-lying
                               areas of Town when the creek overflowed its banks in Ross and San Anselmo.
                               Our region’s historic pattern of developing the flat lands along Corte Madera
                               Creek in the Ross Valley leaves us vulnerable to the whims of nature.

                               remodels within the 100-year floodplain must comply with the Town’s
                               floodplain regulations.
                               6.2 Flood Control Improvements. The Town supports the construction of flood
                               control improvements consistent with the natural environment, the design
                               character of the Town of Ross and the safety and protection of persons and

                               jurisdictions within the Ross Valley watershed to develop a comprehensive
                               approach to flood protection and resource preservation strategies.

     6.4 Runoff and Drainage. Stormwater runoff should be maintained in its natural
     path. Water should not be concentrated and flow onto adjacent property.
     Instead, runoff should be directed toward storm drains or, preferably to other
     areas where it can be retained, detained, and/or absorbed into the ground.
     6.5 Permeable Surfaces. To the greatest extent possible, development should
     use permeable surfaces and other techniques to minimize runoff into
     underground drain systems and to allow water to percolate into the
     ground. Landscaped areas should be designed to provide potential runoff
     absorption and infiltration.
     6.6 Creek and Drainageway Setbacks, Maintenance and Restoration. Keep
     development away from creeks and drainageways. Setbacks from creeks
     shall be maximized to protect riparian areas and to protect residents from
     flooding and other hazards. Encourage restoration of runoff areas, to
     include but not be limited to such actions as sloping banks, providing native                                              Creek access
     vegetation, protecting habitat, etc., and work with property owners to identify
     means of keeping debris from blocking drainageways.
     6.7 Riparian Vegetation. Protect existing creek and riparian vegetation and
     encourage the use of native species during creek restoration. Assure that
     modification of natural channels is done in a manner that retains and protects
     creekside vegetation, integrates fish passage and includes habitat restoration in
     its natural state.

                                    Town of Ross General Plan * 2007-2025
                                    Overview of Our Past Accomplishments
                                    Ross is a member of the Marin County Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program
                                    (MCSTOPPP), which is the leader in stormwater management within the Bay Area.
                                    Programs encourage public participation, education and appropriately designed
                                    development to curb water pollution in Marin County. The Town encourages
                                                practices that enable water to percolate into the surrounding soil, instead
                                                 of letting sediment, metals, pesticides and chemicals run off directly into
                                                 waterways or the storm drain system.
                                                 Many of these development practices also help to reduce stormwater flow.
                                                 In particular, gravel driveways, permeable pavers and grass-lined drainage
                                                 ditches on the side of the roads (as opposed to curbs and sidewalks)
                                                 enhance water absorption and filter out pollutants, such as hydrocarbons.
                                                 Most of the land adjacent to Ross Creek and Corte Madera Creek is in
                                                 private ownership. Therefore, educating homeowners about the best ways
                                                 to stabilize banks and care for creeks has been important. Techniques
Creek drainageway from Phoenix Lake              include biotechnical bank stabilization, which utilizes native plants and
                                    natural materials for banks. In addition, rocks can be used at the toe of the bank to
                                    provide bank stabilization, and to provide shelter and feeding areas for trout. The
                                    Marin Art & Garden Center showcases a variety of native plants that are appropriate
                                    for riparian areas.
                                    In a coordinated effort, the County of Marin and the municipalities of Fairfax,
                                    Larkspur, Ross and San Anselmo have been working together on the Ross Valley
                                    Flood Protection and Watershed Program with three main objectives: (1) achieving
                                    comprehensive flood damage reduction, (2) conserving and enhancing the natural
                                    creek network, and (3) providing an affordable local financing plan.
                                    Generalized areas in Ross subject to flooding and potential dam inundation are shown
                                    in Figure 9, and areas affected by the New Year’s Eve flood of 2005 are shown in
                                    Figure 10. After the 2005 New Year’s Eve flood the Town fast-tracked applications
                                    and waived fees to raise houses, and more than a dozen property owners took
                                    advantage of this program to raise their houses up above 100-year floodplain levels.

                       Trying to drive anywhere in Marin at certain times of day can be frustrating.
                       Travel through and around Ross is affected by countywide development
                       and travel patterns since Sir Francis Drake Boulevard is the major east-
                       west arterial from West Marin to Highway 101. Bottlenecks on Sir Francis
                       Drake Boulevard can push through-traffic onto Bolinas Avenue, Shady Lane,
                       Laurel Grove Avenue and Poplar Avenue, adversely impacting residential
                       neighborhoods. We want to maintain manageable traffic volumes. Thus, we
                       encourage alternative travel including safe walking and biking.

A Beautiful, Safe and Close-Knit Community
  When we talk about what we like about our Town, there are many
  common themes. Among them are preservation of the small-town character,
  maintenance of architectural diversity and protection of the green, tree-
  dominated hills. The purpose of the general plan is to translate concepts
  like these into usable guidelines, goals and codes. The challenge lies in
  preserving the Town character and traditions that Ross residents hold dear,
  while allowing room for necessary change. The Ross General Plan does not
  intend to turn Ross into a live-in museum; rather, it seeks to guide change to
  preserve the architectural mix and take into account not just the individual
  property, but the community-at-large.

Overview of Our Past Accomplishments
The general plan and zoning have guided decision-making to enable new
development to gracefully fit-in with the community. As special issues have arisen
over the past 15 years, new regulations have been developed to respond to those
needs. The Town is now essentially built-out, with almost all of the remaining
vacant land in Town located on steeply sloping hillside areas with limited residential
development potential. A significant amount of vacant land zoned for residential use
is contained in three major parcels adjacent to or part of Bald Hill. There are very
few vacant lots located in the flatter portions of the Town. The figure below shows
existing land use in Ross as of 2006.

                 Action List of New Ideas
                 8.A Prepare a Downtown Area Plan. Develop a plan for the Downtown area as
                 a “Special Planning Area” (see Land Use Plan) to include the Downtown
                 commercial area, parking area through the post office to Lagunitas Avenue,
                 and Ross Common. The plan would include: (1) street design improvements;
                                 (2) parking; (3) potential uses, including opportunities for
                                 limited housing; (4) design guidelines; (5) pedestrian and
                                 bicycle access — including access to Frederick Allen Park and
                                 Kentfield Rehabilitation Hospital; and, (6) outdoor gathering
                                 areas.
                                 8.B Modify Downtown Commercial Zoning. Revise commercial
                                 zoning in the Downtown to prohibit offices in storefront
                                 locations, to encourage mixed use housing, and to encourage
                                 uses that are local-serving and would contribute to the vitality
                                 of downtown.
Ross Post Office
                 8.C Develop New Sign Ordinance for the Downtown. In coordination with
                 Advisory Design Review, develop a new sign ordinance for the downtown
                 to provide greater flexibility in sign design and Town approval.
                 8.D Investigate Enforcement Methods. Review enforcement needs as part of the
                 development of design guidelines and other programs intended to refine
                 Town practices for application review and approval.

  families who stand together and the education of the children who will learn
  and project these values into the future. We have come to this valley in search
  of a better way to live. Every aspect of this shared view of the projected future
  is grounded in the stewardship of these irreplaceable assets.

                               9.7 Annexation Criteria. Areas that can reasonably be served through
                               extension of the existing service area of the Town will be considered for
                               annexation. Annexations will be considered based on the following criteria:
The Branson School (Soccer) (a)	    Resident interest.
                            (b)	 The effect of the annexation on the Town’s “small town” character
                            (c)	    The cost/revenue implications of the provision of Town services.
                            (d)	 The availability of Town services and infrastructure.
                            (e)	    Access.
                            (f)	    Location within the Ross watershed.
                            (g)	    Potential liability concerns related to drainage, geotechnical conditions
                                    and roadway adequacy.
                            Where existing properties are situated within the Town of Ross Planning
                            Area (some properties may be in two jurisdictions), the Town will consider
                            property owner requests for annexation on a case-by-case basis, depending
                            upon the reasonableness of the request and conformity with the Town’s
                            annexation criteria.
                            Overview of Our Past Accomplishments
                            Our community cannot operate without the strong interaction and involvement of its
                            residents. Community involvement pumps fresh ideas into our Town. Each person
                            is different, and collectively we all benefit in recognizing that the participation of a

full cross-section of the community gives a validity and creative boost to our planning
and decision-making. Resident participation leads to better government and a better
community.
Town government plays a critical role in bringing the community together. We
encourage community participation in the formulation and review of planning
policies, implementing programs and development proposals. The Town
provides information to the community about planning policy issues to
(a) enable effective participation from all segments of the community, (b)
enhance community dialogue, (c) foster consensus building, (d) bring in
expert analysis, and (e) achieve the best decisions based upon achieving the
greatest good. For example, the Town uses its “information by email” list
with over 500 contacts to keep people aware of what is going on in the
community, emailing them Council agendas each month and special email
releases from Town staff and other notices of public interest.
The Town must also coordinate with surrounding jurisdictions, special
districts and the Marin County Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO). LAFCO coordinates the logical and timely changes in local                         Ross Fire Department
governmental boundaries (annexation and detachment of territory, formation of
special districts, and consolidation, merger, and dissolution of districts) and ways to
reorganize, simplify and streamline governmental structure.
Action List of New Ideas
9.A Study and Implement Town Hall Remodel. Evaluate options for remodeling
Town Hall for police, fire, administrative staff and meeting space.
9.B Consider Fire Service Consolidation. Study opportunities to consolidate fire
protection service with other Ross Valley jurisdictions and agencies.
9.C Review Fees. Conduct a periodic review of fees to assure cost recovery for
services provided by the Town.
9.D Post General Plan Information on the Town Website. Provide an interactive
general plan format by posting the Ross General Plan on the Town’s website
and providing links to make it easy to navigate for users.
9.E Establish a List of Town Specialists. Identify specialists in fields such as
hydrology, archaeology, historic preservation, cultural places, etc. (similar
to the Town Arborist position) who can provide technical review and
recommendations, as needed by Town staff, for development proposals.

Goal 10
Provision of Affordable Housing Opportunities
     Home ownership in Ross and throughout Marin County has become an ever
     more distant dream for many people. The median sales price for single family
     homes in Ross for the three-month period from August through October,
     2006 was almost $2.0 million. The double-edged sword of steep home prices
     is apparent as we see subsequent generations priced out of the local housing
     market. Similarly, people who work in Ross are often forced to live far away
     where housing is more affordable.
     Our Vision of Ross in Year 2025
     The Town has obtained funding to provide affordable housing for teachers,           Major New Ideas
     Ross Town personnel and others. Some of the affordable housing units are
     apartments above the retail establishments.                                         	 Housing Element Update

   Part VII  Goal 11
             Implementing the Ross General Plan
             Planning in Ross does not begin and end with the General Plan. The
             Ross General Plan recognizes that the process of change is dynamic and
             unpredictable and that a continuing process for monitoring the General
             Plan, and the assumptions upon which it is based, is necessary. The General
             Plan sets out our road map, but it is the ongoing commitment of time and
             resources that will achieve our vision of Ross in the year 2025. All of the
             actions identified in the General Plan require further study, new ordinances,
             special funding, or public review. The details relating to each action will be
             evaluated at the time they are undertaken.
             Our Vision of Ross in Year 2025
             The General Plan is a strategic document that identifies commitments to
             action and implementation goals. It is a blueprint for the adoption of
             ordinances and for establishing Town Council and staff work priorities.
             The planning and permitting process is transparent, understandable
             and objective. Decisions are based on staff and design review
             recommendations, familiarity with the General Plan and sound judgment.
             Applicants for variances or use permits are assisted by staff and the
             Town’s Advisory Design Review Committee (ADR), and are encouraged
             to familiarize themselves with the process for obtaining variances and
             permits. The process is simplified and efficient.

Criteria to Define Action/Implementation Priorities
There are many actions the Town should undertake to implement the Ross
General Plan. However, not all actions can be undertaken immediately as
there are community needs, staffing availability and financial resources to
consider. The following factors have been used for grouping General Plan
implementation actions into priority categories.
First-Level Criteria (Near-Term or Urgent Need and Benefit)
(1)	 Does the action address an immediate health or safety
       concern?
(2)	 Is the action a legal requirement that must be fulfilled?
(3)	 Does the action respond to a pressing development issue?
(4)	 What is the financial impact on the Town?
(5)	 Is the action a special project that has already been started?                   Downtown Ross Commercial Building
(6)	 Is the action already an ongoing normal responsibility of the Town?
(7)	 Does the time-frame for the action require it to be implemented before
       another program action can be taken?
Second-Level Criteria (Medium-Term Benefit)
(8)	 Does the action respond to a longer-term planning need?
(9)	 Will the action result in a longer-term aesthetic improvement?
(10)	 Is the action necessary to keep the General Plan current?
To ensure that the Plan remains up-to-date and reflective of current town
policy and consistent with State law implementation of the General Plan will
be reviewed biennially by the Town Council concurrently with the budget so
that any modifications can be made. This portion of the General Plan will be
evaluated as part of the General Plan’s review.

1.B Create a Landscape Master Plan for Public Areas. Develop a Landscape Master
Plan for entryways, streets, parks and other public areas of Ross. The plan
may include: (1) clarification of responsibility for selecting, maintaining and
irrigating Town trees; (2) an approved planting list; (3) a requirement for
homeowners to plant and maintain certain types of trees from an approved
list; (4) a replacement policy for trees when trees are removed; and, (5)             Medium-Term Actions
guidance for issues such as tree lanes and waterways.
2.A Establish “Green Building” Requirements. Establish specific development
regulations that require buildings and substantial remodels to be built using
“green” building techniques, including recycling of building materials where
possible, and to conform to an industry approved certification or rating such
as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building
Rating System, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), or
Build it Green, which is a professional non-profit membership organization
whose mission is to promote healthy, energy and resource-efficient buildings
in California.
2.B Review Pesticide and Herbicide Requirements. Review current Town
standards to ensure the prudent use of pesticides and herbicides. Implement
an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program that uses a variety of methods
to control pests. The program would also include actions to identify and
eliminate conditions that may attract and support pests.
2.C Adopt Woodsmoke or Biomass Smoke Ordinance. Adopt a Woodsmoke
Ordinance to reduce particulate emissions from wood or biomass burning
appliances, including fireplaces, that do not meet EPA standards of emission.
The purposes of the ordinance will be to either require or encourage the
removal of existing wood or biomass burning appliances that do not meet
standards of emission, and to implement requirements at the time of major
remodel projects.
2.D Consider Secondhand Smoke Ordinance. Study and consider enactment of a
Secondhand Smoke Ordinance in Ross.
2.E Consider Solar Access Ordinance. Study and consider enactment of a Solar
Access Ordinance to encourage use of solar design for Ross development.
4.A Conduct Study to Identify Historic Resources. Identify potential districts and
significant properties that may be eligible for National Register or California
Historic Resources status, or which may have local significance or distinction.

                     Town of Ross General Plan * 2007-2025
                     4.B Adopt Historic Resources Regulations. Adopt guidelines, regulations and
                     requirements to protect historic resources, including buildings, accessory
                     structures, kiosks, gates, bridges, etc. Incorporate historic review into ADR
                     design guidelines and consider the development of findings as part of the
                     Town record for disclosure at resale, indicating that the home or site carries
                     special significance to the town and therefore has special requirements for
                     future renovation or alteration.
 Medium-Term Actions
                     4.C Map Archaeologically Sensitive Areas. Consult with the Federated Indians
                     of Graton Rancheria, the Northwest Information Center of the California
                     Historical Resources Information System, and other resources to develop a
                     map of potentially sensitive archaeological areas that can be used to identify
                     locations where an archaeological inventory may be necessary prior to
                     approval of development activity.
                     6.B Develop Rules Regarding Site Runoff. Develop guidelines that limit the
                     coverage of impervious surfaces, that require the use of permeable surfaces,
                     that implement other regulations to effectively channel and minimize site
                     runoff, and that allow water to percolate into the ground.
                     6.C Develop Regional Land Use Regulation. Work with other Ross Valley
                     jurisdictions to explore and adopt land use regulations to minimize additional
                     runoff, or reduce runoff, within the Ross Valley watershed.
                     8.B Modify Downtown Commercial Zoning. Revise commercial zoning in the
                     Downtown to prohibit offices in storefront locations, to encourage mixed
                     use housing, and to encourage uses that are local-serving and would
                     contribute to the vitality of downtown.
                     8.D Investigate Enforcement Methods. Review enforcement needs as part of the
                     development of design guidelines and other programs intended to refine
                     Town practices for application review and approval.

                 Ross General Plan Vision
                            for the Year 2025
Visioning is a way of looking at the future and our ability to define a future state. A vision
statement, in its simplest terms, is one’s ability to define a future state. A community visioning
event was held in 2005. The visioning ideas of the community have been incorporated into each
general plan issue topic section.
                           Our Vision of Ross in Year 2025
                           Set in a valley between open hillsides, Ross enjoys a
                           natural environment where cultural and civic activities are
                           encouraged and thrive. There’s an abundance of green
                      from tree-lined streets, parks and open space, to healthy creeks
                      and watershed. Ross has maintained access to open space for
                      all people, not just its residents, but this access should not disturb
                      the privacy or peaceful enjoyment of the Town by its residents.
General Plan Proper management of the eco-system helps to prevent erosion
     2007 - 2025
                      and excess stormwater runoff, reduces ambient temperatures,
retains natural habitat for wildlife and birds, and enhances the beauty of the
natural landscape.
To perpetuate the health of our community, we have followed environmentally
sustainable management and development policies with regard to our environment.
The natural environment for plant and animal health and habitat is not to be
compromised. The Town has developed and follows policies for “green” building.
We have worked to reduce our ecological footprint by shifting our reliance away
from fossil fuels toward renewable sources of energy and by ameliorating the
local conditions that contribute to global warming.
The Town has encouraged diversity in home design. While design review is
based in part on the need to preserve architectural features that serve as significant
reminders of the past, it nevertheless encourages 21st century creativity. The Town
                           Appendix B — Ross General Plan Vision for the Year 2025 — Page B-

has made investments in infrastructure resulting in architecture and landscaping
that promote the aesthetic and sustainable needs of the community.
Each neighborhood shows pride of community through maintenance and design
quality. Our government responds to changing needs and is grounded in the
recognition that creating and maintaining a quality environment in which to live
is everyone’s job.
Advisory Design Review (ADR) has been established to assist applicants, staff and
Town Council with the permit process. ADR helps maintain and apply consistent
guidelines for architectural and landscape design.
The architectural and environmental ambiance that attracted caring residents to
Ross since the Town’s incorporation in 1908 have been preserved through a
tradition of stewardship that has guided the decisions of the Town Council. Ross
Recreation, the Marin Art & Garden Center, Town parks, Natalie Coffin Greene
Park, Phoenix Lake and proximity to the College of Marin are among the resources
that provide cultural, educational and recreational opportunities.
The Lagunitas Bridge, symbolic entry to the Town proper, has been rebuilt to
mitigate flood and seismic concerns. The new bridge maintains the character
and style of the old bridge, and is consistent with the style of other bridges in
Town that were designed by John Buck Leonard. The peaceful ambience of the
Ross Common provides the focal point for the community.
The health and safety of the community are critical concerns. We have worked
to prepare and practice emergency response and to minimize risks of fire danger
by emphasizing responsible landscaping practices (especially in the steeper, less
accessible areas of the Town). Additionally, we have worked to minimize noise
pollution.
Flood control improvements have been made and a new creek management
program has been completed. All new structures are above the 100-year flood
elevation in the Downtown area and in new and remodeled houses located along
the creeks and in the low areas. Houses in the floodplain have been granted
expedited Council approval to be raised above flood levels and all businesses
have installed flood protection mitigation. Specific standards for upstream
mitigation and drainage system restoration have been implemented and overall
runoff reduced.

Measures are in place to keep our streets and walkways safe for adults, children,
pedestrians, bikers and the disabled. We have developed safe bicycle routes
and provided bicycle racks in public areas, including the Downtown, parks,
schools and the post office. Drivers and cyclists are careful to “share the road.”
Everyone observes traffic signs, signals and rules, with consistent enforcement by
Public Safety.
As citizens of Ross we are dedicated to leaving our community a better and more
beautiful place than we found it. Our neighborly connections, historic heritage,
sense of community, natural ecological environments, attractive neighborhoods,
local businesses and Town services all work well together.
The Ross Common is where Town residents participate in community celebrations
throughout the year, including the annual Ross Town dinner, and the Fourth of July
parade and picnic. Next to The Common is the Ross School. We recognize the
importance of Ross School to our community. Maintaining the school’s academic
excellence is a goal of everyone in Town. The Ross Post Office is an informal
gathering place for the community and a place where residents can maintain their
connection to the community as a whole.
The commercial downtown area has two-and three-story buildings that are home
to an eclectic variety of retail stores, restaurants and professional offices. The
Town encourages the community to support these businesses in order to maintain
their viability and to sustain a timeless “country village” appeal to the Downtown
area.
We visualize Ross in 2025 as a friendly and welcoming Town that encourages
interaction and community involvement. The population is diverse and welcomes
people of all races, ages, creeds and ethnic backgrounds. All members of
the community treat others with friendly respect. Our amicable and considerate
demeanor significantly influences the behavior of our children. There is a feeling
of inclusion in the community that translates into the opportunity for everyone to
participate in the civic and community life of the Town.
The Town has obtained funding to provide affordable housing for teachers, Ross
Town personnel and others. Some of the affordable housing units are apartments
above the retail establishments.

The General Plan is a strategic document that identifies commitments to action
and implementation goals. It is a blueprint for the adoption of ordinances and
for establishing Town Council and staff work priorities.
The planning and permitting process is transparent, understandable and objective.
Decisions are based on staff and design review recommendations, familiarity with
the General Plan and sound judgment. Applicants for variances or use permits are
assisted by staff and the Town’s Advisory Design Review Committee (ADR), and
are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the process for obtaining variances
and permits. The process is simplified and efficient.
