                                            HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
   Recognizing the importance of providing adequate housing in all communities, the State of California has
   mandated a Housing Element within every General Plan since 1969. The Housing Element is one of the
   seven elements required by the state. Article 10.6, Section 65580–65589.8, Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of
   the Government Code sets forth the legal requirements of the Housing Element and encourages the
   provision of affordable and decent housing in all communities to meet statewide goals. Specifically, Section
   65580 states the element shall consist of “an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing
   needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources and scheduled programs for
   the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.” The element must also contain a five-year
   housing plan with quantified objectives for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Housing
   Element. The contents of the element must be consistent with the other elements of the General Plan.
   Meeting the housing needs established by the State of California is an important goal for the City of
   Hughson. As the population of the state continues to grow and scarce resources decline, it becomes more
   difficult for local agencies to create adequate housing opportunities while maintaining a high standard of
   living for all citizens in the community.
   This Housing Element (2009–2014) was created in compliance with state General Plan law pertaining to
   Housing Elements and was adopted by the Hughson City Council on August 24, 2009.
   The data used in preparing the Housing Needs Assessment was taken from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census,
   State Department of Finance, Stanislaus Council of Governments (StanCOG), 2008 Claritas Report,
   Employment Development Department, and the California Department of Housing and Community
   Development. While the U.S. Census is still considered the most reliable source of demographic information,
   it has now been ten years since the data was collected and therefore the validity of the numbers has lessened.
   To correct this, the City has used 2008 projections provided by Claritas, a data collection firm. The Claritas
   numbers use 2000 Census data as a baseline for these projections. For a complete list of data sources and
   Housing Element acronyms see Appendix A and Appendix B.
   PURPOSE
   The State of California has declared that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide importance and the
   early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a
   priority of the highest order.” In addition, government and the private sector should make an effort to provide
   a diversity of housing opportunities and accommodate regional housing needs through a cooperative effort,
   while maintaining a responsibility toward economic, environmental, fiscal factors and community goals within
   the General Plan.
   Further, state Housing Element law requires “an assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources
   and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.” The law requires:
        •    An analysis of population and employment trends
        •    An analysis of the City’s fair share of the regional housing needs
        •    An analysis of household characteristics

                    HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
       •    An inventory of suitable land for residential development
       •    An analysis of the governmental and non-governmental constraints on the improvement,
            maintenance, and development of housing
       •    An analysis of special housing needs
       •    An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation
       •    An analysis of publicly assisted housing developments that may convert to non-assisted housing
            developments
   The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and projected housing
   needs within the community and to set forth policies and schedules which promote preservation,
   improvement, and development of diverse types and costs of housing throughout Hughson.
   ORGANIZATION
   Hughson’s Housing Element is organized into five primary sections:
   Introduction: This section analyzes the purpose, organization, relationship to other elements, public
   participation and the Review of Previous Housing Element.
   Housing Needs Assessment: This section includes an analysis of the City's demographic profile,
   housing characteristics, and existing and future housing needs 
   Housing Resources: This section includes a discussion of Hughson’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation
   (RHNA), land availability, and financial resources.
   Housing Constraints: This section identifies potential governmental and non-governmental
   constraints, such as land use controls, fees and exactions, permit processing, land and construction costs,
   and availability of financing.
   Housing Program: This section identifies housing goals, policies and objectives. Funding sources are
   identified and schedules for implementation are set forth. In addition, a quantified objectives summary is
   provided.
   RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
   State law requires that “the General Plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated,
   internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies.” The purpose of requiring internal
   consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for the future maintenance,
   improvement, and development of housing within the City.
   This Housing Element is part of a comprehensive Hughson General Plan. All elements of the Hughson
   General Plan have been reviewed for consistency, and the Housing Element was prepared to assure
   compatibility with the remaining elements.

                                          HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
   State law requires that "the local government shall make a diligent effort to achieve public participation
   of all economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element . . .”
   (Government Code §65583).
   In order to satisfy this requirement, the City conducted a series of community meetings and public
   hearings to receive community input concerning Hughson's housing goals and policies. Descriptions of
   these meetings are listed below. In addition, City staff posted notices at the City Hall, Developments
   Services and published notices in the Hughson Chronicle, and used letters and verbal notices to inform
   housing advocacy groups, property owners, and community members to publicize meetings dates for
   study sessions and public hearings. Notices for the May 19th Planning Commission Workshop were
   published in the Hughson Chronicle on May 12th and on May 19th and 2nd for the June 8th City Council
   Hearing. In addition, in the May 19th issue of the Chronicle, the editor also included a front page article
   on the Housing Element Update. (See Appendix C for the Housing Element mailing list)
   Public Meetings
   Planning Commission Workshop, May 19, 2009 - The City’s consultant made a presentation to the
   Planning Commission and general public including an overview of the update process, an outline of
   State housing law, and a description of the required components of the Housing Element Background
   Report and Policy Document. At the conclusion of the presentation, Commissioners had time to
   discuss any housing related concerns in the City and potential changes or additional to policies and
   programs. The comments received at the meeting included general questions and comments about the
   Housing Element process. Once specific question asked was in regards to whether single-parents
   households include single-person households, this answer was addressed in Table 11 Household Type
   and Presence of Children under 18 years of age. Single-person households are called out as a separate
   category.
   City Council Hearing, June 8, 2009 - The City’s consultant made a presentation that included an
   overview of the update process, an outline of State housing law, and a description of the required
   components of the Housing Element Background Report and Policy Document. At the conclusion of
   the presentation, City Council members had time to discuss any housing related concerns in the City and
   potential changes or additional to policies and programs. There were no comments or questions received
   by staff or the consultant.
   City Council Hearing- TBD
   Public Survey
   In an effort to solicit input from stakeholders who may not have been able to attend the public hearings
   held prior to submitting the Housing Element to the State for review, the City made the draft Housing
   Element available for review at the City of Hughson Development Services, the City Library, City Hall
   and was available on CD upon request at Development Services. Accompanying the Housing Element
   was a brief questionnaire to gather input on the document. The survey is outlined below and shows the
   input gathered as well as how the City incorporated the input.

                  HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
       1. Please list which group or groups in Hughson currently have the greatest housing
           needs:
               •   Low-income families,
               •   Hispanic families and
               •   Unemployed persons
       2. In the space below, please indicate any comments or concerns that you have with the
           Draft Housing Element:
           Response 1: The Housing Element covers most of the important policies but I am a little
                         concerned about programs needed to make housing affordable. I’m worried that
                         people will leave the area because the housing prices are too high.
           Response 2: My concern is about how long it’s taking and no changes have really benefited the
                         community.
       3. Are you currently involved in a community based organization?
               •   Hughson Family Resource Center.
   Housing Element Response: The City of Hughson is committed to assisting with the development of
   affordable housing through the implementation of Goal 1 and the associated policies and programs that
   encourage and help facilitate the development of affordable housing to low-income households.

          REVIEW OF PREVIOUS ELEMENT
          Government Code, Section 65588(a)(2) “Review and Revision” requires that each local government review its Housing Element as frequently as
          appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community’s housing goals and objectives. This section
          reflects the actual housing activities that were accomplished since the last Housing Element.

   HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
   Household type and size, income levels, the presence of special needs populations, and other household
   characteristics determine the type of housing needed by residents. This section details the various
   household characteristics affecting housing needs.
   Household Type
   The Census defines a “household” as any group of people occupying a housing unit, which may include
   single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons who share
   living quarters. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or other group living
   situations are not considered households. Household characteristics are important indicators of the type
   and size of housing needed in a community.
   The change in the number of households in a city is one of the prime determinants of the demand for
   housing. Households can form even in periods of static population growth as adult children leave home,
   through divorce, and with the aging of the population.
   The 2008 Claritas Report indicates that 2,028 households lived in Hughson as of 2008. Approximately
   96 percent of those households consisted of families, while 4 percent were non-family households.
   There was an increase of 160 percent in families with children between 2000 and 2008 (Table 11).

   As a percentage, household composition in Hughson has remained stable since 2000, as shown in Table
   11. However, in absolute terms, there have been increases in all household types, especially families with
   children.

   Persons per household is an important indicator of the relationship between population growth and
   household formation. For example, if the number of persons per household is decreasing, then
   households are forming at a faster rate than population growth. Conversely, if the population were
   growing faster than the households, then the persons per household would be increasing.
   Shown is Table 12 below, between 1990 and 2000, persons per household slightly increased for the City
   of Hughson and Stanislaus County. Specifically, households increased from 3.2 to 3.3 persons per
   household. The increase in persons per household indicates that the population increased at a faster pace
   than the household formation between 1990 and 2000. Since there had been little housing development
   during that period, the increase in population can be attributed to natural increases.
   More recently, the persons per household rate has remained stagnant in the City of Hughson and
   Stanislaus County. According to the 2000 Census, there were 3.3 persons per household in the City, which was
   only an increase of 0.1 since 1990. Currently, the persons per household ratio remains at 3.3. There were
   3.1 persons per household in Stanislaus County in 2000.

    In addition to the persons per household figures, household size helps to determine the size of
    housing units needed within a jurisdiction. In the City of Hughson, “large” households, containing five or
    more persons, represented 22 percent of all households in 2008 (Table 13). Households with three to
    four persons were the fastest growing household size component between 1990 and 2000, increasing from
    33 percent in 1990 to 37 percent in 2000. Small households decreased from 46 percent to 42 percent in the
    same time period.
    Household sizes in Stanislaus County vary from those in the City of Hughson. For example, one- and
    two-person households comprised 50 percent of the households in Stanislaus County in 2000.
    Additionally, larger households, having five or more persons, represented 19 percent in the County, in
    2000, compared to 21 percent in the City of Hughson.

   Household Income
   Area Median Incomes (AMI) are estimated and published annually by the Department of Housing and
   Community Development (HCD). The Area Median Income is used to classify households into income
   groups consistent with government codes. Table 14 shows the maximum household income levels by
   household size.
   HCD has established the standard income groups. They are defined as Extremely Low- Income, households
   earning less than 30 percent of the AMI; Very Low- Income, households earning between 30 percent and 50
   percent of the AMI; Low-Income, households earning between 50 percent and 80 percent of the AMI;
   Moderate- Income, households earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of the AMI; Above Moderate-
   Income, households earning over 120 percent of the AMI. Generally, these income groups are used to
   determine household eligibility for all federal and local government housing assistance programs.
   Based on the 2008 HCD Income Limits based on the AMI and household income table, the proportion of
   very low-income groups has increased. The 2008 median household income for Stanislaus County was $56,500.
   As of 2008, approximately 37 percent of households in Hughson were classified as extremely low-income and
   very low-income (Table 15).

   Poverty
   Table 18 shows that approximately 16 percent of the total family households in the City of Hughson
   were below the 2000 Census poverty level. Of these, 43 percent (69 households) were female-headed
   households. Of these female-headed households, 38 percent (61 households) had children under 18
   years of age.
   In 2008, the number of female-headed households in poverty increased in number and percentage and
   the number of female-headed households with children under 18 in poverty also increased. The number
   of families in poverty and families with children under 18 in poverty increased in number, but not in
   percentage.

   SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
   Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding acceptable, affordable housing due to special
   circumstances relating to employment and income, household characteristics, and disabilities, among
   others. These “special needs” groups include seniors, persons with disabilities, large households, single-
   parent households (female-headed households with children, in particular), homeless persons, and
   agricultural workers. This section discusses the housing needs facing each group, as well as programs
   and services available to address the housing needs.
   Senior Households
   Many elderly households live in housing that is too expensive or does not accommodate specific needs
   for assistance. Due to various circumstances, an elderly household may have difficulties staying in their
   home community or near family. The purpose of this section is to determine the housing needs for all
   needs segments of the elderly community. The senior population is defined as persons over the age of
   65 years.
   Shown in Table 19 below, in 1990, there were 385 seniors in Hughson, which represented 12 percent of
   the total population in the City. Between 1990 and 2000, the senior population increased at a rate of less
   than 1 percent annually. In 2008, the senior population increased significantly to 608 people (59
   percent).

   In 1990, 17 percent of senior households were renters. In the state as a whole, 28 percent of senior
   households were renters, while 12 percent of Stanislaus County senior households rented their housing.
   Change in the proportion of senior renters is dependent on the quantity of housing options and the
   propensity to convert from ownership. In 2000, the proportion of the City’s senior renters increased to
   18 percent from 17 percent in 1990. Table 20 below, Householders by Tenure by Age, shows that there was
   a 29 percent decrease in senior households during this period. While the numerical decrease in senior
   households was close to one-third, the numerical decrease in rental households decreased by one-tenth.
   Therefore, more senior households are renting rather than owning and none live in group quarters. This
   could indicate that the elderly population is facing more economic challenges.

   An important statistic to measure the affordability of housing for senior citizens is “overpayment,”
   which is defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30 percent of a household’s gross income.
   According to 2000 CHAS data (see Table 22), shows that of senior homeowners, 91 percent (40
   households) are very low- or low-income households and 68 percent (130 households) of owner
   households are very low- and low-income households.

   Disabled Persons
   There are three types of disabled persons that are considered as having special housing needs: physically
   impaired, mentally disabled, and developmentally disabled. Each type is unique and requires specific
   attention in terms of access to housing, employment, social services, medical services, and accessibility
   within housing.
   The 2000 Census defines disability as a mental, physical, or health condition that lasts over six months.
   There are three types of disabilities: work disability, mobility limitation, and self-care limitation.
   Work disability – Refers to a condition lasting more than six months that restricts a person’s choice of
   work and prevents that person from working full time.
   Mobility limitation – Refers to a physical or mental condition lasting more than six months that makes
   it difficult for a person to go outside the home alone.
   Self-care limitation – Refers to a physical or mental condition lasting more than six months that makes
   it difficult to take care of one’s personal needs.
   In 2000, a total of 1,480 persons in the City had some type of disability. Of these, 72 percent or 1,067
   persons were between the ages of 5 and 64 and the remaining 413 or 28 percent were 65 years of age or
   older (see Table 25).
   According to the 2000 Census, 52 percent of persons 16 to 64 years of age with a work disability were
   employed. This is far below the overall employment rate of 86 percent. In Stanislaus County, there are
   several organizations that offer employment services such as the Disability Resource Agency for
   Independent Living and the Howard Training Center in Modesto.

   Types of disabilities are listed to determine needs that can be met by the City of Hughson. The total
   disabilities for people ages 5-64 account for 1,067 people or 72 percent. The total disabilities for people
   ages 65+ are 413 or 28 percent. In the age group of 5-64, the largest percentage of disabilities includes
   employment disability, followed by physical disability and mental disability. In the 65+ age group, the
   highest percentage of disabilities includes physical disability followed by sensory disability. Based on this
   information, programs to aid people ages 5-64 with disability may include housing rehabilitation to aid
   people experiencing architectural barriers. Additionally, this age group may need assistance with housing
   costs due to employment disability. People aged 65+ also have a large number of physical and sensory
   disabilities. Housing rehabilitation programs that aid in the removal of architectural barriers would aid
   the majority of those with disability in this age group.

   There are two approaches to housing design for those residents with disabilities: adaptability and
   accessibility. Adaptable housing is a design concept in which a dwelling unit contains design features that
   allow for accessibility and use by mobility-impaired individuals with only minor modifications. An
   accessible unit has the actual special features installed in the house (grab-bars, special cabinetry).
   To address the need for the adaptability and accessibility of housing by mobility-impaired individuals,
   the California Department of Housing and Community Development has adopted a series of
   requirements for new rental housing. These regulations implement most of the requirements of federal
   law for federally financed housing projects, plus several additional requirements. California law requires

   that 5 percent of the dwelling units in a newly constructed apartment building, hotel, motel, lodge, or
   other rental project include design features for adaptable use by mobility-impaired individuals.
   The state requirements address exterior and interior design features, such as walkways leading to a
   dwelling unit, the gradient of the access way to the main entrance, changes in level, entry width,
   threshold height, ramp and landing design, corridor widths, types of door locks and latches, electrical
   outlet and switch heights, bathroom configuration and clear space, ability to install grab-bars in bathrooms,
   knee space under lavatories and sinks, the height of countertops, the configuration of a kitchen, and
   other aspects of housing design.
   Large Households
   For the purposes of this section, large households are defined as households consisting of five or more
   persons. Generally, the needs of large families are not targeted in the housing market, especially in the
   multifamily market. This subsection explores the availability of large housing units in Hughson.
   Large households often have lower incomes, which frequently result in overcrowding, smaller dwelling
   units, and the acceleration of unit deterioration. According to the 2000 Census, shown in Table 26,
   there were 266 large households in the City and 113 housing units with four or more bedrooms. This
   would indicate an inadequate number of large housing units available in the City. Since the 2000 Census,
   the number of large households has stayed relatively constant in Hughson with the demand for larger
   units remaining the same.

   Farmworkers
   Estimating farmworkers and those households associated with farm work within the state is extremely
   difficult. Generally, the farmworker population contains two segments of farmworkers: permanent and
   migratory (seasonal) farmworkers. The permanent population consists of farmworkers who have settled
   in the region and maintain local residence and who are employed most of the year. The migratory
   farmworker population consists of those farmworkers who typically migrate to the region during
   seasonal periods in search of farm labor employment.
   While the City of Hughson’s primary industries are services and manufacturing, the City is located in the
   heart of the San Joaquin Valley, which is prime agricultural land. Within the City of Hughson, it is
   reported that almonds, walnuts, and peaches are the primary crops. These crops require most labor
   during the summer and fall for harvesting, irrigating, and weeding, but there is also some work that is
   done later in the winter and in the early spring. According to the 2008 Claritas Report (see Table 27), 5
   percent of the City’s labor force was employed in the Farming, Fishing, and Forestry occupation, which
   is a decrease since 2000. Since there are not any fishing or forestry industries in the City, it is assumed
   that all 156 persons were employed as farmworkers.

   Farmworker Housing
   The City of Hughson does not have any formal group housing for farm laborers or seasonal workers,
   although there are three sets of small identical single-family homes, totaling approximately 18 units, that
   are either considered to be farmworker housing by the owner or primarily rent to permanent
   farmworkers. These homes are located on 6760 Walker Lane, 6773 Locust Street, and First Street.
   Because the percentage of the City’s farmworker population is small and has been decreasing, the
   housing needs of this group have generally been addressed through low-income housing and rental
   housing.
   Although there is no farmworker-designated housing within the City, farmworker housing can be found
   in the unincorporated community of Empire and the cities of Modesto and Ceres. Table 28 provides
   details of migrant and permanent farmworker-designated housing in Stanislaus County. In addition, to
   comply with Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the Health and Safety Code, Program 1-7-6 states the
   City will amend the Zoning Code to specifically define farmworker housing and allow for farmworker
   housing in the R-1 zone.

   Single-Parent Households
   Single-parent households have special needs due to the need for reasonable health care, day care, and
   affordable housing. A significant proportion of single-parent households have a female as the head of
   household. Female-headed households with children often have lower incomes, limiting their access to
   available housing.
   According to the 2008 Claritas Report, there were 932 family households with children under the age of
   18, an increase of 60 percent since 2000. Of the 932 households, 174 (9 percent) were female-headed
   households and 118 (6 percent) were male-headed households.
   Homeless Persons
   There are generally two types of homeless: the “permanent homeless,” who are on the streets and thus
   the most visible homeless population, and the “temporary homeless,” who are homeless usually due to
   eviction and may stay with friends, family, or in a shelter or motel until they can find a permanent
   residence.
   City staff and the Hughson Police Department estimate the number of homeless persons living in Hughson
   to be zero to two persons. In January 2007, a count conducted by the Housing Authority of Stanislaus
   County for HUD showed there were 20 fewer homeless persons in 2007 than in 2005, which is a 1
   percent decrease. The 2007 figures suggest that 9,000 homeless persons exist in the County. The number
   of families in transitional housing increased 64 percent in 2007 compared with 39 percent in 2005, while
   the number in emergency shelters decreased. The street population decreased by 2.5 percent. Behavioral
   Health houses 270 people.
   City staff and the Hughson Police Department estimate the number of homeless persons living in
   Hughson to be zero to two persons. Several services are available to the homeless, as well as to low-

   program, offered by the United Samaritans Foundation (USF) at 2413 3rd Street. The Social and Human
   Service Agency in Hughson offers referrals to those who are in need of emergency shelter.
   Housing Assistance and Shelters
   Services for the homeless are generally provided by the County. As a result, the information for
   homeless facilities and shelters in the Stanislaus County area is collected and reported for the County as
   a whole. The City currently does not have a need for homeless shelters. However, temporary shelter and
   services to the homeless and displaced are provided within the County.
   In Hughson, the United Samaritans Foundation offers referral services, a clothes closet, a food box
   program twice a month, and a daily lunch on wheels program for the homeless and low-income families.
   The homeless are generally referred to the Salvation Army, Gospel Mission, or Community Housing and
   Shelter Service in Modesto, as well as to the Social and Human Service Agency in Hughson. The
   Stanislaus County Homeless Assistance Program provides homeless families receiving support from the
   Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program with money for housing, temporary shelter,
   and/or first and last month rent and deposit.
   The following (Table 29) is a list of emergency assistance and shelters for persons in need of transitional

   HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
   This section addresses the various housing characteristics and conditions, including the housing stock
   growth trends, tenure and vacancy rates, age and condition, housing costs, and affordability, among
   others.
   Housing Type
   The proportion of units by housing type has remained stable through the last 20 years. Single-family
   units comprise the majority of the housing stock within the City. According to the 2000 Census,
   Hughson had a total of 1,252 housing units, of which 1,223 were occupied. Of these units, 810 were
   owner-occupied and 413 were renter-occupied. In 2008, according to the State Department of Finance,
   there were 1,937 housing units, a 3 percent increase since 2000 (see Table 30).

   Housing Tenure
   Tenure or the ratio between homeowner and renter households can be affected by many factors, such as
   housing cost (interest rates, economics, land supply, and development constraints), housing type,
   housing availability, job availability, and consumer preference.
   Table 31 below shows that between 1990 and 2000, the proportion of renter households in Hughson
   decreased slightly from 35 percent to 34 percent. However, this decrease in renter households may
   partially be attributed to the lack of multifamily units within the City

   In comparison to the City, the County has a higher proportion of renter households. For example, in
   1990 the County had 4 percent more renters than the City. In 2000, the County had 38 percent renters
   versus 39 percent in 1990. Although the rate of renters in the County has been decreasing over the last
   decade, the difference in the proportion of renters between the County and the City is increasing. In
   2000, 33 percent of Hughson households were renters, while renter households represented 38 percent
   of Stanislaus County, a difference of 5 percent.

   Overcrowding
   The Census defines an overcrowded unit as one occupied by 1.01 persons or more per room (excluding
   bathrooms and kitchens). Units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered severely
   overcrowded.
   In 1990, 10 percent of all households in the City were considered overcrowded. By 2000, the percentage
   increased to 15 percent, or 186, overcrowded units (see Table 32). Overcrowded housing in the City is
   more critical for renter households, because more renter households than owner households live in
   overcrowded conditions. The percentage of overcrowded units for renters was 9 percent versus 6 percent
   for owner-occupied units. The increase in overcrowding can mainly be attributed to the lack of housing
   units with four or more bedrooms, in addition to no multifamily units existing in the City with three or more
   bedrooms. More multifamily units can be targeted for larger households along with single-family households.

   Vacancy Trends
   Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using a “vacancy rate” which establishes the relationship
   between housing supply and demand. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the
   available supply, then the vacancy rate is low and the price of housing will most likely increase.
   Additionally, the vacancy rate indicates whether or not the City has an adequate housing supply to
   provide choice and mobility. HUD standards indicate that a vacancy rate of 5 percent is sufficient to
   provide choice and mobility.
   In 2000, the Census reported a vacancy rate of 2.3 percent. The California State Department of Finance
   (DOF) Population Research Unit publishes an annual estimate of population, housing units, vacancy,
   and household size for all incorporated cities in the state. In 2008, the DOF estimated the vacancy rate
   for Hughson to be 3.3 percent. It should be noted that the DOF estimate is for all housing unit types
   and does not exclude seasonal, recreational, or occasional use. Table 34 shows the characteristics of the
   City’s vacant housing units per the 2000 Census.

   HOUSING CONDITIONS
   In May of 2009, a survey of Hughson was conducted to identify the general housing conditions. The
   condition of housing was assessed by an exterior survey of quality, condition, and improvement needed.
   Each residential structure was scored according to structural criteria established by the California
   Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). There are five structural categories
   (foundation, roofing, siding, windows, and electrical). Based on scores assigned to the five categories,
   each housing structure was rated as being in sound or dilapidated condition, or in need of minor,
   moderate, or substantial repairs. Through this analysis, the City is able to identify specific rehabilitation
   needs and formulate efforts to meet such needs. The majority of units were found to be in sound
   condition with a few units in need of substantial repair and some in need of minor and moderate repair.
   Tables 35, 36 and 37 below provide a more detailed analysis.
   DEFINITION OF HOUSING CONDITIONS
   SOUND- a unit that appears new or well maintained and structurally intact. The foundation should
   appear structurally undamaged and there should be straight roof lines. Siding, windows, and doors
   should be in good repair with good exterior paint condition. Minor problems such as small areas of
   peeling paint and/or other maintenance items are allowable under this category.
   MINOR- a unit that show signs of deferred maintenance, or which needs only one major component,
   such as a roof.
   MODERATE- a unit in need of replacement of one or more major components and other repairs, such
   as roof replacement, painting, and window repairs.

                   HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   SUBSTANTIAL- a unit that requires replacement of several major systems and possibly other repairs
   (e.g. complete foundation work, roof structure replacement and re-roofing, as well as painting and
   window replacement).
   DILAPIDATED- a unit suffering from excessive neglect, where the building appears structurally
   unsound and maintenance is non-existent, not fit for human habitation in its current condition, may be
   considered for demolition or at minimum, major rehabilitation will be required.
   Detailed Survey Results
   Many of the homes surveyed in the City of Hughson were categorized as sound, or minor. Two (2)
   percent of the surveyed units were found to be in need of substantial repair and none of the surveyed
   units were found to be in dilapidated condition. Table 35 illustrates the overall condition of all of the
   homes surveyed in the City. Ninety-one (91) percent of the homes surveyed in Hughson were in sound
   condition or needed minor repairs. A house in sound condition is well maintained and structurally
   intact. This includes a good foundation, straight roof lines, good exterior paint condition and siding,
   and windows and doors that are in good repair. Homes in sound condition may have minor
   maintenance needs or require some paint or siding repair. Homes deemed to be in need of minor
   repairs require general maintenance or one major repair such as a new roof.
   Roughly seven (7) percent of the remaining homes surveyed were in moderate condition, which means
   they are in need of one or more major repairs, such as a roof replacement and window repair or
   replacement.

   Eighty-three (83) percent of all surveyed structures were single-family homes with attached or detached
   garages. Table 36 illustrates that ninety five (95) percent of the single-family homes surveyed were in
   sound or minor condition. This means little maintenance, if any, was needed. Four (4) percent of the
   homes required moderate repairs. There was only one single-family home found to be in need of
   substantial repair.

   As shown in Table 37, there were 9 duplex units surveyed. Thirty-three (33) percent of the duplexes
   assessed were found to be in sound condition, which is significantly less than the percentage of single-
   family units in sound condition. The percentage (56 percent) of units in minor condition is more than
   twice the percentage as single-family homes (24 percent) in minor condition. The percentage (11
   percent) of moderate condition duplexes is far higher than the percentage of single-family homes in
   moderate condition (4 percent) meaning that there is a higher need for duplexes in Hughson to have
   major components of the structure replaced.

   HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
   One of the major barriers to housing availability is the cost of housing. In order to provide housing to
   all economic levels in the community, a wide variety of housing opportunities at various prices should be
   made available. Housing affordability is dependent upon income and housing costs. According to the
   HCD income guidelines for 2008, the Area Median Income (AMI) in Stanislaus County was $56,500.
   Table 39 below describes the income limits for a four-person household based on the median income.

   Affordability
   Affordability is defined as a household spending under 30 percent or less of household income for
   housing. The price for housing is defined as gross rent or gross monthly owner costs. Gross rent is the
   contract rent, plus utilities. In most cases, the contract rent includes payment for water, sewer, and
   garbage. “Gross monthly owner costs” includes mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities,
   condominium fees, and site rent for mobile homes.
   Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in Stanislaus
   County with the maximum affordable housing costs to households at different income levels. Taken
   together, this information can generally show who can afford what size and type of housing and indicate
   the type of households that are most likely to experience overcrowding or overpayment.
   While housing costs for rental units are estimated to be affordable at 30 percent of gross income,
   households are generally able to obtain a mortgage loan based on 35 percent of gross income. This is

   subject to individual credit and budgeting conditions, and those with less revolving loan-type debt can
   usually find financing for a more expensive home.
   In evaluating affordability, the maximum affordable price refers to the maximum amount that could be
   afforded by households in the upper range of their respective income category. Households in the lower
   end of each category can afford less in comparison. The maximum affordable home and rental prices for
   residents of Stanislaus County are shown in Table 44 and Table 45. HCD has estimated the 2008
   County Area Median Income (AMI) to be $54,500.

   Overpayment
   Generally, overpayment for housing is based on the total cost of shelter compared to a household’s
   ability to pay. Overpayment is an important measure of the affordability within the City of Hughson.
   Specifically, overpayment is defined as a household spending more than 30 percent of household
   income for shelter. According to the Census, shelter cost is the monthly owner costs (mortgages, deeds
   of trust, contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes, insurance on the property) or
   the net rent (contract rent) plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities.
   In 2000, a total of 378 (over 30 percent) of all households in the City of Hughson paid in excess of 30
   percent of their income for housing. Owners had a higher percentage of households overpaying, with 20
   percent, while only 14 percent of renters overpaid. The overpayment situation is particularly critical for
   renters with annual incomes less than $20,000. Table 46 illustrates the extent of overpayment by income
   group for the City.

    The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), which was developed by the Department
    of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to assist jurisdictions in writing their consolidated plans,
    has special tabulation data based on the 2000 Census. According to this data, there were 77 owner-
    occupied households and 117 renter-occupied households earning less than 50 percent of the Median
    Family Income (MFI) in the City in 2000. Of these, 117 owner-occupied households and 77 renter-
    occupied households fell into the extremely low-income category, earned less than 30 percent of the
    MFI.

                    HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   Assisted Housing Inventory and At-risk Housing
   California Housing Element law requires all jurisdictions to include a study of all low-income housing
   units which may at some future time be lost to the affordable inventory by the expiration of some type
   of affordability restrictions. The law requires that the analysis and study cover a five-year and a ten-year
   period, coinciding with updates of the Housing Element. Following are some of the programs that may
   be expiring:
       •   Prepayment of HUD mortgages: Section 221(d)(3), Section 236, Section 202, and Section 811,
           and Farmers Home (RHS) Section 515/516 subsidies to tenants and/or owners.
       •   Low-income use restrictions on Section 236(j)(1) projects are for the full 40-year mortgage term.
           However, owners have the option to repay the remaining mortgage at the end of the first 20
           years.
       •   FHA-insured mortgages under the Section 221(d)(4) program have no binding use restrictions.
           The affordability of these projects is governed by the Section 8 contracts maintained on the
           projects which are now approved on a year-to-year basis.
       •   Opt-outs and expirations of project-based Housing Choice contracts – The Housing Choice
           Voucher program is a federally funded program that provides for subsidies to the owner of a
           prequalified project for the difference between the tenant’s ability to pay and the contract rent.
           Opt-outs occur when the owner of the project decides to opt out of the contract with HUD by
           prepaying the remainder of the mortgage. Usually, the likelihood of opt-outs increases as the
           market rents exceed the contract rents.
       •   Other – Expiration of the low-income use period of various financing sources, such as Low-
           Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), bond financing, density bonuses, California Housing
           Finance Agency (CHFA), Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME funds,
           and redevelopment funds. Generally, bond financing properties expire according to a qualified
           project period or when the bonds mature. Density bonus units expire in either 10 or 30 years,
           depending on the level of incentives. Also, properties funded through the Redevelopment
           Agency generally require an affordability term of 20 years.
   Inventory of At-Risk Rental Housing Units
   According to the California Housing Partnership Corporation, there are no government-assisted rental
   properties in the City of Hughson that may be at risk of opting out of programs that keep them
   affordable to very low- and low-income households over the five-year Housing Element Period (2009–
   2014). Generally, the inventory consists of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Redevelopment
   Agency, multifamily bonds, and density bonus properties. Target levels include the very low-income
   group and the low-income group.
   Preservation Resources
   Efforts by the City to retain low-income housing must be able to draw upon two basic types of
   preservation resources: organizational and financial. Qualified, nonprofit entities need to be made aware

   of the future possibilities of units becoming “at risk.” Should a property become at risk, the City
   maintains an active list of resources by which to preserve that property.
   In addition, the City of Hughson will develop procedures for monitoring and preserving at-risk units,
   which will include:
        •   Monitoring the Risk Assessment report published by the California Housing Partnership
            Corporation (CHPC).
        •   Maintain regular contact with the local HUD office regarding early warnings of possible opt-
            outs.
        •   Maintain contact with the owners and managers of existing affordable housing to determine if
            there are plans to opt out in the future and offer assistance in locating eligible buyers.
        •   Develop and maintain a list of potential purchasers of at-risk units and act as a liaison between
            owners and eligible purchasers (See Appendix D, List of Non-Profit Agencies).
        •   Ensure that all owners and managers of affordable housing are provided with applicable state
            and federal laws regarding notice to tenants of the owner’s desire to opt out or prepay. State law
            requires a 12-month notice.
   Redevelopment Agency
   The City of Hughson’s Redevelopment Agency provides staff support for administering rehabilitation
   and first-time homebuyer funds for low-income homeowners and housing programs. The City also
   applies for and receives CDBG funds and collects revenues on loan repayments that are circulated in the
   owner-occupied housing rehabilitation revolving loan fund. By state law, the Hughson Redevelopment
   Agency (RDA) will set aside 20 percent of the gross tax increment revenues received from the
   Redevelopment Area into a low- to moderate-income housing fund for affordable housing activities.
   Approximately $100,000 in loan revenues has been recirculated into the owner-occupied housing
   rehabilitation program. The City was awarded a HOME grant in 2008 in the amount of $400,000 which
   will be used for the First Time Homebuyer and owner-occupied housing programs. These funds will be
   used to preserve the existing affordable housing stock and for the creation of new affordable housing.
   Other redevelopment activities funded include open space acquisition, public utilities, street
   construction, circulation and traffic improvements, storm drainage facilities, and economic development.
   Redevelopment law requires that 15 percent of all housing within a project area be available at affordable
   cost. Of the 15 percent, 40 percent must be made available to persons of very low income. The City
   plans to update their 5-year Implementation Plan in 2010 and will ensure that it complements the goals,
   policies, and programs set forth in the Housing Element.
   The City has struggled to utilize its LMI Housing funds thus far. As a relatively new entity, the City’s
   Redevelopment Agency has had limited time to generate the amount of funds that would facilitate an
   affordable housing project. In addition, the Governor passed a budget in July 2009 that will take more
   than $200,000 from the City’s Redevelopment Agency funds. With an original budget of just over
   $800,000 and this $200,000 reduction, the City’s funding capabilities will be further restricted. While the
   City has the option of replacing this money by setting aside 30 percent instead of the usual 20 percent,
   the City will still have limited funds available to facilitate an entire housing project.

   SECTION 3 - HOUSING RESOURCES
   This section includes an evaluation of the availability of land resources, financial resources for future
   housing development, the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing needs, and the
   financial resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs. Additionally this
   section examines opportunities for energy conservation.
   REGIONAL HOUSING NEED
   The City of Hughson falls under the jurisdiction of the Stanislaus Council of Governments (StanCOG)
   that uses a predominantly demographic formula to allocate the regional housing needs among the
   incorporated cities and unincorporated county. This process results in a Regional Housing Needs
   Assessment (RHNA), and the number reflected in that assessment must be considered when the
   housing element is prepared. The current RHNA is for the 2007–2014 time frame.
   For the period 2007 to 2014, the City of Hughson has been given a construction need of 282 new
   housing units:
       •    33 housing units for extremely low-income households (below 30 percent of median income);
       •    33 housing units for very low-income households (30 to 50 percent of median income);
       •    46 housing units for low-income households (50 to 80 percent of median income);
       •    54 housing units for moderate-income households (80 to 120 percent of median income); and
       •    116 housing units for above moderate-income households (over 120 percent of median income).
   Housing constructed since January 2007 can be credited toward the City’s RHNA. Table 47 shows the
   progress the City has made toward its regional housing needs allocation.

   AVAILABILITY OF LAND
   To demonstrate the City’s capacity to potentially meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation, an
   adequate sites inventory was conducted. The sites listed in Table 49 are currently vacant and will allow
   for the development of a variety of housing types that will potentially meet the needs of all income
   groups as allocated by StanCOG for the 2007-2014 RHNA planning period.
   In addressing the estimated housing needs identified in the Housing Needs Assessment section of this
   Housing Element, Title 7 requires that this element contain “an inventory of land suitable for residential
   development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment.” This inventory must
   identify adequate sites which will be made available through appropriate zoning and development
   standards and with public services and facilities needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a
   variety of housing types for households of all income levels.
   The analysis of the relationship of suitable sites to zoning provides a means for determining the realistic
   number of dwelling units that could actually be constructed on those sites within the current planning
   period of the housing element. The analysis should also identify the zoning districts the locality believes
   can accommodate its share of the regional housing needs for all income levels.
   Realistic Capacity
   The Zoning Districts and General Plan land use designations are shown for each site and are used to
   determine the realistic unit capacity of each site. Realistic capacity for medium density residential (R-2)
   and low density residential (R-1) sites, was determined by multiplying the number of acres by the
   maximum density for the site, and then 75 percent of that result was used as the final realistic unit
   number. The realistic capacity for high density residential (R-3), was a more conservative approach. The
   City multiplying the number of acres by the HCD default density of 20 units to the acre and then 75
   percent of that number was used to determine the realistic unit number. The 75 percent assumption was
   derived from sample developments of what has been developed in Hughson and would be consistent
   with the General Plan and Zoning District designations.
           A project built in 2007 at 2220 and 2012 Charles Street contained two triplexes. One triplex was
            constructed on .15 acres in the R-3 zone, allowing 10-27 units per acre. This triplex was built at a
            density of 20 units to the acre having a capacity of 74 percent of the maximum density of this
            site. The second triplex was developed on .14 acres in the same zone (R-3) and was built at 21
            units to the acre, showing a 78 percent capacity of the maximum density of the site.
   Table 29 compares the City of Hughson’s RHNA to the site inventory capacity. Including the credit of
   1 unit funded with CDBG funds for a very low-income households, 43 market rate building permits and

   FINANCIAL RESOURCES
   The following is a list of potential financial resources considered a part of the City’s overall efforts and
   funding to retain and increase affordable housing units. The number and availability of programs to
   assist cities and counties are increasing and improving the affordable housing stock. The following lists
   the local, state, and federal resources, available to the City and housing developers that can provide
   financial or other assistance in the development, financing, and rehabilitation of housing for very low- to
   moderate-income households.
   Local Resources
   The Stanislaus County Housing Authority is a public agency that has provided subsidized housing to
   low- and moderate-income individuals and families. In addition to conventional public housing within
   Stanislaus County, the Housing Authority administers several rental assistance programs such as the
   Section 8/Housing Choice Voucher program. The Housing Authority receives federal and state
   assistance in order to operate these programs and, as such, is governed by any applicable housing
   regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and HCD.
   Public Housing was established to provide decent and safe rental housing for eligible families, the
   elderly, and persons with disabilities. Public housing comes in all sizes and types, from scattered single-
   family houses to apartments for elderly households. HUD administers federal aid to local housing
   agencies that manage the housing for residents at rents they can afford. HUD furnishes technical and
   professional assistance in planning, developing, and managing these developments.
   The Housing Choice Program, formally known as the Section 8 Program, is a partnership between
   private landlords, low-income families, and the Housing Authority. The Housing Authority administers
   a number of Housing Choice Vouchers rental assistance programs for low- and very low-income
   families. The objective of these programs is to provide adequate housing for low-income families by
   subsidizing a family’s rent in a privately owned rental unit.

   operated employee housing facilities providing housing for five or more employees to assure their
   health, safety, and general welfare. Directly, or through local governments, inspects and issues permits
   for facility operation. Through the Office of the Mobilehome Ombudsman, the Department accepts
   requests for assistance and initiates investigations of complaints concerning health and safety violations
   within these facilities.

   State Housing Law Program
   Promulgates regulations to ensure that hotels, motels, apartments, single-family dwellings, and other
   residential buildings are maintained in compliance with the model building codes and other provisions of
   state law, and reviews and proposes building standards for construction and rehabilitation of residential
   structures.
   California Homebuyers Down-payment Assistance Program (CHDAP)
   This program offers a deferred-payment junior loan of an amount up to the lesser of 3 percent of the
   purchase price or appraised value. Homebuyers are able to use these funds to help with their down-
   payment and closing costs without the need to make monthly payments on the loan. Interest will be
   calculated at 3% simple interest. The assistance may be combined with any CalHFA or non-CalHFA
   conventional or government first mortgage loan.
   Homebuyers using a CalHFA first mortgage may combine the assistance with a CalHFA Housing
   Assistance Program (CHAP) loan, High Cost Area Home Purchase Assistance Program (HiCAP) loan,
   and other down-payment assistance programs offered by local government agencies and nonprofit
   organization, if the subordinate program is pre-approved by CalHFA. The CHDAP loan cannot be
   combined with loans under CalHFA’s Extra Credit Teacher Program and Homeownership in
   Revitalization Program (HIRAP).
   The CHDAP is available on a statewide basis for first-time homebuyers purchasing a single-family
   residence anywhere in California that is within CalHFA’s sales price limits, is intended as their primary
   residence, and whose family income does not exceed the program’s moderate-income limit
   requirements. Homebuyers must also meet all first mortgage eligibility requirements according to the
   lender, investor, mortgage insurer, or guarantor criteria.
   Farmworker Housing Grant Program
   Provides housing opportunities for agricultural households. Cities with a population of less than 50,000
   are eligible.
   Housing Enabled by Local Partnerships (HELP)
   The program employs a loan-to-lender approach to provide 10-year, 3 percent simple interest rate per
   annum, minimally restrictive loans to local government agencies. The program challenges local agencies
   to prioritize their unmet housing needs and to design housing programs that target their particular
   priorities. This approach allows the local agency to more closely match local housing policy and
   accountability with project performance. Increasingly, the program is being used to facilitate affordable
   housing within more targeted comprehensive local programs for neighborhood revitalization.
   Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant (JSJFWHG) Program: Finances the new construction,
   rehabilitation, and acquisition of owner-occupied and rental units for agricultural workers, with a priority
   for lower-income households.
   Homeowner Grants: For rehabilitation or new home construction. Lien restrictions are required for 20
   years. If the unit is sold to a non-farmworker buyer before completing the tenth year, the full grant

   amount must be repaid under most circumstances. Between the tenth and twentieth anniversaries, the
   grant is forgiven at a rate of 10 percent per completed year; it is fully forgiven after completing 20 years.
   Rental Construction Grants or Loans: Lien restrictions for assisted units are required for 40 years. If assisted
   units are sold for uses other than farmworker housing before the fortieth year, the grant must be repaid
   in full. Under most circumstances, loans may be made only in conjunction with low-income tax credit
   financing.
   Rental Rehabilitation Grants or Loans: Lien restrictions for assisted units are required for 20 years. If
   assisted units are sold for uses other than farmworker housing before the twentieth year, the grant must
   be repaid in full, under most circumstances. Loans may be made only in conjunction with low-income
   tax credit financing.
   Those eligible include local government agencies, nonprofit corporations, cooperative housing
   corporations, and limited partnerships where all the general partners are nonprofit mutual or public
   benefit corporations.
   Multifamily Housing Program (MHP)
   MHP assists with new construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of permanent and transitional rental
   housing for lower-income households. Projects are not eligible if construction has commenced as of the
   application date, or if they are receiving 9 percent federal low-income housing tax credits. MHP funds
   will be provided for post-construction permanent financing only. Eligible costs include the cost of child
   care, after-school care, and social service facilities integrally linked to the assisted housing units; real
   property acquisition; refinancing to retain affordable rents; necessary on-site and off-site improvements;
   reasonable fees and consulting costs; and capitalized reserves.
   Rental Housing Construction Program (RHCP)
   Provides long term, 3 percent loans for building affordable rental housing. Housing authorities, local
   governments, nonprofit developers, and private builders are eligible. At least 30 percent of the units
   must be assisted units. Of the assisted units, at least two-thirds must be affordable to those earning no
   more than 50 percent of the area median income (AMI) and up to one-third must be affordable to
   persons earning no more than 80 percent of the AMI. The assisted units must be affordable for at least
   40 years.
   The Family Housing Demonstration Program
   Operates and provides financing similar to RHCP but is directed at those projects which include special
   or innovative features for families, such as congregate housing and community housing developments
   with some shared facilities, child care space, and job training or other economic assistance programs.
   Federal Programs
   The Affordable Housing Program (AHP) and Community Investment Program (CIP) are facilitated
   through the Federal Home Loan System for the purposes of expanding the affordable housing supply.

   competitive basis usually in the form of low-interest loans and must be used to finance the purchase,
   construction, and/or rehabilitation of rental housing.
   Farmworker Housing Assistance Program provides grants to public and private nonprofits to assist
   farmworkers in securing temporary or permanent housing. The program provides technical assistance
   and counseling to farmworker and farmworker housing agencies, but does not actually fund housing
   production or rehabilitation.
   Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers a variety programs and services which include direct
   financing and management of the redevelopment or construction of low-income rental housing and
   single-family housing, providing homeownership to low-income families. A subsidy for public housing
   provides an annual subsidy to help public housing agencies (PHAs) pay some of the cost of operating
   and maintaining public housing units.
   The Public Housing Development program provides federal grants to local PHAs to develop housing
   for low-income families that cannot afford housing in the private market.
   HOPE I helps low-income people buy public housing units by providing funds to nonprofit
   organizations, resident groups, and other eligible grantees can use to develop and implement
   homeownership programs.
   The Section 5(h) homeownership program offers PHAs a flexible way to sell public housing units to
   low-income families.
   HOPE 3 Homeownership of Single-Family Homes Program provides grants to state and local
   governments and nonprofit organizations to assist low-income, first-time homebuyers by utilizing
   government-owned or financed single-family properties in the form of grants. Funds cover rehabilitation
   costs of owner-occupied housing, acquisition, or operation administration.
   Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) provides for federal and state tax credits for
   private and nonprofit developers and investors who agree to set aside all or an established percentage of
   their rental units for households at 60 percent of AMI for no less than 30 years. These tax credits may
   also be utilized on rehabilitation projects, contributing to the preservation program. The program begins
   when developers and investors apply for an allocation of tax credits from the California Tax Credit
   Allocation Committee (CTCAC). Tax credits are awarded on a competitive basis each year. Compliance
   is monitored according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules and regulations.
   USDA Rural Development: USDA housing programs have helped over two million low- or moderate-
   income rural Americans buy homes. USDA also finances construction of apartments and other multiple
   family housing in rural communities that lack sufficient, affordable rental housing. Other programs
   finance the development of affordable farm labor housing wherever it is needed.
   The Self-Help Housing Program enables low-income families to become homeowners by helping to
   build their own homes. Their “sweat equity” becomes their down payment. Home improvement loans
   and grants help low-income, often elderly, people remove health and safety hazards from their homes.

   OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
   Two basic and interrelated approaches to creating energy conservation opportunities in residences are
   conservation and development..
   Conservation
   Conservation can be accomplished by reducing the use of energy-consuming items or by physically
   modifying existing structures and land uses. The California Energy Commission first adopted energy
   conservation standards for new construction in 1978. These standards, contained in Title 24 of the
   California Administrative Code, contain specifications relating to insulation, glazing, heating and cooling
   systems, water heaters, swimming pool heaters, and several other items. Specific design provisions differ
   throughout the state depending upon local temperature conditions. Because of the warm climate, some
   of the insulation and heating standards are significantly less stringent in Hughson.
   The California Energy Commission revised the standards for new residential buildings in 1981. These
   “second generation” standards were then delayed until 1983 when Assembly Bill (AB) 163 was passed
   which provided options for complying with the standards.
   Although energy regulations establish a uniform standard of energy efficiency, they do not ensure that all
   available conservation features are incorporated into building design. Additional measures may further
   reduce heating, cooling, and lighting loads, and overall energy consumption. While it is not suggested
   that all possible conservation features be included in every development, there are often a number of
   economically feasible measures that may result in savings in excess of the minimum required by Title 24.
   Title 24 energy requirements are consistently reviewed in all building applications processed in the City.
   Development
   Solar energy is a viable alternate energy source for the City of Hughson. There are two basic types of
   solar systems: active and passive. In passive solar systems, the structure itself is designed to collect the
   sun’s energy, then store and circulate the resulting heat similar to a greenhouse. Passive buildings are
   typically designed with a southerly orientation to maximize solar exposure and are constructed with
   dense material such as concrete or adobe to better absorb heat. Properly placed windows, overhanging
   eaves, and landscaping can all be designed to keep a house cool.
   Active solar systems typically collect and store energy in panels attached to the exterior of a house. This
   type of system utilizes mechanical fans or pumps to circulate the warm/cool air, while heated water can
   flow directly into a home’s hot water system. Solar cells absorb the sun’s rays to generate electricity and
   can substantially reduce electric bills. Technology has made the cells increasingly efficient and has
   reduced their cost to the level that may make them more popular with the average consumer.
   Although passive solar systems generally maximize use of the sun’s energy and are less costly to install,
   active systems have greater potential application to cool and heat a house plus provide it with hot water
   and electricity. This may mean lower energy costs for Hughson residents.
   Approximately 20.9 percent of the City’s housing stock has been built since 1980 and most of these
   units benefit from Title 24 and other energy conservation measures. Some conservation opportunities

   will come from remodeling existing residences. Major opportunities for residential energy conservation
   will include insulation and weatherproofing, landscaping, and maximizing orientation and lowering
   appliance consumption. Since the energy crisis of 2001, many new residential structures are
   incorporating energy conservation equipment and design, as well as technological advances (such as
   automatic timers to control air conditioning, lighting, etc.) to help reduce energy dependence.
   Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides gas and electric service to Hughson residents. The company
   offers a variety of energy conservation programs and information services that are available to residents:
        •   Weatherization: If homes and apartments are not sealed tightly, energy used for heating and
            cooling can be wasted. Weatherization helps to decrease energy costs and increase comfort.
            Weatherization services may include attic insulation, weather stripping and caulking around areas
            where air leakage occurs, exhaust fan dampers, air duct repair, water heater blankets, and low-
            flow showerheads. Approved low-income residents may be eligible for free weatherization
            services.
        •   Home Improvements: High-performance windows (e.g., dual-paned) can help reduce energy
            costs, condensation and color fading due to sunlight, and increase the comfort of the home.
            Customers of PG&E can receive a rebate of $0.50 per square foot of high-performance
            replacement windows purchased and installed in the home. In addition, qualified costumers can
            receive a rebate of $0.15 per square foot by purchasing and installing attic or wall insulation for
            the home.
        •   California 20/20 Program: If PG&E costumers reduce their electricity use by 20 percent, they
            receive a credit equal to 20 percent of their summer electric bills from the Department of Water
            Resources under the California 20/20 Rebate Program.
   Green Building Development
   Currently the City’s Zoning Code allows for the following modification to help facilitate “green”
   development.
        •   Solar Energy Collection Systems are allowed through a ministerial review process.
        •   Wind Energy Systems are allowed in all residential zones through a ministerial review process.
        •   All street out-door lights shall been energy efficient lighting.
   The City has also included Programs 1-10-1, 1-10-2, and 1-10-3 to promote energy conservation.

   SECTION 4 - HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
   The purpose of this chapter is to analyze potential and actual governmental and non-governmental
   constraints on the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing in the City of Hughson. A
   discussion of Hughson’s efforts to remove constraints is included.
   GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
   Land Use Controls
   The General Plan is the primary land use control document. This policy document not only establishes
   the location and amount of land that will be allocated to residential development, but also establishes the
   intensity of development (in terms of unit densities and total number of units) that will be permitted.
   While nearly all components or elements of the General Plan contain goals and policies that influence
   residential development, it is the Land Use Element that has the most direct influence.
   Title 17 of the Hughson Municipal Code, the 2008 Hughson Zoning Code , provides the zoning
   provisions for the City. Zoning districts specify minimum lot size, permitted uses, conditional uses,
   building height, and front, rear, and side yard setbacks. Zoning districts further the health, safety, and
   welfare of the residents. In addressing the minimum lot size, the zoning districts must be consistent with
   the densities of the General Plan.
   Zoning for the City of Hughson is defined as follows:
   Low Density Residential (R-1) – The purpose of the R-1 low density residential zone district is to
   provide living areas where development is limited to low density single-family and duplex housing; to
   ensure adequate light, air, privacy and open space for each dwelling; to provide space for community
   facilities needed to complement urban residential areas and for institutions which require a residential
   environment.
   Medium Density Residential (R2) – The purpose of the R-2 medium density residential zone is to
   provide living areas where a compatible mixture of single-family, duplex, triplex, fourplex and
   townhouse housing will provide a suitable environment for family living; to ensure adequate light, air,
   privacy and open space for each dwelling; to provide space for community facilities needed to
   complement urban residential areas and for institutions which require a residential environment. This
   zone provides a transition between R-1 and R-3 districts.
   High Density Residential (R3) – The purpose of the R-3 high density residential zone is to provide
   residential areas which can accommodate a suitable mixture of more intensive land uses, including
   multiple-family dwellings, community facilities, retail establishments, medical facilities, and offices,
   compatible with the surrounding area and consistent with the General Plan
   Rural Residential (R-A) - The purpose of the R-A zone is to provide living areas at the fringe of the
   City’s incorporated area which combine certain advantages of both urban and rural location by limiting
   development to very low density concentrations of one-family dwellings and permitting limited numbers
   of animals and fowl to be kept for pleasure or hobbies, free from activities of a commercial nature.

                                          HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   Neighborhood Commercial (C-1) – The purpose of the C-1 neighborhood commercial zone is to
   provide neighborhood shopping areas where retail business or service establishments supply
   commodities or perform services to meet the daily needs of the residential neighborhood but not to
   permit commercial uses which would be more appropriate in the C-2 or C-3 zones. The C-1 zone is
   intended to provide an area for resident-serving commercial establishments which enable Hughson
   residents to remain in the city for their daily shopping needs
   General Commercial (C-2) – The purpose of the C-2 general commercial zone is to provide a general
   commercial area for the sale of commodities or the performance of services to serve the entire com-
   munity. Downtown Hughson, defined as the area designated as Downtown Commercial in the Hugh-
   son General Plan, is given priority by the community as that area where commercial uses should be
   focused prior to developing other land zoned C-2.
   Service Commercial (C-3) – The purpose of the C-3 service commercial zone is to provide areas for
   heavy commercial uses along major arterial streets where a mixture of commercial and light industrial
   activities is appropriate. This zone permits commercial uses generally not appropriate to the central
   commercial area in addition to retail stores and offices and is intended to provide for the continuance of
   established uses. C-3 zones are to be applied to areas of two acres or more..
   Specific Plan Zone (S-P) - The purpose of the S-P zone is to identify those areas within the City’s
   adopted Sphere of Influence where a Specific Plan will need to be prepared in advance of annexation
   into the City. The permitted land uses are intended to remain in effect until a Specific Plan is adopted
   and the area included in the Specific Plan is annexed into the City with specified zoning districts. Once
   annexed into the City, the S-P zone designates areas subject to an adopted Specific Plan. The Specific
   Plan will determine appropriate zoning.
   Planned Development Overlay Zone (P-D) - The purpose of the P-D planned development overlay
   zone is to encourage a creative and more efficient approach to the use of land and to provide for greater
   flexibility in the design of integrated developments than otherwise possible through strict application of
   zoning regulations.
   Residential Development Standards
   In accordance with state law, cities and counties have broad latitude in establishing zoning standards and
   procedures. Outside of a general requirement for open space zoning and several specific requirements
   governing residential zoning, state law establishes only broadly the scope of zoning regulations and sets
   minimum standards for their adoption and administration. The City of Hughson Development
   Standards do not contain any unduly restrictive provisions. Building height, setbacks, lot areas, and
   parking are generally within the range of other small cities in the state.
   The Hughson Zoning Code has four residential zoning districts, with the highest density of up to 27
   dwelling units per acre allowed in the R-3 District. Table 50 summarizes the residential development
   standards for the City of Hughson.

   Parking Requirements
   The City’s parking requirements for residential projects vary by the housing type. Table 51 provides the
   parking requirements for residential developments. Single-family residential units and duplexes are
   required to have two garage spaces per dwelling unit. Multiple family residential units (studio or one
   bedroom) require one parking space per dwelling unit. Multiple family residential units with more than
   two bedrooms require 2 spaces per dwelling unit. In addition, for every four units, one additional space
   is required. The City’s parking requirements do not pose any type of constraint to development.

     City of Hughson Zoning Code, 2008
   PROVISION FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING TYPES
   Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
   through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various
   housing for all economic segments of the population. Table 52 summarizes the housing types permitted
   in each zoning district.
   Persons with Disabilities
   The City of Hughson conscientiously and specifically implements and monitors compliance with Section
   65583(a)(4) and Section 65583(c)(3) in the review of its General Plan, zoning code, development codes,
   construction and re-construction regulations, and in the development and rehabilitation of multifamily
   and single-family homes. The City conducted an internal review for compliance with “reasonable
   accommodation” with the following findings.
   The zoning code permits supportive multifamily or single-family housing for the disabled in any
   residential zone that permits non-designated single-family or multifamily housing. Over the last Housing
   Element period, 48 units of disabled-designated housing for seniors 60 and older were constructed in
   the Samaritan Village senior complex in Hughson. In addition, CalHome rehabilitation funds are
   available to disabled persons to improve access and mobility in their existing homes. Recently, the City
   has awarded three grants for households wishing to retrofit their homes to accommodate disabled family
   members. These retrofits included building both ramp access and making the bathroom wheelchair
   accessible.
   The City of Hughson offices are handicapped accessible. Disabled applicants are treated with the same
   courtesy as all applicants. They are provided one-on-one assistance to complete the forms for zoning,
   permits, or other building applications. The City will reasonably accommodate any specific verbal or

   written request for assistance. Applications for retrofit are processed over the counter in the same
   process as for improvements to any single-family home. While the zoning code does not specifically
   waive fees for building permits that address reasonable accommodation, the planning director is given
   the flexibility to offer fee waivers or reductions for these types of projects on a case-by-case basis.
   The City of Hughson reviews its ordinances, policies, and practices for compliance with fair housing
   laws. Keeping current on fair housing laws is most important in regard to special needs groups. In its
   most recent review, the City has not identified any constraints that would inhibit the development of
   housing for disabled persons or in addressing any reasonable accommodation requests. All new
   development is required to adhere to ADA laws. All multifamily complexes are required to provide
   handicapped parking. However, the City is willing to work with the developers of special needs housing
   and will reduce parking requirements if the applicant can demonstrate a reduced need for parking. The City
   has no separate restrictions or development standards for group homes or other special needs housing.
   Hughson has set valid and responsible building codes for utilization in the City. The City Building
   Department administers building code and enforcement services. The City has adopted, and the
   department implements, provisions of the 2007 California Building Code with no amendments. The City
   does not have any amendments to its building codes that might diminish the ability to accommodate
   persons with disabilities. During the analysis of potential governmental constraints to development,
   these items were not identified as constraints.
   The City also currently evaluates the need for reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities
   on a case-by-case basis. Program 1-8-3 states that the City will develop a more formalized reasonable
   accommodation procedure that will provide an administrative exception process in zoning and land use
   matters for housing for persons with disabilities. The process may include minimal review by the
   Planning Director and may include the following criteria:
       •    The request for reasonable accommodation will be used by an individual with a disability
            protected under fair housing laws.
       •    The requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with a
            disability protected under fair housing laws.
       •    The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden
            on the City.
       •    The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the
            City’s land use and zoning program.
   Emergency Shelters
   California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing with
   minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a
   homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability
   to pay.”
AUGUST 2009                                                                                CITY OF HUGHSON

                                          HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   New legislation (Senate Bill 2 (Cedillo, 2007)) requires jurisdictions to allow emergency shelters and
   supportive and transitional housing without a conditional use permit. The City must identify a zone(s)
   where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit or other
   discretionary permit. The zone or zones identified have to have land available to accommodate an
   emergency shelter. The City currently allows for emergency housing “shelters” by right in the High
   Density Residential (R-3) zoning district. Within the R-3 zone, the City has identified 21 acres that will
   allow adequate capacity for the provision of emergency shelter. The R-3 zone is appropriate as the
   majority of R-3 zoned land is located near the center of town and there for near services and any
   available transportation.
   Supportive and Transitional Housing
   Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code as housing with linked
   on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length of stay and that is occupied by a target population
   as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 53260 (i.e., low-income person with mental disabilities,
   AIDS, substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or persons whose disabilities originated before the
   age of 18). Services linked to supportive housing usually focuses on retaining housing, living and
   working in the community, and/or health improvement.
   Transitional housing is defined in Section 50675.2 of the Health and Safety Code as rental housing for
   stays of at least six months but where the units are recirculated to another program recipient after a set
   period. It may be designated for a homeless individual or family transitioning to permanent housing.
   This housing can take many structural forms such as group housing and multifamily units and may
   include supportive services to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent
   living.
   Under the current land use ordinance, transitional housing is permitted in the High Density Residential
   (R-3) zoning district by right, and permitted with a conditional use permit in the Industrial (I) zoning
   district. The City currently includes transitional housing as a definition in its zoning code, but pursuant
   to Senate Bill SB 2, the City must explicitly define both supportive and transitional housing types and
   allow them in all residential zones only subject to the same conditions to that zone. In an effort to clarify
   the zoning code and therefore facilitate these housing types, the City will (1) add the current definition
   of supportive housing as stated in this document; and (2) list these as permitted uses within residential
   zoning districts. Program 1-7-2 will address the changes to the City’s Zoning Code required to be in
   compliance with the new legislation regarding supportive and transitional housing.
   Residential Care Homes
   Residential care homes with are currently allowed with a conditional use permit in all of the four
   residential zoning districts (R-A, R-1, R-2, and R-3). Program 1-7-5 states that the City will amend the
   Zoning Code to allow for residential care homes with 6 or fewer persons by right in all residential zones
   and will allow for 7 or more persons in all residential zoning district with a conditional use permit.
   Permit conditions on this type of housing are limited to those necessary to meet building codes, and
   development standards as described under the zoning code. There are no regulations relating to the
   siting of special needs housing in relationship to distance or location to one another.
CITY OF HUGHSON                                                                                   AUGUST 2009

   The City of Hughson holds public hearings for every change or amendment to any ordinance, policy,
   program, procedure, funding, or other similar action. There is no public comment request for the
   establishment of a group home for six or less persons. Requests for group homes of more than six
   persons are determined at a noticed public hearing before the Planning Commission. Property owners
   within 300 feet of the site are noticed and may attend and comment.
   Recognizing that some disabled persons may require the assistance of specially trained persons who live
   with the disabled persons, the zoning code does not differentiate between related and unrelated persons
   occupying the same residential unit. To further comply with SB 520, the City will amend the Zoning
   Code to define the definition of family as “One or more persons living together in a dwelling unit.”
   Extremely Low-Income Households
   Extremely low-income households typically comprise persons with special housing needs including but
   not limited to persons experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, persons with substance
   abuse problems, and farmworkers. Assembly Bill 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the quantification and
   analysis of existing and projected housing needs of extremely low-income households. This need is
   demonstrated in Table 8 in the Housing Needs Assessment. Housing Elements must also identify
   zoning to encourage and facilitate supportive housing and single-room occupancy units (SROs).
   Currently SROs are allowed under the land use term “boarding and rooming houses,” defined as a
   dwelling where rooms are rented to paying guests who may be provided with meals. Boarding and
   rooming houses are permitted with a conditional use permit in the R-3 and C-2 zoning districts.
   Program 1-7-3, states that the City will update its zoning code to allow for single-room occupancy units
   (SROs) in all zones where boarding and rooming houses are allowed.
   Farmworker Housing
   Farmworker housing is defined in Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the Health and Safety Code as any
   employee housing consisting of no more than 36 beds in a group quarters, or 12 units or spaces
   designed for use by a single family or household shall be deemed an agricultural land use designation.
   For the purpose of all local ordinances, employee housing shall not be deemed a use that implies that the
   employee housing is an activity that differs in any other way from an agricultural use. No conditional use
   permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be required of this employee housing that is not
   required of any other agricultural activity in the same zone. The permitted occupancy in employee
   housing in an agricultural zone shall include agricultural employees who do not work on the property
   where the employee housing is located. Currently the City does specifically call out farmworker housing
   but to be consistent with Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the Health and Safety Code has included
   Program 1-7-6 which states, the City will amend the Zoning Code to specifically define farmworker
   housing and allow for farmworker housing in the R-1 zone.
   Secondary Dwelling Units
   AB 1866 requires local governments to use a ministerial process for second unit applications. This
   legislation intends to facilitate the production of affordable housing. AB 1866 allows cities to impose
   development standards on second units addressing issues such as building size, parking, height, setbacks,

   and lot coverage. Currently, the City allows for secondary dwelling units as a permitted use in all
   residential zones.
    “Secondary residential unit” means an attached or detached dwelling unit which provides complete,
   independent living facilities for one or more persons. It shall include permanent provisions for living,
   sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel or parcels as the primary residential unit. It
   shall not be sold but may be rented. It shall contain no more than 640 square feet of floor area, if the
   unit is detached, or if it is attached, any increase in the floor area shall not exceed 15 percent of the
   existing living area of the primary unit. It shall not exceed one story or 16 feet in height, whichever is
   less.

   Local Entitlement Fees and Exactions
   Part of the cost of developing residential units is the fees or other exactions required of developers to
   obtain project approval and the time delays caused by the review and approval process. Critics contend
   that lengthy review periods increase financial and carrying costs and that fees and exactions increase
   expenses. These costs are in part passed onto the prospective homebuyer in the form of higher purchase
   prices or rents.
   Fees, land dedications, or improvements are also required in most instances to provide an adequate
   supply of public parkland and to provide necessary public works (streets, sewers, and storm drains) to
   support the new development. While such costs are charged to the developer, most, if not all, additional
   costs are passed to the ultimate product consumer in the form of higher home prices or rents.
   Compliance with numerous governmental laws or regulations can also add to the cost of housing.
   Requirements which relate to site coverage, parking, and open space within developments can indirectly
   increase costs by limiting the number of dwelling units which can occupy a given piece of land. This is
   especially true with larger units when the bulk of the buildings and increased parking requirements
   occupy an increasing share of the site. In some instances, developers must decide whether or not to
   build smaller units at the maximum allowable density or fewer larger units at a density less than the
   maximum. Either solution can have different impacts on the housing market.
   Building a higher number of small units can reduce costs and provide additional housing opportunities
   for smaller households but does not accommodate the needs of larger families. Bigger units can be made
   available to families, but because of their size and lower density, the cost of these units is higher.
   Other development and construction standards can also impact housing costs. Such standards may
   include the incorporation of additional design treatment (architectural details or trim, special building
   materials, landscaping, and textured paving) to improve the appearance of the development. Other
   standards included in the Uniform Building Code lists regulations regarding noise transmission and
   energy conservation that can also result in higher construction costs. While some of these features
   (interior and exterior design treatments) are included, by the developer, to help sell the product in the
   competitive market, some features (energy conservation regulations) may actually reduce monthly living
   expenses. All add to the initial sales price, which is becoming an increasingly difficult hurdle for many
   new homebuyers. Table 53 lists the City’s development fees.

   On average, the per unit fee cost is approximately $45,043 for a single-family home and $27,142 for
   multifamily housing units (see Table 54). A portion of this fee can be deferred if it can be clearly
   demonstrated that the fee (alone) will increase the cost of the housing so that it is no longer affordable
   to low income households. Construction cost for more than two units is unavailable due to the lack of
   larger projects (more than two units) being developed in the City over the past several years. The price
   for a multifamily development with more than two units would be similar to the cost listed in the
   multifamily column below.

   Processing and Permit Procedures
   The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly related
   to the size and complexity of the proposal and the number of actions or approvals needed to complete
   the process. For a typical singe family development it takes approximately 2 to 4 months from start to
   finish This is the generally the same for a multi family development but depending on the complexity of
   the project may take 3 to 6 months. Table 55 identifies the most common steps in the entitlement
   process. It should be noted that each project does not necessarily have to complete each step in the
   process (i.e., small-scale projects consistent with General Plan and zoning designations do not generally
   require environmental impact reports, General Plan Amendments, rezones, or variances). Also, certain
   review and approval procedures may run concurrently. Since the majority of environmental impact
   reports are prepared in response to a General Plan Amendment request, they are often processed
   simultaneously. Hughson also encourages the joint processing of related applications for a single project.
   Such procedures save time, money, and effort for both the public and private sector.

   Design Review Process
   The City of Hughson adopted multi-family residential guidelines in July 2009. The guidelines cover
   attached-type dwellings in general, including apartments, condominiums and townhouses throughout the
   multi-family zoning district. The primary objective of the design guidelines is to ensure quality
   development that will stand the test of time, be safe and convenient for its residents, and be compatible
   with the character of the neighborhood
   By their nature, multi-family developments are large in scale and tend to dominate their surroundings if
   not properly designed. Additionally, issues of parking, circulation, open space, site amenities, and
   resident safety need to be addressed. Since these design guidelines were just recently adopted, the City
   does not have a specific timeframe for which it will take to complete the process. To ensure that the
   guidelines will not be a constraint to the development of multifamily housing, the City has included

                     HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   Program 2-2-1 to monitor the design guidelines to ensure they will not constrain the development of
   multifamily housing.
   The design guidelines for multi-family developments are based on the following objectives:
        •    Establish multi-family residential architectural designs that complement various neighborhood
             characteristics and that support high quality development.
        •    Provide attractive, functional, and convenient site arrangements.
        •    Identify landscape materials and designs that enhance the appearance of multi-family housing
             developments and contribute to the overall quality of the community.
        •    Provide for amenities and passive recreational activities appropriate to the different age groups
             of multi-family residential developments within the project.
        •    Apply design principles that enhance safety and security within multi-family residential
             developments.
   See Appendix F for the multi-family residential design guidelines.
   Building Codes and Enforcement
   Compliance with Building Code standards often adds to the cost of construction but is seen as necessary
   to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens. Compliance results in greater construction costs
   up front but ensures that the buildings retain their structural integrity. The City of Hughson does not
   have any amendments to its building codes that might diminish the ability to accommodate persons with
   disabilities.
   The City of Hughson regulates building standards through the 2007 California Building Code, Uniform
   Housing Code, and the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings. New structures must
   conform to the standards of the UBC. When a project plan is checked, it is reviewed for minimum
   compliance with the 2001 California Building Codes (CBC). This includes electrical, plumbing,
   mechanical (heating and cooling), structural, energy compliance, non-structural (building exits, interior
   environment, etc.), and disabled access (commercial buildings). The Uniform Housing Code is not
   applicable to structural modifications or additions. The Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous
   Buildings applies to all buildings, old or new. These building codes ensure structural integrity and
   facilitate the City’s efforts to maintain a safe housing supply.
   On- and Off-Site Improvements
   For residential projects the City requires both on- and off-site improvements. These improvements
   include curb/gutter and drainage facilities, sidewalks, paved streets, landscaping, and water and sewer
   service. Such improvements are required as a condition of the subdivision map, or if there is no required
   map, improvements are required as part of the building permit. These on- and off-site improvements
   promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.

   Curbs/gutters and drainage facilities direct stormwater and runoff water out of residential developments.
   City roadways are required to be paved. Pavement creates an all-weather roadway, facilitates roadway
   drainage, and reduces dust. It also produces a high speed circulation system and facilitates relatively safe
   traffic movement. Roadways are classified by the City according to traffic needs. Classifications are as
   follows:
        •     Local – 2 lanes, 60-foot right-of-way
        •     Collector – 2 lanes, with a 60- to 100-foot right-of-way
        •     Minor Arterial – 2 lanes, 80-foot right-of-way
   Arterials and collectors are designated on the General Plan according to existing and projected needs.
   Developers are responsible for the development of roadways associated with the residential project and
   also participate in regional transportation system improvements through a Capital Facility Fee
   Sidewalks are for movement of pedestrian traffic. Where sidewalks are available, safety of pedestrian
   traffic is enhanced, particularly for school-age children.
   Landscaping is required for all zoning districts, though the majority of the landscaping requirements
   target commercial and industrial uses and not residential. Landscaping, at least 8 feet in width, is
   required along all public rights-of-way. Such landscaping would include, but not be limited to, shrubbery,
   trees, grass, and decorative masonry walls. Landscaping contributes to a cooler and more aesthetic
   environment in the City by providing transition from developed and paved land areas to promote an
   attractive visual environment. All landscaping plans must be approved by the Planning Department and
   installed by the developer. There are no special landscaping fees associated with this requirement, and
   approval of landscaping is done concurrently with design review of the project. Planning staff work
   closely with developers to ensure compliance with all zoning requirements and have flexibility in the
   review process. Because frontal landscaping is a standard component of project design, this requirement
   does not put an undue cost burden on the developer and is not considered a constraint on the
   development of housing.
   Development of and connection to municipal water and sewer services are required as a condition of
   approving tract maps. Water service is necessary for a constant supply of potable water. Sewer services
   are necessary for the disposal of liquid and solid waste. These off-site requirements allow for the
   development of much higher residential densities.
   NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
   The ability to address the underserved needs of the citizens of the City of Hughson must overcome a
   variety of obstacles, many of which are beyond the scope of municipal governments. The responsibility
   for identifying, responding to, and mitigating these needs rests with the agencies providing services.
   Funding limitations exist at all levels.
   The private market influences the selling and rental prices of all types of housing. This includes existing
   and new dwelling units. While actions within the public sector play important parts in determining the
   cost of housing, the private sector affects the residential markets through such mechanisms as supply
   costs (i.e., land, construction, financing) and value of consumer preference.

   Availability of Financing
   Table 52 displays home loan activity for the City of Hughson and the Modesto Metropolitan Statistical
   Area (MSA) between the years of 2005 and 2007. The data was gathered from the Federal Financial
   Institutions Examination Council (FFEIC), which is the council responsible for disclosing Home
   Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. HMDA was enacted by Congress in 1975 and requires public
   lending institutions to report public loan data. As seen in the table, the total of loan applications
   reported in the Modesto MSA over the three-year period is 66,498, with 632 in Hughson.
   According to the HMDA report, Hughson had a higher percentage of loans approved than in the MSA.
   Over the three-year period, 73 percent of loans were approved in Hughson, which was 5 percent higher
   than in the MSA (68 percent). The 5 percent difference was covered in the percentage of denied loan
   applications, in which Hughson experienced 15 percent of all loan applications denied, compared with
   the MSA, in which 20 percent of loan applications were denied. Both Hughson and the MSA
   experienced 12 percent of all loan applications either closed for being incomplete or withdrawn by the
   applicant.
   It is difficult to identify neighborhoods within Hughson that experience a constraint to the availability of
   financing, since Hughson is represented by one census tract (0029.02) and HMDA data is only
   delineated to the census tract level. The FFEIC reports that census tract 0029.02 is considered a middle-
   income tract that is not underserved or distressed. In comparison to the MSA, Hughson has a greater
   percentage of approved loans, indicating that there does not appear to be a constraint to the availability
   of financing in the City.
   An important note regarding the trend of loan activity reported in Table 56 is that the total loan
   applications reported in each year has declined significantly in both the MSA and the City. In 2007,
   Hughson reported 101 total applications, which was 72 percent less than in 2005 (359 loan applications).
   The percentage share of approved, denied, and withdrawn/incomplete remained consistent in 2005 and
   2006, and began to change in 2007. As seen in the table, Hughson experienced a 9 percent decline in the
   percentage share of approved loans between 2006 and 2007 and a 10 percent increase in denied loans.
   While this shift does not indicate a constraint to the availability of financing in Hughson, it is important
   for the City to continue to monitor this trend to ensure that potential homebuyers are not constrained to
   purchase homes based on a constraint to the availability of financing.

  First Time Homebuyer
  Another aspect of a comprehensive housing program is the need to assist low-income entry-level
  homebuyers. These households are usually burdened by increasing rents and the difficulty of saving
  money for a down payment on a home. These households generally are subject to paying up to 35
  percent of their income in order to own a home.
  The First-Time Homebuyers Program administered by the City requires the following:
       •   A household must qualify for a first mortgage,
       •   The selling price of the home must be within stated limits,
       •   Household income must be no more than 80 percent of the AMI,
       •   A down payment of 2 percent of the total cost must be contributed,
       •   The primary loan shall be fully amortized and have a term “all due and payable” in no fewer than 30
           years
  LAND AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
  Development Costs
  Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with multifamily housing generally
  less expensive to construct than single-family homes. However, wide variation within each construction
  type exists depending on the size of the unit and the number and quality of amenities provided, such as
  fireplaces, swimming pools, and interior fixtures among others.
  Using current pricing sources, the average costs for a newly constructed 2,000 square foot single-family
  home (not including land) in the region would be calculated as follows:
                    Item                                                        Cost

    Today’s new homes are quite different than those produced during the 1960s. Numerous interior and
    exterior design features (larger master bedroom suites, microwave ovens, trash compactors, dishwashers,
    wet bars, decorative roofing materials, exterior trim, and architectural style) make it difficult to make
    direct comparisons in costs over the years. In a highly competitive market, many consumers consider
    these "extra touches" as necessities when buying a new home. While the basic shelter or “no frills”
    house has met with varying degrees of consumer acceptance, the high costs of homeownership may lead
    to a return to less complicated designs.
    A significant cost constraint too many families is the specific design features (recreational facilities or
    unit size and design) in individual projects or features that are not suited for a family with children. In
    addition, design features such as stairs, hallways, doorways, counters, and plumbing facilities may restrict
    access to handicapped persons.
    Cost of Land
    In addition to construction costs, the price of land is one of the largest components of housing
    development costs. Land costs may vary depending on whether the site is vacant or has an existing use
    that must be removed. Similarly, site constraints such as environmental issues (i.e., steep slopes, soil
    stability, seismic hazards, or flooding) can also be factor in the cost of land.
    Generally, the higher the raw land costs, the higher the price of a new home. Normally, developers will
    seek to obtain city approvals for the largest number of lots obtainable on a given parcel of raw land. This
    allows the developer to spread the costs for off-site improvements (i.e., streets, water lines, etc.) over the
    maximum number of lots. According to the Stanislaus County Assessor’s Office, there have not been
    any recent sales in the City of Hughson. The County Assessor’s Office is allocating $60,000 for newer
    subdivisions and $40,000 for older lots.
    Vacant residential land in Hughson, in comparison to other small nearby towns, is relatively inexpensive
    to acquire. As the land becomes scarcer over time, the cost of vacant land will increase. In addition to
    the cost of land, most of the large areas of vacant land in the surrounding sphere of influence are
    designated for agricultural preservation under the Williamson Act. Developers must go through legal
    litigation and pay a substantial amount in order to remove land from the Williamson Act.
    Constraint Removal Efforts
    Cost implications for developers of low-income housing can be significant when any increase inhibits
    the ability to provide units affordable to their clients. To offset developer’s costs, the City does defer
    some payments of development fees. In addition, the City’s Capital Facility Development Fees are
    significantly less for multifamily projects than for single-family projects. The City also provides cost
    reductions to developers through the Density Bonus when low- and very low-income housing units are
    proposed. Further cost reductions occur in the form of increased densities and concessions such as
    flexibility in site development standards and zoning code requirements, deferment in development fees,
    and financial aid from the Redevelopment Agency.

  INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABILITY
  Water and sewer is readily available to all residential vacant land within the developed portions of the
  City and therefore has enough capacity to meet its 2007- 2014 regional housing need. Recently, the City
  constructed a 750,000 gallon water storage tank and as part of the Water Facilities Master Plan there will
  be an addition of two more tanks. The City is also in the process of updating and expanding the sewer
  plant.
  To comply with Senate Bill 1087, the City will immediately forward its adopted Housing Element to its
  water and wastewater providers so they can grant priority for service allocations to proposed
  developments that include units affordable to lower-income households.
  ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
  There are no environmental constraints that would inhibit developers from building on the parcels
  identified in the vacant land survey. Hughson is not located in a flood zone and is characterized by flat
  land. As a result, no major grading would be required on these parcels

    SECTION 5 - GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
    The purpose of this chapter is to formulate a housing program that will guide the City of Hughson and
    all of its housing stakeholders toward the preservation, improvement, and development of housing for
    all economic levels. It is the City’s intent to create a municipal climate that encourages varied and quality
    affordable housing developments by both the public and private sectors. The following programs
    include goals, objectives, and policies that will form the foundation for the implementation of specific
    procedures and actions related to housing and economic development.
    Goal 1: Housing Opportunities and Accessibility
    It is the goal of the City of Hughson to concentrate on efforts that will increase the
    availability of permanent housing for all community residents.
    Policy 1-1:      Seek assistance under federal, state and other programs for eligible activities within the
                     City that address affordable housing needs.

                     Housing and Community Development (HCD) staff to apply for the funding that is
                     made available through Proposition 1C. For example, in partnership with an interested
                     nonprofit developer, apply to the MHP program for the development of low-income
                     housing. Finally, as affordable units are developed, apply for the Workforce Housing
                     Rewards Program.

                     increment revenues received from the Redevelopment Area into a low- to moderate-
                     income housing fund for affordable housing activities. These funds will be designated
                     for low- to moderate-income housing rehabilitation programs including financing,
                     infrastructure improvements, land acquisition, and construction.

                with supportive services to formerly homeless persons for a period that is typically
                between six months and two years. The supportive services, such as job training,
                rehabilitation, and counseling, help individuals gain life skills necessary for independent
                living.
                Currently, the City permits transitional housing by right in the High Density Residential
                (R-3) zoning district, and in the General Commercial (C-2) zoning district subject to a
                conditional use permit. Pursuant to Senate Bill 2, the City must explicitly allow both
                supportive and transitional housing types in all residential zones. The City currenly
                defines transitional housing in the Zoning code but will update its Zoning Code to
                include the definition of supportive housing as defined in Health and Safety Code
                Sections 50675.2 and 50675.14. Both transitional and supportive housing types will be
                allowed as a permitted use subject to only the same restrictions on residential uses
                contained in the same type of structure.

                                                HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
        QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
        The goals, objectives, and programs of the 2009 City of Hughson Housing Element focused on
        recommending studies to determine the housing needs and growth of the community. The current
        update continues to address the adequate site issues, the availability of federal and state housing
        programs, and housing preservation, and also focuses on the identification and mitigation of constraints
        to affordable housing, as well as the identification of incentives.
        The objectives in this update will be quantified to meet the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
        (RHNA) for the City, as prescribed by the Stanislaus Council of Governments.
        The City of Hughson has six broad housing priorities:
            1.     Assist in the development of housing opportunities and accessibility for all economic levels in
                   the City.
            2.     Remove constraints that hinder the production and conservation of affordable housing units.
            3.     Provide and maintain an adequate supply of sites for the development of affordable new
                   housing.
            4.     Preserve, rehabilitate, and enhance existing housing and neighborhoods.
            5.     Ensure that all housing programs are available without discrimination on the basis of race,
                   color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, marital status, age, household composition,
                   income, size, or any other arbitrary factor.
            6.     Encourage and enhance intergovernmental, public, and private coordination and cooperation
                   to achieve an adequate supply of housing for all residents of the community.

   Appendix F
   MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES
   By their nature, multi-family developments are large in scale and tend to dominate their surroundings if not
   properly designed. Additionally, issues of parking, circulation, open space, site amenities, and resident safety
   need to be addressed.
   The purpose of this section is to provide design guidelines that address the particular issues associated with
   multi-family developments. The guidelines cover attached-type dwellings in general, including apartments,
   condominiums, and townhouses throughout the multi-family zoning district.
   The primary objective of the design guidelines in this section is to ensure quality development that will stand
   the test of time, be safe and convenient for its residents, and be compatible with the character of the
   neighborhood.
   Applicability
   The design guidelines in this section are applicable to all new multi-family developments throughout the
   City, including duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, and other attached multi-family projects whether available
   for rent or ownership.
   General Design Objectives
   The design guidelines for multi-family developments are based on the following objectives:
   A. Neighborhood Compatibility
       •    Establish multi-family residential architectural designs that complement various neighborhood
            characteristics and that support high quality development.
       •    Provide attractive, functional, and convenient site arrangements.
       •    Identify landscape materials and designs that enhance the appearance of multi-family housing
            developments and contribute to the overall quality of the community.
       •    Provide for amenities and passive recreational activities appropriate to the different age groups
            of multi-family residential developments within the project.
       •    Apply design principles that enhance safety and security within multi-family residential
            developments.

                      APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
   Site Planning
   A. Neighborhood Context
        1. New multi-family residential development should be compatible with other development in
            the immediate area through the use of complementary building arrangements, buffers, and
            avoidance of overwhelming building scale and visual obstructions.
        2. New multi-family developments are encouraged to use courtyard siting arrangements, where
            appropriate, to complement similar siting in the area.
        3. Landscaping should complement existing landscape materials, location, and massing on
            adjacent developments.
        4. Developments should relate directly to the adjacent street, and present an attractive and
            interesting façade to passersby. Developments that ignore the street and create an isolated
            enclave are strongly discouraged.
   B. Building and Facilities Location
   Appropriate building siting can reduce the perceived density of multi-family developments, maximize
   open space areas, provide “eyes on the street” surveillance, and enhance neighborliness by creating
   community gathering spaces.
        1. The siting of buildings should consider the existing neighborhood context. Developments
            should generally be oriented parallel to the public street or to the development’s internal
            streets, with some setback variation to provide visual interest.
        2. In addition to a street orientation, the clustering of multi-family units should be a consistent
            site planning element. Whenever possible, buildings should be configured around courtyards,
            gathering areas, and open spaces.
        3. Portions of the development that are not oriented to the street should be well integrated into
            the project’s overall site design. As with the street-oriented area of the development, the same
            design considerations should be given to siting, appearance, circulation, landscaping, and
            safety issues.
        4. Buildings should be oriented to provide some privacy yet still relate to the street and the
            existing community. Doors should be visible from the street and windows should allow
            residents to have “eyes on the street” for natural surveillance.
        5. Energy efficiency and energy conservation should be considered in building siting. Buildings
            should be oriented to take advantage of prevailing breezes and solar opportunities whenever
            possible.
        6. Where public transit is located near the development, the site design should consider
            convenience and comfort factors for residents. These include direct access, widened sidewalks,
            shaded seating areas, and weather protection provided near public transit stops.

                    APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
   C. Open Space
   Common open space provides opportunities for casual social interaction and safe play areas for children,
   as well as helping to reduce the perceived density of the development. Private open space serves as an
   outdoor room for residents and as a protected play area for toddlers.
          1. Residents should have access to useable open space for recreation and social activities. Open
              spaces should be conveniently located for the majority of units.
          2. Open space areas should be sheltered from the noise and traffic of adjacent streets or other
              incompatible uses. Open space siting should take advantage of prevailing breezes and sun
              orientation in order to provide a comfortable environment.
          3. A series of connected open space areas of varying shape, appearance and usage are
              encouraged. Smaller areas may directly relate to a cluster of units, while the larger areas may
              serve several clusters as common open space.
          4. Boundaries between private and common open spaces should be clearly defined by low walls
              or plant materials.
          5. Buildings should be sited and designed so that windows of neighboring units do not overlook
              private open spaces likely to be used for private activities.
          6. Private open space should be provided adjacent to the units it serves and should be
              immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way or common open space.
          7. Shade structures are encouraged to provide shelter from sun and rain.
   D. Outdoor Play Areas
   Onsite outdoor play areas can provide children with a safe and interesting environment, and allow
   parents to easily view play areas in order to supervise play activities. Children, especially those in the
   five- to twelve-years old age group, tend to play throughout the entire grounds of a development, not
   just in designated play areas. Therefore, their needs, as well as maintenance requirements, should be
   important design considerations.
          1. Children’s play areas should be visible from as many units as possible and from private open
              space areas. Direct, convenient access from ground level, private open space to the communal
              play area is encouraged.
          2. Outdoor play areas should be located adjacent to laundry rooms, community centers, or
              similar common facilities. Play areas should not be located near public streets, parking, or
              entry areas unless physically separated by appropriate walls, fencing, or dense landscaping.
          3. Hard surface areas for outdoor activities (e.g., bicycle riding, skating, rope jumping, and
              hopscotch) should be provided. These active play areas should be safely separated from
              vehicular use areas.
AUGUST 2009                                                                              CITY OF HUGHSON

                      APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
        4. In larger developments, separate, but not necessarily segregated, play areas or informal
            outdoor spaces should be provided for different age groups for safety reasons. Small
            developments may combine play areas (e.g., a tot lot incorporated into a larger activity area for
            older children).
        5. Seating areas should be provided where adults can supervise children’s play and also where
            school-age children can sit. Seating location should consider comfort factors, including sun
            orientation, shade, and wind.
   E. Miscellaneous Site Elements
          1. Walls and Fences
                           a. The design of walls and fences, as well as the materials used, should be
                               consistent with the overall development’s design. Fence and wall color
                               should be compatible with the development and adjacent properties. Paint
                               color or stain used on fences should be common colors readily purchased
                               and kept readily available on the development’s premises.
                           b. If front yard fences are provided, visually penetrable materials (e.g., wrought
                               iron or tubular steel) should be used.
                           c. Long fences or walls should consider vertical variation in the design.
                           d. Wall design and selection of materials should consider maintenance issues,
                               especially graffiti removal and long-term maintenance. Concrete capstones
                               on stucco walls are encouraged to help prevent water damage from rainfall
                               and moisture.
                           e. Individual dwelling unit patio and rear yard fences and walls visible from the
                               development’s open space should be no higher than 42 inches for security
                               reasons. Outdoor privacy walls between units, however, may be higher. To
                               increase privacy, it is encouraged that the privacy walls be solid.
          2. Site Furniture
                           a. The design, selection and placement of all site furnishings (e.g., tables,
                               benches, bollards, and trash receptacles) should be compatible with the
                               overall site design and architectural character of the development.
                           b. Seating opportunities should be provided in both sunny and shaded areas.
                               Seating in areas that offer opportunities for social interaction and informal
                               surveillance, (e.g., a bench near the communal mailbox area or benches near
                               tot lot areas and laundry rooms) are strongly encouraged. A variety of sitting
                               area designs, from formal arrangements (benches) to informal arrangements
                               (low walls or steps) is encouraged. In general benches should be located in
                               areas that have some provision for shade.
CITY OF HUGHSON                                                                                    AUGUST 2009

               APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
                     c. A drinking fountain located near each children’s play area is encouraged.
                        Drinking fountains should be “high/low” to accommodate various age
                        groups and disabled persons.
                     d. Onsite trash receptacles and recycling containers should be located in or
                        adjacent to high use areas (e.g., community facilities, play areas, and laundry
                        rooms).
        3. Trash Enclosure Storage Areas
                     a. Trash enclosure and recycling storage areas should be located in convenient
                        but not prominent areas, such as inside parking courts, or at the end of
                        parking bays. They should be well screened but usable by the serving utility
                        company. Screening should be of the same type of material as, or
                        complementary to, the material used on the main building. Landscaping
                        should be provided where possible.
                     b. Trash receptacles should be accessible for trash collection but should not
                        block circulation drives near loading areas or conflict with parking. For
                        security reasons, trash enclosure locations should not create blind spots or
                        hiding areas.
        4. Mailboxes
                     a. Mailboxes should be located in highly visible, heavy use areas for
                        convenience, to allow for casual social interaction, and to promote safety. A
                        bench or seating area in close proximity to the mailbox location is strongly
                        encouraged. A trash receptacle should be located adjacent to the mailboxes.
                     b. Incorporation of design features, such as a built frame consistent with the
                        development’s architectural style, is encouraged.
        5. Signs
                     a. Signs contribute to the development’s identity as a unique environment.
                        Professionally designed, creative signs are strongly encouraged, especially for
                        internal directions and building identification.
                     b. Clear legible entry signs should be provided to identify the development.
                        Internal circulation signs and visitor parking areas should also be clearly
                        indicated. A directory that shows the location of buildings and individual
                        dwelling units within the development is encouraged.
                     c. Building numbers and individual unit numbers should be readily visible, in a
                        consistent location, well lit at night, and compatible with the overall design
                        of the development.
AUGUST 2009                                                                      CITY OF HUGHSON

                         APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
   Architecture
   It is not intended that these guidelines designate a particular architectural style or a specific design
   character. The primary focus should be to construct a high quality residential environment that is
   compatible with the surrounding community. The architectural guidelines address the overall external
   appearance of the development, including building forms, details, and proportions. Use of single-family
   residential design elements (e.g., pitched roofs, porches, individual entries) are recommended to reduce
   perceived density, give identity to the development and its individual dwelling units, add visual interest,
   and be compatible with the neighborhood context.
   A. Architectural
         1. Where the neighborhood or street has a recognizable architectural theme, style, or character, it
              should be incorporated into the development’s design.
         2. To create a unified appearance, all support buildings in the development, (e.g., laundry
              facilities, recreation buildings, carports, garages, and the management office) should be
              compatible in architectural design with the rest of the development.
   B. Building Scale and Height
         1. Buildings should incorporate smaller-scale architectural forms such as bays, recessed or
              projecting balconies, and dormers to visually reduce the height and scale of the building and
              emphasize the definition of individual units. Architectural elements such as bay windows,
              porches, projecting eaves, awnings, and similar elements that add visual interest to the
              development are strongly encouraged.
         2. In order to “scale down” facades that face the street, common open space, and adjacent
              residential structures, it may be desirable to set back portions of the upper floors of new
              multifamily buildings.
         3. Varied building heights are encouraged, both to provide visual interest and give the
              appearance of a collection of smaller structures. Building heights at the development’s edge
              should be considered within the context of the project’s surroundings, the adjacent uses, and
              the distance from adjacent buildings. The development’s building height should create a
              transition from the heights of adjacent existing residential development, rather than form
              abrupt height changes.
   C. Facade Modulation
         1. Boxy and monotonous facades that lack human scale dimensions and have large expanses of
              flat wall planes should be avoided. Architectural treatments, such as recessed windows,
              moldings, decorative trim, balconies, and wood frames, should be used to add visual interest
              to the facade.
         2. Building facades that enclose stairwells should include residential-type windows to reduce the
              visual bulk of the stairwell and enhance safety. Building facades enclosing elevator shafts
              should use architectural treatments to reduce the visual mass.
CITY OF HUGHSON                                                                                 AUGUST 2009

                  APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
        3. To provide visual interest and avoid an identical appearance, garage doors should incorporate
            some architectural detailing that is consistent with the overall development’s architectural
            design, such as patterned garage doors or painted trim.
   D. Building Entries
        1. Courtyard doors or gates used at building entries should be attractively designed as an
            important architectural feature of the building or development.
        2. Individual entries should have a strong relationship with a fronting street, internal walkway, or
            courtyard, as appropriate to the overall siting concept. A transitional area from the public
            space or walkway to the private dwelling unit entry, such as a porch, steps, or landscaped
            walkway, should be provided.
        3. Each dwelling unit’s entry should be emphasized and differentiated through architectural
            detailing and elements such as porches, stoops, or roof canopies. Opportunities should be
            provided for residents to personalize their entry by providing ground level space or a wide
            ledge for potted plants.
   E. Stairs
        1. Not more than three second floor dwelling units should be served by a single flight of stairs.
            Where appropriate for the architectural style, the stairway design should be open to allow
            views for natural surveillance.
        2. Where prefabricated metal stairs are used, additional design features such as screen walls,
            enhanced railings, or accent colors should be used to enhance their appearance. The additional
            design features should be consistent with the overall building design.
   F. Building Materials
        1. The development’s dwelling units, community facilities, and parking structures should be
            unified by a consistent use of building materials, textures, and colors. Exterior columns or
            supports for site elements, such as trellises and porches, should utilize materials and colors
            that are compatible with the rest of the development.
        2. Building materials should be durable, require low maintenance, and be of comparable quality
            and image to what is used in the surrounding neighborhood. Frequent changes in building
            materials should be avoided.
   G. Roofs
        1. Roof pitches and materials should appear residential in character and should consider the
            prevailing roof types in the neighborhood, including flat roofs, hipped or gabled roofs, and
            mansard roofs. The roof pitch for a porch may be slightly lower than the roof pitch of the
            main building.

                       APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
          2. Roof lines should be broken up and varied within the overall horizontal plane. Combinations
             of roof heights that create variation and visual interest are encouraged.
          3. Carport roofs visible from buildings or streets should incorporate the roof pitch and materials
             of the main buildings. Flat carport roofs should be avoided.
   H. Color
          1. Color should be used as an important design element in the development’s appearance. Garish
             and incompatible colors should be avoided. Appropriate use of more than one predominant
             paint color is encouraged. Compatible accent colors are encouraged to enhance important
             building elements.
          2. The color of shadow patterns, relief, decorative trim, and wood frames should be distinctive
             yet compatible with the overall building color.
          3. Materials such as brick, stone, copper, etc. should be left in their natural colors. Such materials
             should not appear thin and artificial. Veneer should turn corners and avoid exposed edges.
   I. Mechanical Equipment and Vents
          1. On-site mechanical equipment visible from buildings or a public street should be screened to
             block sight lines.
          2. Roof flashing and vents exposed to public view should be painted to match adjacent surfaces
             or concealed in a manner consistent with the building’s appearance.
   Landscaping
   Landscaping serves many functions in a multi-family housing development. Plant materials can create
   unique identity, visually connect areas, soften the architecture, provide shade, and screen unattractive
   areas. Landscaping is important to site design and safety/security issues, as it helps to define outdoor
   space and edges and can be used to discourage graffiti. An attractive, well-maintained landscaped
   environment contributes to overall resident satisfaction in the development and enhances the
   appearance of the surrounding neighborhood.
   A. Use of Landscaping
          1. Landscape design and selection of plant materials are an important component in multi-family
             developments. The development’s budget should provide for quality landscaping design,
             proper installation, and plant sizes that will “fill in” and beautify the development within a
             reasonable period of time. Encourage the use of 24” and 36” box trees in landscape design.
          2. Use of landscaping is encouraged to define and accent specific areas such as building and
             parking lot entrances and the main walkways to community facilities.
          3. Plant materials should be used to define the territorial edge between public and private space,
             buffer adjacent uses, when appropriate, and screen service areas.

   B. Landscape Design
        1. Landscaped areas should generally use a three-tiered planting system consisting of ground
            cover; shrubs and vines; and trees. Grass is a high-maintenance ground cover that should be
            used primarily for active recreation areas. Grass should not be used in narrow strip areas;
            groundcover or shrubs are more appropriate.
        2. Different landscape designs and plant materials should be used in the various courtyards and
            common open space areas of the development to create an individual identity for each space.
        3. Landscape designs that emphasize water-efficient plants are encouraged. Water-intensive
            landscaping, such as grass, should be concentrated in areas of high visibility and use.
        4. Vines and climbing plants on buildings, trellises, perimeter walls, and fences are encouraged,
            both to provide an attractive appearance and to minimize graffiti.
        5. Landscape plantings should be used to help define property lines and distinguish private space
            from public space by creating a strong edge through a distinct change of plant material, form,
            height and/or color.
        6. Trees and shrubs should be selected based on their mature size and root characteristics. Plants
            with root systems that uplift hardscape materials should be avoided.
        7. Landscape materials should be used to help screen trash enclosures and mechanical equipment
            so that they are not exposed to view from the street or major walkways within the
            development.
        8. Trees and shrubs should not be planted so close together that they create maintenance and
            security problems at maturity. They should not completely obstruct views into the
            development from the public right-of-way, especially views to dwelling entries and common
            open space areas.
        9. Tree height and spread should consider the location of light standards in order to avoid
            conflicts and maintenance problems as the tree grows.
   The following are design concepts that are encouraged in all developments:
              •   Use specimen trees (24-36” box trees) and accent plant materials at major focal points,
                  such as the entry to the development or where major walkways intersect with the
                  common open space area.
              •   Use landscaping to help define the edges of common open space areas and to
                  distinguish the boundary between private and common open space areas.
              •   Use plantings to soften building lines and emphasize the positive features of the site.
                  Use plantings to create shadows and patterns against walls.

                        APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
                •   Use dense landscaping to physically separate children’s outdoor play areas from
                    vehicular parking or entry areas.
                •   Use trees to create canopy and shade, especially in parking areas and passive open space
                    areas. Trees with open branching structures and less dense foliage should be used to
                    allow “filtered” views to parking lots for security purposes.
                •   Hardscape materials should be consistent with the architectural design or style of the
                    development. The use of interlocking pavers, scored concrete, or rough textured
                    concrete to define site entries is strongly encouraged. Stamped concrete or colored
                    concrete is not recommended due to excessive maintenance and repair costs associated
                    with its use.
   Parking and Circulation
   Safe and efficient parking and circulation arrangements take into consideration the needs of pedestrians,
   children at play, parking lot appearance, and prevention of car theft or damage.
   A. Parking
         1. One large parking area where cars would dominate views and increase perceived density
             should be avoided. Parking areas should be divided into a series of small parking courts with
             convenient access that relates to adjacent dwelling units. For security reasons, dwelling units
             should have sight lines out to the parking areas, but these views should be partially filtered
             through use of appropriate landscaping, such as trees.
         2. Parking areas should be located in the development’s interior and not along street frontages.
             Carports and tuck-under parking should not be visible from a public street.
         3. Parking structures, such as garages and carports, should be located where they do not obstruct
             natural surveillance. See subsection on Public Safety Through Design, below.
         4. Entry drives should have an adjacent pedestrian entry path.
         5. Special accents that define the main entry, create territorial reinforcement, and provide visual
             interest are strongly encouraged. Examples include entry signage with name of project,
             specialty lighting, textured paving, and accent plant materials such as specimen trees and
             flowering plants.
         6. Carports, detached garages, and accessory structures should be designed as an integral part of
             the development’s architecture. They should be similar in material, color, and detail to the
             main buildings of the development. Flat roofs should be avoided. Prefabricated metal carports
             should not be used.
         7. Parking courts should be well designed, with consideration given to landscaping, lighting,
             building massing, and pedestrian/vehicular circulation.
CITY OF HUGHSON                                                                                 AUGUST 2009

                    APPENDIX TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
          8. Visitor and disabled parking should be clearly identified and distributed throughout the
              development to provide convenient access to groups of dwellings and community facilities.
          9. For convenience, parking spaces should be assigned, but the parking space numbering system
              should not identify the dwelling unit that is assigned to the space.
   B. Pedestrian Circulation
   Pedestrian circulation provides safe, efficient access to facilities and dwelling units for residents,
   encourages opportunities for casual social encounters, and allows natural surveillance by residents.
       1. Convenient pedestrian connections should be provided to adjoining residential developments,
            commercial projects, and other compatible land uses.
       2. Pedestrian access to adjacent existing or planned open space areas and corridors should be
            provided for the development’s residents.
       3. Cross circulation between vehicles and pedestrians should be minimized. A continuous, clearly
            marked walkway should be provided from the parking areas to main entrances of buildings.
       4. Walkways should be located to minimize the impact of pedestrians on the privacy of nearby
            residences or private open space. Avoid siting a walkway directly against a building. A
            landscaped planting area between walkways and building facades is strongly encouraged.
       5. Adequate lighting should be provided along all walkways.
   C. Access to Dwellings
   Access to dwellings should provide a unique identity for the individual unit, allow opportunities for
   social interaction and increase natural surveillance.
       1. The main entry to each dwelling unit should be clearly visible from the nearest public circulation
            walkway. A porch, covered stoop, or similar entry feature should be provided at each unit’s
            front entry.
       2. Stairwells should be centrally located to the units served and should be visible from as many
            units as possible.
       3. Not more than three units should share a common entry or stairway.
       4. To minimize the outdoor clutter that can accumulate in private open space areas, private storage
            space for strollers, bicycles, etc., should be provided for each dwelling unit. Its location should
            be either inside the unit, or outside and immediately adjacent to the unit.
       5. Walkways and access to dwelling units should be designed to facilitate the moving of furniture
            by considering minimum widths, heights, and turning angles.

   Public Safety through Design
   Residents have a basic right to feel safe and secure in their homes. The following guidelines promote the
   use of site planning, landscaping, community involvement, and physical and psychological barriers to
   create a safe environment and to prevent crime, vandalism, and graffiti.
   The principles of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) are used extensively. The
   lighting guidelines are less detailed, and recognize that specific illumination levels are dependent on the
   individual site characteristics.
   A. Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
   The following CPTED strategies should be incorporated into the design of multi-family developments,
   whenever possible.
       1. Use the concept of natural surveillance, or “eyes on the street,” by promoting features that
            maximize the visibility of people, parking, and building entrances.
       2. Use the concept of territorial reinforcement by promoting features such as landscape plantings,
            paving designs, and gateway treatments that define property lines and distinguish private space
            from public space.
       3. Use the concept of natural access control by designing streets, walkways, building entrances, and
            development entries to clearly indicate public routes and to discourage access to private areas.
   B. Opportunities for Surveillance
       1. Windows and entries should be placed to maximize natural surveillance of the site. Sight lines
            from dwelling units to the parking area should be provided.
       2. Open spaces, courtyards, circulation corridors, and individual dwelling unit entrances should be
            designed to be visible from as many dwelling units as possible. Enclosure of private open space
            should not prevent common open space surveillance by residents.
       3. The management office should be located in a central, visible location, and community meeting
            rooms and other amenities should also be located close to other heavily used areas.
       4. Laundry rooms should be located adjacent to the children’s play area to facilitate supervision. Doors
            and walls should have windows to allow natural surveillance both into the laundry room and outside
            to the surrounding area.
   C. Hierarchy of Space
       1. Development design should use a “hierarchy of space” to define territory for public space
            (streets), community space (common open space, play areas, communal laundry, community
            center, etc.), and private space (individual units and private open space.) The use of design
            elements to define the public/private edge, such as special paving, change in building materials,
CITY OF HUGHSON                                                                                    AUGUST 2009

          and grade separations, or physical barriers such as landscaping, fences, walls, screens, or building
          enclosures, are encouraged.
       2. Building entrances and individual dwelling unit entries should be accentuated by architectural
          elements, lighting, and/or landscaping to further emphasize their private nature.
       3. Where appropriate, handicapped accessibility should be integrated into the design concept.
   D. Access
       1. Doors to community facilities should contain some transparency and be key-controlled by
          residents. Courtyard gates and shared building entrances that access individual units should
          automatically lock when closed.
       2. All front doors in individual dwelling units should have a peep hole or other feature to allow
          residents to see who is at the door before opening it. To prevent break-ins, door knobs should
          be 40 inches from any window pane. Single cylinder dead bolt locks should be installed on the
          exterior doors of all individual dwelling units. Sliding glass doors should have one permanent
          door on the outside and the inside moving door should have a locking device and a pin.
       3. If security bars are provided, they should be located only on the inside of windows and have
          proper emergency release mechanisms.
   `E. Lighting
       1. Lighting levels should vary depending on the specific use and conditions, but the overall
          consideration should be to provide lighting levels sufficient that intruders cannot lurk in
          shadows, steps and other grade changes are apparent, residents can easily unlock their door or
          identify visitors on their doorstep, and opportunities for theft and vandalism are eliminated.
       2. Street lighting should be installed along the internal circulation streets. Lighting should be
          designed to shine downward and eliminate skyward glare. Light standards should be
          residential/pedestrian in scale and be spaced appropriately for the fixture, type of illumination
          and pole height.
       3. Lighting in parking areas should be arranged to prevent direct glare into adjacent dwelling units
          and onto neighboring uses/properties.
       4. Pedestrian-scaled lighting should be located along all walkways within the development. Lighting
          bollards should not be used as they do not illuminate large enough areas and are subject to
          vandalism. Light standards 12 feet in height are recommended as they allow proper illumination,
          discourage vandalism, and have a pedestrian scale. Site lighting may be located on buildings to
          illuminate site areas not covered by individual light standards.
