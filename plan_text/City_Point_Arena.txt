                                         I. OVERVIEW
1. WHAT THE PLAN COVERS
1.1. Scope, Format and Contents
The Point Arena General Plan is a comprehensive, integrated, and internally consistent statement
of Point Arena's environmental preservation, economic development, land use, public safety,
housing, and development goals, policies, and programs. It is intended to address goals and
needs for a period of approximately fifty years from the date of adoption. As a precautionary
measure, when the population reaches 50% of projected build-out, or in 50 years (which ever
comes first) the City shall undertake steps necessary to reassess and insure the continued ability
to meet infrastructure requirements through build-out.
Its authority derives from the California Government Code, and it contains the seven
State-mandated elements (land use, housing, open space, conservation, circulation (traffic),
safety, and noise) plus two additional elements which are deemed of special concern to Point
Arena: The Economic Development Element and the Coastal Element.
This plan was prepared over a period of many years by a volunteer committee of citizens,
together with the assistance of several consultants, and the city administrator.
The General Plan consists of four maps and the following text. The text is organized to
recognize the interrelationships among planning and development issues and to respond directly
to needs and problems facing the City's citizens and decision makers.
Included as part of and incorporated into the General Plan are the following maps:
The Land-Use and Development Map
The Opportunities and Constraints Map; (1) Scenic Corridors; (2) Natural Hazards; and (3)
Biological Resources and Trails.
This 2001 plan consolidates, amends, updates and supersedes all other plans for Point Arena that
deal with land-use planning, housing, public safety, and environmental preservation matters,
including the Land-Use Plan dated June 30, 1980, and the Housing Element adopted September
10, 1985.
This 2001 General Plan is also intended to serve as the policy and program basis for the Local
Coastal Program (LCP), which program is required by the California Coastal Act. The General
Plan comprises the LCP, and the LCP must be certified by the California Coastal Commission.
The 2006 certified LCP consists of the 2001 General Plan, not including the Housing Element,
the 2001 Zoning Ordinance (No. 179) and the 1997 Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance (No. 166).
The Housing Element is drafted in a different format and style than the other elements, in order
to satisfy the requirements and guidelines of the California Department of Housing and
Community Development, which agency has reviewed a preliminary Housing Element draft and
                                         I. Overview, Page 1
submitted its comments on it. The Housing Element is not currently part of the LCP, but will be
submitted to the California Coastal Commission at a future date for certification.
The General Plan includes the following:
1. A Statement of Community Character and Overall Goals
2. The General Plan Elements. For each of these there are written goals, policies, plan
provisions, and action programs.
3. The General Plan Implementation Program, including a recital of the City's obligations under
the plan, and the responsibilities and rights of property owners.
4. Project Review and Permitting: Requirements and Procedures.
5. General Plan Review and Amendments.
6. A Glossary of Terms.
The General Plan covers the entire city of Point Arena and refers to county territory surrounding
the incorporated city. While county territory is governed by the Mendocino County General Plan
and Zoning Code, it is a Point Arena objective that the immediate surrounding county land-use
designations and regulations are enforced; that any county land-use decisions within the
surrounding area remain compatible with this city's General Plan; and that any contemplated
changes to the County Plan or Zoning Code are referred to the City for comment.
The basic data and information on which this plan is based is set forth and referenced in the body
of the following text or may be found in one of the following reference documents:
The Point Arena Zoning Ordinance
The Land Use Plan of the City of Point Arena, Certified by the California Coastal Commission
June 3, 1980
The Housing Element which was adopted on September 10, 1985
The Community Plan, including Appendix A and B November 1988
The Preliminary Draft General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and Local Coastal Program, which was
submitted for review on January 1986 by consultant Mintier Harnish & Associates but not
adopted by the City
1.2. What Kind of Plan is This?
1. This is an economic development and economic growth plan.
2. This is an environmental protection plan.
                                          I. Overview, Page 2
3. This is a land-use and zoning plan.
1.3. How this General Plan Provides for Healthy Economic Development
1. Within the core commercial and highway commercial areas. The Plan also permits the
inclusion of living units, arts and crafts studios, small businesses and industries, and live-work
units, as part of planned mixed-use developments.
2. It reaffirms the suitability of 27.8 acres of land currently (1994) zoned industrial.
3. It reaffirms the suitability of 16.57 acres of land in the Arena Cove area for coastal-dependent
and visitor-serving uses, approximately 6.83 acres of which are currently undeveloped.
4. It encourages growth of the in-town population (consumers of local goods and services) by
increasing both allowable residential densities and the amount of land available for new housing
in and near Downtown.
5. It reaffirms the long-standing city policy that parcels designated for multiple-family
residential purposes may also include environmentally- and architecturally- compatible office
uses (under certain circumstances).
6. It increases the number of residential zones in which home occupations may be permitted
from four to eight, under prescribed circumstances.
7. It encourages the in-fill development of existing undeveloped commercial and residential lots.
1.4. How this Plan Provides for Protection and Preservation of Environmental Quality
1. It reaffirms the long-standing notion that the town's small-town character and special
environmental characteristics can and should be maintained for economic, public health and
aesthetic reasons by fairly and equitably placing limits on building-to-land intensities of
development, grading, residential densities, and the unnecessary depletion of open space
resources.
2. It provides for the preservation, in as near natural form as possible, of landscapes and land
forms, bluffs, and bluff tops, the coastline, viewsheds, creeks and riparian areas.
3. It affirms the importance to everyone's health and well being the value of Point Arena's
exceptional clean air and low ambient noise levels, both of which are typically subject to subtle
but irreversible decline as a consequence of incremental unregulated development.
4. It asserts the importance of how the city looks—its viewscapes, landscapes and land forms,
building designs and landscapes, architectural landmarks—and not only for how the city looks to
those who live here but to those traveling through and those contemplating investing in the city's
future.
                                            I. Overview, Page 3

To summarize, the keys to Point Arena's health are (1) economic growth and development, and
(2) protection of the city's unique environmental qualities.
This General Plan has as its most fundamental purpose the balancing of these two objectives.
1.5. Legal Basis for this Plan
A general plan is a compilation in one place of policies governing land use, environmental
quality, housing, public safety and transportation. A very substantial proportion of the policies
contained in this General Plan are already in place. They were adopted years ago and are to be
found in the existing Coastal Commission-certified Local Coastal Program (LCP), comprised of
the Land Use Plan and the Zoning Ordinance, and in the city's state-certified Housing Element.
(The existing [1980] LCP and the existing [1985] Housing Element will no longer be in effect
when all elements of this General Plan, including the new Land Use Element and the new
Housing Element, are adopted and certified).
After adoption of this plan, the City must formally amend the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning
Map, as well as such other ordinances as may be affected by this plan, and those amendments
must be consistent with this plan, as per the requirements of California
Planning law.
In addition to restating existing policies and development requirements, some of the policies
contained in this Plan are new. They have been developed during a three-year period by a
committee of local citizens with the assistance of specialized consultants.
State planning law, and other selected state statutes, prescribe exactly what subject matters must
be addressed in a local general plan. With some exceptions, which are noted in the body of the
plan's text, the city has broad discretion in determining what policies it wants to adopt within the
framework the State prescribes by law. The exceptions, noted in the text, represent the few
policies enacted by the State which all cities are obliged to implement through local plans and
programs.
It is intended that this General Plan satisfy and comply with all of the State's planning,
environmental and housing mandates and be judged legally adequate. Pursuant to State law (The
California Environmental Quality Act--[CEQA]) the Planning Commission and/or City Council
may adopt this plan only after considering all pertinent testimony, written and oral, as well as
information contained in the General Plan Environmental Impact Report.
No actions may be taken with respect to planning subjects covered, and policies and programs
set forth and adopted, in this Plan without a formal finding first being made that the proposed
action is consistent with this plan. The "Project Review and Permitting" section spells out the
necessity for findings and the form they must take to make certain discretionary actions of the
Planning Commission and City Council legal.
Nothing in this plan precludes the obligations of the city and property owners alike to comply
with the spirit and letter of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and the state's
Subdivision Map Act, Open Space Lands Act, Endangered Species Act, and California Coastal
Act, as well as other federal and state laws which may take precedence over, or be applicable in
                                           I. Overview, Page 4
lieu of or in addition to, local ordinances. It is the obligation of all responsible parties to ensure
that laws, regulations and processes promulgated by agencies other than the City of Point Arena
are complied with.
2. THE GENERAL PLAN PREPARATION PROCESS
The process followed to create this General Plan began in January 1990 when the City Council
authorized and instructed that a plan be prepared by a citizens' committee appointed to undertake
the work. At that time the city had no general plan. It did have, however, an adopted Local
Coastal Program (LCP), which included a Land Use Plan and the Zoning Ordinance, as well as
an adopted and State-certified Housing Element.
This comprehensive general plan, the first ever for Point Arena, was prepared by a committee of
citizens with the assistance of several consultants. The consultants helped prepare the Housing
Element, the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), and the Traffic and Circulation Element. The
individuals and firms participating in the preparation of this general plan are acknowledged at
the end of this document.
Public Hearings on this Draft General Plan must precede adoption.
The General Plan is subject to environmental review as required by the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be reviewed by the public
and the planning commission/city council before this General Plan may be adopted and become
effective.
Any amendments to the General Plan, once it is adopted, or enactment of most programs and
ordinances pertaining to the matters addressed in this plan, also require public hearings.
Henceforth, "Findings of Fact" that certain actions are consistent with the General Plan and with
CEQA must be made prior to said actions becoming legally valid. (See the sections in this
document entitled "Project Review and Permitting: Regulations and Procedures" and "General
Plan Review and Amendments".)

                 II. COMMUNITY CHARACTER AND OVERALL GOALS
1. INTRODUCTION
The major goals of this General Plan are described below, along with some of the reasons behind
them. These goals set the theme for guiding Point Arena's growth and development; for the
conservation of its character, open spaces, and natural resources; and for the general welfare and
well-being of its citizens.
This chapter also is concerned with how Point Arena looks and feels. It attempts to translate
these intangibles into policies and programs needed to achieve the overall goals cited below.
Also included are the principal characteristics of Point Arena that may constrain or limit
development, or define the form development may take, and the characteristics of the town
which present tangible opportunities for the future well being of the town's citizens.
2. OVERALL GOALS
2.1. Goal #1: Preserve the Small-Town Rural Character of Point Arena
This means: What kind of a place do we want Point Arena to be 10-20 years from now, 30 years
from now? What should it look like? How shall it feel? What do we want to have happen or
change? What should stay pretty much the same? What makes Point Arena unique and special?
 What will we discourage, and what will we not tolerate?
These are among the basic questions we must keep in mind each time we examine a proposed
general plan element, consider a rezoning or subdivision map proposal, or deal with a specific
development proposal.
The following is the perceived consensus of public opinion regarding the desired character of
Point Arena. People like the town's present semi-rural, low-key, modest and unpretentious
atmosphere as well as its
       low population density and building intensity
       historic buildings
       absence of "cuteness" and "artiness"
       mixed uses (absence of strict and artificial separations between residential and
        non-residential uses, for example) "unpretentious" building designs with an absence of
        any city-imposed mandatory design themes
       features of a real town, not just a wide place in the road or accidental settlement of
        convenience
       stores; with an "old time" motion picture theater, general stores, and small-town
        character, with curbs, gutters and sidewalks
                                       II. Community Char., Page 1

       "sense of community" in which people of various ages, educational achievements,
        socio-economic condition, and points of view co-exist and make the town "work", and
        cooperate on matters of civic concern
       collection of vacant lots Downtown that may provide start-up business opportunities for
        people with limited incomes, provided incentives are built into the Zoning Ordinance to
        make this happen
       open spaces, views and vistas, oceanside bluffs, clean air, quietude, open fields, access to
        the ocean, and proximity to working farms
       the cove and pier...the first driving north after leaving Bodega Bay and the first driving
        south after leaving Albion
       absence of strung-out, strip-commercial developments along the highway...a common but
        unpopular occurrence in most of California.
These are the characteristics that define and give special and unique identity to Point Arena...the
characteristics that are to be championed in this plan and preserved through the planning and
plan-implementation process.
2.2. Goal #2: Ensure Public Safety
The most significant risks to property, well being, and the environment are geologic and seismic
hazards, flooding, non- seismically-induced soils hazards, fires, and possible poor water quality.
 Secondary issues of public safety are air pollutants and unwanted noise.
The city shall establish acceptable levels of risk and safety, cause vulnerable buildings to be
brought up to these standards, and enforce standards for the design of new structures.
The city shall also avoid placement of cultural, educational and high-occupancy structures in
areas prone to ground failure during an earthquake.
Furthermore, the city shall ensure through the enactment of public policies and programs that its
employees, citizens, and business persons are prepared for effective responses to major seismic
and other emergencies.
To the fullest extent possible the city shall avoid approving grading, new land uses and
developments, and facility locations that may result in property damage, may threaten the public
safety and well-being of its citizens, or may negatively impact the environment.
2.3. Goal #3: Encourage Economic Growth and Development
Population growth and new development are to be encouraged, but indiscriminate growth
contrary to and inconsistent with other city goals is not welcome.
Substantial population growth is not likely since North Coast California is and will continue to
be a slow-growth region of the state. Some small growth of population will be a function
of new arrivals from outside the area.
                                        II. Community Char., Page 2

Development growth should occur within the annexed area and also as a result of city-inspired
infilling within and adjoining Downtown on undeveloped and under-developed existing lots.
Local economic development cannot and should not be overly dependent upon tourists, however.
 New techniques for stimulating all suitable types of economic development are necessary.
Among the most significant measures appropriate to Point Arena, over which the city council has
direct control are:
        adopting incentive zoning (see Land-Use and Development Element) to inspire income-
         and tax-producing activities, giving special attention to new small businesses, offices,
         and small manufacturing, fabricating, and crafts enterprises
        creating Downtown parking that is attractive, free, and convenient
        publicizing the existence and location of the Cove which at present is not boldly
         identified or signed such that the passing motorist notices
        improving the city's appearance and otherwise giving the driving public a reason to stop
        supporting and seeking funds from public transit programs of county, state and federal
         agencies.
Other economic development opportunity areas are within the Hay Annexation Area and on
commercially-zoned parcels along Highway 1 at the north and south ends of town.
2.4. Goal #4: Preserve Open Spaces, Natural Resources, Coastal Assets and Environmental
Quality
Point Arena's natural features, environmental quality, clean air, low ambient noise levels, and
open spaces are valuable and precious resources which shall be protected from neglect, careless
use, and deliberate destructive actions. The city council shall spearhead actions to accomplish
this goal, which is consistent with the California Coastal Act, and warrants reemphasizing as a
fundamental component of the General Plan.
Planning must ensure, through specific policies and regulations, the preservation of identifiable
open spaces in and adjoining Point Arena as well as the sense of open space within the city, even
within the most populated areas. Open space takes the form of parks, greenbelts, farms, open
bluffs, undeveloped hillsides, and scenic corridors/viewsheds. A sense of open space is achieved
through maintaining low residential densities and building intensities, and through the clustering
of buildings so as to leave substantial open land around structures and between developments.
Planning must also protect natural resources and sensitive habitats, stream beds, creeks and
wetlands from inappropriate, unnecessary and damaging developments and from pollutants,
uncontrolled grading, and neglect.
For county areas adjoining Point Arena and outside the "urban limit line" every effort shall be
made to work with the county to keep agriculture lands viable and as long as possible to ensure
their preservation.
The techniques for preserving natural resources and open spaces must be a combination of
                                       II. Community Char., Page 3

zoning regulations, including the introduction of open space standards and open space
zones/overlay zones; dedications as a condition of development permit approvals; deed
restrictions; outright purchases by public agencies or private organizations, and possibly the
transfer of development rights.
2.5. Goal #5: Promote Affordable Housing
There are two ways to further the cause of creating additional housing at "affordable" costs. One
is to wait for those publicly-financed programs that come and go, which attempt to close the gap
between housing prices and personal income. Over recent years housing prices have risen and
incomes, especially at the lower economic levels, have remained steady or declined. The federal
and state governments have not responded realistically or adequately to deal with these realities
(nor are they likely to in the near future), and local governments rarely have sufficient resources
to do so. Point Arena has no money for such things as emergency housing, transitional housing,
or low-cost permanent affordable housing. Moreover, there are virtually no available rentals
(vacancies) in the area, in spite of the high ratio of renter- to owner-occupied housing in the city.
 The clear conclusion is that housing for very-low, low- and some moderate- income persons and
families is very scarce indeed.
Even if the County's less-than-modest housing assistance program, intended for low-income
families, funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD, Section 8),
were more adequately funded, without a housing stock (available units on the market to live in)
the program doesn't do much good for those in need...very low- and low-income individuals and
families...who want to live in or near Point Arena. While the County also administers a "public
housing program" whereby it owns units and offers them for rent to qualifying persons, without
any housing stock the program has no positive impact in Point Arena at the present time.
The second way to deal with housing needs is to include provisions in the General Plan and
Zoning Ordinance that affordable housing shall be provided as a proportion of major private
development projects. Incentives for property owners/developers to build affordable housing
shall be a community goal; incentives can be in the form of density bonuses if such bonuses can
be found consistent with all applicable provisions of the certified LCP.
Also, as a condition of approval of large residential subdivisions a proportion of the new lots
and/or housing units should be reserved for affordable housing...a common practice throughout
California to enlist the private sector in affordable housing solutions through the
project-approval process. To accomplish this goal may require mandates as well as residential
density-bonus incentives. Implementation of new policies to promote affordable housing will
require certification of LCP amendments.
The ultimate goal is for the City to encourage through public policies and programs the
ownership of as many housing units as possible by as many people who want them, at affordable
costs, not just for persons with more than ample income or assets but also for individuals,
families and single parents with limited or modest incomes.
                                       II. Community Char., Page 4
2.6. Goal #6: Improve Public Facilities, Services and Transportation Systems
Various public works and public facilities are presently aging or are non existent, or are in need
of maintenance, or may become inadequate in the near future. Included in this category are
selected city streets and roads, the waste water (sewer) system, elements of the local water
distribution system (a privately- owned utility under California Public Utility Commission
oversight), public off-street parking, parks and recreation facilities, public safety facilities, and
trails/sidewalks.
To accommodate new as well as the existing population and businesses the city shall undertake a
comprehensive program to upgrade and create adequate public facilities and services. This
program shall be a combination of city-financed capital improvements, which may require bond
issues, and "exactions" (the process whereby as a condition of subdivision and development
approval the developer dedicates land and/or pays fees in order that facilities generated by and
for the benefit of the development are provided).
Furthermore, the city shall ensure that new streets and trails to be considered for acceptance into
the Point Arena street system conform to design standards appropriate to their functional
classification. Priority attention should be given to adopting exacting standards as a basis for
reviewing tentative subdivision map applications.
Adequate off-street parking Downtown shall be ensured through a combination of the continuing
application of existing ordinances and the development by the city of one or more off-street
parking lots as a priority public works project.
A schedule of "development impact fees" as a method to finance roadways and other public
facilities shall be adopted as soon as possible.
A year-round bridge or crossing of the Garcia River shall be established.
Eventually, a Highway One bypass route to replace the present location of the in-town State
highway shall be recognized as a significant transportation improvement and policy objective.
2.7. Goal #7: Promote Energy Conservation and Recycling
Preserving non-renewable energy resources, promoting the recycling of household and
industrial products, and minimizing unnecessary disposal of solid wastes when alternatives are
available are national, state, and county goals that the City of Point Arena shall adhere to in the
small ways available to it. Among the goals are recovering materials from solid wastes,
promoting the use of solar energy, and developing land-use regulations and Zoning Ordinance
provisions for new subdivisions that mandate the maximum possible reliance upon passive solar
heating or other energy-saving features.
                                       II. Community Char., Page 5
2.8. Goal #8: Assist in Implementing the California Coastal Act
In addition to the goals enumerated above, the city shall, to the extent required by law,
implement relevant California Coastal Act policies through its certified Local Coastal Program
including, but not limited to policies for preserving marine resources; protecting the quality of
coastal waters, streams, and wetlands; regulating the diking, filling and dredging of open coastal
waters, wetlands and estuaries; protecting environmentally-sensitive habitat areas; giving
priority to coastal-dependent uses on or near the coastline; limiting oil and gas developments in
accordance with state and local statutes; and, maintaining the viability of existing agricultural
uses in accordance with the provisions of California Coastal Act Sections 30241 - 30243.
3. CONSTRAINTS AFFECTING DEVELOPMENT
3.1. Introduction
Development within Point Arena must be limited or constrained by certain realities. First are
physical hazards including seismic hazards, as well as slope and soils conditions.
Moreover, the availability or not of water and waste water facilities may constrain development
or dictate where and when development may occur or not occur.
Building and development can not occur haphazardly; they must, for reasons of safety to people
and property, be limited through public policies (land use, zoning, subdivision, and
environmental); and the mapping of hazardous areas, as a component of the General Plan, must
be accomplished as a basis for adopting regulations.
Development must also be subject to the availability of sufficient water and sewer capacity and
facilities, and in some cases be conditional upon extensions and upgrades of existing
infrastructure or upon the provision of new facilities.
Finally, development of Point Arena may well be constrained generally or within specific areas
by virtue of a consensus among the populace that certain changes in the status quo, or threats to
natural or man-made features and the town's existing identity, will not be tolerated.
3.2. Existing Physical Hazards
Among the non-seismic physical hazards which must be taken into account and may constrain or
limit the location or extent of development are the potential for cliff failure or retreat along the
coastal bluffs; the potential for non-seismically-induced soils hazards imposing limits on
urban-type development; shallow soil depths which may constrain septic sanitation disposal
systems; the poor bearing capacity of surface and sub-surface soil materials, which may pose the
risk of soil failure on steeper slopes, particularly when water saturated; and the danger of wave
actions at the Cove.
Direct risk of land surface rupture (seismic hazards) along a fault trace during an earthquake
                                        II. Community Char., Page 6
would pose a hazard to structures, utilities, or roads which traverse or straddle the fault. The San
Andreas Fault and the Hathaway Creek Fault pose the kind of risk potential which must be taken
into account as a part of the process of project review.
Secondary seismic risks are created by the energy release by movement along a fault and
include: ground shaking, landslides, lurch-cracking of the soil surface, and liquefaction of soils.
Tsunamis (tidal wave action which may result during a major earthquake) are an additional risk
factor.
Flood dangers exist along the length of Arena Creek and may increase with runoff from
up-stream development.
Fire hazards may be due to wildland fires, structural fires, and hazards posed by fuel
storage/distribution depots. The degree of risk is related in part to the readiness of fire-fighting
authorities and water availability.
3.3. Infrastructure Constraints
Among the possible constraints to further development of Point Arena are any limitations to
property access that may be due to the absence or inadequacy of streets and roads; limitations
posed by any limited sewer capacity; and limitations posed by the unavailability of water.
To date new sewer hook-ups to new developments are supposed to have been based on the
policy of infilling, which, at the time the policy was initially adopted in the 1980 LCP, meant
encouraging development on vacant lots within areas of existing development before extending
services to outlying areas, with top priority to be given to existing developments within zones
not presently served by sewers, and secondary priority given to undeveloped lots in these zones.
The 1980 LCP also specified that a portion of the city's sewage capacity be reserved for
commercial uses, namely existing vacant parcels within the infill areas. Residential and
commercial parcel sizes were to be limited to one acre minimum in areas not now served by
water and sewer facilities.
On the whole these old policies were not strictly adhered to and are not considered appropriate to
the new thinking that is going into this new General Plan. The main point is that unless there is
some sort of explicit "growth management" plan to be followed, (no such plan is included in this
General Plan) then the most reasonable solution is for sewer capacity and sewer facilities to be
upgraded to handle need as and where it develops. The same can be said for domestic water
services and facilities.
Accordingly, until such time as up-to-date engineering studies are completed the City will rely
upon existing available information on the area's water and sewer systems and capacities, and,
within a five-year time frame, will re-assess the suitability of the present systems. The City finds
that within this five-year time frame the present systems will meet foreseeable needs and will
accommodate growth and development as set forth in this General Plan.

3.4. Constraints Imposed By Local Values and Expectations
The following are Point Arena's "Sacred Cows" ... those features which are to be maintained and
preserved as the town grows and accommodates more people, businesses, and houses. The
General Plan acknowledges these and other features and asserts that they are to be taken into
account with respect to all new developments in order to create a more perfect environment and
save what is highly regarded by the populace. The "sacred cows" of Point Arena are:
1. Coastal bluffs and access to them by foot
2. Viewsheds and open space features
3. Historic buildings of merit
4. The integrity, water quality and natural condition of Point Arena Creek
5. The town's special air quality
6. The low ambient noise levels
7. The town's overall low population density and building intensity
8. The semi-rural, small-town, unpretentious character of Point Arena
9. The existing relatively-restrained signing of commercial and business establishments
10. The rural countryside surrounding Point Arena
4. OPPORTUNITIES
Every community possesses its own unique set of characteristics and features that present
opportunities for the future, and Point Arena is no exception. For Point Arena the most
significant opportunities are the potentials that exist for:
1. Increased economic development and recreational opportunities at the Cove, Downtown and
along Highway 1
2. "Capturing" more tourist dollars as traffic on Highway 1 increases, provided reasons to stop
exist by the side of the road
3. Creating housing opportunities within the underdeveloped Downtown area and as part of new
housing built within new subdivisions
4. "Capturing" an increased demand for consumer goods and services because of new houses
being built and occupied within rural areas outside the urban limit line of Point Arena
5. Attracting and accommodating craftspeople and artists, and small cottage industries, as part of
a privately- initiated City-inspired Downtown revitalization program
6. Allowing a greater proportion of residential units connected with commercial Downtown
growth...in order to foster mixed uses, Downtown revitalization, a built-in demand for
                                      II. Community Char., Page 8
Downtown goods and services, and affordable housing (on now undeveloped and
underdeveloped lots)
7. "Capitalizing" on the inventory of historical buildings, which buildings contribute to the
town's attractiveness, character, and identity
8. Conserving existing natural features, viewsheds, open spaces, air quality, low ambient noise
levels...due to the fact that little has occurred so far to irretrievably damage or destroy these
resources and assets
9. Accommodating no-negative-impact home occupations within residential areas...in
recognition of the fact that increasing numbers of people can and wish to work in their homes,
especially those involved in or dependent on high-tech electronic communications activities (use
of computers, FAX machines, modems, etc.), and
10. Accommodating light industrial activities (and fostering job opportunities in the
presently-zoned industrial area.
5. MAPS
The various resource designations appearing on the General Plan maps represent the best
information available at this time and, therefore, create a presumption of accuracy which may be
overcome only with additional information that can be shown to be a more accurate
representation of the existing situation than the information has been used to determine these
boundaries. Such showing shall be done in the context of an amendment to the General
Plan/Local Coastal Plan.
Development proposals in or adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas such as
wetlands, riparian zones on streams or sensitive plant or wildlife habitats including, but not
limited to those shown on the Land Use Map and Opportunities and Constraints Map:
“Biological Resources and Trails” shall be subject to special review to determine the current
extent of the sensitive resource and appropriate development controls and mitigation measures
consistent with the applicable policies of the LCP.
6. INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
To achieve the Overall Goals of this 2001 Point Arena General Plan there are eight General Plan
Elements. In this chapter the specific goals, policies, and programs of each of the following
elements are set forth.

                      III. LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
1. INTRODUCTION
The chief expression of private and public expectations in matters of town planning is the
land-use element. In this element every parcel of land is designated for its best use given (1) the
feasibility of land usage considering physical conditions and limitations or opportunities, and (2)
the perceived ultimate general welfare consistent with the community goals set forth at the
beginning of this General Plan document, and consistent with the California Coastal Act and
California planning laws.
The "Land-Use and Development Map", which is incorporated as part of this General Plan,
portrays the general pattern of future land usage, depicts land-use designations for each parcel of
land in the city, and also is an expression of the desired and permissible land-use types and their
locations throughout the city. What will occur, ultimately, is the gradual build-out of activities
within these patterns of land uses according to specific development standards set forth in this
element, elsewhere in the General Plan, and in the Zoning Ordinance.
The purpose of the Land-Use and Development Element of this General Plan is to depict the
future pattern of land uses and also to set forth policies, programs, and review procedures
governing conservation and development within the land-use designations depicted on the
"Land-Use and Development Map" and on the "Opportunities and Constraints Map". The latter
map is also incorporated as a part of this general plan.
The "Land-Use and Development Map", upon its adoption, also may become the city's official
"Zoning Map".
2. FINDINGS
Point Arena's total land area is 829 net acres (Public streets are not included in this figure). This
total is divided into approximately 280 assessor's parcels of various sizes accommodating a
variety of rural and urban uses, including open spaces and unbuildable lands. The overall
impression is of abundant open space, including properties that have not been developed to their
full potential, low residential densities, the presence in town of many urban development
opportunities, and an attractive and unique rural and small-town character.
According to the 1990 U.S. Census, Point Arena's population was at that time 407--living in
approximately 200 dwelling units. (The State Department of Finance's January 1, 1994 estimate
of population was 409). The in-city growth rate is judged to be extremely modest throughout the
near term, although the general market-area population (persons living within the city limits plus
those living in the surrounding county territory) is likely to increase somewhat. The date by
which build-out might occur is unknown and it is an event that will occur very far into the future.
                                           III. Land Use, Page 1
This plan addresses short-term goals and needs (next 5-10 years) and provides more than enough
room for residential development to meet all foreseeable needs.
Commercial development is a function of residential growth within the city and within the
surrounding market area, and on the growth of tourism. Industrial development, and the
formation of cottage industries and small businesses, is a function of factors not easy to predict
and not within the direct influence of the city. For the foreseeable future there is ample land set
aside in this plan for new and expanding commercial, industrial activities and small-business
activities.
3. LAND-USE GOALS
The following are the Land-use Goals of this 1994 General Plan:
1. To accommodate future urban-type development within the city's "urban limit line".
2. To maintain the city's small-town, open and rural character through low residential densities
and building intensities, and through the preservation of open spaces.
3. To provide for a strong and healthy downtown commercial core that can also accommodate a
mixture of commercial, office, small business, and residential activities.
4. To adopt land-use and development policies that welcome and encourage economic
development and growth, job formations, a variety of new housing opportunities, infilling of new
development within the Downtown area, increased but limited development at the Cove, and
industrial-type uses in the City's industrial area.
5. To require sewer and/or water hookups, and expansion of both systems, within most of the
urbanized and urbanizing portions of the urban limit line, so that development may proceed
unimpeded in all areas of the city in response to needs and demands for service, provided that the
systems are deemed adequate and that extensions of facilities can be shown to be financially and
fiscally feasible or will be provided as a condition of development.
To achieve these goals there are included herein six sub-elements: (1) the Land-Use and
Development map, (2) the Opportunities and Constraints map, (3) a description of land-use and
zoning categories and permissible uses within each, (4) a table of residential density policies, (5)
a statement of overriding citywide land-use and development policies and programs, and (6)
procedures governing project review and the issuance of permits.
4. LAND-USE AND DEVELOPMENT MAP
The "Land-Use and Development Map" depicts graphically the City's intentions and policies for
growth, development, and land usage, and for the preservation and safety of public and private
                                          III. Land Use, Page 2
properties, within the city limits, and records the county plan's land-use designations for the
immediate surrounding county territory.
The permitted land-use designations shown on the Map generally echo existing patterns of land
usage. A few land-use changes have been made to the current Land-Use Plan (LUP)...the one in
effect prior to the adoption of the 1994 Land-Use Element of this General Plan, and these are
largely increases in the amount and extent of land available for multi-family residential uses.
5. OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS MAP
In addition to the "Land-Use and Development Map", the "Opportunities and Constraints Maps"
serve as "overlays", the purpose of which are to depict the City's intentions and policies
regarding open spaces, creeks and stream beds, riparian areas, view sheds and view corridors,
conservation areas, safety and seismic safety considerations, natural habitat areas, and trails.
The Maps are an "early-warning" depiction of matters that shall be attended to as part of project
planning and review; they are further described in the text of this General Plan. Not all wetland
and environmentally sensitive areas (ESHA) can be shown on the maps and the determination of
what constitutes a wetland and/or ESHA shall not be limited to what is mapped. Any areas
meeting the definitions of ESHA and wetlands in the certified LCP shall be subject to the
policies and standards of the certified LCP regarding the protection of ESHA and wetlands,
respectively.
6. LAND-USE DESIGNATIONS
Each parcel of land in Point Arena (as shown on the "Land-Use and Development Map") falls
into one of several land-use categories. In addition to the assignment of a land-use category to
each parcel of land in the city, specific development standards pertaining to each land-use
category (zone) are to be incorporated into the revised Zoning Ordinance after this General Plan
and this element are officially adopted, or amendments made to the existing ordinance, as the
case may be.
Since this is the Land-Use and Development Element of the General Plan, and not the Zoning
Ordinance, permissible uses (uses by right) and conditional uses (which will require a use
permit), which uses are listed below, are not necessarily all-inclusive and may be added to when
the Zoning Ordinance itself is evaluated in detail and amended, as the next step following
adoption of this General Plan. An amended Zoning Ordinance, by law, must carry out the
objectives and policies of this element, and, furthermore, not be found to be inconsistent with
those objectives and policies. Accordingly, any additional permissible or conditional uses that
may be considered for inclusion when the Zoning Ordinance is in the process of being amended
must be consistent with the stated purposes and policies of the land-use category as set forth in
this element, and, furthermore, can not be inconsistent with the policies pertaining to any other
element of this General Plan.

7. OVERALL CITYWIDE LAND-USE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The following policies and programs are not lot-specific or zoning district specific but apply
throughout the city where applicable. These policies are in addition to, or shall supersede, as the
case may be, the "General Provisions and Exceptions" of the Zoning Ordinance (beginning at
Section 5.01).
1. The City shall encourage and allow new development in those areas of the city where
adequate water supply, sewage disposal capacity, and traffic capacity exist to serve both the new
development and future priority uses planned throughout the City. .
2. The City shall adopt policies and programs in order to meet local public facility and
infrastructure needs through exactions; dedications; impact, linkage, in-lieu, and development
fees, and other techniques. These policies, programs, and fees shall be established in accordance
with various provisions of the Government Code, including the State's AB1600 legislation.
3. Coastal access shall be maintained, and coastal bluffs shall be protected from development
and erosion.
4. No new development shall be allowed within or adjacent to riparian corridors along Arena
Creek, or other environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHA) where mapped (on the
Opportunities and Constraints Map: Biological Resources and Trails) or within or adjacent to
other unmapped ESHAs that meet the ESHA criteria contained in LUP Chapter X Section 2.4
without first obtaining appropriate permits. New development includes, but is not limited to,
vegetation removal, grading, filling, soils or refuse dumping, and the alteration of creek banks.
New development adjacent to ESHA shall provide native vegetation buffer areas to serve as
transitional habitat and provide distance and physical barriers to human intrusion. The ESHA
Buffer Zone is defined in the Glossary and Appendix A of the Zoning Ordinance. The purpose of
this buffer area is to provide for a sufficient area to protect environmentally sensitive habitats
from significant degradation resulting from future development. Vegetation removal, vegetation
thinning, or planting of non-native or invasive vegetation may not be permitted within buffers.
Buffers shall be of a sufficient size to ensure the biological integrity and preservation of the
ESHA they are designed to protect. The buffer area shall be a minimum of 100 feet and shall be
larger if necessary to protect the resources of the particular habitat area from possible significant
degradation caused by the proposed development. No buffer may be less than 100 feet unless it
can be demonstrated, based on the criteria below and after City consultation with the California
Department of Fish and Game, that 100 feet is not necessary to protect the resources of the
particular habitat area from possible significant degradation caused by the proposed
development. No buffer area may be less than 50 feet in width. Standards for determining an
appropriate width of the buffer area are set forth in Zoning Ordinance Section 5.22.
New subdivisions or boundary line adjustments shall not be allowed which will create or provide
for new parcels entirely within a buffer area.
                                           III. Land Use, Page 4
Only resource dependent uses such as public nature trails shall be allowed within ESHA or in the
ESHA buffer zone including public access trail crossings provided that (1) the length of the trail
within the riparian corridor shall be minimized, (2) the trail crosses the stream at right angles to
the maximum extent feasible, (3) the trail is kept as far up slope from the stream as possible, (4)
trail development involves a minimum of slope disturbance and vegetation clearing, and (5) the
trail is the minimum width necessary.
Pre-existing buildings and non-conforming uses within riparian buffer zones may continue as
legally non-conforming, but no additions that encroach closer to the stream or creek within said
buffer zone shall be permitted, with the following exception contingent upon required findings
set forth in Zoning Ordinance Section 5.22:
     a. Accessory structures located at the City's waste water reclamation facility situated entirely
     within the developed fenced area subject to a coastal development permit consistent with all
     other applicable provisions of the certified LCP.
5. Sensitive habitat areas shall be preserved.
6. No development and no activity on any property, including site preparation work, earth
moving and grading, shall be allowed to discharge harmful pollutants or untreated runoff into the
waters at the Cove, or into any creek, or into the air.
7. Comprehensive assessments of risks posed to the general public shall be required for any
development proposal as part of CEQA-required environmental assessments, which assessments
shall include but not be limited to analyses of noise sources, potential sources of pollutants, and
potential risks associated with soils and seismic conditions.
8. All developments in hazardous areas, and on severely constrained or unstable soils, shall be
qualified as to the suitability of the site for the proposed development, pursuant to appropriate
geological and soils engineering studies prior to approval to grade or develop any property
public or private, and findings regarding the results of geologic and related investigations shall
be made as per provisions of Section 6.08 of the Zoning Ordinance prior to the issuance of any
permit.
9. All required qualifying investigations for grading, site preparation and development in
hazardous and constrained areas shall be conducted by a licensed engineering geologist or
registered civil engineer with expertise in soils or foundation engineering, mitigation measures
identified in these studies shall be required as a condition of all land preparation and
development approvals, as per Sections 5.15, 5.20, and 5.21 of the Zoning Ordinance.
10. The City shall prohibit diking, dredging and filling operations which may negatively impact
streams, water and marine resources, and sensitive habitats, and all diking, dredging, and filling
operations shall conform to all applicable provisions of the LCP. Necessary permits from the
California department of Fish and Game and from the Water Resources Control Board shall be
required on all such projects before any city permits are issued. Any alteration of wetlands,
                                            III. Land Use, Page 5
including diking, filling and dredging, shall meet all provisions and mitigation requirements of
State planning laws, the California Coastal Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regulations,
federal and state statutes governing wetlands and the protection of endangered species, and all
other applicable provisions of the LCP.
11. Continuing agricultural uses of lands which have the soils, acreage and water capability to
sustain such operations are encouraged but not required. The maximum amount of prime
agricultural land (see glossary for definition) shall be maintained in agricultural production;
conflicts shall be minimized between agricultural and urban uses; and lands suitable for
agricultural use shall not be converted to non-agricultural uses unless continued or renewed
agricultural use is not feasible. All actions undertaken by the City governing use and conversion
of agricultural lands shall be governed by Sections 30241, 30241.5, 30242, and 30243 of the
California Coastal Act.
12. Individual mobile homes qualify as permissible single-family dwellings, and are permitted
by right in all residential zones except in the Multi-Family Residential (MR) Zone. Mobile
home parks or projects (two or more mobile homes on one parcel of land) may be permitted in
the Highway Commercial (HWC) zone only, and are subject to securing a use permit and to the
City's mobile home regulations (Zoning Ordinance Section 5.30) and to coastal development
permit requirements and all applicable policies of the LCP, including, but not limited to visual
resource protection policies and water quality policies.
13. New physical development shall be contained within the boundaries of the City limits of
Point Arena. The city shall work with the County of Mendocino to promote continuing
agricultural uses in county territory, and to prevent the intrusion of urban uses and rural
residential developments into surrounding agricultural lands, except in accordance with
presently-allowable policies in the County General Plan and Zoning Code.
14. Public views, viewsheds, view corridors, buildings of architectural and historical merit,
existing topographic features, and existing important clusters of trees, shall be preserved and
maintained.
15. Lot splits or minor subdivisions (the subdivision of lots into four or less parcels) shall be
subject to city coastal development permit approval and to the provisions of the city's
Subdivision Ordinance, the State's Subdivision Map Act, and the California Coastal Act.
16. Common Open Spaces are to be provided for in new residential developments in accordance
with policies set forth in the Land Use and in the Open Space and Conservation elements of this
General Plan, and in the Zoning Ordinance.
17. Approval of new subdivisions and other developments shall be consistent with the policies
and standards of the LCP in addition to the provisions of the California Subdivision Map Act and
city requirements for the dedication of land for streets, trails and pathways, parks and other
public improvements, and shall be subject to the improvement and design standards of the City's
subdivision and other development regulations.
                                          III. Land Use, Page 6
18. An Architectural and Historic Preservation Element, an inventory of which has been
prepared for the City by the State of California, shall be prepared and adopted as soon as
possible. In the interim the Planning Commission or the Design Assistance Committee shall be
responsible for implementing the requirements governing such assets in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 5.15 and 5.16 of the Zoning Ordinance.
19. Bed and breakfast inns are conditionally permitted uses in all residential areas/zones.
20. Site and building designs shall comply with the requirements of the LCP, including but not
limited to Zoning Ordinance provisions governing signs, landscaping and screening, site
preparation and development, and building design, and visual resource protection policies of
Chapter X and Chapter VI of the General Plan/LUP, and shall be subject to review and approval
by the Design Assistance Committee, as provided in the Zoning Ordinance.
21. A second dwelling unit ordinance shall be prepared and enacted into law in accordance with
State planning law. Second dwelling units may be allowed by use permit on legally-conforming
residential properties, where there is an existing single-family home, but only in accordance
with State planning law and all applicable provisions of the LCP.
22. No signs shall be erected unless in compliance with all applicable provisions of the LUP,
including, but not limited to, the signing regulations of the Zoning Ordinance and coastal
development permit requirements.
23. Home occupations shall be principally permitted uses in residential districts subject to
securing a "Home Occupation Permit" and a city business license, and subject to meeting the
performance standards for home occupations found in the Zoning Ordinance.
24. (NO SECTION)
25. A system of coastal trails shall be ensured and coastal bluffs shall be protected by setbacks
that meet the criteria established by Sections 5.20 and 5.21 of the Zoning Ordinance.
26. Visual corridors of the waterfront shall be protected and enhanced.
27. Public access points to the coast and (linear) foot paths shall be incorporated into
development plans.
28. The scenic resources and attributes of lands adjacent to the waterfront shall be considered
and protected as resources of public importance.
29. Permitted development shall be sighted and designed to protect scenic views associated with
Public Trust lands and resources.
30. In addition to the Chapter 3 policies of the Coastal Act, the following Public Trust resource
                                          III. Land Use, Page 7
management policies of the State of California shall be adhered to:
    a. Fishing: Facilities serving recreational fishing shall be identified and shall be protected
    and where feasible upgraded.
    b. Scenic Resources: The scenic resources of public trust lands and resources shall be
    considered and protected as a resource of public importance. Permitted development shall be
    sited and designed to protect scenic views associated with public trust lands and resources.
    c. Recreation: Areas suited for water-oriented recreational activities, that cannot readily be
    provided on other lands, shall be protected for such uses unless such uses would interfere
    with an existing public trust use that has not or does not adversely affect the resource or
    result in negative impacts to public trust uses or values.
    The use of private lands, adjacent or integral to uses on public trust lands, suitable for
    recreational facilities designed to enhance public water-oriented recreation, shall have
    priority over private residential, general industrial or commercial development, but not over
    other appropriate public trust uses.
    d. Marinas and Recreational Boating: Allow new recreational, commercial and marina
    developments only to the extent that, based upon a carrying capacity study, no significant
    negative impacts to public trust values, human, ecological or water quality, will result.
    e. Public Access Provisions: Require public access to and along the shoreline in all new
    developments adjacent to such waterfronts consistent with statutory and constitutional
    requirements (Government Code Section 66478.1, et seq; Article X, Section 4 of the
    California Constitution; and Sections 6210.4 and 6210.5 of the Public Resources Code).
    Requirements for Public Access shall comply with Section 5.10 of the Zoning Ordinance.
31. Adopt a Zoning Ordinance measure that requires development proposals to be planned in a
manner to avoid removing trees, if feasible. At least two trees shall be planted for every one
removed to accommodate development facilitated by the General Plan. The planting of trees
shall be performed in a manner that protects public views to and along the ocean and scenic
coastal areas, consistent with the visual resources policies of the LCP. Visually attractive native
trees species, such as bishop pine and sargent cypress, shall be the preferred species used, as they
require less water, herbicides, pesticides, and are valuable wildlife resources.
32. In order to protect the natural setting of the hillsides that surround the city, the City shall
adopt a Zoning Ordinance measure that requires hillside or ridgeline development proposals to
be scrutinized with "view from the valley floor" considerations. Proposed development on the
crest of bluffs or canyons shall be specifically analyzed in relation to views from the low-lying
areas of the city, important view corridors, and scenic gateways. Development shall not
silhouette against the ridgeline without adequate visual buffers, and development on lower
slopes shall be visually screened by existing or landscaped vegetation to minimize visual impact.
 These measures may become review standards for the design review process.
                                          III. Land Use, Page 8
33. New development shall (a) be sited and designed to protect views to and along the ocean
and scenic coastal areas (b) minimize the alteration of natural land forms, and (c) be visually
compatible with the character of surrounding areas.
34. New construction shall provide water conservation measures, and water conservation shall
be encouraged for all new development. Water conservation measures shall include low flow
water faucets, showerheads, and toilets for all new construction.
35. New developments shall be encouraged to use native plant species that are more drought
resistant for landscaping. New commercial development shall be required to use native species
for all landscaping.
36. (a) The Opportunities and Constraints Map: Biological Resources and Trails depicting
    sensitive habitats of the General Plan area shall be updated to include all the riparian habitat
    in the area as well as associated north-facing slopes with coastal scrub vegetation. North
    facing slopes of the habitat of the Point Arena Mountain Beaver. Riparian habitat along the
    entire length of Point Arena Creek within the city boundary shall be designated on the
    updated map, as well as the north-facing slopes south of the creek in the southeastern portion
    of the annexation area. A buffer zone for the Point Arena mountain beaver shall be
    designated in coordination with CDFG and the USFWS. Other riparian zones not
    represented on existing maps include two tributaries of Hathaway Creek: one in the north-
    central portion of the city and one in the northeastern corner of the annexation area. Riparian
    vegetation also exists along ephemeral drainage in the city that drain north to south into Point
    Arena Creek and shall also be mapped.
    (b) All updates to this map or future maps shall be submitted to the California Coastal
    Commission for certification. All habitat maps shall include a note that states that “the maps
    may be updated as appropriate and may not include all areas that constitute ESHA.”
37. Suburban development on SR-1 lots proposed for the northeastern portion of the annexation
area shall be clustered in flatter, grassy areas or clustered in planned residential developments to
reduce grading and cutting on slopes. Consideration shall be given to allowing planned
development design based on the natural landform. The yield of the total land area would be one
unit to the acre but the forested steep slopes and the riparian canyon bottom would be maintained
in a natural state. In this fashion, the same number of residences could be built in the area while
avoiding impacts of vegetation removal, wildlife habitat reduction, and potential impacts to
sensitive species.
38. North-facing slopes south of Point Arena Creek in the annexation area is confirmed Point
Arena Mountain Beaver habitat that shall be set aside for protection of the small populations of
this sensitive species. Development proposed in this area, zoned for residential agriculture (two-
acre lots), shall be reviewed vigorously to ensure conformance with policies of the General Plan
and preservation of the populations of Point Arena mountain beaver that inhabit the area.
                                           III. Land Use, Page 9

39. Those portions of the annexation area in a natural, undisturbed state shall be subject to more
detailed biologic field studies prior to the approval of any development application.
40. The City of Point Arena shall avoid developing any road crossings of Arena Creek.
41. To mitigate exterior sound levels, due to transportation or other sources, for new residential
or other new projects, consideration shall be given to an increased setback distance; use of
property line, patio, and deck barriers; orientation of buildings to achieve a sound shielding
benefit at outdoor use areas.
42. To mitigate interior sound levels, due to transportation or other sources, for new residential
or other new projects, consideration shall be given to an increased setback distance and use of
barriers, insulation measures applied to the building skins, including appropriate designs for
windows, walls, doors, roof/ceiling assemblies, weather seals, and other components.
Vegetative barriers do not generally provide substantial reductions in noise levels.
43. The City will consider the following measures which can be used to mitigate the sound
impacts created at residential or other sensitive receptors as a result of equipment operations or
other activities at industrial and commercial facilities:
    a. Use buffer zones of open space or "intermediate" type uses. It is desirable, where
    feasible, to allow at least 200 feet between noisy industrial or commercial sites and
    residential or other sensitive land uses. Noisy buildings or other noisy facilities shall be well
    set back from the property line.
    b. The City shall require noise studies for potentially noisy facilities which are to be located
    near sensitive land uses. Industrial and commercial uses likely to create adverse noise
    impacts include fuel distribution centers served by rail or truck, truck terminals, new or
    expansion of gravel Batch plants and concrete manufacturing plants, construction activities if
    hammering is involved and is done outdoors, and animal kennels. Commercial facilities
    likely to create adverse noise impacts include automobile repair shops, body shops, and
    heavy equipment rental shops; car washes; drive-in restaurants; and supermarkets and other
    facilities with rooftop equipment and truck deliveries.
    c. The public shall be notified of the proposed placing of noisy industrial or commercial
    facilities in proximity to sensitive uses and vice versa.
    d. Noise studies shall be required for any new industrial use that will generate more than five
    truck trips per daytime hour, any heavy truck traffic during nighttime hours, or more than 25
    trucks in 24 hours. A Noise Ordinance including both quantitative limits and nuisance
    provisions shall be enacted.
    e. All truck loading bays shall be located such that they do not open to the direction where
    sensitive receptors are located.
                                          III. Land Use, Page 10

    interposed between residential and commercial uses and between residential and industrial
    uses, especially those that are likely to be noisy, as described above.
    h. Rooftop and other mechanical equipment shall be shielded, enclosed, silenced, or setback
    an appropriate distance from the property line. The shielding could be accomplished by
    either appropriate siting of buildings or appropriate fences or walls.
    i. Large exterior pipes or ducts in some cases may need to be shielded, enclosed, or lagged.
    j. In some cases, insulation measures may be needed for industrial buildings.
44. Proposals for uses associated with industrial and commercial development should include
appropriate designs for walls, roof/ ceilings, doors, windows, vent silencers, interior absorption,
and other components. Doors and windows shall be provided with effective weather seals.
    a. Trucks idling times shall be limited where feasible. Where personal radios are used, the
    volume shall be controlled as far as feasible.
    b. Where paging systems are required, they shall be designed to minimize "spillover" sound
    to sensitive receptor properties.
45. The City should require that all future development pay appropriate impact fees to finance
the installation of adequate storm drainage infrastructure.
46. The City shall work with local school district officials to determine future school facility
needs. Appropriate sites for new facilities shall be closely coordinated between city and school
district officials.
47. The City should encourage, where feasible and appropriate, the incorporation of school
impact fees as part of the development fee assessment.
48. The City shall encourage the direct negotiation between developers and school officials to
determine appropriate mitigation measures to offset the impacts of new development.
49. Stable boundaries shall be established separating urban and rural areas, including, where
necessary, clearly defined buffer areas utilized to minimize conflicts between agricultural and
urban land uses.

8.2. URBAN AREAS AND USES
The central portion of the city is appropriate for relatively dense urban uses. Included is the
Downtown area and the surrounding areas of limited multiple-family units and single-family
homes. While the single-family areas are largely built up there is a substantial area within the
annexed area east of Main Street which is designated for new dwelling units, and large areas of
land within and abutting Downtown that are suitable for multiple-family developments.
Point Arena's destiny is likely to include infilling that can take place on available parcels within
the Downtown and within the areas surrounding Downtown, areas that have not yet realized their
full potential. This 2001 General Plan provides for development opportunities that have not
existed heretofore. They consist of allowing and fostering mixed commercial and residential
uses, increasing the land area available for multiple-family housing, and opening up
opportunities for expanding retail and commercial service uses within the Downtown and along
Highway 1 at the north and south ends of the city.
Within areas designated commercial the predominant uses are to be retail commercial, personal
and professional service uses, and tourist-oriented activities. Also permitted are a mixing in with
commercial uses of live-work and studio spaces, limited residential units, and offices.
It is an objective of this plan that the Downtown area be served with one or more off-street
parking lots in order to meet current demand as well as future demand. New developments
within the (C) Core Commercial area shall be required to provide off- street parking, or to
contribute funds in lieu thereof, in order that the City may acquire and improve off-street parking
lots within and to serve the Downtown area. All required off-street parking in other zones shall
be provided on site.

8.4. SPECIAL AREAS
(A) Harbor Commercial--(HC)
This area comprises Arena Cove and is suitable and is to be reserved for commercial activities in
conjunction with commercial and recreational fishing and other coastal-dependent activities,
including visitor-serving uses. It is also an area of exceptional environmental and ecological
significance due to the joining of Arena Creek, the wetlands, the Ocean, the coastal bluffs, and
the beach. It is also an area of significant economic and fiscal benefit to the city, and of historical
and communitywide significance.
Coastal-dependent developments shall have priority over other developments on or near the
shoreline. Except as provided in the California Coastal Act, coastal developments shall not be
sited in the wetland areas of Arena Cove. Facilities serving the commercial fishing and
recreational boating industries shall be protected and, where feasible, upgraded. Existing
commercial fishing and recreational boating harbor space shall not be reduced and shall be
protected unless written findings are made that present and foreseeable future demand for the
facilities that could be accommodated on the property is already adequately provided for in the
area. Proposed recreational boating facilities shall, where feasible, be designed and located in
                                          III. Land Use, Page 20
such a fashion as not to interfere with the needs of the commercial fishing industry (Sec. 30234
California Coastal Act).
Permissible and Preferred Uses by right:
Boat launching and public facilities related to coastal dependent activities; boat building and
repair; retail sales or rentals of fishing supplies, scuba supplies and surf-related sports supplies;
purchasing, selling, and processing of fish and shellfish; coastal-dependent aquaculture facilities;
visitor-serving uses already at the cove (24-room inn with mgr's. residence; 10-room bed and
breakfast inn with mgr's. residence; two-story commercial building containing restaurants and
gift shops).
Uses Subject to Securing a Use Permit or Comprehensive Development Plan approval:
Other visitor-serving uses: bed and breakfast inns; restaurants; restaurants with bar; cafes; hotels,
motels and inns; campground; campground with short-term R/V use; short-term R/V park for
seasonal uses (not to exceed a total of 44 RV spaces overall), with R/V timeshares being
impermissible; housing units in each case for the owner or manager; art galleries;
non-coastal-dependent aquaculture activities; gift and antique shops; City-managed public
facilities; expansion of existing visitor-serving uses.
Land Use and Development Guidelines:
Uses are to be located and designed so as not to inhibit access to the ocean and riparian areas.
Uses may include roads, trails, parks, and parking facilities. A bike path shall be established on
Iversen and Port Road to ensure the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists, provided it is consistent
with the wetland and ESHA policies of the LCP and Section 30233 of the Coastal Act. A small
public park/picnic area near the creek, and a dedicated trail along the creek, shall be provided.
The safety of pedestrians and bicyclists is to be ensured.
Uses shall be sited to ensure that they neither interfere with existing coastal-dependent uses nor
preclude potential coastal-dependent uses in the Cove area. Generally, development in the flats
near Arena Cove shall not preclude coastal-dependent uses.
All federal, state and LCP regulations pertaining to wetlands and endangered species (if any)
shall be adhered to and permits gained prior to any earth moving or site preparation or
development.
Property owners and/or applicants shall prepare and the City shall review for consistency with
all applicable provisions of the LCP, and shall approve Comprehensive Development Plans for
each parcel or all parcels in one ownership, before a coastal development permit for any new
development is approved.
In the near future a Specific Plan shall be prepared by the City and shall serve as the City's
policy statement and basis for public programs and the review of private development plans.
The above guidelines shall be incorporated into the Specific Plan, and the Plan, upon adoption,
shall govern all private and public actions within the HC area. The Specific Plan shall be
submitted to the Coastal Commission for certification as an amendment to the LCP.
                                            III. Land Use, Page 21
Connection to municipal water and sewer systems shall be required and the availability of
adequate municipal water and sewer systems as well as adequate roadway capacity shall be
demonstrated prior to approval of the permit.
(B) Industrial--(I)
This land use exists in order to accommodate non-nuisance industrial activities that are not
suitable by virtue of their performance for location in commercial districts or proximate to living
and tourist areas, and can be expected to contribute to Point Arena's economic development and
tax revenues. All uses shall be by conditional use permit.
By use permit:
Because environmental quality concerns must be accommodated this plan provides that all uses
are subject to obtaining a Conditional Use Permit, and that findings shall be required in each
instance, in addition to the other required findings in Section 6.08 of the Zoning Ordinance, that
the proposed development will not create any significant negative environmental impacts which
can not be mitigated within the industrial area and upon surrounding areas, such as noxious or
offensive emissions including noise, glare, dust, dirt, chemical pollutants; and that all
manufacturing, repairing, and fabricating shall be enclosed in buildings; and that all equipment
and materials storage areas shall be screened, except from other industrial use areas, by
sight-obscuring fences, berms, or plant materials to a height of not less than six (6) feet.
Retail, professional service, and office uses should be excluded unless directly associated with
an industrial activity.
Septic system and/or wells may be acceptable in lieu of connection to the city sewer system and
to the water system only if in compliance with City ordinance(s) and Mendocino County
Environmental Health regulations in effect at time of permit application, and the adequacy and
availability of water supply and sewage disposal to serve the proposed use shall be substantiated
prior to approval of the permit.
(C) Public Facility--(PF)
This designation accommodates such uses as schools, public utilities, public facilities,
publicly-owned libraries and publicly-owned parking lots and facilities, public utility service and
storage yards, sewer facilities, community centers, and similar uses. All proposed uses and
developments shall be subject to securing a use permit.
(D) Park--(P)
All publicly-owned parks, recreation areas, and trails, except tot lots.
(E) Open Space--(OS)
                                         III. Land Use, Page 22
Lands owned by and dedicated to a public agency, quasi-public agency, or by deed and in
perpetuity to a home owners' association or equivalent, or otherwise permanently set aside by an
owner and his/her assigns for open space, may be designated OS, in which case usage may be
strictly limited. (Dedications or other guarantees may be the subject of Development
Agreements and may not necessarily be depicted on the city's Zoning Map.)
8.5. SPECIAL NOTE
Assessor's parcels # 027-081-18 and # 027-101-23 total approximately 16.30 acres. A maximum
total of three (3) dwelling units may be permitted within this total acreage, subject to the
execution of a mutually-binding Development Agreement (as defined in this General Plan and in
California Planning Law) by the City and the property owner, and subject to the provisions of
the Planned Residential Development Procedure and to the fifty percent open space requirement
and shall require the execution and recording of the Development Agreement. The development
of residential units and other developments shall require a coastal development permit and only
development consistent with the Certified LCP may be approved.

Limited dwelling units may be permitted by Use Permit in the
(C) Core Commercial District, not to exceed the allowable residential density for the relevant
commercial district; and in the HWC Highway Commercial District, not to exceed the allowable
residential density for that zoning district.
9. PROJECT REVIEW PROCEDURES
Land uses are either permitted by right or conditionally permitted. In the latter case the property
owner does not hold a right to a proposed use or development, and the city has the sole
discretion about permitting a use or not; a Conditional Use Permit, or in lieu thereof an approved
Comprehensive Development Plan, will be required, according to the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance.
In both cases land use and development plans are also subject to coastal development permit
requirements, environmental review determinations according to the provisions of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); design review by the City's Design Assistance Committee,
according to Section 5.15 of the Zoning Ordinance; and geologic studies as specified in the
Safety Element of this plan and in the Zoning Ordinance, and to site and development standards
set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance, other applicable city ordinances, and
all other applicable provisions of the LCP.
10. PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS (PRD)
This procedure shall be applied to any proposed development, including land divisions, on
residential parcel of ten (10) acres or more, or where any two or more abutting parcels of less
than ten acres are each in the same ownership or under the same control and total ten acres or
more. Owners of parcels less than ten acres may also apply for PRD approval.
PRD is an "overlay" land-use and zoning technique. It sets forth opportunities for the flexible
application of development standards associated with zoning districts, and is a procedure for
arriving at development permits for large project areas. It is to be complied with in connection
with the underlying residential zones (SR, UR and MR) except that the Planning Commission
may not require strict adherence to the zone's yard, set-back and building height limit and
minimum lot size requirements of the zone and is hereby authorized to encourage innovative
mixtures of permissible land uses, building types, and site layouts.
The residential density limits established for the underlying zone shall remain in effect and may
not be exceeded, although density bonuses for providing very-low, low- and moderate-income,
and senior, housing units may be approved in accordance with provisions of California's codes
governing density bonuses (Sections 65915 - 65918 of the Government Code) and
Implementation Action No. 6 of Section 2 of Chapter 11 of the LUP.
The principal objectives of the PRD are (1) to encourage and allow flexibility in site design
(planned departures from conventional and strict site standards that do not easily accommodate
                                          III. Land Use, Page 27
innovation, special conditions in the housing economy and market, and do not allow for unique
physical constrains and opportunities of hillside sites), (2) to ensure that open spaces are
preserved and provided for as part of the development process, and (3) to allow careful and
comprehensive public review of proposed larger projects that may have unusual or substantial
community impacts.
Unimproved properties which are zoned SR, UR or MR and are ten acres or more in size or
where any two or more abutting parcels of less than ten acres are each in the same ownership or
under the same control and total ten acres or more shall be treated as Planned Residential
Developments (PRD), in which case a Comprehensive Development Plan shall be prepared and
approved as a prerequisite for filing a proposed Parcel Map, Tentative Subdivision Map, or
Coastal Development Permit. A PRD designation "overlays" the underlying residential zone and
signals that the following shall apply:
1. Residential densities (number of dwelling units per acre of land) shall be the same as in effect
for the underlying zone, although lot sizes may vary
2. Common Open Space shall make up fifty (50) percent of the subdivision or development
3. Approved Comprehensive Development Plans may suffice in lieu of required use permits.
11. COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN
These are privately-initiated land-use/development proposals which consist of one or more maps
and a text describing in detail all features of a new development or uses on a lot or on an
assemblage of commonly-held contiguous lots. It must be prepared and approved in any
circumstance where called for in the regulations pertaining to a land-use category or zone.
Comprehensive Development Plans may also be prepared at the discretion of a property owner
when appropriate.
The purpose of the Plan is to supply all of the relevant information about the property and the
proposed uses and development as may be necessary for the public and the Planning
Commission to evaluate the merits and consequences of the proposal. It is also intended to
facilitate creative and flexible modifications of the adopted standards associated with the base
zone of the Zoning Ordinance, provided that greater public benefits will be achieved by such
modifications. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, improved and innovative site
and building designs, provisions for housing to meet special needs, provision of special
amenities, and provisions for protecting valuable natural and coastal resources.
Comprehensive Development Plans are part of the coastal development permit application, and
may be approved only if found to be consistent with all policies and provisions of the General
Plan and the Local Coastal Program. The Planning Commission may require that (1) both
conceptual (generalized) plans and precise plans be submitted and approved; (2) development
proceed in phases; (3) plan approval lapse within a reasonable period of time if the approved
                                          III. Land Use, Page 28
project is not initiated; (4) Development Agreements between the City and the property owner
are signed and recorded.
The precise requirements for Comprehensive Development Plan submission, review, public
hearings, and adoption shall be set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.
12. MEMO OF UNDERSTANDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE HAY ANNEXATION
On April 13, 1990, the California Coastal Commission certified the successful completion of the
City's Local Coastal Plan Amendment No. 1-89. This amendment, known as the "Hay
Annexation", rezoned 20 acres located within the eastern-most boundary of the City limits and
then annexed an additional 156 acres to it. In order to finalize the annexation/amendment, a
Memo of Understanding (dated 11/14/89 with an amendment dated 2/27/90) was executed
between the developer and the City which sets forth certain conditions necessary to ensure an
orderly progression for development and infrastructure. The City hereby reaffirms its intent to
uphold the terms of this Memo of Understanding.
The following policies shall apply to proposed development in the Hay annexation area: 12.1
Where required, the necessary extension of road, water, and sewer services within the Mill
Street/Hay Annexation area shall be in two phases, as shown on Exhibit B of the Memo of
Understanding City of Point Arena/Hay Annexation as amended dated January 10, 1990. Phase I
includes: 13 acres of Urban Residential, 3 acres of Multifamily, and 20 acres of Suburban
Residential Zoned lands. Phase II includes: 10 acres of Suburban Residential (1/2 acre
minimum), 32.6 acres of Suburban Residential (1-acre minimum) and 62 acres of Residential
Agriculture zoned lands. Phase 1 would commence upon approval by the City Council of
necessary permits needed for construction of road and utility installations. Subdivision plans
would be processed. Phase II can commence no earlier than 2 years from the commencement of
Phase I and when the developer can provide verification that 50% of the Phase I site have been
sold.
12.2 All lands and acreages described in the MOU and policy 12.1 above represent the maximum
potentially allowable development, and neither the MOU nor Policy 12.1 represents an
entitlement to develop. Any and all proposed development or development agreements in the
Hay annexation area shall conform to all applicable provisions of the certified LCP. 12.3 All
proposed developments in the Hay annexation area, including subdivisions, shall be processed
according to the Planned Residential Development Process. While construction may proceed in
phases as required by policy no. 12.1, approval of any development proposals and
comprehensive development plans related to the Hay annexation area shall include plans for all
lands in common contiguous ownership, and shall be processed at one time. A coastal
development permit shall not be approved unless all residential lands in the Hay annexation area
are included in a single proposed development, and unless the proposal conforms with all
applicable provisions of the LCP.
                                        III. Land Use, Page 29
13. ANNEXATION OF THE COVE
To better serve the public interest the City shall research the possibility of annexing submerged
lands totaling all water area within sight of the Pier running from the south point to the farthest
north point in Arena Cove. The annexation will connect existing City boundaries from south to
north on the City's western boundary. The City finds that annexation of this territory will
improve protection of this natural resource, improve management of the harbor facilities and
activities, and foster enforcement through City ordinances and by City personnel of boating and
other activities within the cove. This annexation is recommended by the State Lands
Commission, which agency's approval is required prior to annexation taking effect. All
proposed development on any submerged lands, tidelands, or on public trust lands in the Cove,
whether filled or unfilled, shall obtain a coastal development permit from the Coastal
Commission

                         IV. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
1. FINDINGS
For decades, Point Arena has experienced little growth in population and employment. The city
lies outside the mainstream of small town development in Northern California, and it is too
distant from major population centers to have benefited from the exodus of those fleeing
congested cities.
Nevertheless, the growth of nearby settlements--Gualala to the south and Mendocino to the
north--may indicate that Point Arena has prospects for more growth in the future.
Point Arena has maintained its population at about 400. Residents earn their incomes from both
white-collar and blue-collar jobs, in consumer and tourist-serving jobs, in government
employment, in retail sales and personal services, and in various small businesses. These are
classified in the following table. Point Arena's businesses and jobs are divisible into several
types: consumer-based retail and personal services for the resident population; tourist oriented;
and small businesses serving out-of-area markets and customers.
Meanwhile, fishing, logging and lumbering, and military services (a Coast Guard station and an
Air Force station) that were major income and employment sources in Point Arena's immediate
hinterland have declined or disappeared entirely. To have more or less retained its population is,
in this context, a notable achievement for the city, reflecting its strength and resilience.
Agriculture continues as a strong economic activity in the area.
From the viewpoint of some of Point Arena's residents, however, the lack of job growth has
meant a limited potential for local employment in the industrial, construction and resource
sectors, and in high-tech enterprises; the job scarcity has translated into the emigration of many
young job seekers.
The lack of growth also means a very limited revenue base for city operations and services, and
for needed capital improvements. City resources are scarcely sufficient to maintain minimum
services and facilities.

The reasons for improving the economic climate in Point Arena are the classic ones: providing
livelihoods and jobs for the existing and emerging resident population of all ages; and providing
investment and small business opportunities. Equally important is the modern-day reality of
municipal finance, which requires that properties and businesses produce tax revenues to pay for
city services, public facilities, and basic infrastructure.
The City's principal sources of revenue are shown in the following table. Each of these are
subject to increases or decreases depending upon both local and statewide economic conditions,
the level of the tourist trade, and population growth or decline. The city's fiscal health depends
upon increases in all of the categories listed.

2. SHORT TERM POTENTIALS
In spite of findings that there is likely to be no dramatic improvement in the local economic and
job creation picture, the local business climate nevertheless has recently improved, and new
investments have produced increases in employment of about 30 jobs, and an increase in sales
tax and bed tax revenues--relatively healthy percentage increases in one year in both cases.
Sources of new jobs in recent years, which are also sources of sales tax revenues, were a
magazine publisher, a book publisher, three new retail establishments at the Cove, a
Laundromat, a manufacturer's representative (mail-order retail sales), a sizeable bed and
breakfast inn at the Cove, and a pharmacy (which replaces a food store). One employer (8 jobs)
discontinued operations during the same period of time, but the net gain in jobs and tax revenues
is notable and good news for Point Arena.
                                           IV. Economic, Page 3
There have also been significant investments, resulting in job expansion, by existing businesses
during the past year. In addition to employment growth these economic activities also contribute
to the local municipal revenue base.
There is no foolproof basis for projecting Point Arena's economic growth into the future, but it is
worth noting that the city has substantial short-run potential. Considerable growth could occur
with minimal public expenditures based on the physical and economic infrastructure already in
place, especially in and adjoining the core area.
There are also abundant developable and redevelopable residential, commercial and industrial
parcels in the city, which means that there is no scarcity of land should property owners and
developers wish to proceed with new developments.
Moreover, an often-unrecognized potential for Point Arena is that it is a desirable location for
entrepreneurs who could locate in any area with good communication and yet they have chosen,
or will choose, to locate in Point Arena. This is demonstrated by the fact that the city has
recently attracted several small businesses owned by one individual or a family doing business
with suppliers and customers located outside the area. Customers and Point Arena businesses of
this type are connected by telephone, FAX machines, computer communications, the postal
service, and commercial delivery systems. These developments may also indicate an ability to
attract "footloose" industries (small businesses not dependent upon any natural resource base or
local market and therefore able to locate anywhere that the owner wants to live).
By California standards Point Arena still has comparatively cheap land. It is also blessed with
the availability of urban services in place and capable of handling an influx of new customers, a
low local tax burden, and a very modest business license fee. All classes of land are available
and designated for a wide variety of business development purposes.
This General Plan not only encourages and allows small-business developments, it also permits
and encourages mixed land uses if there are no negative environmental impacts, and permits
businesses to operate out of homes in many cases (as a home occupation or by use permit). Point
Arena also includes a municipally-owned and managed commercial and recreational pier, and a
partially-developed cove, giving access to substantial seasonal employment (for example, about
80 urchin fishermen, in season). At the Cove there is also additional potential for tourist,
recreation and other coastal dependent activities.
To summarize, Point Arena provides a unique physical, comparatively inexpensive, and
developable context for investments in housing, tourist facilities, retail establishments, and small
businesses. Whether the city's assets and opportunities in fact will lead to substantial economic
development and job formations can only be guessed. As other potential North Coast locations
run into development limits, however, Point Arena can expect to receive serious attention from
home builders and investors. And, as individuals and small business owners discover the merits
of locating in Point Arena it can be expected that they will invest in and locate their businesses
in the city rather than somewhere else.
                                          IV. Economic, Page 4
The following sections set out the goals, policies and programs that are intended to guide Point
Arena in taking advantage of its setting, amenities, and locational advantages. Perhaps one of
the first steps in the process of realizing the city's potential is for the citizens to raise their sights
as to what is possible and what is desirable, because the North Coast in general and Point Arena
in particular are on the verge of moving away from no-growth local economies based largely
upon fishing, logging and lumbering and towards local economies that are based on growth
industries such as tourism and small business development, with the latter dependent upon
regional and statewide markets and upon modern communication methods and equipment, and
not on local markets.
3. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOALS
To provide job opportunities for the local population, and new tax revenues for the City, by
making it possible for the city's economic base Downtown, along Highway 1, at the Cove, and in
the city's industrial area, to expand and grow.
To provide a high-quality and attractive habitat for the area's residents and business owners, and
for those who are evaluating Point Arena as a place in which to live, invest and start (or transfer)
a business. This implies that protection of the physical environment and enhancement of the
beauty of the built environment in the city and its surroundings must be a top municipal
objective for two reasons: a high-quality environment contributes to everyone's well being and
health; and, a high-quality environment begets an interest in Point Arena by those whose
investments are essential to help pay for environmental protection as well as public infrastructure
improvements and municipal services.
4. POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
1. Encourage Retailing. Approve all reasonable retail use proposals for development and
redevelopment Downtown, including mixed commercial and residential uses, as well as at the
Cove, and along Highway 1, all according to the regulations set forth in the Land-Use Element
and subject to design review and applicable citywide zoning requirements governing off-street
parking, etc.
2. Promote Housing. Allow for additional areas to be zoned higher-density housing within and
adjoining Downtown, and allow such housing to be combined with commercial activities, or to
be developed as live-work spaces and studios, provided residential neighborhoods are not
negatively impacted, and adequate off-street parking for all uses is provided.
3. Develop the Cove to Its Full Potential. With due care not to destroy the beauty and natural
integrity of the beach, shoreline, cove and wetlands, promote business development while also
maximizing retention of the slopes and open spaces of the area. Discourage or prohibit activities
or uses that can be readily accommodated in less scenic and fragile areas of the city. Support
                                           IV. Economic, Page 5
and enhance opportunities for commercial and recreational fishing; recreational boating,
including boat mooring and launching; fish cleaning and processing; fish equipment sales; and
other coastal- and marine-dependent activities as well as urchin harvesting and processing.
4. Develop Tourist Facilities. Encourage development and expansion or upgrading of tourist
facilities and opportunities, and prioritize lower cost visitor and recreational facilities, in the core
area, along Highway 1 and at the Cove, including bed and breakfast inns in residential areas by
use permit.
5. Promote Small Business Development. Point Arena's setting and potential for small business
development (non industrial) suggests that through zoning it is possible to accommodate modern
small business and office uses within commercial areas or within multi-family areas. Very small
businesses may be accommodated in homes as home occupations, in live-work spaces, in
studios, and as commercial enterprises within commercial districts. In addition to
accommodating such activities and uses, the City should positively promote the creation of such
small businesses and the opportunities they present for job creation and increased municipal
revenues.
6. Attract Industry. Through the development of promotional literature industry can be
positively attracted to locate in the city's designated industrial area. Design and publicize an
illustrative package of development opportunities, including an illustrative list of desired
industries, the availability of urban services, and components of the approval process.
7. Obtain Funds for Infrastructure Expansion. Levy fair and equitable development fees for
needed infrastructure in connection with new development; consider including a charge for
maintaining existing infrastructure along with the ordinary monthly service charges; evaluate the
need for and the City's ability to pay for capital improvements; and research the availability of
state and federal funding sources, including Community Development Block Grants (CDBG).
8. Beautify and Protect the Environment. Through the Design Assistance Committee encourage
private improvements, perhaps as a unified effort for particular parts of town, and enforce the
spirit and letter of the laws pertaining to screening, signing, landscaping, and site and building
designs. Develop the city park as a pleasant place to congregate and as a play/recreation area for
children, teens, and adults. Encourage private (perhaps joint) efforts at sidewalk and street
cleaning, as well as public-private Downtown tree planting and maintenance, and development
of lanes and walkways.
9. Promote Point Arena. There is a general perception that North Coast local governments and
communities are anti growth and anti development. It is time to communicate a message closer
to reality about Point Arena's goals. In connection with the publication of this General Plan the
City should prepare an abstract of its main business-encouraging and growth-and- development
objectives and should advertise these through various channels. For example, include such
information in Chamber of Commerce information bulletins; and circulate simple handouts
throughout the county. Include factual information, lists and descriptions of recent
developments, some facts about the local employment base, and about factors that distinguish
                                           IV. Economic, Page 6
and define Point Arena, especially in terms that will interest investors. Try for a modest
bandwagon effect. Designate a promoter as an informed and sympathetic contact person to
provide information to any potential investor.
5. PROVISIONS OF THE GENERAL PLAN PERTAINING TO ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT
1. The Downtown Core is defined as the Core Commercial (C) zoning district in the Land-Use
Element and on the General Plan Land-Use and Development map, and on the Zoning Map.
Permitted uses include a full array of retail sales, personal services, limited housing mixed with
offices and commercial activities, overnight lodging, commercial recreation, public facilities and
services, and live-work accommodations. The total area so designated is 12.31 acres.
Within this area is a substantial amount of land for new developments and for expansion of
existing businesses and facilities.
Among the essential priority programs for improving Downtown are creation of off-street
parking as part of the development process; creation of a publicly accessible off-street parking
lot; preparation of a street-tree and general physical improvement program; and sidewalk/curb
improvements.
In order to foster refurbishing of some existing properties and development of attractive new
ones, there is a dual role for the Design Assistance Committee. One is to encourage private
improvements, perhaps as a unified effort of Downtown merchants and property owners. The
other is to carry out the spirit and letter of the Zoning Ordinance which gives the committee
specific powers to review and comment on site and building designs brought before it as part of
the permit-granting processes of the City.
2. Directly related to the first policy/program is the "upzoning" of properties adjoining the
Downtown core in order to establish a total of 20.86 acres of land for multi-family uses. Within
this zone (MR) it would be possible to create multi-family structures at residential densities of
7.51 units per acre, as well as combined residential and office projects. The purposes are to
"redevelop" now undeveloped parcels or parcels currently developed at less than their full
potential by increasing the economic incentive to do so, and to establish over time a residential
and working population within walking distance of Downtown, which population will enliven
the core with new activity, increase local in-town buying power and property values, and
minimize the home-to-work commute.
3. At both ends of town along Highway 1 are a combined 23.84 acres of land designated for
highway commercial. Unlike in the Downtown core, where lots are small and building intensity
is expected to be relatively high in comparison, and where parking cannot in all instances be
provided on site, the highway commercial areas, for the most part, include large parcels that will
and must accommodate off-street parking, where creative site layouts are possible, where
commercial uses that cannot be accommodated Downtown may be situated, and where visibility
                                            IV. Economic, Page 7
along the highway may be essential for economic success. Light electrical/electronic or parts
assembly facilities and other very light industrial activities are desirable uses, as may be "heavy"
retail sales and services, tourist- accommodating businesses, and limited housing at the rear of
parcels.
4. Home occupations, often essential for some people's livelihood, will continue to be permitted
in residential districts provided no negative environmental or coastal resource impact or parking
problems will result, and provided the home occupation in no way changes the predominantly
residential character, appearance, peace, quiet or tranquility of the residential neighborhood.
5. Industrial activities that are environmentally compatible with the environmental goals and
policies of the General Plan are provided for through the designation along Eureka Hill Road of
27.8 acres of Industrial (I) zoned land. Proposed uses are subject to the securing of a use permit
in accordance with Section 4.10 of the Zoning Ordinance, provided they are also in conformity
with all elements of the General Plan.
6. Coastal-dependent activities with an emphasis on fishing and the harvesting and processing of
ocean products, coastal- dependent commercial and public recreation, and related activities,
including lower cost overnight accommodations, are encouraged and permitted within the
Harbor Commercial (HC) zone at the Cove. Further changes in land forms, Arena Creek, and
the wetlands shall be subject to City policies and regulations, and may be subject to federal and
state wetlands and endangered species acts.
7. While the local pride that goes along with being a good looking and environmentally healthy
city is very important, how the city looks, and what motorists and potential investors see, and
what impressions are gained driving into or through town, are equally important and can make a
difference economically. Indifference on the part of Point Arena can make a big difference if the
result is to repel rather than to attract. Accordingly, this plan focuses special attention on public
appearance policies and programs, and provides for implementation of various sections of the
Zoning Ordinance that deal with landscaping and screening, the design of signs, and the design
of sites and buildings.
A secondary objective of these provisions is to make the city attractive to the tourist and to those
who are comparing Point Arena with other locales in their search for business sites and homes.
Important considerations in the search for civic improvement are clean streets and sidewalks;
attractively- designed buildings; the presence of well-maintained historic buildings of merit;
sitting and play areas within parks or park-like settings; sidewalks and trails for strolling in
comfort and safety; interesting and appealing shops offering locally-produced arts, crafts and
goods; appealing delis, coffee shops and cafes; and that special small-town character that is so
appealing to so many, and so rare in California. Reference is made to Sections 5.15 and 5.16 of
the Zoning Ordinance which delineates the design standards to be met and the specific role of the
Design Assistance Committee in encouraging that these standards are achieved.
8. Use of the U.S. Airforce facility and of any other state and federal properties that may be
vacated should be considered for other public uses or for private economic development.
                                           IV. Economic, Page 8
                        V. TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION ELEMENT
1. BACKGROUND
This element deals with topics associated with traffic, transportation and Point Arena's street and
pedestrian systems. Included are issues of:
Traffic safety. Much of the Point Arena street system was constructed prior to development of
modern standards. Conditions such as narrow streets, steep (for Point Arena) grades, an
incomplete street network, and poor sight distances at some intersections are inherent in the
system. These conditions may contribute to traffic safety hazards unless mitigated by street
improvements, traffic engineering activities, and traffic law enforcement.
Parking. An inadequate supply of parking Downtown on and near Main Street may be hindering
business activity now and surely will do so in the future unless improvements are implemented
and contribute to congestion, safety problems, and frustration.
Street Capacity and Service. As the city grows, increased traffic on the street system will follow.
There is a need to balance growth and accommodate additional traffic with the goal of
maintaining the rural character of the community and the safety of the public. The level of
service (LOS) and the volume- to-capacity (V/C) ratio need improvement now and will require
additional attention as soon as the city grows.
Street Network Completion. State Route 1 provides the only opportunity for through north-south
traffic. There is a need to provide new streets to meet local north-south circulation needs. As
the city grows there also will be an increased need for improved east-west circulation. Both are
long-range needs.
Non-motorized Transportation. The city needs to provide a safe transportation system for
pedestrians and bicyclists, which system shall include the upgrading of existing curbs and
sidewalks.
Public Transportation. Two forms of public transportation provide service for Point Area: the
MTA service and the South Coast Senior's Service. Both should be increased as growth occurs
and demand increases.
Aesthetics. Increased attention needs to be given to how Point Arena looks from its roadways,
and to designing streets and pedestrian ways having in mind the quality and visual appearance of
streetscapes.
                                         V. Circulation, Page 1
2. GOALS
1. Improve safety on all streets.
2. Preserve peace and quiet in residential areas.
3. Improve parking downtown.
4. Provide pleasant and safe systems for pedestrians and bicyclists.
5. Create an efficient system of streets for the movement of vehicles through town and for the
circulation of vehicles within the city.
3. POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The following policies and programs with respect to various aspects of traffic and circulation
shall apply:
3.1. Traffic Safety Policies and Programs
1. New streets to be considered for acceptance into the Point Arena street system shall conform
to design standards appropriate to their functional classification.
2. The segment of Port Road between Main Street and Iversen Avenue shall continue to be
de-emphasized as an access to Arena Cove. Adequate curbs, gutters, and sidewalks shall be
completed along the north side of Port Road between Main Street and the intersection with
Iverson Avenue to allow safe pedestrian passage during rainy weather.
3. The city shall resolve traffic and safety impacts of development at Arena Cove, and along
Iversen/Port roads. Of immediate concern is the junction of Iversen at Main Street. Safety and
operational characteristics of this intersection shall be identified and problems mitigated prior to
approval of new developments.
4. The city shall investigate methods of improving sight distances at intersections. Possible
solutions may include: trimming or removing weeds, shrubbery, or limbs; relocating signs or
other obstructions; removing on-street parking near intersections; prohibiting large-vehicle
parking near intersections; and adjusting traffic control devices to provide better views.
5. Curbs and gutters should be installed on existing streets, which are built on steep topography
where traffic safety would be improved by doing so. (The availability of curbs would permit
drivers to curb their wheels when parked to prevent runaway vehicles).
6. Through traffic should be diverted from local streets insofar as possible.
7. New development in areas that create parcels of one-half acre and smaller shall be required to
provide adequate curbs, gutters and sidewalks.
                                          V. Circulation, Page 2
3.2. Parking Policies and Programs
1. The city shall ensure adequacy of off-street parking and compliance with city requirements
and accepted standards prior to approval of new developments. Where off-street parking can not
be provided in accordance with Section 5.28 of the Zoning Ordinance, the city shall continue to
apply its "fees in-lieu" requirements.
2. The city shall encourage joint use of parking facilities where it can be shown that such uses
do not conflict in time of use, are functionally and conveniently located, provide for safe use,
and provide sufficient parking for all uses.
3. The city should pursue acquisition and development of off- street parking lots and facilities.
The feasibility of a parking district Downtown should be investigated, and if feasible
implemented as a high priority.
4. Alleys should be developed east (Center Street) and west of Main Street to permit service
access to Main Street businesses by trucks. Availability of service alleys would eliminate some
of the need for double parking on Main Street.
5. The city shall not install parking meters.
6. The City shall designate a two-hour parking limit Monday- Friday, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m., in the
Downtown area along Main Street, from the area of the Post Office to the Shell Station on the
west side of the street, and from Riverside Drive to Mill Street on the east side.
7. New developments in the cove area shall be required to provide off-street parking to serve the
approved use in order to minimize impacts to public parking available for coastal access and
recreation and in order to distribute parking throughout the area.
3.3. Street Capacity Policies and Programs
1. Level of Service (LOS) B, as defined in the Glossary, is the desired standard for the Point
Arena Street system, and all new Local and Collector streets shall be designed to operate at that
level.
2. City streets shall be classified according to function, as follows:
Local Streets shall be low-speed, low-volume facilities which are used primarily to
access property. Lake Street, Scott Place, Mill Street, Starboard Way, Center Street, Port
Street (east of Iversen), and Gillmore Alley, serve these local functions.
Collector Streets shall be moderate-speed, low-to medium-volume facilities which serve
to collect traffic from local streets and distribute to the arterial system. Collector streets
also provide for direct property access, but their role of serving traffic is equally
                                          V. Circulation, Page 3
important. Riverside Drive, Windy Hollow Drive, Iversen Avenue, and Port Road west
of Iversen are streets, which serve as collectors.
Arterial Streets are designed to move traffic efficiently. Property access is de-
emphasized, whereas traffic movement is emphasized. In larger communities a complete
system of arterials would link a collector system to local streets. In Point Arena only
State Route 1 functions as an arterial. Downtown, Highway 1 functions equally as a
collector as it assumes the role of Main Street.
3. Existing collector streets or intersections, which operate below Level of Service (LOS) B may
continue to operate at the lower level. New development shall not cause collector streets to
degrade to a lower level of service.
4. The City shall have the right to review and approve internal circulation plans for all new
developments.
5. All new private streets shall meet minimum city standards.
6. Traffic studies shall be required for all major development proposals and may be required at
the discretion of the city under other circumstances where there may be significant effects on the
street system overall, and including but not limited to whenever the City processes Planned
Residential Development (PRD) or commercial development proposals or tentative subdivision
maps or when any proposal would potentially increase a Level of Service. Traffic studies shall
identify, as a minimum:
    (a) the amount of traffic to be added to the system by the proposed development
    (b) other known planned projects and their effects on the street system
    (c) the direct, indirect and cumulative adverse impacts of project traffic on street
    system operations, safety, and public access to the coast.
    (d) mitigation measures necessary to provide for project traffic while maintaining city
    level-of-service standards
    (e) the responsibility of the developer to provide improvements
    (f) the timing of all improvements.
7. Direct, indirect, and cumulative adverse impacts to Highway 1 capacity in the rural areas
surrounding Point Arena shall be considered during the review of proposed LCP amendments
that would increase density or change land use classifications to ensure that Highway 1 in rural
areas remains a scenic two-lane road.
                                          V. Circulation, Page 4
3.4. Street Network Completion Policies and Programs
1. Development of a north-south collector street between Port Road and State Route 1, and
development of an alternative access road to Arena Cove from Highway 1 north should be
pursued if technically and financially feasible, and if consistent with the policies of the certified
LCP, including but not limited to the wetland and ESHA policies.
2. The city should pursue abandonment of Gillmore Alley and develop a new street between
Iversen Avenue and Port Road. The preferred alignment would improve internal circulation in
this area of town, provide a direct access to high-density units on Port Street, eliminate the
poorly-located Iversen/Gillmore Alley intersection, and maintain the residential character of the
neighborhood.
3. Port Road is very narrow and should be widened from the intersection of Port Road and
Iversen westward, and the junction at State Route 1 should be improved immediately. Any and
all improvements to Port Road shall be consistent with the policies of the LCP, including, but not
limited to the ESHA and wetland fill policies.
4. "Devil's Cutoff" and/or "Harper Easement" should be improved sufficiently to allow
emergency access to and from Arena Cove in a manner consistent with the policies of the
certified LCP, including, but not limited to, the wetland and ESHA policies.
5. New street networks shall avoid grid patterns. Optimum use of Tee intersections shall be
employed in the design of local streets to discourage through traffic, control speeds, and
minimize the need for traffic control devices.
6. Collector streets in new subdivisions shall be designed to limit tangent (straight) sections to
one-eighth mile unless longer tangents are needed to integrate the collector into the city street
system.
7. Through traffic should be diverted to collectors off of residential streets.
8. Standards for street rights-of-way, paved widths, and improvements in new subdivisions
should be consistent with the goal of maintaining the city's small-town rural character and should
result in minimum grading of existing land forms where feasible. (Also see # 7 under "Traffic
Safety Policies and Programs" above).
9. Highway 1 leading north and south out of Point Arena, Riverside Drive and Windy Hollow
Road should be designated as the only available evacuation routes in case of an emergency.
10. The City recognizes the eventual need for a Highway 1 bypass route to replace the present
in-town state route location.
                                         V. Circulation, Page 5
3.5. Non-Motorized Transportation Policies and Programs
1. The City shall as a condition of land subdivisions and development require the dedication of
land for the development of public pathways and trails where appropriate.
2. Accommodations for bikeways shall be considered in all new developments and on all new
collector and arterial streets unless right-of-way or physical constraints preclude their inclusion.
3. The city shall pursue Transportation Development Act funds, Proposition 116 funds, and
other sources of funding which may be available to implement the city's bikeway, trail and
pathway system.
4. Improvement of a pedestrian walkway within the right-of-way along Port Road/Iversen
Avenue to and from the Cove should receive initial priority attention. Any and all improvements
to the pedestrian walkway within the right-of-way along Port Road shall be consistent with LCP
ESHA policies, including, but not limited to, those policies governing wetland fill.
5. The City shall develop all existing city trail/pedestrian easements as permanent and safe trails
or pathways and shall develop all existing, undeveloped city road easements, initially, as safe
trails or pathways.
6. The City shall require an offer to dedicate a twenty-five (25) foot wide easement along all
trails designated for access to the shoreline and to trails along the bluff top to provide lateral
access as a condition of approval for any development that will require a Coastal Development
Permit. These easements shall take effect when a public or private party accepts the
responsibility for improvement and maintenance of the access easement. (See Zoning Ordinance
for authority and specific requirements).
7. Trails and trail easements shall include but not be limited to those depicted on the
"Opportunities and Constraints Map."
3.6. Public Transportation Policies and Programs
1. Bus service should continue to be provided to and from Point Arena for all those dependent
upon public transportation.
2. The South Coast Senior's Van Service should continue to be supported.
3. The City should support and seek assistance from county, state and federal agencies in order
to preserve and enhance public transit for use by area citizens.
3.7. Policies and Programs for Circulation System Aesthetics
1. The City shall ensure that design standards for roadways, pathways and trails also emphasize
and include (a) landscaping and screening; (b) street tree planting; and (c) continuing
                                          V. Circulation, Page 6
maintenance. Where trees must be removed to accommodate essential improvements they
should be replaced and earthmoving operations and road cuts should be followed with reseeding
and re-vegetation programs.
2. The City will establish an underground committee with representation from the City Council,
the utilities and the community. This committee will develop a prioritized list of underground
districts to be established by the City. Rule 20 funds will be used to underground the existing
facilities within these districts.
3. In no case shall off-site advertising signs and billboards be permitted, except that directional
signs shall be installed by the city as necessary to properly identify the Cove and other
significant features. The City should install, or cause to be installed, a business/services
directory sign at the north and south ends of town facing Highway 1.
4. Building setback standards or lines shall be established along major public rights-of-way to
assure that building placement is compatible with the preservation of scenic values and
viewsheds.
5. All off-street parking lots shall be dust free and landscaped and screened to the satisfaction of
the City's Design Assistance Committee or the Planning Commission.
4. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRAFFIC CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Four principal methods shall be adopted and utilized to finance the implementation of the
policies and programs of this element.
1. New public rights-of-way, streets and other facilities that are not provided as part of new
developments, and the improvement of existing public rights-of-way, streets and facilities, shall
be among the required future capital expenditures of the City and shall be included in the City's
Capital Improvement Program (CIP). Funds for carrying out the CIP shall be raised in
accordance with standard municipal finance methods, subject to the limitations of State law.
2. The City shall require dedications of land, or fees in lieu of such dedications, as part of the
development process, in accordance with the provisions and limitations of State law, in order to
ensure that new developments provide land or in lieu fees for the benefit of the public.
3. The City should adopt policies for and a schedule of "development impact fees" and "traffic
impact fees", in accordance with the provisions and limitations of State law, in order to finance
the development of infrastructure caused by new developments, including such infrastructure as
roads, curbs, gutters, storm drains, sidewalks, bicycle paths, trails, and pedestrian ways.
4. The City's current off-street parking requirements (Section 5.28 of the Zoning Ordinance, and
Section 5.19 (D) of the Zoning Ordinance governing the payment of fees in-lieu of providing
                                          V. Circulation, Page 7
required off-street parking spaces) shall continue to accomplish the goals and the off-street
parking policies and provisions of this element.
5. The City shall implement the following measures:
    a. Require traffic studies for all new development contributing 50 peak hour traffic trips to
    Main Street, School Street, or any intersection of State Route 1 as determined by the
    Institution of Transportation Engineers (ITE) standards for trip generation or whenever the
    City processes Planned Residential proposals or tentative subdivision maps or when any
    proposal would potentially increase a Level of Service or where there would be significant
    direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts to Highway One traffic capacity in rural areas north
    and south of the City.
    b. Require new development to pay a pro-rata share of all traffic improvements needed as a
    result of project implementation.
    c. Apply to all future transportation projects, where applicable, the recommended mitigation
    measures outlined in the State Route 1 Corridor Study for the County of Mendocino,
    prepared by TJKM Transportation Consultants.
6. To mitigate exterior sound levels, due to transportation or other sources, for new residential
or other new projects, consideration shall be given to an increased setback distance; use of
property line, patio, and deck barriers; orientation of buildings to achieve a sound shielding
benefit at outdoor use areas.
7. To mitigate interior sound levels, due to transportation or other sources, for new residential or
other new projects, consideration shall be given to an increased setback distance and use of
barriers, insulation measures applied to the building skins, including appropriate designs for
windows, walls, doors, roof/ceiling assemblies, weather seals, and other components.
Vegetative barriers do not generally provide substantial reductions in noise levels.

                    VI. OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
1. INTRODUCTION
This element addresses the very considerable environmental assets of Point Arena, as well as the
policies, General Plan provisions, and action programs required to protect and enhance those
assets.
This element is largely concerned with matters of open space preservation and the conservation
of natural resources. The overall environmental goals of this General Plan are also achievable
through implementation of the Land-Use Element of this General Plan.
Identifying, preserving and conserving the area's open spaces and natural resources is the chief
objective of this element. These two subjects, both of which are mandated by state law for
inclusion in local general plans, are often interrelated. Accordingly, they are presented together
in this general plan as one element. Reference is also made in the text that follows to air and
water quality, which are concerns and matters of related public policy. They are raised here
because sometimes they need to be addressed in the context of open space and natural resources
policy and program development, but they are covered in depth in the Health and Safety Element
and in the Noise Element.
2. BACKGROUND AND FINDINGS: OPEN SPACE
State Government Code Sec. 65560 defines open space as any parcel or area of land or water
which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open space use for the purposes of (a)
preservation of natural resources; (b) managed production of resources; (c) outdoor recreation;
and (d) public health and safety.
Additionally, this General Plan recognizes that the relative densities of the city's residential areas
are considerably less than densities for other cities, and that this feature has much to do with
giving Point Arena its special open space feeling.
This general plan sets forth a network of open spaces to provide relief from urbanization, access
to natural areas, protection of slopes and viewsheds, protection from natural hazards, and access
via open space corridors to destinations throughout the city. The network is created by fitting
together components in a continuous series so that even if all the open spaces do not physically
touch they bear a positive relationship to each other.
The inventory of existing open spaces includes the following:
1. Arena Creek, its riparian corridor, and its trail and open space easements
2. The South Fork of Hathaway Creek and its riparian corridor.
                                      VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 1
3. Existing trail easements, or recorded offers to dedicate such easements, at various locations
within the city
4. The undeveloped coastal bluffs
5. City-owned parks, and school district playgrounds
6. The Arena Cove undeveloped areas, especially the riparian corridor of Arena Creek, the
wetlands area, and the beach
7. Undeveloped non-agricultural lands throughout the city
8. Agricultural lands within the city.
9. Areas precluded from development by virtue of their severe slope or other physical hazards.
These existing and potential open space resources are not identified as to precise use, type of
open space, potential for development or non development, ownership, or quality. This is
merely an inventory of what constitutes the supply of existing and potential open spaces in Point
Arena as of 1993.
3. BACKGROUND AND FINDINGS: NATURAL RESOURCES
Identifying and establishing policies and programs for the conservation of natural resources is
the responsibility of the "conservation element" and is prescribed by Sec. 65301 (d) of the
Government Code. The Code is concerned with water resources, soils, beaches and coastlines,
watersheds, flood control, marine life, harbors and fisheries, wildlife, and other natural resources
peculiar to the area under consideration, including significant plants and animals in the local
ecosystem.
The unique natural features and natural resources inventory of Point Arena and its sphere of
influence includes the following:
1. The area's high air quality
2. The area's low ambient noise levels
3. Arena Creek as an ecosystem, riparian corridor and wildlife habitat revival as a healthy
habitat for animal and plant life and for fish
4. The bluff tops north and south of Arena Cove, and the informal trail systems at both locations
(which are connectible to the county's trail system)
                                     VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 2
5. The sometimes steep-sloped and undeveloped open lands directly within the urbanized area
of Point Arena, and the magnificent open lands, hillsides, and mountains off into the distance.
6. The presence of working farms on the very edge of the town.
7. The array of scenic sites, views and vistas wherever one looks and from many vantage points.
8. The various marine resources associated with Arena Cove and the ocean waters, including
marine life and biological resources within the sea and on the shore, and the commercial and
recreational fishing opportunities available within the Cove and beyond.
9. The fresh-water habitats of the Garcia River and Plain, the associated wetlands, the river itself
and its ecosystem... the source of the City's principal water supply.
10. Other fresh-water habitats and riparian areas, as well as the salt water ocean habitat, the
coastline, and the beaches.
11. Numerous wildlife resources: salmon spawning grounds, nesting and feeding grounds for
migratory birds (Arctic Loon, White Pelican, Great White Egret, Red-Necked Grebes, Tundra
Swans, Great Blue Heron, Brown Pelican, White-Faced Ibis), deer, raccoon, skunks, fox, various
song and game birds, kelp, sea urchin, abalone, and the Federally-listed-as-endangered Point
Arena Mountain Beaver.
12. Absence of excessive artificial lighting, which facilitates star gazing while also contributing
to the pleasant and much-appreciated rural small-town atmosphere of Point Arena.
4. OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION GOALS
1. To preserve identifiable open space and conservation resources, as well as the "sense of open
space" that now contributes to the town's character.
2. To create an open space system adequate to serve local needs and expectations, and to
provide visual and psychological relief from the built-up environment that will result when the
city is more fully urbanized, which system shall be comprised of parks and recreation areas,
urban pathways and trails, waterways and riparian corridors, permanently-preserved urban open
space lands held in a single or common ownership, and the coastline and beaches.
3. To preserve key scenic corridors, vistas and viewsheds, and the special open space and scenic
qualities of ocean bluffs, hillsides, hilltops, and farmlands.
4. To strive to preserve existing open space lands: farmlands and ranches, and forested areas,
located outside Point Arena and yet within its sphere of influence.
                                       VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 3
5. To protect all sensitive and endangered habitats from grading, diking, dredging, filling and
development, and from water and air pollutants.
6. To retain waterways and associated riparian buffer areas, marshes and wetlands, and beaches,
in as close to a natural state as possible.
7. To promote opportunities for outdoor recreation within open spaces, at Arena Cove, and
within the waters of the Cove.
8. To attempt to conserve existing natural land contours.
9. To promote the planting of trees for wind protection and scenery, and to work to conserve
existing trees of significance.
10. To preserve and improve coastal access by foot and vehicle, and for the handicapped.
11. To promote coastal-dependent economic development and visitor-serving uses at Arena
Cove, subject to the environmental-protection policies and regulations of this general plan.
12. To protect the integrity and quality of the City's domestic water supply.
13. To ensure that all pollutants, including unwanted sounds, are not allowed to impact
negatively on the environment.
14. To preserve the existing qualities associated with a low level of artificial lighting on public
and private properties.
15. In order to protect the environmental integrity of its marine resources, to oppose the
construction of a breakwater at Arena Cove.
16. To preserve the City's unique archaeological, architectural, and historic resources.
5. OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION POLICIES
The following policies shall guide and regulate the actions of the City, other public agencies,
property owners, and developers in order that the open space and conservation goals of this
general plan are achieved:
1. Environmentally-sensitive habitat areas shall be protected against any significant disruption
of habitat values, and only uses dependent on such resources shall be allowed within such areas.
2. To prevent non-agricultural activities from being developed in county agriculturally-zoned
areas adjoining and nearby Point Arena, the City and Mendocino County should cooperate in
preserving the integrity of the County's land use plan for these county territories.
                                       VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 4
3. Every effort should be made to enhance wildlife habitats and maintain wildlife travel
corridors along waterways and within riparian corridors, within the city and its environs.
4. The City shall protect the non-developed flat areas of Arena Cove as a flood basin, wildlife
habitat, and critical link in the Arena Creek life-chain...insofar as possible given the objective of
enhancing the area's economic development potential. Any portions of this area that are
environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHAs) as defined in Section 30107.5 of the Coastal
Act shall be subject to the policies and standards of the certified LCP regarding the protection of
ESHA.
5. The City recognizes the marine resources and seashore habitats of the area, which include the
kelp beds as important feeding and breeding places for the myriad of organisms inhabiting
coastal waters, and shall strive to protect these resources.
6. The City shall protect water resources and quality, both of which are vital to the health of the
city's residents and important to the area's ecology, and shall allow no discharging of harmful
pollutants into any waterway.
7. The City shall strive to reduce the likelihood of sediment entering waterways as a result of
working the land or developing it.
8. Only resource dependent uses such as public nature trails shall be allowed within the riparian
corridor of any stream or creek provided that (1) the length of the trail within the riparian
corridor shall be minimized, (2) the trail crosses the stream at right angles to the maximum
extent feasible, (3) the trail is kept as far up slope from the stream as possible, (4) trail
development involves a minimum of slope disturbance and vegetation clearing, and (5) the trail
is the minimum width necessary. Development in areas adjacent to environmentally-sensitive
habitat areas and parks and recreation areas shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which
would significantly degrade such areas, and shall be compatible with the continuance of such
habitat areas.
9. The City recognizes that the main values of Arena Creek are its aesthetic qualities, its
potential as a trail site, its natural habitats, and its contribution to the biology of the waters of
Arena Cove.
10. The City shall strive to stabilize where necessary the banks of Arena Creek and ensure a
continuous strip of native vegetation along the creek, through direct city actions and by
regulating private developments, consistent with LCP policies, including but not limited to the
LCP wetland and ESHA policies.
11. Keeping waterways in their natural state, rather than allowing them to be concrete lined or
placed underground, shall be achieved during the development process.
                                         VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 5
12. New development should be required to: (a) avoid creating concentrated runoff, particularly
over steep slopes and bluff faces, by installing energy dissipating devices, (b) create drainage
swales, detention, and retention basins, (c) control the timing and manner of new construction so
that there are no bare soil slopes during the rainy season, etc.
13. Riparian buffer areas shall be maintained to preserve and protect the valuable wildlife
habitats provided by riparian areas (riparian corridors) along streams and creeks shown on the
official General Plan maps, as well as unmapped streams and creeks that meet the definition of
an environmentally sensitive habitat area (ESHA). Uses and use restrictions pertaining to
riparian buffers shall be regulated by Sections 5.22 and 5.23 of the Zoning Ordinance, and
pre-existing non-conforming uses and structures may continue in the buffer area, but no
additions that may encroach upon the buffer area shall be permitted, with the following
exception:
    a. accessory structures located at the City's waste water reclamation facility situated entirely
    within the developed, fenced area subject to securing a coastal development permit
    consistent with all other applicable provisions of the certified LCP.
14. Since the Point Arena Mountain Beaver was listed as an endangered species on December
12, 1991, with beaver habitat potentially located along Point Arena Creek, the City shall
establish a 500 feet riparian setback area ("Mountain Beaver Buffer Area") from the centerline of
the stream as recommended by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). In
addition, fences are prohibited within 15 feet of the center line to allow for wildlife migration
along the travel corridor. Disturbance of the streambed is prohibited. Through zoning and
subdivision regulations, the City shall restrict development in areas which contain identified rare
or endangered species of plants and animals, including the Point Arena Mountain Beaver.
15. The City may require the establishment of conservation easements along streams, or require
dedications of easements at the time of development.
16. The City shall ensure that new development proposals include provisions for public parks
and/or recreation facilities, the need for which must be found to be generated by the new
development and intended to serve the development, and shall be open to the public.
17. The City recognizes the need for recreational and cultural opportunities in response to a
diverse population, and shall strive to meet these needs; these may include but not be limited to
habitat restoration projects; community gardens; athletic fields; picnic areas; specially-designed
areas for seniors and for teenagers; multi-use public parks, and tot lots; and joint use of city
lands/facilities and school lands/facilities.
18. The City shall consider the merits of a citywide assessment district in order to maintain
parks and recreation facilities.
                                      VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 6
19. The City shall encourage new residential developments of any size to provide their own
recreation facilities and common- ownership open spaces in order to meet all or a portion of the
open space and recreation needs that will be generated by the new development.
20. The City shall require that developers give consideration to the impacts on wildlife and the
natural landscape of their development plans, and consider the use of native plant species that
provide wildlife cover and food sources while also requiring low maintenance and low water
usage.
21. The City shall maintain Arena Cove as an integral part of the City; all specific policies must
reflect the notion that the Cove must not become a separate entity, and that it should continue to
be part of, and an enhancement to, the entire city.
22. The City shall analyze proposed property developments on the crest of hills and bluffs, and
in canyons, in relation to views potentially lost, in order to preserve important view corridors and
viewsheds, scenic roadways, gateways to the city, and the integrity and merits of existing land
forms.
23. Five view sheds and scenic corridors are depicted on the Opportunities and Constraints Map
and shall be protected from inappropriate developments and siting of buildings; significant
unavoidable alterations to view sheds and scenic corridors shall require mitigations that may be
caused by such new developments. These viewsheds/view corridors are: to the south from
School Street; along Windy Hollow Road; along and from Riverside Drive; along Port Road; at
Arena Cove.
24. No development may be situated closer to a cliff edge along an ocean bluff than is
absolutely safe, and such development may only be approved if it will not engender the need for
a shoreline protective device.
25. City shall be obliged to advise property owners in the Cove that any proposed development
is subject to securing a coastal development permit, and they may be required to conduct wetland
delineation. If wetlands are discovered, they shall be required to obtain the appropriate federal
and/or state permits, as well as a Coastal Development Permit, prior to undertaking any earth
moving, diking, dredging, land alterations, re-vegetation, fill or other development activity. In
addition, all property owners shall comply with all of the policies and standards of the certified
LCP, including but not limited to the General Plan’s wetland policies, and if the wetland is alo
an environmentally sensitive habitat area (ESHA), they shall also comply with the General
Plan’s ESHA policies, and that they shall comply with Sections 5.22, 5.23 and 5.27 of the City's
Zoning Ordinance.
Furthermore, the marine environment of Point Arena shall be governed by Coastal Act Policies,
particularly Section 30233, which shall hereby be incorporated into this document by reference.
The requirements of Section 30233 are detailed in Chapter X Section 2.3.
                                     VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 7

26. There shall be no off-shore uses which could affect the integrity of the kelp beds and
off-shore fisheries.
27. The City shall participate with other agencies in (a) maintaining the Garcia River's water
availability and water quality for domestic water purposes, (b) protecting the micro-organisms
which serve as the basis for the river's food chain, and thereby maintaining the viability of
commercial and recreational fishing, and (c) protecting the river from unwarranted impounding,
diversions, vegetation removal, grading, refuse dumping, or alteration.
28. The City shall require a general plan amendment for any proposed on-shore facility to
support off-shore oil and gas exploration or development. Any such amendment shall not be
effective until a majority of the voters in Point Arena, in a general or special election, approve
the proposed amendment, unless such amendment is approved by the Coastal Commission
pursuant to Section 30515 of the Coastal Act.
29. Consistent with Section 5.10 of the Point Arena Zoning Ordinance, the City of Point Arena
shall require a 25-foot-wide easement along all trails designated on the Opportunities and
Constraints Map as a condition of approval to mitigate impacts of development that would
require a coastal development permit where such impacts cannot be avoided. For any project
where such mitigation is required, the preferred implementation should be through a recorded
grant of easement to the City or to a designated private nonprofit association acceptable to the
City who is willing to accept the easement and willing to operate and maintain the public
accessway or trail. Where grants of easement are not feasible because neither the City nor private
nonprofit association is willing to accept, maintain and operate the accessway, implementation of
required access mitigation shall be implemented through a recorded Offer to Dedicate (OTD) an
easement to a public agency or a designated private nonprofit association acceptable to the City.
Offers of dedication shall last for a period of 21 years from the date of recordation of the offer.
30. The City will develop and maintain an "open space parcel list within the City."
31. New utility easements (if any) should be integrated into the city's open space system.
32. The City shall establish the following system of interconnecting trails and pathways (also see
the Land-Use and Development Map and the Opportunities and Constraints Map) in a manner
consistent with LCP policies, including but not limited to the LCP wetland and ESHA policies:
    a. From Downtown to Harper Park
    b. From Harper Park to the Cove
    c. Along Devil's Cutoff
    d. From School Street to Harper Park
    e. From the Hay Annexation to Downtown
    f. Along the bluffs, and connecting to the system, as shown on said map
                                      VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 8
33. The City shall facilitate or support establishment of the following trails within county
territory:
    a. Mote Creek to the Cove
    b. The Cove to the Lighthouse
34. The City shall maintain the very-low building density, scenic qualities and open space
character of the bluff tops north and south of Arena Cove.
35. The City shall adopt a Zoning Ordinance measure that requires development proposals to be
planned in a manner to avoid removing trees, if feasible. At least two trees shall be planted for
every one removed to accommodate development facilitated by the General Plan. The planting
of trees shall not block public views to the ocean, consistent with the visual resources policies of
the LCP. Visually attractive native trees species, such as bishop pine and sargent cypress, shall
be the preferred species used, as they require less water, herbicides, pesticides, and are valuable
wildlife resources.
36. New development shall (a) be sited and designed to protect views to and along the ocean and
scenic coastal areas (b) minimize the alteration of natural land forms, and (c) be visually
compatible with the character of surrounding areas.
37. Suburban development on SR-1 lots proposed for the northeastern portion of the annexation
area shall be clustered in flatter, grassy areas or clustered in planned unit developments to reduce
grading and cutting on slopes. Consideration shall be given to allowing planned development
design based on the natural landform. The yield of the total land area would be one unit to the
acre but the forested steep slopes and the riparian canyon bottom would be maintained in a
natural state. In this fashion, the same number of residences could be built in the area while
avoiding impacts of vegetation removal, wildlife habitat reduction, and potential impacts to
sensitive species.
38. New development shall protect and preserve archaeological and paleontological resources
from destruction, and shall avoid and minimize impacts to such resources.
39. The City shall require a determination of the significance of all archaeological finds
discovered during development activity to determine appropriate actions taken.
40. Coastal Development Permits for new development within archaeologically sensitive areas
shall be conditioned upon the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures: If there is the
potential that prehistoric traces such as human remains, artifacts, or concentrations of shell,
bone, or ash may be encountered during development activity, the City shall require the
following actions be taken as a condition of any CDP approval:
    a. All construction activities on the project site shall be halted and the Planning Commission
    and a qualified archaeologist shall be consulted immediately. Prompt evaluation of the
    importance of the find shall be made and the proper course of action, acceptable to all parties
    concerned, shall be adopted.
                                       VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 9
    b. If human remains are encountered, the county coroner and the Mendocino County
    Archaeological Commission shall be contacted immediately. If the county coroner or
    archaeological commission officials determine that the remains are those of a Native
    American, local representative Native American organizations shall be consulted as to
    courses of action.
41. New development on sites identified as archaeologically sensitive shall include on-site
monitoring of all grading, excavation and site preparation that involve earth moving operations
by a qualified archaeologist(s) and appropriate Native American consultant(s).
6. ACTION PROGRAMS
In addition to causing the above open space and conservation policies to be implemented through
the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances (by amending those ordinances as necessary), or adhered
to as part of the project review and development processes, or accomplished in cooperation with
other agencies and with property owners, the City itself should initiate and carry out the
following specific actions:
1. Amend the Zoning Ordinance so that the open space requirements that are spelled out for
Planned Residential Developments (PRD) are incorporated into the appropriate section of the
Zoning Ordinance, together with the procedures that must be followed to process projects using
the PRD method.
2. Establish, zone as Park-P, and improve the following in-city parks:
    a.  The Downtown Park
    b.  Harper Park
    c.  A park at Arena Cove
    d.  A park east of Downtown
3. Prepare and adopt a comprehensive ecosystem restoration and management plan for all of
Arena Cove before more substantial development activities commence.
4. Adopt as part of the Land-Use Element of this general plan, and as part of the Zoning
Ordinance, a land-use category for public park, namely Park-P.
5. Prepare or cause to be prepared, and adopt, a comprehensive ecosystem restoration and
management plan for Arena and Hathaway Creeks and for their riparian corridors.
6. Establish a program for trees to be designated as Heritage Trees so that if designated they will
be saved from unnecessary or unwarranted destruction.
7. Prepare a "Habitat Conservation Plan" for the Point Arena Mountain Beaver in accordance
with the provisions of the US Endangered Species Act, for Coastal Commission certification as
                                     VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 10
an LCP amendment, which includes specifications governing the issuance of permits where
endangered species habitats are determined to be included in or affected by a proposed
development; and enforce Sections 6.25 5.13, 5.22, 5.23, 5.24, and 5.27 of the City's Zoning
Ordinance which governs development in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat
areas.
8. Establish a process whereby a project proponent is notified that in addition to obtaining a
coastal development permit a "Stream Bed Alteration Permit" must be obtained from the
California Department of Fish and Game prior to commencing any development project that may
alter any stream and that such development shall be consistent with the Local Coastal Program.
9. Adopt specific regulations, for inclusion in the Zoning Ordinance, to provide acceptable
alternative means for ensuring that lands required for open space, parks, or recreation areas will
be guaranteed; among the options are outright purchase by the city, or dedications to the city;
recorded easements; or the establishment of open space or park/recreation areas in common
ownership by home owners' associations.
10. Adopt specific regulations and procedures governing dredging, diking, damming,
channelization, filling or similar activities within any floodplain or stream in the city, the
proposals for which shall be subject to securing a Coastal Development Permit and to Sections
5.13, 5.23, and 5.27 of the City's Zoning Ordinance and all other applicable policies of the LCP.
11. Adopt a Zoning Ordinance provision that at least fifteen (15) percent of the lot area of a
multi-family residential project in any MR or HWC zone be reserved and improved for
multi-family common useable open space purposes.
12. Adopt specific policies, set-back criteria, and design standards appropriate for the future
planning and development within the five viewshed/view corridors provided for in this general
plan.
13. In order to protect the natural setting of the hillsides that surround the city, the City shall
adopt a Zoning Ordinance measure that requires hillside or ridgeline development proposals to
be scrutinized with "view from the valley floor" considerations. Proposed development on the
crest of bluffs or canyons shall be specifically analyzed in relation to views from the low-lying
areas of the city, important view corridors, and scenic gateways. Development shall not
silhouette against the ridgeline without adequate visual buffers, and development on lower
slopes shall be visually screened by existing or landscaped vegetation to minimize visual impact.
 These measures may become review standards for the design review process.
14. (a) Maps depicting sensitive habitats of the General Plan area shall be updated to include all
    the riparian habitat in the area as well as associated north-facing slopes with coastal scrub
    vegetation. North-facing slopes with coastal scrub vegetation shall be identified on the
    habitat maps as habitat of the Point Arena Mountain Beaver. Riparian habitat along the
    entire length of Point Arena Creek within the city boundary shall be designated on the
    updated map, as well as the north-facing slopes south of the creek in the southeastern portion
                                      VI. Open Space/Cons., Page 11
    of the annexation area. A buffer zone for the Point Arena mountain beaver shall be
    designated in coordination with CDFG and the USFWS. Other riparian zones not
    represented on existing maps include two tributaries of Hathaway Creek: one in the north-
    central portion of the city and one in the northeastern corner of the annexation area. Riparian
    vegetation along ephemeral drainages in the city that drain north to south into Point Arena
    Creek shall also be mapped.
    (b) Updated habitat maps shall be submitted to the California Coastal Commission for
    certification. All habitat maps shall include a note that states that “the maps may be updated
    as appropriate and may not include all areas that constitute ESHA.”
15. North-facing slopes south of Point Arena Creek in the annexation area confirmed Point
Arena mountain beaver habitat that shall be set aside for protection of the small populations of
this sensitive species. Development proposed in this area, zoned for residential agriculture (two-
acre lots), shall be reviewed vigorously to ensure conformance with policies of the General Plan
and preservation of the populations of Point Arena mountain beaver that inhabit the area.
16. Those portions of the annexation area in a natural, undisturbed state shall be subject to more
detailed biologic field studies prior to the approval of any development application.
17. The City of Point Arena shall avoid developing any road crossings of Arena Creek.

                   VII. COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT
1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter covers safety, as prescribed by Safety Element provisions of the California
Government Code, Section 65302(g); air quality; and water supply and quality, which are parts
of the State-mandated Conservation Element, Section 35602(d) but are included as part of this
element rather than as a part of the conservation element.
The underlying assumption of this element is that the City can reduce the hazards caused by
certain natural occurrences if the probabilities of such conditions are known in advance and
plans for dealing with them are prepared.
State law requires that the Safety Element address the protection of the community from
unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically-induced surface rupture, ground
shaking, ground failure, tsunami and seiche; slope instability due to mudslides and landslides;
subsidence and other known geologic hazards; flooding; and wildland and urban fires.
State law requires that local communities also adopt measurable noise standards as well as
programs that will ensure that they are adhered to. These are to be found in the separate Noise
Element of this general plan.
After setting forth public health and safety goals, the implementing policies and programs of this
element are presented. They are divided into eight sections: seismic safety; flood hazards and
control; slope stability; fire protection; air quality; water supply and quality; waste water
collection and treatment; emergency preparedness; and hazardous materials transportation and
storage.
2. COMMUNITY SAFETY GOALS
1. Strive to protect the community from injury, loss of life, and property damage resulting from
natural catastrophes and hazardous conditions.
2. Strive to reduce the impact of pollutants on the well-being of Point Arena citizens, and on
plants and wildlife.
3. Provide an adequate, consistent, and safe supply of water to meet Point Arena's domestic,
commercial and fire fighting needs, and protect the city's ground water from pollutants.
4. Recognize the importance of the Garcia River and of the Garcia River Watershed and
ecosystem to the City's well being.
                                        VII. Health & Safety, Page 1
5. Ensure that the city and its citizens, and businesses, are prepared for an effective response to
major emergencies.
3. COMMUNITY SAFETY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The following are the City's policies and programs with respect to community health and safety,
by category of concern:
1. New development shall: (a) Minimize risks to life and property in areas of high geologic,
flood, and fire hazard. (b) Assure stability and structural integrity, and neither create nor
contribute significantly to erosion, geologic instability, or destruction of the site or surrounding
area or in any way require the construction of protective devices that would substantially alter
natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs. (c) Be consistent with requirements imposed by an air
pollution control district or the State Air Resources Control Board as to each particular
development.
2. All proposed land divisions, including lot line adjustments, shall be prohibited unless potential
future development on all proposed parcels can be demonstrated to be safe from flooding,
erosion, and geologic hazards and will be provided with a safe, legal, all-weather access road(s),
which can be constructed consistent with all policies of the LCP.
3.1. Seismic Safety Policies and Programs
Seismic hazards originate from sources both inside and outside of the city's corporate boundaries
and pose both direct (primary) and indirect (secondary) risks to inhabitants. Primary hazard
risks are land surface ruptures along a fault trace during an earthquake of moderate to major
magnitude. Such an occurrence would pose a hazard to structures, utilities, and roads which
traverse or straddle the fault.
Although Hathaway Creek Fault is not a major one it does traverse part of the city and may be a
source of a primary risk. It is likely any seismic activity on this fault would be associated with
major seismic activity on the San Andreas Fault north of the city.
Secondary seismic risks include ground shaking, lurch cracking of soil surfaces, liquefaction of
soils, and lateral spreading, and may occur on unstable soils, of which there are those (Santa
Lucia) shown on the Opportunities and Constraints Map of this general plan. Another secondary
risk is a tsunami tidal wave action.
The following policies and programs shall apply:
1. The City shall undertake studies that establish acceptable levels of risk/safety standards, and
shall cause existing buildings to be brought up to those standards.
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 2
2. The City shall require dynamic ground-motion analyses and responsive structural design for
all new privately owned, high-occupancy structures (e.g., theaters, apartment houses, places of
public assembly) and for structures for whose continued function in the event of a seismic
disaster is critical (for example, public assembly buildings), and have plan checks for these
buildings performed by a licensed structural engineer. The City shall also continue to invoke
Sections 5.20 and 5.21 of the Zoning Ordinance in connection with all new proposed
developments.
3. The City shall avoid placement of critical facilities and habitable structures in areas prone to
ground failure during an earthquake or within areas subject to Tsunami wave run-up.
4. The City shall prepare a more detailed Seismic Safety sub- element that translates general
plan seismic safety policies into specific programs, mitigation measures, and specifications...
largely with respect to potentially seismically-hazardous buildings constructed prior to
enactment of codes requiring earthquake-resistant design. The sub-element shall be submitted to
the Coastal Commission as an LCP amendment for certification.
5. The City shall determine the precise location and map the Hathaway Creek Fault as generally
shown on the “Natural Hazards” Opportunities and Constraints Map of the General Plan. The
City shall require site-specific qualifying engineering studies for all new construction within any
fault zone. The map shall be submitted to the Coastal Commission as an LCP amendment for
certification.
6. The City shall review local- and distant-source tsunami inundation maps for Point Arena and
adjacent coastal communities as they are developed to identify susceptible areas, plan evacuation
routes or location suitable for vertical evacuation and make evacuation plans available to all
emergency responders and other appropriate parties.
7. The City shall identify and map potential tsunami inundation zones for land use planning.
Maps should identify generalized tsunami inundation zones on a probabilistic basis (e.g., 100-
year event). These maps shall be submitted to the Coastal Commission for certification.
8. The City shall periodically review and update tsunami preparation response policies/practices
to reflect current inundation maps and design standards, and submit these updated policies to the
Coastal Commission for certification.
9. If new development is proposed within a potential tsunami inundation zone as identified by
policy nos. 6 and 7, the City shall require a site-specific hazard analysis for a 100-year tsunami
event. Where feasible, development shall be sited outside of the area identified as a tsunami
inundation zone in the site specific wave run-up analysis.
10. If it is not feasible to site new development outside of tsunami inundation zones identified by
the site-specific analysis required in policy no. 8, development shall be located and designed to
minimize tsunami losses and damage.
                                        VII. Health & Safety, Page 3

11. The City shall avoid where feasible siting new critical facilities, including fire and police
stations and hospitals in tsunami inundation zones. If it is necessary to site such facilities in
tsunami inundation zones to provide adequate population protection, new critical facilities shall
be located and configured to be functional immediately after a 100-year tsunami event.
12. The City shall develop a local response plan and/or participate in any regional effort to
develop and implement workable response plans for distribution of information on tsunami
alerts, watches, and warnings, to appropriate emergency responders and City personnel.
13. The City shall include tsunami evacuation route information as part of any overall evacuation
route sign program implemented in the City. Evacuation routes should be clearly posted. An
evacuation route traffic monitoring system that provides real-time information on the traffic flow
at critical roadways should be considered.
14. The City shall develop and implement a tsunami educational program for residents, visitors,
and people who work in the susceptible areas. 15. The City shall require that overnight visitor-
serving facilities in susceptible areas to provide tsunami information and evacuation plans.
3.2. Flood Hazard Policies and Programs
Flood hazards in the city are limited to the area along Arena Creek and to the present parking
area at Arena Cove. The latter is a result of heavy seas during winter storms, and the former a
function of both heavy seas and heavy runoff along Arena Creek. At times the creek may run
high and partially inundate properties located at various points along its length.
The following policies and programs shall apply:
1. The City shall maintain an updated flood control plan. It should address issues such as (a)
natural flooding resulting from major rain storms that cause overflows of Arena Creek and may
be aggravated by the City's inadequate storm drainage facilities, (b) mud and debris flows that
may originate in hill areas having deep top soils with poor drainage characteristics, and (c)
improvements in drainage systems sufficient to handle increases in storm drainage capacity as
development increases.
2. Buildings within flood prone areas subject to inundation or erosion shall be prohibited unless
no alternative building site exists on the property and proper mitigation measures are provided to
minimize or eliminate risks to life and property from flood hazard.
3. The City shall establish standards to mitigate downstream impacts associated with new
development.
4. Drainage channels shall be improved or maintained so as to preserve the natural character of
waterways.
5. The City shall continue to be guided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 4
(FEMA) and/or the Federal Insurance Administration with respect to "special flood hazards"
identified in the scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study for Point
Arena" dated June 3, 1986 together with the accompanying "Flood Insurance Rate Map".
6. No structure on land shall be located, constructed, extended, converted, or altered without full
compliance with the terms of the City's Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance (Ordinance # 126)
and without first obtaining a development permit as per Section 4.1 of said ordinance.
3.3. Slope Stability Policies and Programs
Soils hazards are largely limited to engineering constraints posed to urban development given
the city's Santa Lucia soils. Slopes which exceed 20% in grade clearly must be acknowledged as
constraints on development. Poor bearing capacity and surface and subsurface soil materials
pose the greatest risk of soil failure, particularly when water-saturated. Within Point Arena such
slopes in excess of nine percent may be unstable.
Considerable hazard to public safety is apparent with regard to coastal bluffs and their uses, and
the potential for sea-cliff retreat is significant, posing a considerable hazard for development
occurring along the vacant coastal bluffs. Open space and agricultural uses are appropriate with
very-low residential uses allowed only subject to site specific and qualified geologic and soils
studies. Areas south of Arena Cove are especially vulnerable.
In addition, landslides are most likely in hillside locations under conditions where (a) rock strata
parallels surface slopes; (b) high clay content absorbs excess water; (c) displacement has
fractured a fault zone; or (d), the bases of slopes have been removed by erosion or by people.
Landslides can be triggered by heavy rains, human actions, or earthquakes.
The following policies and programs apply:
1. Applications for new development, where applicable and as required in the Sections 5.20 and
5.21 of the City’s ordinance, shall include a geologic/soils/geotechnical study that identifies any
geologic hazards affecting the proposed project site, any necessary mitigation measures, and
contains a statement that the project site is suitable for the proposed development and that the
development will be safe from geologic hazard. Such reports shall be conducted by a licensed
Certified Engineering Geologist (CEG) or Geotechnical Engineer (GE). Both on-site and off-site
hazardous impacts shall be considered.
2. Development shall not be permitted until necessary mitigation measures are implemented to
limit potential damage to levels of acceptable risk.
3. The City shall encourage clustering of developments away from areas unsuitable for
development because of slope instability problems.
4. Replanting of non-invasive vegetation following development shall be required on slopes
prone to instability, and drought-resistive non-invasive plants shall be used for landscaping
                                         VII. Health & Safety, Page 5

slopes where excessive watering might induce landslides or erosion.
5. On ancient landslides, unstable slopes and other geologic hazard areas, new development shall
only be permitted where an adequate factor of safety can be provided, consistent with the
applicable provisions of Section 5.21 of the City’s zoning ordinance.
6. The remediation or stabilization of landslides that affect existing structures or that threatens
public health or safety may be permitted. Alternative remediation or stabilization techniques
shall be analyzed to determine the least environmentally damaging alternative. Maximum
feasible mitigation shall be incorporated into the project in order to minimize adverse impacts to
resources.
7. Grading and/or development-related vegetation clearance shall be prohibited where the slope
exceeds 40 percent (2.5:1), except that driveways and/or utilities may be located on such slopes,
where there is no less environmentally damaging feasible alternative means of providing access
to a building site, provided that the building site is determined to be the preferred alternative and
consistent with all other policies of the LCP.
8. New development shall provide adequate drainage and erosion control facilities that convey
site drainage in a non-erosive manner in order to minimize hazards resulting from increased
runoff, erosion and other hydrologic impacts to streams.
8.5 New development shall: (1) avoid creating concentrated runoff, particularly over steep slopes
and bluff faces, by installing energy dissipating devices, (2) create drainage swales, detention,
and retention basins, (3) control the timing and manner of new construction so that there are no
bare soil slopes during the rainy season.
9. All swimming pools proposed near coastal bluffs and within 100 feet of fault zones shall
contain double wall construction with drains and leak detection systems.
10. New development on or along the shoreline or a coastal bluff requiring on-site waste disposal
systems shall site systems as far landward as possible in order to avoid the need for protective
devices to the maximum extent feasible.
11. New development in the cove or on an oceanfront bluff shall be sited outside areas subject to
inundation or wave up-rush at any time during the full projected 75-year economic life of the
development. If complete avoidance of hazard areas is not feasible, all new cove or oceanfront
bluff development shall be elevated above the base Flood Elevation (as defined by FEMA) and
setback as far landward as possible. All development shall be setback a minimum of 10 feet
landward of the most landward surveyed mean high tide line. Whichever setback method is most
restrictive shall apply. Development plans shall consider hazards currently affecting the property
as well as hazards that can be anticipated over the life of the structure.
12. All new development located on a bluff top shall be setback from the bluff edge a sufficient
distance to ensure that it will be stable for a projected 75- year economic life. Stability shall be
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 6

defined as maintaining a minimum factor of safety against sliding of 1.5. This requirement shall
apply to the principle structure and accessory or ancillary structures. Ancillary structures such as
decks, patios and walkways that do not require structural foundations may extend into the
setback area to a minimum distance of 15 feet from the bluff edge. Ancillary structures shall be
removed or relocated landward when threatened by erosion. Slope stability analyses and erosion
rate estimates shall be performed by a licensed Certified Engineering Geologist or Geotechnical
Engineer.
13. All new ocean-front and bluff top development shall be sized, sited and designed to minimize
risk from wave run-up, flooding and beach and bluff erosion hazards without requiring a
shoreline protection structure at any time during the life of the development.
14. As a condition of approval of new development on a vacant ocean-front or bluff top lot, or
where demolition and rebuilding is proposed, where geologic or engineering evaluations
conclude that the development can be sited and designed to not require a shoreline protection
structure as part of the proposed development or at any time during the life of the development,
the property owner shall be required to record a deed restriction against the property that ensures
that no shoreline protection structure shall be proposed or constructed to protect the development
approved and which expressly waives any future right to construct such devices that may exist
pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 30235.
15. No permanent structures shall be permitted on a bluff face, except for engineered stairways
or accessways to provide public beach access. Such structures shall be constructed and designed
to not contribute to further erosion of the bluff face and to be visually compatible with the
surrounding area to the maximum extent feasible.
16. Existing shoreline protection structures which do not conform to the provisions of the LCP
may be repaired and maintained to the extent that such repairs and/or maintenance conform to
the provisions of Title 14 CCR Section 13252 and Section 6.11(B)(5) of the Zoning Ordinance.
17. Land divisions, including subdivisions, lot splits, lot line adjustments, and certificates of
compliance which create new shoreline or bluff top lots, shall not be permitted unless the
subdivision can be shown to create lots which can be developed without requiring a current or
future bluff or shoreline protection structure. No new lots shall be created that could require
shoreline protection or bluff stabilization structures at any time during the full 75-year life of the
development.
18. Siting and design of new shoreline development and shoreline protective devices shall take
into account anticipated future changes in sea level. In particular, an acceleration of the historic
rate of sea level rise shall be considered. Development shall be set back a sufficient distance
landward and elevated to a sufficient foundation height to eliminate or minimize to the
maximum extent feasible hazards associated with anticipated sea level rise over the expected 75-
year economic life of the structure.
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 7
3.4. Fire Protection Policies and Programs
Fire hazards in Point Arena are either site-specific or generalized. In the case of site-specific
fires, the local volunteer fire department is capable of responding adequately, and the
combination of personnel, infrastructure (hydrants) and equipment is adequate to yield a rating
of "8" or "9" on the general fire insurance rate schedule.
The most significant risk of fire in town is to the Downtown area where there are a number of
older buildings and relatively high building densities. On a more generalized level the California
Department of Forestry rates the area as having a "moderate" rating on the Fire Hazard Severity
Scale during the peak summer season. This is because of the usually higher humidity levels and
low fuel vegetation components of coastal terrace lands.
A major problem for the city is the absence of an alternative emergency route to and from Arena
Cove. The lack of a secondary route is addressed in the Traffic and Circulation element of this
general plan.
The following policies and programs apply:
1. Potential fire hazards, including existing fire-vulnerable buildings, shall be mitigated where
appropriate, through proper fire-protection methods and fire-fighting practices, by clearing
vacant land of excessive vegetation, and by updating fire- protection regulations for new
construction and remodeled buildings.
2. The City shall strive to assure a five-minute response time for emergency vehicles, and to
improve the ISO rating to "7" overall.
3. An adequate and safe supply of water to meet fire fighting needs shall be ensured. The City
shall allow new development only in areas where adequate water pressure for fire suppression is
available.
4. The City shall establish a program to upgrade fire fighting vehicles, equipment and storage
facilities.
5. The City should consider establishing a fire control assessment district and/or a focused
development impact fee policy and schedule to carry out its upgrade program.
6. Woodstoves and fireplaces in buildings with common walls should be prohibited or potential
risks satisfactorily mitigated.
7. The City should ensure that all new wood stove installations or replacements meet prevailing
and current State requirements.
8. Roads and streets shall be designed and constructed to satisfy up-to-date Fire Safety
Regulations of the State Board of Forestry, where applicable.
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 8
9. The City should require maintenance of a 500-gallon per minute fire flow standard in all
existing and future city fire hydrants, with higher pressure standards to apply in higher density
and industrial areas.
10. The City should require all new building and remodeling plans to be in conformance with
applicable building and fire code standards. Prior to commencement of grading or construction,
plans shall be submitted for approval to the City of Point Arena.
11. The City shall evaluate the feasibility of expanding the existing fire station or a acquiring a
new fire station that would facilitate the housing of additional fire-fighting equipment and
personnel.
12. When brush clearance is required for fire safety, brushing techniques that minimize impacts
to native vegetation, ESHA and that minimize erosion, runoff, and sedimentation shall be
utilized.
13. Applications for new development, which require fuel modification, shall include a fuel
modification plan for the project, prepared by a landscape architect or resource specialist that
incorporates measures to minimize removal of native vegetation and to minimize impacts to
ESHA, while providing for fire safety, consistent with the requirements of the applicable fire
safety regulations. Such plans shall be reviewed and approved by the Forestry Division.
3.5. Police Protection Policies and Programs
The City should maintain and periodically renegotiate contractual arrangements with the
Mendocino County Sheriff's Department to ensure that a satisfactory level of traffic enforcement
and general law enforcement is provided to the City, its residents, and visitors.
The City should work to provide a sufficient level of police service to maintain a minimum 20-
minute response time to emergency calls.
4. AIR QUALITY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Point Arena is in a unique location with respect to air quality because of its proximity to the
ocean and the pathway of prevailing winds. One exception is the Mill Street corridor where
woodstove smoke often lingers and becomes bothersome and may prove unhealthy to some.
The Point Arena area is located in the North Coast Air Basin, and the Mendocino County Air
Pollution Control District (MCAPCD) is the regional agency with the responsibility for
enforcing State of California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQSA) and the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards.
Sources of air pollution within the area are divided into stationary sources and mobile sources,
the latter mostly along Highway 1. The former consist of fireplaces and wood stoves, and
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 9
activities at the industrial site on Riverside Drive. Residential fuel burning on days with a
marine inversion layer leads to local accumulations in low-lying areas, mostly along Mill Street.
To maintain Point Arena's high air quality and to reduce significant impacts caused by growth
and development to less- than-significant levels, the following policies shall apply:
1. Development which would result in the violation of any State ambient air quality standard or
generate a significant amount of air pollutants will not be permitted.
2. The City shall ensure that all new wood stove installations or replacements meet clean air
standards (EPA Phase 2 requirements), except that wood stoves and fireplaces in high- density
low inversion residential areas may not be approved if the effect is to contribute to a reduction of
air quality.
3. The City will prohibit the burning of non-vegetative materials, garbage, clothes, plastics, and
construction or demolition wastes.
4. The City will require that new and upgraded/modified industrial and commercial
developments utilize BMP (Best Management Practices) for pollution control.
5. To mitigate local and regional impacts due to dust and emissions from construction activities,
and to prevent fugitive dust from being transported off-site, a "construction dust control policy"
should be adopted and implemented. The following measures shall be considered when adopting
a construction dust policy:
    a. Areas of soil redistribution shall be watered down twice daily or as necessary to trap
    fugitive dust and particulate during construction until plants, grass growth, or building
    coverage reduce the need for such measures.
    b. If water is limited, soil binders such as soil cement may be spread in conjunction with
    watering, or sheet coverings such as burlap may be used on small areas. Areas with soil
    binders shall be turned over prior to re-vegetation.
    c. During periods of excessive wind speeds, construction shall be temporarily suspended.
    d. Disturbed areas shall be re-vegetated or paved as soon as possible to reduce dust during
    construction activities.
5. AIR QUALITY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS, PER THE COUNTY OF
MENDOCINO AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT
1. The City shall require all air quality mitigation measures to be reasonable, effective, feasible,
measurable, and implementable concurrent with project development.
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 10
         Implementation Strategy: Consult with the Air Quality Management District regarding
         the effectiveness of mitigation measures proposed by the applicant. When using
         mitigation measures suggested by the Air Quality Management District, consider site-
         specific factors, which may make a measure infeasible. Consider measures to reduce
         traffic in other parts of the community to offset emissions (or traffic) not mitigated by
         site-specific measures.
2. In the short-term planning period, the City shall support the development and use of Air
Quality Impact Assessment Guidelines that will provide: A) standard criteria for determining
significant environmental effects, B) a uniform method of calculating project emissions, C) a list
of standard mitigation measures.
         Implementation Strategy: Work with the Air Quality Management District and other
         planning agencies to develop and implement standards that are uniform throughout the
         county. The Air Quality Management District will act as primary author of the Air
         Impact Quality Assessment Guidelines. The District will hold workshops and meetings
         to gather ideas from citizens and affected agencies, with a completed product ready
         within three years.
3. The City shall consult with the Air Quality Management District during CEQA review for all
discretionary projects. The City shall consult with the Air Quality Management District prior to
accepting applications for development projects meeting or exceeding Air Quality Management
District emissions thresholds, and other projects as appropriate.
         Implementation Strategy: Conduct a pre-application air quality review to identify issues
         or problems that might require re-design or major alterations of the project. The District
         may also review formal air quality impact analyses submitted by the applicant for
         adequacy. This will ensure that the environmental document bases its conclusions on
         accurate information.
4. The City shall request Caltrans and other transportation agencies to construct or improve
facilities for all travel modes on Highway 1.
         Implementation Strategy 1: Identify the location of all bicycle, pedestrian, and transit
         facilities on General Plan maps, and consider developing additional signage to help
         residents and visitors use these routes. Request Caltrans to help fill gaps in needed
         facilities.
         Implementation Strategy 2: Work with Mendocino Council of Governments and other
         agencies to pursue funding for alternative transportation facilities under STA (d1), TDA,
         federal TEA, state bike lane account, and other sources.
5. The City shall support and participate in the air quality education programs of the Air Quality
Management District.
                                        VII. Health & Safety, Page 11
        Implementation Strategy 1: The City shall assist the Air Quality Management District in
        educating developers and the public on the benefits of pedestrian and transit friendly
        development. A key tool will be joint participation by City staff and council members in
        District seminars on planning for air quality and other community values.
        Implementation Strategy 2: During the short term planning period, the City shall develop
        community education programs about the possibilities of reducing air pollution through
        personal life-style choices. This program would include the importance of using wood
        burning appliances appropriately, alternatives to open-burning such as chipping and
        composting, and use of alternative transportation.
6. The City shall support agricultural education programs that increase the awareness among
farmers of techniques to reduce PM-10 emissions.
        Implementation Strategy: During the short-term planning period, work with the Farm
        Bureau, the University of California, the Air Quality Management District and farm
        organizations on educational programs.
7. The City shall require measures to reduce particulate emissions from road and site
construction, grading, and demolition to the maximum extent feasible. Developers must cover
all access roads, driveways, and parking areas with pavement or other appropriate material
serving new commercial and industrial development.
        Implementation Strategy: Utilize recommendations from the Air Quality Management
        District on appropriate dust-control activities, suitable for soil, wind, slope, and other site
        particulars. Provide for regular inspection of the projects' dust-suppression measures.
        Incorporate dust-control enforcement provisions in all construction permits, and consult
        with District enforcement staff if a nuisance issue arises from project earth-moving or
        construction-equipment exhaust. Include paving requirements as part of the development
        standards of the Zoning Ordinance.
8. In consultation with the Air Quality Management District, the City shall develop a program to
reduce PM-10 emissions from City and County maintained roads within the planning area.
        Implementation Strategy 1: Inventory unpaved roads (private and public) within the
        planning area. Conduct regular traffic counts (ADT) on these roads during dry months
        (May through October). Require application of dust palliatives when traffic levels
        exceed 300 ADT during this period. During drought periods, monitor traffic and dust
        levels as appropriate. Over the intermediate planning period, develop plans and funding
        sources to pave heavily-used dirt roads.
        Implementation Strategy 2: Maintain a street sweeping program throughout the planning
        area. Landscape shoulders and medians. Consider lowering speed limits on roads which
        cannot be paved during the short-term period, and implementing traffic calming measures
                                     VII. Health & Safety, Page 12
         to keep speeds low.
9. The City shall work with Caltrans, Mendocino Council of Governments, and other local
agencies or institutions to develop programs that reduce the impact of automobile commuting.
         Implementation Strategy 1: During the short-term planning period, request Caltrans and
         MCOG to identify suitable sites for park-and-ride lots within the planning area.
         Designate these sites within the Circulation Element.
         Implementation Strategy 2: Encourage Banks, Savings and Loans, and other lending
         institutions to consider commute distances and associated travel costs when reviewing
         mortgage applications. This review should encourage people to live and work in the
         same community whenever possible.
         Implementation Strategy 3: The City should construct appropriate park-and-ride lots on
         public land or other available areas as needed. The City (or County) may require new
         projects to construct park-and-ride lots as traffic and air quality mitigation.
         Implementation Strategy 4: Utilize park-and-ride lot construction as an offset for new
         project traffic-created air pollution. Incorporate park-and-ride lot construction in
         standard CEQA mitigation measures for developments expected to generate over 500
         ADT. Coordinate with MTA and major employers to establish express buses and
         vanpools to increase patronage of park-and-ride lots.
10. The City shall, through the development process, reduce air quality impacts resulting from
space heating. The City shall require primary heat sources in all new development, room
additions, or remodels involving space heating to utilize solar, pellet stoves, propane, butane,
fuel oil, vented kerosene heaters or electricity. The City may restrict or prohibit installation of
wood burning appliances in new development, especially in multi-family rental units.
         Implementation Strategy 1: Commencing within 180 days of Plan adoption, City plan
         reviews and inspections should verify that solar access is optimized and primary heat
         sources come from low-polluting sources (cited above). Secondary heat should come
         only from EPA certified wood stoves, or fireplace inserts.
         Implementation Strategy 2: Where wood stoves or fireplace inserts are permitted, (a)
         dwellings should incorporate increased insulation or reduced window area sufficient to
         exceed insulation requirements of Title 24 of the state energy code by 25% or more.
         Implementation Strategy 3: Pursuant to Strategy 2 above, all new wood stoves,
         fireplaces, and fireplace inserts must pay an offset fee of $700 at the time of permitting.
         This fee will be used to replace existing non-certified wood-burning devices used for
         primary heat sources with butane, propane or other very clean heaters. Increased
         insulation or weatherization of low-income family homes may be part of the replacement
                                        VII. Health & Safety, Page 13
        process. The City may request the Air Quality Management District to provide
        assistance in administering the replacement program.
11. Little air monitoring is available for the coastal area near Point Arena. Conducting regular
monitoring of Respirable Particulate Matter (PM10) and other ambient air pollutants such as
ozone will help ensure that air quality remains good, and provide immediate notice if unhealthful
conditions occur.
        Implementation Strategy: Support establishment of a monitoring station for PM10 or
        other ambient air pollutants. The City can assist the Air Quality Management District to
        locate a suitable site for monitoring equipment and might provide electric power or other
        services.
6. WATER SUPPLY AND WATER QUALITY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The Point Arena Water Works, a privately-owned utility under California Public Utility
Commission oversight, supplies water to most of Point Arena. The exceptions are users who
have individual wells. The major source of water is a well adjacent to the Garcia River. The
main storage tank is just east of Downtown. It is estimated that the present system produces
33,000 gallons per day and delivers water to approximately 179 homes and businesses.
Existing water permits allow the Point Arena Water Works to pump 0.22 cubic feet per second
(142,000 gallons per day) or a maximum of 100 acre feet per year (90,000 gallons per day).
Existing water storage is capable of holding 575,000 gallons.
Under the current water permits, a maximum of 1,385 people may be served (90,000 gallons per
day maximum at 65 gallons per person).
A new water line has been installed at the north end of town by the Point Arena Water Works
(Permit 03-93) rendering more-than- adequate water pressure to the northern sections of the City.
Lacking is an emergency contingency plan in the advent of loss of water at its source or within
the system due to a natural disaster, particularly seismic activity at the river or seismic activity in
the vicinity of any water lines or storage tanks.
Water quality is regulated by the State Department of Health Services, which agency conducts
regular inspections to ensure continuing water quality.
A. The following policies governing the supply and delivery of water shall apply:
1. The City will continue to work with the PAWW ownership to ensure that maintenance of the
Garcia River's water quality and water supply for domestic purposes is guaranteed and meets
State standards for operation and testing.
2. The city and PAWW will maintain an updated water service plan to incorporate the changing
                                      VII. Health & Safety, Page 14
needs of the city, and to consider the impacts of drought or peak fire-fighting demand.
3. Care shall be taken to ensure that the quality of the city's ground water supply is maintained.
This can be assured by limiting or prohibiting private septic tanks.
4. The City shall consider, as a long-range possibility, the merits of purchasing, operating and
maintaining the existing water supply system. In the interim, the City should complete or cause
to be completed a satisfactory capacity study of the current water system, to include data on
system capacity (pumps, filters, storage capacity, delivery system) and source capacity. Included
should be studies of the capacity of the Garcia River in drought-year conditions.
5. Extension of the water system and new hookups should be permitted within the urban limit
line, and hookups of new developments on lots smaller than one acre shall be required.
6. The City should monitor land-use activities and development projects within the Garcia River
watershed and oppose those activities and projects that may have an adverse effect on the city's
water supply or quality.
7. The State Board of Forestry should be asked to notify the City of any timber harvesting plans
submitted within the watershed, with full consideration to be given to possible impacts on the
watershed of practices that might increase turbidity, runoff, and debris.
8. Due to the proximity of the water system's Garcia River well to a known fault zone, the City
shall assess the seismic risk the fault poses to the well, pumps, and the eight inch main which
extends from the water source to the city, and shall develop an emergency contingency plan in
cooperation with the County of Mendocino.
9. The City shall request from the PAWW a yearly assessment of the condition of the city's
water system in general and a report on any circumstances or conditions that would limit water
connections in any area or zone for any reason.
10. New construction shall provide water conservation measures, and water conservation shall
be encouraged for all new development. Water conservation measures shall include low flow
water faucets, showerheads, and toilets for all new construction.
11. New developments shall be encouraged to use native plant species that are more drought
resistant for landscaping. New commercial development shall be required to use native species
for all landscaping.
12. New water wells shall minimize individual and cumulative adverse impacts on groundwater,
streams, springs, or seeps, and their associated riparian habitats.
13. The construction of a new water well may only be permitted where it will not have
significant adverse individual or cumulative impacts on groundwater, streams, or ESHA.
                                      VII. Health & Safety, Page 15
B. The following policies governing water quality shall apply:
Minimize Introduction of Pollutants and Increases in Runoff
1. Development shall be designed and managed to minimize the introduction of pollutants into
coastal waters (including the ocean, estuaries, wetlands, rivers, streams, and lakes) to the
maximum extent practicable.
2. Development shall be designed and managed to minimize increases in runoff volume and peak
runoff flow rate, to avoid detrimental water quality impacts caused by excessive erosion and
sedimentation.
3. Consistent with section 30230 and 30231 of the Coastal Act, development shall not result in
the degradation of coastal waters caused by the introduction of pollutants, or by changes to the
landscape that adversely impact the quality, quantity, and flow dynamics of coastal waters.
Development shall not discharge runoff in a manner that adversely impacts the biological
productivity and the quality of coastal waters appropriate to maintain optimum populations of
marine organisms and protect human health.
        Coastal Act Policies:
        30230. Marine resources shall be maintained, enhanced, and, where feasible, restored.
        Special protection shall be given to areas and species of special biological or economic
        significance. Uses of the marine environment shall be carried out in a manner that will
        sustain the biological productivity of coastal waters and that will maintain healthy
        populations of all species of marine organisms adequate for long-term commercial,
        recreational, scientific, and educational purposes.
        30231. The biological productivity and the quality of coastal waters, streams, wetlands,
        estuaries, and lakes appropriate to maintain optimum populations of marine organisms
        and for the protection of human health shall be maintained and, where feasible, restored
        through, among other means, minimizing adverse effects of waste water discharges and
        entrainment, controlling runoff, preventing depletion of ground water supplies and
        substantial interference with surface water flow, encouraging waste water reclamation,
        maintaining natural vegetation buffer areas that protect riparian habitats, and minimizing
        alteration of natural streams.
Incorporate Site Design and Source Control BMPs; add Treatment Control BMPs as Required
4. All development shall incorporate Site Design and Source Control Best Management
Practices (BMPs) to the maximum extent practicable, to minimize polluted runoff and water
quality impacts resulting from the development. BMPs shall be selected to mitigate both
construction-phase and post-construction water quality impacts. Where required (see 4.3),
structural Treatment Control BMPs shall supplement Site Design and Source Control BMPS as
necessary to protect coastal water quality.
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 16
The definitions of Site Design, Source Control, and Treatment Control BMPs are as follows:
Site Design BMPs: Project design features that reduce the generation of pollutants or reduce the
alteration of natural landscape features that protect water quality (e.g., minimizing impervious
surfaces, or minimizing grading).
Source Control BMPs: Practices that reduce the entrainment of pollutants in runoff (e.g.,
covering trash receptacles, or minimizing the use of landscaping chemicals and irrigation).
Treatment Control BMPs: Structural systems designed to remove pollutants from runoff (using
processes such as gravity settling, filtration, biological uptake, media adsorption, or any other
physical, chemical, biological process) and/or to reduce runoff volume and peak flow rates
(using systems such as grassy swales, infiltration basins, detention ponds, or dry wells).
5. The selection of appropriate BMPs to protect water quality shall be guided by the California
Stormwater Quality Association (CASQA) Stormwater BMP Handbooks dated January 2003 (or
the current edition), or an equivalent BMP manual that describes the type, location, size,
implementation, and maintenance of BMPs suitable to address the pollutants generated by the
development.
6. All development shall be evaluated by the City during the Coastal Development Permit (CDP)
review process for potential adverse impacts to water quality. The applicant shall submit
information that details how Site Design and Source Control BMPs will manage or mitigate
polluted runoff and water quality impacts resulting from the development, consistent with
Zoning Ordinance Section 5.33. These proposed measures shall be submitted for review and
approval as part of the CDP application, or prior to issuance of the CDP.
7. All Coastal Development Permit approvals shall include conditions requiring the continued
application, inspection, and maintenance of required BMPs as necessary to ensure their effective
operation for the life of the development.
Developments of Special Concern
8. Certain categories of development have a greater potential for adverse coastal water quality
impact, due to the development size, type of land use, or proximity to coastal waters. A
development in one or more of the following categories shall be considered a Development of
Special Concern, and shall be subject to additional requirements (see Policy 9, below) to protect
coastal water quality:
Developments of Special Concern:
    a. Housing development of ten units or more
    b. Hillside residential development on slopes > 20 percent (as indicated on the “Natural
    Hazards” Opportunities and Constraints Map)Industrial developments
                                      VII. Health & Safety, Page 17

    c. Commercial development if such development creates more than 5,000 square feet of
    impermeable surface or increases the impermeable surface on the property by more than 10%
    d. Retail gasoline outlet or automotive service facility
    e. Restaurant
    f. Parking lot of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surface area, or with 25 or more
    parking spaces
    g. Re-development project that results in the creation, addition, or replacement of 5,000
    square feet or more of impervious surface area on an already developed site, Commercial or
    industrial outdoor storage area
    h. All development within 200 feet of the Pacific Ocean, or of a stream or river (including
    Point Arena Creek and Hathaway Creek), or discharges directly to a surface water (including
    wetlands, streams, or other coastal waters), if such development creates more than 2,500
    square feet of impermeable surface or increases the impermeable surface on the property by
    more than 10% Development that discharges directly to the Pacific Ocean
9. All Developments of Special Concern (as identified in Policy 8, above) shall be subject to the
following three additional requirements to protect coastal water quality:
    a. The applicant for a Development of Special Concern shall be required to submit a Water
    Quality Management Plan (WQMP), certified by a California Registered Civil Engineer,
    estimating increases in pollutant loads and runoff flows resulting from the proposed
    development, and detailing the BMPs that will be implemented to minimize post-
    construction water quality impacts.
    b. If the combination of Site Design and Source Control BMPs proposed for a Development
    of Special Concern is not sufficient to protect water quality, structural Treatment Control
    BMPs shall also be required. The Treatment Control BMPs to be implemented will be
    specified in the WQMP.
Concern shall be sized according to the following numerical design standard:
Where structural BMPs are required for post-construction treatment of runoff, structural BMPs
(or suites of BMPs) shall be designed to treat, infiltrate, or filter the amount of stormwater runoff
produced by all storms up to and including the 85th percentile, 24-hour storm event for volume-
based BMPs, and/or the 85th percentile, 1-hour storm event (with an appropriate safety factor of
2 or greater) for flow-based BMPs.
10. In addition to all other applicable water quality requirements, developments with land use
activities that have a high potential for generating pollutants shall be required to incorporate
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 18
BMPs to address the particular pollutants of concern. For example:
  a) Require parking lots to incorporate BMPs to minimize runoff of oil, grease, car battery
  acid, coolant, gasoline, sediments, trash, and other pollutants to receiving waters.
  b) Require commercial developments to incorporate BMPs to minimize polluted runoff from
  structures, landscaping, parking areas, repair and maintenance areas, loading /unloading
  areas, and vehicle/equipment wash areas.
  c) Require automotive service stations, car washes, and vehicle repair facilities to incorporate
  BMPs to minimize runoff of oil, grease, solvents, car battery acid, coolant, gasoline, and
  other pollutants to the stormwater conveyance system from areas including fueling areas,
  repair and maintenance areas, loading/unloading areas, and vehicle/equipment wash areas.
  d) Require restaurants to incorporate BMPs to minimize runoff of oil, grease, solvents,
  phosphates, suspended solids, and other pollutants.
  e) Require outdoor material storage areas to be designed (e.g., with a roof or awning cover)
  to minimize runoff of toxic compounds, oil and grease, heavy metals, nutrients, suspended
  solids, and other pollutants.
  f) Require roof or awning covers over trash storage areas to minimize off-site transport of
  trash and other pollutants.
                                    VII. Health & Safety, Page 19
Other Land Use Activities
11. New development shall be encouraged to use drought-resistant native plant species for
landscaping, to reduce the need for irrigation and landscaping chemicals (e.g., pesticides and
fertilizers), and thus reduce polluted runoff. New commercial development shall be required to
use native plant species for all landscaping.
12. Development shall be sited and designed to avoid, where feasible, construction on areas
particularly susceptible to erosion, such as steep slopes. Development in these areas shall
incorporate both construction and post-construction BMPs to reduce erosion and sedimentation.
Municipal Activities
13. The City should promote both the protection of good water quality and the restoration of
impaired water quality. Water quality degradation can result from a variety of factors, including
but not limited to the introduction of pollutants, increase in runoff discharge rate, generation of
dry weather runoff, and alteration of physical, chemical, or biological features of the landscape.
14. The City should encourage and support public outreach and education regarding the water
quality impacts of development. The City shall coordinate with other agencies in the watershed
area, as feasible, to develop public education programs on urban runoff issues and the
appropriate roles of individuals, businesses, and government in the implementation of BMPs for
pollution prevention.
15. Storm drain stenciling or signage shall be provided for all new storm drain construction, to
discourage dumping and other illicit discharges into the stormwater conveyance system.
16. The city should ensure that municipal maintenance activities and other public projects not
requiring a Coastal Development Permit also integrate appropriate water quality BMPs.
17. Development shall be sited and designed to preserve the infiltration, purification, and
retention functions of natural drainage systems that exist on the site, to the maximum extent
practicable.
18. Drainage conveyed from the developed area of the site shall be conveyed in a non-erosive
manner, to protect downstream areas from erosion and sedimentation.
19. Development shall be sited and designed to comply with the following principles to help
protect water quality:
    a) Protect areas that provide important water quality benefits, areas necessary to maintain
    riparian and aquatic biota, and/or that are susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
    b) Analyze the natural resources and hazardous constraints of planning areas and individual
    development sites to determine locations most suitable for development;
                                      VII. Health & Safety, Page 20
     c) Preserve and protect riparian corridors, creek channels, wetlands, and buffer zones;
     d) Minimize disturbance of natural areas, including significant trees, native vegetation, and
     root structures;
     e) Ensure adequate setbacks from creeks, wetlands, Pacific Ocean, and other surface waters;
     f) Promote clustering of development on the most suitable portions of a site, taking into
     account geologic constraints, sensitive resources, and natural drainage features.
Minimize Impervious Surfaces
20. New development shall minimize the creation of impervious surfaces, especially directly
connected impervious areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Redevelopment shall increase
the area of pervious surfaces, where feasible.
21. The City shall promote the use of permeable pavement materials and techniques (e.g., paving
blocks, porous asphalt, and permeable concrete).
Infiltrate Runoff
22. To the maximum extent practicable, development shall maximize on-site infiltration of
runoff (to preserve natural hydrologic conditions, recharge groundwater, and prevent transport of
pollutants), except where site conditions preclude infiltration (e.g., where geologic instability
would be exacerbated, or pollutant concentrations are high). In developments where infiltration
is precluded, appropriate Treatment Control BMPs such as filtration shall be implemented to
reduce the discharge of polluted runoff. Single family residences are excluded from the
requirement for treatment control BMPs where infiltration is precluded, unless the development
is a Development of Special Concern.
23. Development shall divert runoff resulting from new impervious surfaces into landscaped
areas or permeable surface areas, wherever feasible, to increase onsite infiltration and attenuate
runoff.
24. To the maximum extent practicable, development shall limit the use of curb drains to avoid
conveying runoff directly to the City’s stormwater conveyance system.
Minimize Polluted Runoff from Construction
25. Development shall minimize erosion, sedimentation, and other polluted runoff from
construction-related activities, to the maximum extent practicable.
26. All development shall address construction-phase erosion and sedimentation, as well as other
potential pollutants from construction sites (e.g., paint, solvents, vehicle fluids, and debris). Such
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 21

measures shall include controls on timing of grading, BMPs for storage and disposal of
construction materials, and/or design specifications for sedimentation basins.
27. Grading shall be prohibited during the rainy season (from October through April) in areas
with slopes of 20 percent or greater (as indicated on the “Natural Hazards” Opportunities and
Constraints Map), except in response to emergencies.
Minimize Land Disturbance During Construction
28. Construction shall minimize land disturbance activities (e.g., clearing, grading, and cut-and-
fill), especially in erosive areas (including steep slopes, unstable areas, and in erosive soils), to
minimize the water quality impacts of excessive erosion and sedimentation.
29. Construction shall minimize disturbance of natural vegetation (including significant trees,
native vegetation, and root structures), and other physical or biological features important for
preventing erosion and sedimentation.
30. Development shall incorporate soil stabilization BMPs on disturbed areas as soon as feasible,
including, but not limited to, revegetation of graded or disturbed areas.
7. SEWAGE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL POLICIES
The city's sewage collection and disposal system is owned and operated by the City of Point
Arena. Sewer lines serve most of the existing developed area. The treatment includes aerated
pond treatment, and chlorination, and percolation and evaporation for disposal. Areas not served
are accommodated by individual septic tank systems.
A wastewater system capacity analysis was completed in January of 1996 by Bonneau Dickson,
P.E. This study used buildout figures from density and Zoning allowed by this General Plan and
it determined that: "The City of Point Arena wastewater system has adequate capacity to handle
and treat the highest foreseeable flows and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) loads that will be
generated under the current General Plan, with the following exceptions:
1. The Capacity of the existing percolation ponds has been reached. It is extremely important to
acquire additional area for percolation as soon as practicable.
2. Some parts of the sewer system might become hydraulically overloaded at some point in the
future.
3. Slightly larger aerators might be needed in the distant future.
The average flows to the system, which currently are just under 30,000 gallons per day (GPD) in
dry weather, are not important. The capacity of the system is limited not by the average flows
but by the peak flows, which are occasionally 20 to 30 times higher than the average dry weather
flows. Similarly, the ability of the plant to treat BOD does not impose a limit on the capacity of
                                        VII. Health & Safety, Page 22

the system. At worst, slightly larger aerators will have to be purchased as the existing units wear
out. Earlier analyses of the capacity of the City's wastewater system which were based on
average flows or BOD loads are not relevant.
The capacity of the sewer system is determined by the peak instantaneous flow that it will pass
and will become inadequate only when there is an overflow from the system. The sewer system
has never been known to overflow due to a lack of hydraulic capacity although some lines may
have been close to their hydraulic capacities during the winter of 1995, at which time an
instantaneous peak flow of 980,000 GPD was noted it is very difficult to predict the future
maximum instantaneous peak flow. It may increase very little as new connections are made to
the sewer system because the system may already be leaking at the maximum rate possible.
Sustained peak flows are caused by infiltration rather than by inflow into the sewer system, i.e.
by leakage of ground water through many small places in the sewer system rather than by
relatively large openings that allow stormwater to flow directly into the sewer system. There is
unlikely to be any single leak that accounts for a large percentage of the total leakage, instead of
the small leaks that are probably occurring in a large number of places. Correcting infiltration is
very expensive because only a small amount of leakage is stopped by each repair.
Most of the leakage into the sewer system probably is coming from house laterals.
Approximately two-thirds of the sewer mains were slip lined in the early 1980's and most of the
manholes were replaced at that time. By contrast to the relatively new sewer mains, many of the
sewer laterals were built in the 1930s, when materials and construction methods were not nearly
as advanced as they are today.
It is less costly and more certain to expand the percolation facilities than to undertake a large
scale, general improvement of the sewer system."
The recommended improvements and activities and the recommended capital improvements of
the Bonneau Dickson study have been accomplished or are incorporated into the polices below.
The following policies and programs shall apply:
1. The City shall take immediate steps to expand percolation capacity to accommodate sustained
peak flows. This is of highest priority.
2. In order to protect ground water resources, all new development of more than one dwelling
unit per acre of land will be required to connect to the municipal sewer system.
3. No sewer service may be extended to lands zoned Agriculture Exclusive-AE or to areas
outside the "urban limit line".
4. All buildings that generate waste water must be connected with the sewer system if said
buildings are within 100 feet of the system, or if said buildings are on a parcel less than one acre
in size that is within 100 feet of the system.
                                       VII. Health & Safety, Page 23
5. New private disposal systems shall not be permitted within the city, except those authorized
by the City Council.
6. Improvements and or expansions to collection and treatment facilities that are necessitated by
new development shall be financed all or in part by development fees.
7. The City should require that all future development also pay appropriate impact fees to
finance the installation of adequate storm drainage infrastructure.
8. To reduce the sewage collection infiltration problem, and to further expand wet-weather
sewage treatment capacity, the City should continue applying a testing and repair program to the
sewage collection system.
9. The City should consider establishing a "sewer impact fee" that would replace the present
"connection fee" (City Ordinance # 143). This fee shall be charged per ESD per connection and
should be established by ordinance in connection with the actual cost of facilities replacement,
repair, and maintenance to serve the use.
10. The City shall adopt an ordinance which requires that sewer laterals be tested when a
building is sold and that leaky laterals be repaired or replaced and that adequate cleanouts be
installed.
11. The City shall adopt a "capital improvement program" upon completion of the capacity and
facilities study.
12. As a precautionary measure, when the population reaches 50% of projected buildout or in 50
years, whichever comes first, the City shall review sewer capacity to insure continue ability to
meet waste water needs through buildout.
13. The City will require that the costs of sewer extensions and hookups for new developments
be borne by the customer.
14. The City shall establish a protocol for visually observing the flows in various branches of
the sewer system so that this information will be available for future sewer system analyses.
15. The City shall measure and map the depth of solids in the aeration basins on a yearly basis
to determine rate of increase and estimate when solids will need to be removed. Test solids to
help estimate cost of solids removal.
16. All sewer improvement programs shall conform with the provisions of the environmentally
sensitive habitat areas (ESHA) policies, including but not limited to the riparian buffer zone for
Point Arena Creek.
8. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS POLICIES
                                      VII. Health & Safety, Page 24
Emergency preparedness is a term used in this general plan to refer to emergency medical and
rescue services and police protection, and to disaster preparedness. Fire protection planning is
addressed elsewhere in this element. Defense against catastrophes combines emergency
response capabilities with policies and programs to minimize hazards. Minimizing hazards
through planning is the principal focus of this element.
To prepare for emergencies the City shall accomplish the following:
1. The city shall update as necessary and maintain its disaster response plan.
2. The city shall prepare a specific earthquake preparedness plan and implementation program
to deal specifically with preparation for and responses during an earthquake.
3. The City shall ensure continued fire and rescue services to the citizens of Point Arena through
a joint powers agreement with the Redwood Coast Fire Protection District. City shall require all
new developments to be in conformance with Uniform Fire Code.
4. The City shall establish an emergency alternative north-south route through or just outside of
Point Arena.
5. Highway 1 leading north and south out of town, Riverside Drive, and Windy Hollow Road
should be designated as the only available evacuation routes in case of an emergency.
9. POLICIES AND PROGRAMS GOVERNING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
To protect citizens and visitors alike the following policies shall apply:
1. No hazardous waste dumps or incinerators will be allowed in the city.
2. The City shall work with the appropriate local, state and federal agencies to determine the
extent of existing toxic waste sites. As of July, 1992, the California Environmental Protection
Agency, Office of Environmental Information, has produced the following list of "Identified
Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites:
    a.  170 Main Street
    b.  185 Main Street
    c.  720 Port Road
    d.  44900 Port Road
    e.  415 School Street
All of the sites are listed for having leaking underground fuel storage tanks.
3. The City shall consider adopting a policy governing the transport of toxic and hazardous
materials through town on local streets and on Highway 1.

                                       VIII. NOISE ELEMENT
1. BACKGROUND AND FINDINGS: GENERAL
The intent of the Noise Element is to provide a framework for evaluating sound in the
community, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and to set forth noise reduction or noise
suppression policies and programs. This is done by describing the current local environment of
sounds, identifying and measuring local noise sources, identifying and mapping noise-sensitive
land uses, projecting future noise levels, and prescribing policies and programs for achieving the
city's noise-control goals. The objectives are to minimize exposure of local citizens to excessive
noise and to preserve the unique low-ambient noise levels of the Point Arena soundscape.
Point Arena is characterized by its citizens as a quiet town. It is a small rural community, with
sound levels at different locations inside the city limits ranging from very quiet to moderately
loud.
In this predominantly quiet environment are the following esteemed features of the local
soundscape: the sound of winter storm surf rolling up from Arena Cove; the tolling of the off-
shore bell buoy; a rich variety of birdsong; the lowing cattle in nearby pastures; water flowing
over rocks in Arena Creek; the peal of morning Church bells; the immediacy and personal
involvement of emergency sirens from ambulances and fire trucks.
Of course, there are also some unpleasant noises: heavy truck traffic noises on Highway 1 in
particular, and along Riverside Drive, unattended barking dogs, and, at times, noises emanating
from the industrial area.
The small, quiet nature of the town produces a low level of sound measurement (technically
described as "low ambient noise level"), which, in turn, makes it noticeably susceptible to
incremental increases in sound levels. Point Arena citizens appreciate and enjoy this very low
ambient sound level, which compares very favorably to most urban areas.
It is so quiet at night that the loudest sound is the surf at Arena Cove, which is approximately
one mile from Downtown. The most prominent sources of noticeable noise are the Highway 1
corridor (Main Street and School Street), truck traffic on Riverside Drive, and the industrial site
on Riverside Drive east of Downtown. The only other notable source of noise is the sound made
by people congregating at night along Main Street where the theater and several restaurants are
located. Noise from bands/ jukeboxes can be heard when bar doors are opened. In many other
communities such noises would not be significant, but they are noticeable in Point Arena
primarily because the night-time background noise level is quite low (approximately 20-25
dBA).
In this context, individual sounds or noises have greater contrast, and as ambient levels rise, the
quieter features of the soundscape are lost. The local soundscape characterized by a low ambient
noise level should be viewed as a public resource to be preserved.
                                            VIII. Noise, Page 1
2. BACKGROUND AND FINDINGS: DEFINITIONS AND MEASUREMENTS
2.1. Introduction
State of California noise guidelines require that noise contours depicting major noise sources be
in terms of Ldn or CNEL (See definitions in the Glossary), which impose a 10dB "penalty" on
sound levels between the hours of 10PM and 7AM. The reason for this is to account for the fact
that noise at night can be more noticeable and bothersome. 10dB is generally accepted to be the
average difference between day and night levels. However, Point Arena has a much wider
spread between day and night levels. And, while Ldn is useful to describe some aspects of noise
levels in the city, it gives a distorted view as to the actual sound level experienced by the area's
residents. Therefore, Ldn measurements must be taken over a twenty-four hour period, or use
must be made of a noise model that matches Point Arena's low night-time sound levels.
Moreover, seasonal factors contribute to the annual average of sound levels in the city, including
tourist traffic on Highway 1 during the spring, summer and fall, and on some long holiday
weekends, and truck traffic at Arena Cove, and logging traffic on Riverside Drive and Highway
1.
State noise guidelines allow and encourage local jurisdictions to employ considerable flexibility
in describing a local situation in order to more fully quantify local sound levels. Two different
units of measurement are used. First, noise contours are to be shown in terms of Ldn. Second,
where appropriate, Leq is to be used to better quantify the true noise levels. (Definitions of the
terms used in this element are located in the Glossary of the General Plan).
2.2. Noise Sources and Existing Measurements
Specific identifiable sources of noise in Point Arena are shown in part on the noise contour map
(located at the end of this element) and additionally are listed in the table below. Noise contours
are intended to illustrate the general location and extent of projected future noise levels.
The most prominent sources of noise in Point Arena are:
1. Traffic on Highway 1, including along Main Street
2. Heavy truck traffic on Highway 1 and Riverside Drive
3. Operations at the BedRock industrial facility
4. Compressor noise from the refrigerator trucks at Arena Cove
5. Barking dogs, especially on Mill Street and EastwoodDrive
6. Jet aircraft overhead.

Noise Element sub-committee, using a County of
Mendocino noise meter
2.3. Noise-Sensitive Areas: Existing and Future
The following are the areas where the impact of noise generated off site can be expected to be
the most severe:
1. In existing and future single-family and multiple-family areas
2. At school and church sites
                                              VIII. Noise, Page 3
3. At the Point Arena Medical Center on Mill Street
4. At similar areas and sites where the absence of noise is essential to the health and welfare of
the residents or occupants.
Various conditions affecting future noise levels and noise contours in Point Arena include the
following:
1. Possible reduced logging truck traffic due to a decline in the logging industry
2. Increased tourist traffic on Highway 1
3. Increased residential development, especially in the newly-annexed area east of Downtown
4. Increased truck traffic and other activities associated with development of the city's industrial
area and of Arena Cove.
The noise contour map for the noise element, which appears at the end of this element ("Noise
Contours Based on General Plan Buildout", prepared by Earth Metrics) shows "worst case"
projected levels for the next 5-10 years. The increase in noise levels along the Highway 1
corridor are estimated to increase 2-3 dB (Ldn) in the next 5-10 years. The city's residential
areas, as they get built up, are not expected to generate any significant increase in ambient noise
levels.
3. NOISE CONTROL GOALS
1. To preserve low ambient noise levels in residential neighborhoods, especially at night (8PM -
7AM)
2. To protect existing developed areas from excessive noise levels
3. To encourage low-noise commercial and industrial developments
4. To implement planning and zoning regulations that will guard against the loss of the low
ambient sound levels, especially at night
5. To implement and enforce the State of California Noise Insulation Standards for all new
developments.
                                           VIII. Noise, Page 4
4. NOISE CONTROL POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
1. Noise levels shall not be permitted to exceed 60 Leq(1)
anywhere within the community.
2. The City may require an acoustical report for new multi- family dwellings within the 60dB
(Ldn) noise exposure contour, as required by Title 25 of the California Administrative
Code-Noise Insulation Standards.
3. New development in all zones must not raise the ambient noise levels in any residential zone
within the city. Where residential zoning is adjacent to other zones, the lower residential noise
limits will apply.
4. New developments in commercial and industrial zones shall be designed, sited and screened
in such a way as to avoid or suppress noise and the impact of any noise on existing and proposed
residential settings; and, noise buffers (walls, trees, landscaping, open spaces, berms, other
buildings) between industrial/commercial activities and residential and other noise-sensitive
activities shall be required as a condition of development permits.
5. No noise-generating industries shall be allowed to operate between the hours of 8 p.m. and 7
a.m.
6. A city noise ordinance based on Leq and Lmax noise measurements for day and night, and
based on and capable of implementing the above goals and policies, shall be enacted, and shall
conform to the requirements of State law and State noise guidelines. Exemptions should be
made for temporary construction and repair activities, and for emergencies.
7. The following Leq and Lmax noise limits shall be incorporated into said ordinance:
Daytime limits: (7AM - 8PM)
Residential: 50 Leq(1) at the property line of the property within which the noise generated is
              located, 80dB (Lmax) at the source
Commercial: 60 Leq(1) at the property line 80dB (Lmax) at the source
Industrial: 60 Leq(1) at the property line 90dB (Lmax) at the source
Night-time limits: (8PM - 7AM)
Residential: 25 Leq(1) at the property line 60Db (Lmax) at the source
Commercial: 30 Leq(1) at the property line 60dB (Lmax) at the source
Industrial: 30 Leq(1) at the property line 60dB(Lmax) at the source
Note 1: Leq(1) denotes average sound level for one hour.
Note 2: "at the property line" shall be interpreted to mean "at the property line or at reasonable
and sensitive receptors such as residences, schools, churches, hospitals and other similar
commercial and residential receptors which are deemed appropriate."
8. To mitigate exterior sound levels, due to transportation or other sources, for new residential
                                           VIII. Noise, Page 5
or other new projects, consideration shall be given to an increased setback distance; use of
property line, patio, and deck barriers; orientation of buildings to achieve a sound shielding
benefit at outdoor use areas.
9. To mitigate interior sound levels, due to transportation or other sources, for new residential or
other new projects, consideration shall be given to an increased setback distance and use of
barriers, insulation measures applied to the building skins, including appropriate designs for
windows, walls, doors, roof/ceiling assemblies, weather seals, and other components.
Vegetative barriers do not generally provide substantial reductions in noise levels.
10. The City will consider the following measures which can be used to mitigate the sound
impacts created at residential or other sensitive receptors as a result of equipment operations or
other activities at industrial and commercial facilities:
    a. Use buffer zones of open space or "intermediate" type uses. It is desirable, where
    feasible, to allow at least 200 feet between noisy industrial or commercial sites and
    residential or other sensitive land uses. Noisy buildings or other noisy facilities shall be well
    set back from the property line.
    b. The City shall require noise studies for potentially noisy facilities which are to be located
    near sensitive land uses. Industrial and commercial uses likely to create adverse noise
    impacts include fuel distribution centers served by rail or truck, truck terminals, new or
    expansion of gravel Batch plants and concrete manufacturing plants, construction activities if
    hammering is involved and is done outdoors, and animal kennels. Commercial facilities
    likely to create adverse noise impacts include automobile repair shops, body shops, and
    heavy equipment rental shops; car washes; drive-in restaurants; and supermarkets and other
    facilities with rooftop equipment and truck deliveries.
    c. The public shall be notified of the proposed placing of noisy industrial or commercial
    facilities in proximity to sensitive uses and vice versa.
    d. Noise studies shall be required for any new industrial use that will generate more than five
    truck trips per daytime hour, any heavy truck traffic during nighttime hours, or more than 25
    trucks in 24 hours. A Noise Ordinance including both quantitative limits and nuisance
    provisions shall be enacted.
    e. All truck loading bays shall be located such that they do not open to the direction where
    sensitive receptors are located.
    f. As far as feasible, truck and loading dock operations near residential receptors shall be
    limited to the daylight hours.
    g. Buffer zones setbacks and/or sound attenuation devices such as landscaped berms shall be
    interposed between residential and commercial uses and between residential and industrial
    uses, especially those that are likely to be noisy, as described above.
                                            VIII. Noise, Page 6
   h. Rooftop and other mechanical equipment shall be shielded, enclosed, silenced, or setback
   an appropriate distance from the property line. The shielding could be accomplished by
   either appropriate siting of buildings or appropriate fences or walls.
   i. Large exterior pipes or ducts in some cases may need to be shielded, enclosed, or lagged.
   j. In some cases, insulation measures may be needed for industrial buildings.
11. Proposals for uses associated with industrial and commercial development should include
appropriate designs for walls, roof/ ceilings, doors, windows, vent silencers, interior absorption,
and other components. Doors and windows shall be provided with effective weather seals.
   a. Trucks idling times shall be limited where feasible. Where personal radios are used, the
   volume shall be controlled as far as feasible.
   b. Where paging systems are required, they shall be designed to minimize "spillover" sound
   to sensitive receptor properties.

1. INTRODUCTION
This is an update and amendment to the "Housing Element" adopted by the Point Arena City
Council on September 10th, 1985, and is one of the elements of the City's 1994 General Plan.
Housing is one of the seven "elements" of the general plan every California city and county is
required by state law to prepare. State law also requires that all housing elements must be
updated not less than every five years.
A housing element must include "...an identification and analysis of existing and projected
housing needs and a statement of goals, qualified objectives, and scheduled programs for the
presentation, improvement and development of housing."
A major objective of state housing law and the housing element preparation requirement is to
encourage each city and county to do its "fair share" in providing for the housing needs of the
state, particularly the needs of low and moderate-income persons and families.
This updated housing element has been prepared according to the guidelines issued by the
California State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). At the time of
preparation of this Element, the available data from the 1990 U.S. census was incomplete.
Forecasts by the State Department of Housing and Mendocino County have been used, where
possible and appropriate, to update the 1980 census data. Because Point Arena is quite small in
population and area, it has been possible to provide accurate current information, perhaps in
some instances even more accurate than the 1990 census data. In general, there have been few
significant changes in the overall population characteristics of Point Arena since the adoption of
the Housing Element in 1985.
2. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
Particular attention has been given in this revision to the implications of the goals and policies
for Point Arena currently being discussed by Point Arena citizens and elected officials who have
participated in the preparation of a Point Arena General Plan. Because the Housing Element
revision has been part of the general plan preparation, there have been many opportunities for
interested citizens to participate in the formulation of housing goals and objectives and,
therefore, to understand the stated objectives and programs of this Housing Element. A twelve-
member citizen's committee appointed by the City Council participated in the initial and final
stages of preparation of the Element. This committee, which is a sub-committee of a larger
citizens' committee for preparation of a general plan, will continue to function on behalf of the
Council to monitor progress on the housing plan and program for Point Arena (Also see
Appendix A).
                                            IX. Housing, Page 1
A series of public hearings were held prior to the adoption of the General Plan and this Housing
Element. Copies of the proposed General Plan and Housing Element were made available to all
interested parties upon request and notices were posted of the availability of copies at City Hall.
A cross section of Pt. Arena residents attended the hearings. Comments and testimony at the
hearings were predominantly expressions of concern or questions about the implications of the
land use categories, preservation of open space, and conservation of resources. The Housing
Element is intended to be an integral part of the new General Plan.
3. POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
The official (1990 census) population of Point Arena is 407, a decline of 18 persons since 1980.
Table I is a summary of certain characteristics of the current population. Based upon the data
available thus far, the 1990 population is similar to the 1980 population in several respects:
a)  Predominantly White (94%);
b)  Predominantly young (more than one half under 40 years of age);
c)  Majority (65%) lives in rented housing units;
d)  Majority of households consists of families (105 of 175 households).
e)  Approximately 20% of the population is "below poverty status".
As more data becomes available, it can be determined in what respects the population
characteristics have changed. As noted in the introduction, by observation, there have been few,
if any, major changes in the composition of the population since 1980. The employment
situation has changed somewhat and the housing situation has changed (improved) considerably.
 These topics will be discussed in the section which follows.

4. HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
4.1. Housing Supply
According to the 1990 census figures, Point Arena has lost not only population but housing units
since 1980. Part of this "loss" can be easily explained: There are 22 fewer mobile homes in
Point Arena in 1990 than in l980. By actual count, Point Arena has 215 housing units of all
types, compared to the 196 in the 1990 census count.* While there has been a reduction in
single-family units there has been a substantial increase in multifamily units. This increase is
largely due to a concerted effort by Point Arena since 1985 to increase the supply of multi-
family units. Table II is a compilation of residential building and demolition permits issued in
Point Arena since 1986 (following the 1985 adoption of the Housing Element). The principal
"subtraction" from the housing stock has been the closing out of a mobile home park at Arena
Cove. The relevance of mobile homes to housing needs is discussed in a following section
(Housing Needs).

4.2. Composition
As shown in Table III, the majority of housing units in Point Arena are in single-family type
structures. As previously noted, the majority of residents in Point Arena are renters and, in 1980,
more than one half of the single family structures were occupied by renters. Although
corresponding 1990 figures are not yet available, field observations and deductions from other
data supports the conclusion that much of the single-family housing supply remains in absentee
ownership, as was true in 1980. Also, there continue to be 4-6 structures "off the market", held
for occasional use by the owners.
Mobile homes no longer constitute a significant supply of housing in Point, Arena, although the
potential remains. The 1990 census indicates 17 mobile homes, while a field survey in June,
1991, lists only 6 (Table III).

4.3. Tenure
As previously noted, the majority (65%) of the Point Arena population live in rented (non-
owner) housing units. A large number (137/34%) live in single-family structures. The 1990
pattern for occupancy in tenure of persons per unit and persons per room is similar to the 1980
pattern (Table IV). Although it is difficult to extract any meaningful measure from the available
data, it appears that the trend is toward higher density (persons) per unit.

4.4. Vacancy Rate
The l990 census records 21 vacancies of the total housing units (11%). State Department of
Finance projections for 1991 indicate a vacancy rate of 10.71%, the highest for a city in
Mendocino County (Table V). In fact, a field survey in June, 1991, indicated 10 vacant units,
but these were badly in need of repair or beyond repair. If these units were to be subtracted from
the supply of available housing, Point Arena would have a "O" vacancy rate which would
indicate a shortage of available housing. However, the majority of available rental housing
supply is detached single-family residences. The vacancy rate for detached, single-family
houses is normally less than the vacancy rate for multi-unit structures.

4.5. Overcrowding
The U.S. Census Bureau defines overcrowding as more than one person per room in a housing
unit. While overcrowding is not a significant problem in Point Arena, overcrowding has
increased from 7 units in 1980 to 16 units in 1990 (Table IV). This trend toward overcrowding
is addressed in a following section, "Housing Needs".
4.6. Unit Size
In 1980, nearly two thirds of the housing units had 3 or more rooms. This proportion remains
true in 1990 (Table IV), which is not surprising since much of the available housing is single--
family dwellings.
                                             IX. Housing, Page 7
4.7. Housing Condition
A 100% survey conducted in Point Arena in l984 revealed that nearly one half of the residential
structures were substandard and in need of major repairs. A field survey conducted in June,
1991, indicated a substantial improvement in residential housing conditions; only 19% of the
structures were classified as substandard (Table VI). When more complete 1990 census data for
housing is available it can be compared to the 1991 field survey. Clearly, however, the overall
condition of the housing stock has improved since 1984. This improvement is accounted for
partially by the building permits issued since 1986 (Table II), some of which were for major
repairs and rehabilitation. Another factor contributing to the decrease in substandard units since
1984 is the reduction (by moving) of a number of mobilehomes, which were in substandard
condition.

NOTE: Total number differs from 1984 & 1991 State Department of Finance projections based
upon the 1980 census; total units in 1980 was 223. It is not known if the same criteria (measure)
of "standard" and "substandard" were used in the 1984 and l991 surveys.
4.8. Housing Costs
In 1980, the median value of a housing unit in Point Arena was $55,500 compared to $69,800 for
Mendocino County. According to the 1990 census, the median value for Point Arena in 1990
was $91,200 and $123,900 for Mendocino County (Specified Owner-Occupied Housing Units,
1990 Census).

                                               IX. Housing, Page 8
The current monthly costs to finance and maintain a house selling for $91,200 are
approximately:
Assume a Mortgage for 80% of selling price @ 10% interest:
Mortgage Payment               $650
Utilities                      $200
Taxes/Insurance                $125
Total Monthly Costs            $975
In terms of "affordability," if the above figure represented 25% of gross monthly income, an
annual income of $46,800 would be required to "afford" the median priced house.
"Affordability" is discussed in the next section.
4.9. Renter Occupied
The median monthly rent in 1980 was estimated to be $119; in 1990 the median monthly rent
was estimated to be $318 for specified (selected) units. These figures are subject to adjustment
when all census data becomes available. However, a survey of local realtors indicates that $500
per month is considered to be the "high end" of the current rental market and that $350-$400 per
month, not including utilities, is more typical. Using S375, plus $150 for utilities as a "typical"
monthly rent, a person would need a monthly income of $2,100 to "afford" the rent and utilities
using the standard of 25% of income as the maximum amount "affordable" for housing.
The median monthly rent in Point Arena was approximately $66 less than the median for
Mendocino County as a whole (Table VII).
4.10. Affordability
"Overpayment for rent, mortgage payments and other housing costs is one criteria for
determining housing "needs" in a defined jurisdiction, such as Point Arena. State agencies have
used 25% of monthly income as the maximum a household should be paying for monthly
housing costs. Paying more than this amount is considered "overpayment" and, therefore, "not
affordable". Federal agencies now use 30% as the criteria, in some instances.
In 1980, more than one half (213) of Point Arena residents could not afford to buy the median
priced house while a third (142) could not afford the median rent (Point Arena Housing Element
P-III-36; affordability = 25% of monthly income).
Census figures for 1989 indicate 6 owner households paying between 25% and 30% of income
for housing costs and 8 owner households paying more than 35% of income for housing costs.
Of the renters, 12 households were paying between 25% and 30% and 55 households were
paying 35% or more of their income for rent. (H50/59, Selected Monthly Owner/Renter Costs).
These figures indicate that 81 Point Arena residents are "overpaying" for monthly housing costs
and that a large proportion of Point Arena households cannot afford to buy a median-priced
house.
                                          IX. Housing, Page 9
The housing "needs" projected by Mendocino County (Table VIII) were based upon
"multipliers", i.e., a percentage of the 1980 Census income categories. In the "very low"
category the multiplier was 1.08, indicating a projected increase (8%) of persons in the "very
low" income category. In "other lower" and "moderate" the increases were .94 and .87,
respectively, indicating a decreasing number in these categories.

5. HOUSING NEEDS
This section identifies Point Arena's need for housing based upon regional (county) demand,
current affordability, termination or depletion of existing subsidized units, and special needs
such as elderly, handicapped, large households and households headed by single females.
5.1. Regional Housing Needs Determination
To assist local governments in Mendocino County in making projections of future housing
needs, the Mendocino County Council of Governments has prepared a Mendocino County
Housing Needs Plan (June, 1991). The projection for the County has been reproduced in its
entirety for comparison with other cities in the County (Table VIII). For Point Arena, the
projections of households by income group is as follows:

The projection, which is based upon a State Department of Finance projection of County-wide
growth, indicates a decreasing number of households over the next five-year period. The
projection is consistent with the actual decline in households since 1980; however, the 1990
census records a larger number of households for Point Arena than the projection indicates (175
compared with 166).

FAIR SHARE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION NEEDS, 1991-1996:                         25 Units.
The projection of "construction needs" based upon the projected households was initially "0" units
(Draft Mendocino County Housing Needs Plan, April, 1991). However, because Point Arena has
recently annexed 156 acres of land, much of it suitable for residential development, Point Arena
has accepted 25 units of the projected basic construction needs of the County over the next 5
years. By income levels, the need is as follows:
         Very Low           12
         Other Low          2
         Moderate           4
         Above Moderate     7
5.2. Special Housing Needs
Low Income: The Mendocino County projections for housing needs indicate a large percentage of
Point Arena households in the "very low" income category (48%, Table VIII). For some, low
income is a temporary situation because of the current California high unemployment rate. For
others, low or very low income is a prospect for the future. According to current census figures in
1989, 40 households had some form of public assistance, 39 had retirement income, 49 had social
security and 16 had no earnings (Table V111-A). Currently 57 families are receiving food stamps.
In terms of housing and supply and ability to pay, it is not possible, from the figures available, to
make any direct correlations between the persons in the above categories and housing "need". In
terms of overpayment for rent or monthly housing costs, it is safe to assume that a larger supply
of affordable housing for low and very low-income persons is a "need" in Point Arena.
According to the 199O census, between 60 and 70 persons were "overpaying" for monthly
housing costs in 1989 (page 16). How many of these are temporarily in this condition cannot be
determined. Although a direct correlation cannot be made from the above statistics, the
Mendocino County projection of 80 persons in the "very low" income category is probably
realistic (page 18). The 1990 census record 81 persons in the "below poverty category in 1989
(Summary Tape File 3, page 117).

5.3. Female Head of Household
Preliminary census data indicates that there continues to be a relatively large number (19) of
female-headed households in Point Arena (11% of households, Table I), slightly less than in
1980 (13%). Of these, 14 have one or more children present and have incomes below poverty
level (1990 Census, Summary Tape, File 3, page 126).
All of these households currently receive some assistance from County and State sources. As
such assistance is cut back or becomes more restricted, as has been the trend since the mid-
1980's, it will become increasingly difficult for these households to pay the increasing costs of
food and shelter.
                                         IX. Housing, Page 14
5.4. Large Households
Comparatively, there are few large households in Point Arena. Only 14 housing units housed 5
or more persons (1990 Census, Summary Tape, File 1, H-17). Data is not available on the
number of large households with "low" or "very low" incomes. In terms of housing supply,
Point Arena has 47 units with 5 rooms, 19 with 6 rooms and 18 with 7 or more rooms (Summary
Tape File 1, H-13).
5.5. Homeless
Currently, the problem of homelessness in Point Arena is limited in comparison to most other
California cities. Occasionally, there are transient persons in emergency situations who need
temporary shelter. There are no permanent transit or transitional housing facilities in Point
Arena. In the past, local churches have provided temporary shelter and funds to persons seeking
help, including transportation to agencies that offer more extended assistance. Usually, referral
is made to the Mendocino County Social Services Department, which can provide some
assistance through the AFDC program.
As long as the local churches provide some emergency service and referral information, the
occasional need for emergency shelter and services can be met. If the problem becomes
perennial, as in some cities, a more permanent solution must be found.
In the General Plan, transitional housing and emergency shelters are permitted in the
Commercial (C) and Highway Commercial (HWC) zones. Provisions for conditional use will be
incorporated in the revision to the Zoning Ordinance to be completed in 1994.
5.6. Handicapped/Elderly
The 1990 census identified 70 persons 60 years or older in Point Arena in 1989, divided exactly
1/2 male and l/2 female (Summary Tape File 1, page 12). Eighteen persons (18) were 80 years
or older. By tenure, the majority of elderly households lived in owner-occupied houses. Only
15 elderly households lived in rented housing (20-25 persons). None of the persons 60 years or
older were listed in the "below poverty" category (Summary Tape, File 3, page 117). From these
figures it would appear that housing is more readily available, affordable and in sufficient supply
for the elderly (60 years or older) who currently live in Point Arena than for younger persons.
A senior center (South Coast Senior Center) provides limited meal service to elderly "shut-ins"
and transportation (through Mendocino County Agencies) to medical appointments. The center
is staffed by volunteers augmented by the services of trained personnel from Mendocino County
agencies, as required. The Center provides a meeting place for events and a place for the
dissemination of information. Members of the Center and staff are interested in the possibility of
some form of cooperative housing for seniors that includes on-site medical services. The nearest
medical facility is the Redwood Coast Medical Center in Gualala, approximately 20 miles south
of Point Arena. One of the programs in this Housing Element is for the City to provide
assistance to the Center in determining the feasibility of a senior housing project and/or
                                         IX. Housing, Page 15
residential care facility, and including such housing in the City's land-use and zoning provisions
and regulations.
The 1990 census listed 20 persons with mobility or self-care limitations under age 65 and 28
with self-care limitations who were 65 years or older, a total of 48 persons, about the same as in
1980 (Summary Tape, File 3, page 68). For those requiring wheel chair access, some
accommodation has been made in the commercial area for access and all new assisted housing
has wheel chair access. For persons on disability incomes, limited transportation services are
available through County agencies and, for persons on Medicare, meal delivery and at-home
health care services are provided, as needed, by local and county agencies.
5.7. Seasonal and Migratory Employment
Mendocino County characteristically has a proportionally large number of seasonal and
migratory workers living in the County. Point Arena, in the past, had a proportionally large share
of these workers but, in l990, only 21 persons were listed (combined) in the occupations of
farming, forestry and fishing, which tend to be seasonal occupations. Construction, to some
extent, is also seasonal, and 17 persons were listed in this occupation (Summary Tape, File 3,
page 77). There are few, if any, migratory workers in Point Arena, i.e., those that move from
place to place each year. Farming and fishing provide few jobs in the Point Arena area because
both industries have greatly diminished in the past 10 years; to the extent that there are short-
term housing needs they are met at a commercial campground and RV park one mile north of
Point Arena. The need for housing for migratory workers has diminished accordingly.
6. AVAILABILITY OF LAND AND SERVICES FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
6.1. Residential Zoning
A recent annexation of 156 acres has increased the area of Point Arena to approximately 828
acres of land. The urban limit now includes approximately 390 acres, of which approximately
300 acres may include residential uses.
The land-use designations used in the 1985 Housing Element have been revised, principally to
allow higher residential density in the urban core and to encourage commercial stability and
growth. The current land uses permitting residential development are as indicated in Table IX.
6.2. Vacant Land Suitable for Residential Development
In 1985, approximately 136 acres of land in Point Arena were designated as potentially available
for residential development (Point Arena Housing Element Table III - 34). Potential residential
development for this potentially available land was an estimated 176 units.
With the annexation of 156 acres into the urban boundary in 19891990, the amount of vacant
land potentially available for residential development within the urban limits of Point Arena has
                                          IX. Housing, Page 16
increased by approximately 144 acres. If all land zoned by residential use were to be fully
developed to the current maximum allowed, many additional housing units could be built within
the urban limits of Point Arena. This maximum "build out" is not likely to occur soon, if ever.
The sites identified in Table X provide location and capacity for approximately 789 additional
housing units, more than a sufficient number to meet the expected "demand" during the next 5-
10 years.
In addition to residential areas added by annexation, the land use designations and allowable
density in the General Plan have substantially increased the amount of land and potential
development available for residential use since 1985. These increases are included in the
"Inventory of Sites" (Table X). There are sufficient vacant parcels of land in the Multi-family
(MR) land use classification to provide sites for additional "affordable" (income-restricted)
housing to meet the projected housing needs for low-income persons. The permitted density of
one dwelling unit per 2900 sq. ft. should encourage further development of housing by non-
profit agencies. Using a conservative 10 du's per acre, the available sites could accommodate
as many as 260 additional multi-family units.

6.3. Services
The recent annexation of land was reviewed and approved by the California Coastal Commission
(April 15, 1990). In that review and approval it was determined that the water supply and sewer
capacity of Point Arena are sufficient to meet the requirements of the potential new development
both within the existing area and the annexed area provided development occurs according to a
plan for phased development. The Point Arena water and sewer capacity is sufficient for the
expected time horizon of this plan or project life of this plan. The extension of roads and utilities
would be a condition of approval of any subdivision within the annexed area.
                                          IX. Housing, Page 18
7. CONSTRAINTS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING
7.1. Government Constraints
Certain governmental regulations can, unintentionally increase the cost of development, and,
thus, the cost of housing. These government constraints include: land-use controls, building
codes, local permit processing, various special fees (such as traffic mitigation fees and
development fees), and environmental/site condition studies. Limitations on density is also a
controlling factor in cost.
To what extent do Point Arena's policies and regulations contribute to higher housing costs and
to what extent can these regulatory measures be reduced or off-set?
7.2. Land Use Controls
Land use is controlled primarily by the locally adopted land-use plans (part of the Point Arena
General Plan), the local zoning and building codes, which must be consistent with the General
Plan, and the Point Arena Land Use Plan certified by the California Coastal Commission. In
addition to the limitations specified in the land use classifications and the zoning classifications,
the Point Arena General Plan contains provisions for the requirement of open space in new
planned developments of 10 acres or more, and an "Opportunities and Constraints Map", the
purpose of which is to enforce City policies concerning open space, protection of creeks and
stream beds, riparian areas, natural habitats, view corridors and view areas, and seismic safety
provisions.
As previously noted, Point Arena has recently taken action to increase allowable densities in the
General Plan and in the local zoning ordinances. These increased density allowances will make
multi-family development more attractive to investors and developers. Point Arena land-use
controls also permit mixed residential/commercial construction and the conduct of certain
"cottage" industries and live/work spaces in the urban core area. To a large extent, higher
density allowances will off-set some of the costs of land-use restrictions imposed by local
policies and ordinances.
7.3. Building Codes
Point Arena has a contractual agreement with Mendocino County to conduct building and health
inspections and to implement the uniform building codes and other building regulations required
by state and federal laws. The uniform codes are designed to establish safety and health
standards in construction. To the extent that these requirements add to the cost of housing
construction, they will remain as a constraint which will not be changed unless some are
determined to be unnecessary or can be reduced to less significant requirements. Point Arena
does not have codes that supersede or augment the State's uniform building code. Permits for the
rehabilitation and alteration of older structures require only the minimum code compliance to
assure health and safety. No systematic or retroactive code enforcement is practiced, except as
required by State law.
                                          IX. Housing, Page 19
7.4. Permit Processing
While building applications are received and approved by Mendocino County Agencies, fees and
processing which require local government approval, subdivisions for example, are established
and administered by Point Arena officials. Because of the low volume of applications and the
relatively small agenda of the City Council, permits are processed quickly compared to most
communities. In general, the cost and time for permit processing cannot be considered a
constraint of any consequence to the production of affordable housing.
7.5. Fees
The fees for permit processing have increased only modestly since 1985 and remain quite low
compared to more densely populated areas (Table XI). For new developments, for example new
subdivisions, the City will impose development fees that will insure the construction of adequate
infrastructure to support the development. These fees, which will be established before the end
of 1994, will almost certainly increase the overall cost of new housing.

NOTE: All the above planning applications include environmental assessment and processing,
negative declarations or notice of exemptions.
General Plan amendments, zoning changes, and applications requiring environmental review
require from 45 to 90 days for processing.
Building permits and plan checks can usually be completed in 20 days or less.
Fees are charged for new utility hook-ups in new subdivisions. These fees are consistent with
those charged by Mendocino County and are not considered to be, nor intended to be, "extra-
ordinary" charges to increase revenue to the City or to mitigate adverse impact of development.
The City's water is supplied by a private company. Sewage is handled with modern treatment
facilities operated by the City. Water and sewer service costs are somewhat comparable to the
costs in a large urban area. For very low-income families, the cost of utilities is a major expense
in housing costs--as much as 30% or more in some cases.
                                                        IX. Housing, Page 21

7.6. Growth Management
The City's growth management policies are directed toward encouraging development in or near
the downtown (built) area and "cluster" development in undeveloped areas. Thus, these policies
tend to encourage rather than constrain the development of affordable housing. However, new
development will be permitted only where utility connections and standard streets are already in
place or will be in place prior to development.
7.7. Infrastructure
The lack of water and sewer services and adequate street capacity have been constraints to
housing development in some communities. This is not true in Point Arena. It was determined in
l967 that the City has the water capacity to serve a population of 1,500 (Wilsey & Ham). In
approving the recent annexation of 156 acres, The California Coastal Commission found that the
City's water supply and waste water disposal facilities were adequate to handle the potential
growth allowed by current land use regulations (California Coastal Commission, #1-89). The
current water and sewer capacities are adequate for the expected life of this plan. Approval of
new subdivisions in the annexed area will be conditioned upon having all water, sewer, and
power connections and all street improvements in place prior to or as a part of construction.
Within the annexed area, only limited portions are mandated to connect to City provided sewer
services.
7.8. Environmental Protection Requirements
In addition to restrictions imposed by the California Coastal Commission, Point Arena has
policies to limit construction near creek beds and riparian rights-of-way and which might intrude
on or adversely affect view corridors, public open space, and natural habitat areas. Permits for
grading must include measures to protect both the short-term and the long-term interest of the
public from harmful erosion, pollution, or unnecessary removal of natural planting and soil.
Enforcement of these environmental protection measures may add to the cost of constructing
housing.
7.9. Coastal Zone Limitations
The entire area of Point Arena, including recent annexations, is within the California Coastal
Commission jurisdiction. As previously noted, the recent annexation of land to be within the
urban boundary of Point Arena has been approved by the California Coastal Commission. The
only restriction imposed by the CCC that may limit development is the requirements for
"phased" development; however, such limitations would affect only the outlying low-density
areas and industrial zones where roads and utilities would have to be constructed in order for
development to take place. Although the land-use provisions of the 1993 Point Arena General
Plan have not been reviewed and acted upon by the CCC, the provisions in the General Plan are
not substantially different from the land-use policies reviewed by the CCC in approving the
"Hay" annexation. Therefore, it can be anticipated that the General Plan will be found to be
consistent with CCC policies and that no new requirements that may limit residential
                                         IX. Housing, Page 22
development or impose unusual or cost-increasing restrictions will be required by the CCC. The
CCC does not have specific requirements for low/moderate housing in Point Arena that
supersede or which are different from the provisions for housing contained in this Housing
Element.
7.10. Non-Governmental Constraints
Non-governmental constraints are those limiting the availability of affordable housing over
which local government has little or no control. These constraints include: cost of living, price
of land, cost of materials and labor, speculative ownership and availability of jobs and economic
opportunity. Environmental constraints may also contribute to the lack of or increased cost of
housing; for example, geologic conditions, susceptibility to flooding, etc.
7.11. Land/Housing Prices
Nation wide, the price of housing has been rising at a much faster rate than income. National
prices affecting interest rates, wage and material costs and availability of subsidies are cost
factors, which are not subject to local control.
Land prices in the Point Arena area are lower than land prices in other parts of Mendocino
County and much lower than for small towns which are near large urban centers. Land
speculation, i.e., land held for future development when demand increases, is doubtless a factor
in land prices in Point Arena. All developable coastal land is, to a varying extent, a diminishing
commodity with increasing attractiveness for development as the population grows. Because
Point Arena is isolated from other urban centers such as San Francisco, Santa Rosa, Sacramento,
etc., the pressure for development is not such that land prices have been driven up as in most
urban areas or even areas such as the village of Mendocino. Also, there is no shortage of land for
housing development. A typical parcel within the urban boundary of Point Arena sells currently
for $90,000 to $100,000 per acre, a somewhat lower figure than a comparable parcel in the
village of Mendocino, further north on the coast. A factor which keeps land prices stable in
Point Arena is the relatively large supply of land available for development.
7.12. Construction Costs
Residential construction costs in Point Arena range from $70 to $90 per square foot. These costs
are comparable to Mendocino County as a whole. Labor costs seem to be less in Point Arena
than for large urban areas, but material costs tend to be higher. Because factory-built housing
tends to cost less than site-built housing, it can be expected that manufactured housing, including
mobile homes, will become more and more an alternative for affordable housing.
7.13. Availability of Financing
Fluctuating interest rates and more conservative lending policies have had the effect of slowing
housing development in general and particularly in areas where demand is uncertain because of
changing economic conditions. In Point Arena, the availability of employment is a key factor in
                                          IX. Housing, Page 23
the production of affordable housing, not only in terms of demand, or need for housing, but in
the economic viability of building housing.
7.14. Energy Costs
Utility costs, including water and sewage, are a significant part of monthly costs for households
of very low income. In 1991, the cost of all utilities including water, sewer, gas and electricity
for a typical two bedroom house was $200 per month (peak use).
8. ANALYSIS OF "AT-RISK" HOUSING UNITS
The following analysis of the housing units in Point Arena that have been financed in some
manner with loans or grants from public sources and carry some income eligibility restrictions
has been prepared pursuant to Government Code Section 65583. Housing units that have been
financed with the intention and provision of providing housing affordable to low/moderate
income persons are identified, and an assessment has been made concerning the status of these
units. The purpose is to identify those units that may be "at risk" because of the termination of
restrictions that make the units available and affordable to persons of low and moderate income.
The analysis covers the ten-year period, 1992-2002.
The units "at risk" in the following list are those units with loans that may be paid off before the
final payment date. For rental units financed with rehab loans, the restrictions accompanying the
loan remain in force as long as the loan is outstanding. Of the units listed below, it has been
estimated that not more than one loan involving two units will be paid off before the final due
date. No "notices of intent" have been filed with the City indicating that termination is pending
for any units. For the owner-occupied single family housing loans, the original 15 year
restrictions on owner occupancy is maintained, even if ownership changes. Thus, none of these
units are at risk during the ten year period. Of the new units created expressly for availability to
low/moderate income persons, none are at risk. Eligibility can be renewed every five years or
sooner. Point Arena Village Apartments consists of 26 units of which 18 are available to eligible
persons of low/moderate income. The non-profit management agency for the complex (CBM
Management Co., Auburn, CA.) have stated the policy of maintaining eligibility during the ten
year period.
In summary: only two rental units with rehabilitation loan restrictions are "at risk" during the ten
year period. An owner occupancy loan may be terminated, following the death of the original
applicant (loan may be paid off at time of transfer of ownership).
Total units possibly at risk during the period: 3 units.
Possible mitigation:      loans will be assumed by eligible borrowers.
New Construction:
Units:                    18 units in a 26 unit development. (Point Arena Village Apartments).

9. EVALUATION OF THE 1985 HOUSING ELEMENT IN PROMOTING GOALS,
OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
9.1. Goals and Policies, 1985
(A) TO IMPROVE AND CONSERVE THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK
Housing units rehabilitated during the period, 1985-1990, included 13 units utilizing
State/Federal loans for low-income tenancy. A net increase of three (3) units occurred through
the rehabilitation of units that were otherwise uninhabitable. The publicly-assisted rehabilitation
efforts produced a "ripple effect" in the Downtown area. Four (4) units were rehabilitated by
private (non-assisted) owner/developers, reflecting the general "upgrading" of buildings in the
downtown area since 1985. Private rehabilitation efforts greatly reduced the number of sub-
standard units and several units were brought into compliance with the most recent State codes.
                                            IX. Housing, Page 25
Two (2) structures that were beyond economic salvage were demolished.
Information about the availability of State/Federal rehabilitation loans became widely known in
the community because of the small size of the population and the high visibility of the
rehabilitated units. The Mendocino County housing and planning agencies provided loan
information and assistance to interested applicants who were referred to them by the Point Arena
City Clerk.
(B) TO ENCOURAGE THE PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Of the 34 housing units constructed during the period, 1985-1991, eighteen (18) were Farmer's
Home Administration-assisted rental units developed by a non-profit agency (Point Arena
Village Apartments) for low-income tenants. Thirteen (13) units were rehabilitated for
low/moderate-income occupancy through the use of Federal/State rehabilitation loans.
The feasibility of offering a density bonus and other incentives, including the waiving of certain
utility hook-up fees were included as part of a preliminary study of a possible redevelopment
project for the downtown and cove area. The redevelopment project was not pursued. The Point
Arena Village Apartment complex was developed by a non-profit sponsor without the benefit of
incentives. Because of declining population during the period, private developers did not seek to
build new housing. The few houses that were built were constructed by owner/occupants who
recently moved to Point Arena or by the nonprofit agency mentioned above.
Although preparation of a General Plan and subsequent updating of the Zoning Ordinance were
pending in 1985, no action was taken during the period to adopt a General Plan or up-date the
Zoning Ordinance. Consequently, some of the land-use changes and provisions projected as
actions in the 1985 Housing Element were not accomplished during the period. For example,
provisions for second units in existing single-family structures have not been enacted. Such
provisions have been included in the current General Plan. The number of mobile homes was
greatly reduced during the period because of the closure of the mobile home park on the outskirts
of the downtown area. The park, which historically had provided low-cost housing for as many
as 30 owner occupants, was closed for economic reasons. This closure accounts for part of the
population loss during the period; however, the closure did not significantly reduce the number
of rental units because a majority of the mobile homes were owner occupied. The current
General Plan, and subsequent zoning provisions, permit mobile or manufactured homes in all
residential zones of the City as a conditional use.
(C) TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SITES FOR ALL TYPES OF HOUSING
A surplus of sites has been available during the period for the development of all types of
housing. Efforts have been made to attract developers to the downtown area where many "infill"
sites are available. A redevelopment project contemplated in 1985 was never adopted. Renewal
of certain areas, the cove area for example, has been accomplished with the assistance of
Federal/State funds (CDBG) and private investment. The new Point Arena Village Apartments
in the downtown area were developed under regulations that were current in 1985 and no public
                                         IX. Housing, Page 26
assistance of and no public assistance for land acquisitions was required. Mobile housing was,
until 1993, permitted only in designated areas outside the downtown area. The new General
Plan and proposed zoning codes permit mobile housing in all residential zones, as a conditional
use. Historically, residential uses have been mixed with commercial uses in Point Arena. The
current zoning ordinance encourages and conditionally permits residential use in commercial
areas as well as mixed residential building types in certain areas.
(D) TO PROVIDE A MIX OF HOUSING FOR ALL INCOME GROUPS
The supply of affordable housing was increased in the period 1985-1991, with the construction
and rehabilitation referred to above. Nearly half of the new units are available for low/moderate
income persons. The majority of houses in Point Arena are single-family type houses, and the
majority of these are occupied by renters. A policy stated in the 1985 Housing Element to
encourage ownership of these houses and /or convert them to multiple units has not been actively
pursued. Most renters cannot afford the median priced house in Point Arena, and condominium
projects are not attractive to those who might be able to afford them. Residents, owners and
tenants alike, generally live in small towns to enjoy, among other things, open space and low-
density living. A number of houses are kept by the owners for seasonal use and are rented out
only part time. The rental population has been and still is very mobile. There is a constant turn-
over of tenants in many of the larger houses. The current zoning ordinance permits the
conversion of such units to multi-family use in certain areas, subject to density and site
development standards of the Zoning Ordinance.
For persons of very low income, estimated to be approximately 35 of the population, affordable
housing is not available except by "overpaying" for rent or by income or rental assistance. There
are no public housing units in Point Arena. The available public housing in Mendocino County
is concentrated in Ukiah, Fort Bragg and Mendocino.
(E) TO INSURE EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
The supply of housing available to low/moderate-income persons was increased during the
period, thus, providing more choices for housing to a large segment of the community. All the
new "affordable" housing has wheel chair access and is near shopping and schools. Single
women with dependent children and elderly on fixed income have more opportunity for suitable
housing than they did in 1985. The pattern of occupancy in Point Arena is generally a mix of
low and higher-income persons in all areas of the City. Low income "ghettos" are not evident.
(F) TO ENCOURAGE ENERGY CONSERVATION
All the new housing built since 1985 has been constructed with certain energy conserving
materials, methods and fixtures. Because of the coastal weather, residents of Point Arena,
owners and tenants alike, tend to be energy conscious and use weather stripping where possible
and affordable. The City has no regular program or assistance for conservation of energy except
as provided for by the local utility company, which encourages energy conservation by
publication of newsletters and programs to assist in the purchase of energy-saving devices.
                                          IX. Housing, Page 27
9.2. Progress in Implementation (1985-1992)
(A) New Construction
 Projected need, 1985-1991:         16 units
 Constructed, 1985-1991:            34 units
(B) Rehabilitation
 Goal, 1985-1991:                   55 units
 Actual, 1985-1991:                 21 (permits issued)
(C) Other Housing Needs
1. Persons handicapped or with work disability: The 26 new units built in the downtown area
all have wheel chair access and are near shopping.
2. Female head of household: Progress has been made to the extent that an increased supply of
low/moderate-income housing in the downtown area has provided more housing opportunity.
Half of the new units have two or more bedrooms
3. and 4. Low-income households/large renter population: As previously noted, at least 18
housing units have been added to the supply of "affordable" housing since 1985.
5. Substandard Units: As previously noted, substantial progress has been made in reducing the
number of sub-standard units:      Substandard 1985: 163      Substandard 1991: 41
6. Overpayment for Rent: For most persons "overpaying" for rent in Point Arena, the solution
would be to have increased income. For some who are unable to work or choose to work only
part time, the increased supply of low/moderate-income has provided more opportunities for
permanent, affordable housing.
(D) Projection of Needs
The Housing Element adopted in 1986 identified housing "needs" for the 1985-1991 period as
follows:
1. Overall new construction need: 18 units not including replacement of units demolished
because of deteriorated condition (p. III-42). This number (18) includes Point Arena's "fair
share" of regional housing needs.
2. Special Needs:
    a) Female-headed household with children under eighteen years: 18 (persons);
    b) Large number of low-income households (54.4% of total); 31 persons receiving
    public assistance;
                                         IX. Housing, Page 28
    c) Large renter population (117 housing units); problems associated with absentee
    ownership;
    d) "Under-utilization" of housing (62% of housing units occupied by 2 or fewer
    persons);
    e) Sub-standard units (58% of units sub-standard and needing rehabilitation; 83% of
    mobile homes needed rehabilitation or replacement);
    f) Overpayment (68 renters with incomes of less than $10,000 per year were
    overpaying).
(E) Progress in Meeting Projected Needs
1. New construction: Since 1986, permits have been issued for 40 residential units; 34 have been
constructed. These include:
8 single family houses
0 units in 2-4 unit structures
26 units in 5 or more unit structures
2. Rehabilitation: As previously noted, a recent field survey revealed that extensive
rehabilitation of structures has occurred since 1986 as evidenced by the number of units
classified as "substandard" (163 structures in 1986 compared to 41 structures in 1991).
Only one demolition permit has been issued since 1986, although, at least 2 demolitions are
known to have occurred. These buildings were beyond redemption). Some rehabilitation may
also have occurred without permits. Three residential units were approved in 1989-90 for
inclusion in rehabilitated or new commercial uses.
3. Assistance Through Government Policies and Programs Government          Loans and Grants
Assistance:
    a) REHABILITATION LOANS: 10 (5 deferred owner-occupied)
        Source of Funding: Federal/State Rehabilitation Loan Funds
        Number of Units: 13 (5 owner-occupied).
        Conditions: Rent to persons of low income and/or not more than 25% of tenant's income.
        Term: 15 years (beginning June 1987). None of these units is at risk of conversion
        before the year 2008 (HUD Inventory, 1989).
    b) NEW CONSTRUCTION LOANS: 1
        Source of Funding: FMHA Mortgage Interest Credits to Non-profit developers.
        Number of Units: 18 units in 26-unit development.
        Conditions: Lower rents to eligible persons (income limits).
                                         IX. Housing, Page 29
         Terms: Eligibility can be renewed every 5 years. Current eligibility expires in 1996 but
         can be renewed prior to expiration. The non-profit management company (CBM
         Management Co., Auburn, CA) has stated that the eligibility will be renewed before the
         end of 1996 for all units.
4. Local Government Policies and Actions to Encourage Affordable Housing:
     a) City has encouraged and assisted non-profit developers in the development of affordable
     housing units in the urban area (26 units). This development has not only met the City's
     overall construction "needs" goal of 18 units, the housing has also become available to meet
     some of the special needs identified in the 1985 Housing Element, for example, the large
     number of low-income households, female-headed households and in general people who
     rent.
     b) City has encouraged and assisted individual property owners (16 units) to rehabilitate
     their properties with low-interest loans and grants.
     c) City has adopted a 1993 General Plan, is revising its Zoning Ordinance and the Coastal
     Zone Land Use Plan, all of which encourage and permit higher-density development in the
     downtown core area. Private owners and developers are likely to respond to these changes
     with proposals for multi-unit housing and mixed residential/commercial development.
     d) City has encouraged, through the securing of grants, promotion, and approval of utility
     hook-ups, the development of labor-intensive industries to increase or maintain employment
     opportunities within the city limits.
         Example: new pier, parking lots, utility extensions and improvements at Arena Cove
         were financed through a series of grants from State and Federal agencies. New
         development includes a restaurant and a new hotel development. One of the objectives of
         this project was to generate employment, particularly for persons in the fishing industry.
         A goal of 30 new jobs was achieved. Unfortunately, due to diminishing supply and high
         costs, only a few persons are currently employed in this industry, but seven new jobs
         were created upon the opening of the hotel in 1992.
     e) The City has a need for jobs which pay higher than minimum wage service jobs in order
     to have citizenry who can afford their own housing. The city encourages jobs which are
     provided by businesses which are carefully chosen and sited to minimize environmental
     disturbance and which are sized to fit into the City's character.
5. Private Efforts: Much of the credit for meeting Point Arena's housing goals and objectives
since 1985 belongs to individuals, separately and collectively, who have believed in Point Arena
and who have worked to improve economic and social conditions in Point Arena and to maintain
its desirable features and characteristics. A collective awareness of the need for increasing the
supply of affordable housing has enabled the City's elected and appointed officials to take
                                           IX. Housing, Page 30
appropriate action to apply for grants, to change zoning, and to adopt policies favorable to the
construction of housing.
9.3. Principal Constraints to Meeting Goals, Objectives, and Projected Needs (1985-1992)
The City has met most of the projected housing needs for the period 1985-1991. To the extent it
has not, for example, the need of persons "overpaying" for rent, the principal constraints are
economic. Point Arena has been gradually losing population since 1985 due principally to lack
of economic opportunity rather than to lack of housing opportunity. Some businesses, for
example the harvesting of sea urchins, have been drastically reduced for lack of supply,
increasing costs and other factors. Other businesses, such as restaurants, have failed for lack of
customers and/or rising costs.
The City recognizes that it is a service center for the south coast between Elk and Gualala. It has
provided for that future needs by and through the "Hay Annexation" and it will continue to
encourage the creation of small businesses to serve the requirements of a service center. This is
considered to be a high priority in the creation of better paying jobs which will, in turn, allow
residents to purchase their own housing.
As previously noted, the City has made and continues to make efforts to attract industries and
businesses to Point Arena. It is difficult to do because Point Arena is a small market, isolated
from larger business and population concentrations. Owners of developable land have not been
motivated to build houses. Some multi-family units have been built by non-profit developers in
the downtown area with the use of low-interest loans. As the job and business situation
improves, the motivation for new housing construction will improve.
10. APPROPRIATENESS OF GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the l994 Housing Element are basically the same as those adopted in
1985. The principal difference is the context in which the goals and policies were set and
formulated. First, there has been experience in implementing housing programs with the use of
funding assistance and active local participation, which was not true in 1985. Citizens and
elected officials are much more aware of what can and cannot be done to implement housing
policies and of the availability and suitability of funding assistance than were their counterparts
in 1985. The "Implementation Programs" listed in the 1985 Housing Element were little more
than a catalog of possible sources of funding and assistance. If these were construed by anyone
at the time to be a list of the programs to be undertaken by the City, they were being unrealistic.
Point Arena then and now does not have departments or staff to pursue programs that require on-
going staff work and the accumulation of information necessary to keep such programs going.
There are no departments of planning, redevelopment, housing engineering or public works, as
most larger cities have to initiate or carry out programs and services. The initiative must come
from individuals and the assistance must be provided, for the most part, by State and County
agencies. The 1993 Housing Element has been prepared within the context of these limitations.
                                           IX. Housing, Page 31
Second, and most importantly, the 1994 Housing Element has been developed as an integral part
of the comprehensive 1994 General Plan. The elected officials and the many citizens
participating in the development of the Plan, including the Housing Element, have a
comprehensive understanding of the issues and considerations facing Point Arena in the future
and, therefore, have formulated goals and policies that are realistic in terms of the City's current
political, social and economic structure and conditions.
Finally, while some of the programs listed in the 1985 Housing Element were, perhaps, merely a
listing of possibilities, the City met or exceeded its objective for construction of new housing
units for low/moderate-income persons, and substantially reduced the number of sub-standard
houses in the City. The 1985 Housing Element provided a beginning for the adoption of the
1993 General Plan and codes which increase the allowable density for housing and encourage
mixed uses and residential building types. The City now has a basis for adopting policies and
legislation such as density bonuses, second units in single-family homes, and mixed
commercial/residential use.
11. CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The Housing Element was prepared as an integral part of the General Plan which is to be
adopted in 1994. All housing policies and programs in this Element would be permitted and
encouraged by other provisions of the General Plan, such as the land-use classifications, and the
revisions to the Zoning Ordinance, which will be enacted in 1994.
12. HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS: 1993 HOUSING ELEMENT

POINT ARENA HOUSING ELEMENT OF THE
             GENERAL PLAN
                 Response to
   Review by the California Department of
 Housing and Community Development of the
    Draft Housing Element for Point Arena.
                 Prepared By
              John H. Anderson
          Urban Planning Consultant
                August, 1992
              IX. Housing, Page 38
Introduction
An initial draft Housing Element of the Point Arena Housing Element was submitted to the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review on
November 27, 1991.
By letter dated December 17, 1991, from Thomas B. Cook, Director, HCD, the comments of
HCD staff were relayed to the Point Arena City Clerk, Fred Patten. A copy of that letter is
attached to the response which follows.
Summary Response
The current (August, 1992) draft of the Point Arena Housing Element contains revisions and
additions to the initial draft which respond directly to the comments of HCD. These are noted in
the following item-by-item response to the HCD letter of December, 1991.
Some of the inadequacies and short-comings noted in the HCD letter can be accounted for very
simply: the initial draft of the Housing Element was prepared from the Element that was
incorporated into the 1985 General Plan draft. The HCD comments were based upon a later
draft, which apparently had been adopted by Point Arena separately from the LCP of 1981. This
later draft contained information and programs not contained in the earlier initial draft;
consequently, some items were not adequately addressed in the draft Housing Element submitted
to HCD in November 1991. The current draft does address the items noted by HCD.
The 1985 Housing Element made reference to the adoption of land-use policies and regulations
that would permit higher densities and which would accommodate such measures as conversion
of large units into condominiums, and the adoption of the redevelopment project plan, which
would provide certain housing benefits. The answer to the question of what happened as a result
of these actions is: nothing happened because no enabling legislation was enacted during the
period.
The HCD letter noted that some of the programs listed in the 1985 draft were not accounted for
in the current draft, i.e., no account was given of the progress made in implementing these
programs. The answer, in short, is that very few of these programs were utilized. The
"Implementation Programs" listed on the 1985 Housing Element appear to be no more than a
listing of the possible sources of financing, not necessarily a list of the programs Point Arena
intended to pursue in fulfillment of specific goals and policies. The only quantified objectives
were listed on one page with no specific reference to funding sources or how the programs were
to be accomplished. Point Arena, then and now, does not have the staff required to initiate and
carry out most of the implementation programs listed.
The quantified goals, however, were realistic. In fact, Point Arena exceeded the "fair share"
construction goal of 16 units by 50%. Eighteen of the 34 units constructed were for
low/moderate-income renters. In addition, the number of sub-standard units was reduced from
124 in 1984 to 36 in 1991; again, more than meeting the goal of 55 units.
                                          IX. Housing, Page 39
Following is an item-by-item response to the HCD letter of December 27, l99l:
PAGE 1, A. REVIEW AND REVISION
1. Effectiveness of the Element
Response: The 1992 Housing Element contains information responding to the request for more
information about the effectiveness of the 1985 Element (pages 37 through 48). Noted in this
section is the fact that a General Plan and Redevelopment Plan were not adopted during the
period, which accounts for many of the programs listed in 1985 not having been implemented.
2. Progress on Implementation
Response: Pages 37 through 43 contain information on specific programs accomplished during
the period. For those not accomplished, the overall explanation is that the programs listed were
too ambitious for Point Arena to undertake and/or were not possible because enabling legislation
was not enacted.
a) Activities of the Redevelopment Agency and Programs
Response: As previously noted, a redevelopment plan has not been prepared or adopted. The
funds and programs that would have been available in a redevelopment project were, therefore,
not available. The City will determine, during the current period, if a redevelopment project is
feasible. Changes in State redevelopment law and lack of State and Federal funding have greatly
diminished the prospects for a feasible project in Point Arena.
3. Status of Programs
    a) Denial of income tax deductions to encourage up-grading of substandard units
    Response: Legislation to implement this program was never enacted. Nevertheless, a large
    portion of units identified as sub-standard in 1985 were rehabilitated and brought up to code
    during the period.
    b) HUD Sec. 8 Rental Assistance
    Response: Sec. 8 Rental Assistance was obtained for 8 households.
    c) Article 34 Referendum
    Response: No programs have been utilized which are under the Article 34 Referendum
    requirements.
                                          IX. Housing, Page 40
    d) Density Bonus Ordinance
    Response: The City has not adopted a density-bonus ordinance.
    A density bonus ordinance will be prepared simultaneously, with or soon after, the
    preparation of a revised Zoning Ordinance and subdivision ordinance, which will be
    presented to the Council for adoption in 1993.
    e) Limited Equity Housing Cooperative/Condominium Conversion
    Response: The non-profit organizations that wanted to develop housing in Point Arena
    concluded that a limited-equity cooperative housing project was not feasible in Point Arena.
    The City did not make any attempt to enact condominium conversion regulations because
    there was and is little interest in condominiums in Point Arena under the new zoning
    provisions, and as more housing is built at higher densities, condominium projects may
    become more attractive as an affordable alternative to a single-family house.
    f) Housing Needs, Resources, and Constraints
    Response: The need has been quantified as follows: 12 "very low"; 2 "other low"; 4
    "moderate"; 7 "above moderate" (page 22, HE). In addition, an analysis of special housing
    needs is presented on page 21, HE. If all the construction and rehabilitation goals are met, a
    total of 36 units would be added to the housing supply that, potentially, would be in the
    low/moderate-income rent range. (In proportion, this would be the same as San Francisco
    adding 5000-8000 units to the San Francisco housing supply during the period.)
2. Inventory of Land Suitable for Residential Development
Response: An inventory has been provided, including specific sites based upon the land use
classifications in the 1992 General Plan page (29 HE).
3. (a) (b) (c) (d) Analysis of Special Housing Needs

4. Land Use Controls, Etc./Government Constraints
Response: Analysis has been provided on pages 30-34, HE. The 1992 General Plan provides for
higher-density (than 1985) residential development and provisions for second units in single-
family structure, mixed residential/commercial use, mobile home parks and day care centers.
The inventory of sites potentially available for residential development is summarized on Table
X, page 29, HE.
Building Codes/Permit Processing
Response: Additional information has been provided pages 30-34, HE.
PAGE 5, C. HOUSING PROGRAMS
1. (a) Construction Loans
    Response: The City will assist interested developers by referral to State and County
    agencies, and will cooperate with developers in the timely processing of application for
    developments that are feasible and which meet the City's objectives (page 49, HE).
    b) Rehabilitation Loans
    Response: The City will attempt to make property owners aware of available sources of
    funding by posting notice in City Hall. Because Point Arena is small, information is easily
    disseminated by word of mouth. If an owner succeeds in getting loan assistance, most of the
    other interested owners will know about it. The City can assist by referring these interested
    owner/developers to the appropriate State or County agency.
    c) Zoning Regulations (Clarification)
    Response: The 1985 HE indicated that provision for higher density conversion of single
    family to multiple family density homes, etc., would be enacted during the period 1985-1991.
     As previously noted, these provisions were not adopted during this period. The revised
    Zoning Ordinance which will be adopted in 1993 will provide for the higher densities
    referred to on page 52, HE, and other provisions, such as mobile home parks, restriction of
    demolition etc.
2. Adequate Sites (a) and (b)
Response: As previously noted, Table X, Page 29, HE, is an inventory of land potentially
available for a variety of housing types. Emergency housing and transitional housing will be
permitted as conditional uses in the Commercial (C) and Highway Commercial (HWC) zones.
                                         IX. Housing, Page 42
3. Removal of Government Constraints
Response: No constraints have been identified that warrant mitigation or revision.
4. Equal Housing Opportunity
Response: The City will post notices and send periodic notices concerning discrimination in
housing. Individuals with complaints or questions will address them to the City Clerk who will
refer them to the Councils' Housing Committee. If the Committee and City Clerk cannot
accomplish a resolution of the problem, the matter will be referred to the appropriate
State/County agency for possible resolution.
5. Use of Redevelopment Project Funds for Housing
Response: As previously noted, the City has not adopted a redevelopment project area plan.
PAGE 7, D. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Response: As previously noted, the adoption of the General Plan was preceded by a series of
workshops and informal meetings in which a cross-section of the City's owners and renters
participated. The Housing Element was an integral part of the review and public hearing
process.
PAGE 7, E. QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
Response: The construction goal of 25 units is quantified on page 21, HE. The rehabilitation
goal of 20 units is specified on page 51, Policy #2 HE.
PAGE 7, F. CONSISTENCY
Response: Because the Housing Element was developed as an integral part of the 1992 General
Plan, consistency has been assured. The principal concern for consistency will be in the
preparation and adoption of revisions to the Zoning Ordinance to make sure that all policies in
the Housing Element can be accommodated by land-use regulation. By law, the Zoning
Ordinance must be consistent with the General Plan.
PAGE 7, G. COASTAL ZONE HOUSING (1), (2), (3), (4)
Response: The California Coastal Commission has no requirements for approval of new
construction in Point Arena, all of which is included in the California Coastal Zone. The
California Coastal Commission must certify any proposed subdivision, annexation, and all land-
use changes affecting the land use map (zoning), the Zoning Ordinance or the land use element,
prior to final approval. The General Plan and the Housing Element are consistent with all
applicable requirements of the California Coastal Commission.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. The Coastal Act
The City of Point Arena is located in the County of Mendocino and is entirely within and is
subject to the regulations (see Title 14 CCR 13000 et. sec.) set forth by the California Coastal
Act of 1976 as amended. The California State Legislature enacted the California Coastal Act to
regulate the conservation and development of California's coastline and established the
California Coastal Commission as a permanent state coastal management and regulatory agency
to assure that public concerns of state wide importance are reflected in local decisions about
coastal development.
The Coastal Act [Section 30001.5] sets the following goals for all Land Use Plans for the coastal
zone:
    a. Protect, maintain and, where feasible, enhance and restore the overall quality of the
    coastal zone environment and it's natural and artificial resources.
    b. Assure orderly, balanced utilization and conservation of coastal zone resources
    taking into account the social and economic needs of the people of the state.
                                            X. Coastal, Page 1
    c. Maximize public access to and along the coast and maximize public recreational
    opportunities in the coastal zone consistent with sound resources conservation
    principles and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners.
    d. Assure priority for coastal-dependent and coastal-related development over other
    development on the coast.
    e. Encourage state and local initiatives and cooperation in preparing procedures to
    implement coordinated planning and development for mutually beneficial uses,
    including educational uses, in the coastal zone.
The spirit and intent of the Act can be summarized as requiring that coastal planning:
    a. Protect the scenic beauty of the coastal landscape.
    b. Maintain productive coastal agricultural lands.
    c. Protect access to the coast for the enjoyment and use of as many people as possible,
    regardless of their income or place of residence, consistent with private rights and
    environmental protection.
    e. Protect marine and land resources, including wetlands; rare and endangered habitat
    areas; environmentally sensitive areas; tide pools; stream channels.
    f. Direct new housing and other development to urbanized areas with adequate
    services rather than allowing a scattered, sprawling, wasteful pattern of subdivision.
    g. Locating any needed coastal energy and industrial facilities where they will have
    the least adverse impact.
The Coastal Act also establishes a framework for resolving conflicts among competing uses for
limited coastal lands. The following table lists land use priorities from highest to lowest, as
established by the Coastal Act [Sections 30213, 30220-23 30234, 30241-43, 30250, 30253 and
30255]:
(A) Development Priorities
1. Preservation and protection of natural resources, including environmentally sensitive habitats,
and prime agricultural and timber lands.
2. Coastal dependent industry and commerce (in non-environmentally sensitive habitat areas)
and commercial fishing.
                                            X. Coastal, Page 2
3. Coastal or water dependent public recreation.
4. Non-coastal or non-water dependent public recreation.
5. Visitor serving commercial recreational, lower cost.
6. Visitor serving commercial recreational, higher cost.
7. Private residential, general industrial or commercial development.
1.2. The Local Coastal Program (LCP)
Local governments are to incorporate the Coastal Act policies into their own Local Coastal
Program (LCP). LCPs are the specific long-term management plans prepared by each of the
state's coastal cities and counties for its section of the coast located within the Coastal Zone,
which in this case is the entire City of Point Arena. Each LCP consists of a land use plan, and
implementation plan, which includes zoning ordinances and other implementing actions.
The Coastal Act, Section 30200 presents policies which provide the standards for determining
the adequacy of the local coastal programs.
The City of Point Arena's LCP shall be a combined document of this General Plan and it's
subsequent Zoning Ordinance (with associated maps). Thus, as referenced herein, LCP refers to
the City's General Plan, otherwise known as the Land Use Plan, including the Opportunities and
Constraints Maps but not including the Housing Element, the Land Use and Development Map
and associated support documents, and the Implementation Plan (IP), which includes the Zoning
Ordinance, Zoning Map, and Second Dwelling Ordinance.
The Coastal Act requires that the LCP be more detailed and specific than the City General Plan
and cover issues such as coastal access, that are not mandated by State Planning Law to be
included in the General Plan. The City General Plan contains elements, or covers issues, that are
not specifically required by the Coastal Act.
General policies regarding the LCP and General Plan:
    a. Development shall be consistent with all of the policies of the LCP. Where policies
    within the LCP overlap or conflict, the policy which on balance is the most protective
    of coastal resources shall take precedence.
    b. Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act [Sections 30210 - 30263] provide the standard for the
    determination of legal adequacy of the LCP and shall guide its implementation.
                                             X. Coastal, Page 3
1.3.         Adoption, Certification and Implementation
The Coastal Commission works with local governments to help them tailor LCPs that reflect the
coastal issues and concerns of each area, while simultaneously meeting the state wide goals and
policies of the Coastal Act. The Commission reviews each LCP to determine that it conforms
with the policies and requirements of the Coastal Act.
This Coastal Element is designed to be adopted as an element of the Point Arena General Plan.
The General Plan must be considered in at least one public hearing by the City Council,
approved with any changes the Council believes are desirable, and then adopted.
Either concurrently with evaluation of the General Plan or at a later date, the Coastal
Commission also must review the City's proposed Zoning Ordinance.
    (a) The certified local coastal program and all local implementing ordinances, regulations,
    and other actions may be amended by the City, which includes the City adoption of this
    General Plan/Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance, but no such amendment shall take effect
    until it has been certified by the commission.
    (b) Any proposed amendments to a certified local coastal program shall be submitted to, and
    processed by, the commission in accordance with the applicable procedures and time limits
    specified in Public Resources Code Sections 30512 and 30513, except that the commission
    shall make no determination as to whether a proposed amendment raises a substantial issue
    as to conformity with the policies of Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 30200) as would
    otherwise be required by Section 30512. In no event shall there be more than three of these
    submittals of proposed amendments in any calendar year. However, there are no limitations
    on the number of amendments included in each of the three submittals.
    (c) The commission shall certify a land use plan, or any amendments thereto, if it finds that a
    land use plan meets the requirements of, and is in conformity with, the policies of Chapter 3
    (commencing with Section 30200) of the Coastal Act. Except as proved in paragraph (1) of
    subdivision (a) of Coastal Act Section 30512, a decision to certify shall require a majority
    vote of the appointed membership of the commission. The commission may only reject
    zoning ordinances, zoning district maps, or other implementing actions on the grounds that
    they do not conform with, or are inadequate to carry out, the provisions of the certified land
    use plan.
    (d) Proposed amendments to a certified local coastal program may be reviewed and
    designated by the executive director of the commission as being minor in nature or as
    requiring rapid and expeditious action. Proposed amendments that are designated as being
    minor in nature or as requiring rapid and expeditious action shall not be subject to (b) or PRC
    Sections 30512 and 30513 and shall take effect on the 10th working day after designation.
    Amendments that allow changes in uses shall not be so designated. A minor amendment to
    an LCP includes but is not limited to, the following:
                                          X. Coastal, Page 4
        (1) changes in wording which make the use as designated in the zoning ordinances,
        zoning district maps or other implementing actions more specific and which do not
        change the kind, location, intensity, or density of use and which are found by the
        executive director of the Commission or the Commission to be consistent with the land
        use plan as certified by the Commission.
        (2) for annexed or detached areas, certification of zoning ordinances, zoning district maps
        or other implementing actions where either:
            (i) the certified land use plan and zoning designations of the city and county
            jurisdictions for the geographic area are equivalent; or
            (ii) the Commission has certified proposed pre-annexation zoning for the annexing
            jurisdiction.
        (3) change in the notification and hearing procedures that is consistent with the
        requirements of the Coastal Act.
        (4) for land use plans:
            (i) revisions or deletion of housing policies certified pursuant to Public Resources
            Code Section 30213 prior to January 1, 1982.
            (ii) correction, reorganization, revisions, or deletion of certified language which when
            taken together does not change the kind, location, intensity or density of use or
            modify the resource protection measures for any area or property.
            (iii) additions or revisions to certified policies which impose further conditions,
            restriction or limitations on any use which might adversely affect the resources of the
            coastal zone, if those amendments do not conflict with any policy of Chapter 3 of the
            Coastal Act or with any other certified land use plan policy.
            (iv) changes in the kinds, location, intensity or density of uses covering areas
            specifically certified by the Commission as acceptable alternative land uses that
            become effective upon the occurrence of specific events authorized in a certified LCP
            or LRDP, such as annexations or the availability of water or sewer services.
The executive director of the Coastal Commission or the Commission may determine whether or
not a proposed amendment is minor in nature. If the executive director determines the proposed
amendment is minor, notice of such determination including a summary of procedures set forth
in Article 15 of Title 14 of the CCR shall be mailed to all parties the executive director has
reason to know may be interested in the amendment to the LCP. The executive director shall
report in writing to the Coastal Commission at the next meeting, his or her determination and
objections to the determination, if any, that have been received within ten (10) working days of
                                             X. Coastal, Page 5
the posting of notice. The report shall include sufficient description of the proposed amendment
to allow the Commission to understand the proposal. If one-third of the appointed members of
the Commission requests, the determination of minor amendment shall not become effective and
the amendment shall be processed in accordance with Section 13555(b) of Title 14 of the CCR.
Proposed amendments that are designated as minor amendments by the executive director with
concurrence by the Commission or the Commission shall take effect upon completion of the
requirements of Section 13547 of Title 14 of the CCR.
If the executive director or the Commission determine that the proposed amendment is not
minor, the application shall be processed by the Commission after notice to all parties the
executive director has reason to know may be interested in the matter. Amendments that are not
designated minor in nature shall be subject to the provisions of this Article and Articles 9-12 OF
Title 14 of the CCR.
(e)(1) The executive director of the Coastal Commission may determine that a proposed local
coastal program amendment is de minimis if the executive director determines that a proposed
amendment would have no impact, either individually or cumulatively, on coastal resources, is
consistent with the policies of Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 30200), and meets the
following criteria:
     (A) The City, at least 21 days prior to the date of submitting the proposed amendment to the
     executive director, has provided public notice, and provided a copy to the commission, that
     specifies the dates and places where comments will be accepted on the proposed amendment,
     contains a brief description of the proposed amendment, and states the address where copies
     of the proposed amendment are available for public review, by one of the following
     procedures:
         (i) Publication, not fewer times than required by Section 6061 of the Government Code,
         in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposed amendment. If
         more than one area will be affected, the notice shall be published in the newspaper of
         largest circulation from among the newspapers of general circulation in those areas.
         (ii) Posting of the notice by the City both onsite and offsite in the area affected by the
         proposed amendment.
         (iii) Direct mailing to the owners and occupants of contiguous property shown on the
         latest equalized assessment roll.
     (B) The proposed amendment does not propose any change in land use or water uses or any
     change in the allowable use of property.
(2) At the time that the City submits the proposed amendment to the executive director of the
Coastal Commission, the City shall also submit to the executive director of the Coastal
Commission any public comments that were received during the comment period provided
                                            X. Coastal, Page 6
pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1).
(3)(A) The executive director of the Coastal Commission shall make a determination as to
    whether the proposed amendment is de minimis within 10 working days of the date of
    submittal by the City. If the proposed amendment is determined to be de minimis, the
    proposed amendment shall be noticed in the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting
    of the commission, in accordance with Section 11125 of the Government Code, and any
    public comments forwarded by the City shall be made available to the members of the
    Coastal Commission.
    (B) If three members of the Coastal Commission object to the executive director's
    determination that the proposed amendment is de minimis, the proposed amendment shall be
    set for public hearing in accordance with the procedures specified in subdivision (b), or as
    specified in subdivision (c) if applicable, as determined by the executive director of the
    Coastal Commission, or, at the request of the local government, returned to the City. If set
    for public hearing under subdivision (b), the time requirements set by Sections 30512 and
    30513 shall commence from the date on which the objection to the de minimis designation
    was made. (C) If three or more members of the Coastal Commission do not object to the de
    minimis determination, the de minimis local coastal program amendment shall become part
    of the certified local coastal program 10 days after the date of the commission meeting.
Once the Coastal Commission has certified an LCP for an area, the Commission's regulatory
authority over most types of development is delegated to the local government.
The Commission retains permanent permit jurisdiction over tidelands, submerged lands, and
public trust lands [Section 30519(b)]. The Commission also continues to advise, monitor, and
review the local coastal programs, hear appeals from certain local decisions, and review
proposed LCP amendments.
Following certification of the LCP, an action taken by the City on a coastal development permit
application may be appealed to the Commission for only the following types of developments:
1. Developments approved by local government between the sea and the first public road
paralleling the sea, or within 300 feet of the inland extent of any beach or the mean high
tide line of the sea where there is no beach, which ever is the greater distance.
2. Developments approved by local government not included within paragraph (1)
located on tidelands, submerged lands, public trust lands, within 100 feet of any wetland,
estuary or stream.
3. Developments approved by local government not included within paragraph (1) or (2)
located within 300 feet of the top of the seaward face of any coastal bluff.
4. Developments approved by local government that are located in a sensitive coastal
resource area.
                                            X. Coastal, Page 7
5. Any development which constitutes a major public works project or a major energy
facility.
The grounds for appeal are limited by Section 30603(b) of the Coastal Act.
The grounds for an appeal pursuant to paragraphs 1 through 5 above shall be limited to an
allegation that the development does not conform to the standards set forth in the certified local
coastal program and/or the public access policies of the Coastal Act. The grounds for an appeal
of a denial of a permit pursuant to paragraph 5 above shall be limited to an allegation that the
development conforms to the standards set forth in the certified local coastal program and the
public access policies of the Coastal Act.
Any action shall become final at the close of business on the 10th working day after the date
which the Coastal Commission receives notice of local action taken, unless an appeal is filed
with the Coastal Commission within that time. The city shall send notification of its final action
on a coastal development permit application to the Commission by certified mail within seven
calendar days from the date of taking the action.

(B) Background
Point Arena lies in the southern coastal region of Mendocino County and is bisected by State
Highway 1, the sole state highway providing north-south vehicle transportation along the
California Coast. The two lane and winding nature of Highway 1 together with its relatively
                                           X. Coastal, Page 8
small coastal population relegates its commercial transportation use to a local rather than a state
wide significance. On the other hand, because of its alignment along rugged, highly scenic,
coastal bluffs and natural resource land, Highway 1 acts as the transportation artery serving
nearly all forms of coastal recreation in the state and directly affects the recreational economies
of all of the communities along its path, including Point Arena.
Public roads providing local access to Point Arena act as a "short cut" across mountain ridges
from Route 128 in Anderson Valley. These roads offer scenic, direct access to the south coastal
areas of the County and, because they are narrow and winding they are more frequently used by
local people than by out-of-County travelers. The roads which are probably more significant to
Point Arena coastal access are the Greenwood-Philo Road and the Mountain View Road. The
roads intersect Highway 1 at Elk and 1.5 miles south of Manchester, respectively.
The high, sheer bluffs characterizing the Point Arena coastline are broken only at the Arena
Cove wharf area, where Arena Creek flows from the east and empties into the ocean. The
coastal bluffs to the north and south of the cove are under private ownership.
1. Vehicular Access to Arena Cove
Primary public access to the ocean in Point Arena is achieved by way of Iversen Avenue (at
Highway 1) to Port Road, which extends approximately one mile to the harbor and wharf at
Arena Cove. Because of the steep character of coastal bluffs within the City, Port Road is the
only vehicular access route currently available.
2. Parking at Arena Cove
Facilities and/or spaces to accommodate vehicle parking are essential parts of the City's Coastal
Access component. Parking is currently available at Arena Cove and serves a variety of uses,
including off-street parking which serves the Arena Cove commercial complex and a public
parking area which serves mixed recreational and coastal dependent uses, as well as a designated
area for commercial boat storage.
Levels of use and demand for public parking varies seasonally with boat launching, abalone
diving, and urchin diving placing the heaviest demand on available parking.
3. Pedestrian Access to Arena Cove
A pedestrian path runs from Main Street through the City Park to Port Road. Pedestrian access
to the ocean via this road is currently available only by walking along and in the road, which has
neither sidewalk nor improved shoulders. There are remnants of an inadequate bike trail along
portions of the road.
A graded strip of land on the south side of Point Arena Creek offers a potential connecting trail
from the City Park pedestrian path to the Cove, but the land is privately owned and fenced.
As conditions of permit approval, "Offers to Dedicate" trail easements along portions of Arena
Creek at the cove were required, but these have not yet been recorded.
                                           X. Coastal, Page 9
Due to the hazardous and restrictive nature of the City's coastline, Port Road should remain the
major source of public access to the ocean. The trails indicated on the Opportunities and
Constraints Map, were generally established by historic use, with initiation of new trails that
could be "formalized" into a City Trail System, once landowner approval is obtained and matters
of liability are established and resolved.
The location of trails on the Opportunities and Constraints Map are not meant to be exact; rather
they are meant as a planning guide and exact trail placement must take into account geography,
safety and other issues.
4. South Coastal Bluff Trail Potential
The bluff top to the south of Arena Cove affords spectacular views of the ocean and surrounding
coastal lands. Most of the parcels are undeveloped, except for a few single family homes. The
zoning is AE (20 acre minimum).
Access to the bluffs south of the cove is via Blufftop Road, a private road owned and maintained
by land owners, including the City. There is an existing "Offer to Dedicate" a portion of a trail
along the south bluffs. (See Opportunity and Constraints Map.)
The Mendocino County General Plan Coastal Element plans for an eventual trail connecting
Schooner Gulch State Beach in the south and the City of Point Arena's southern boundary. The
following is a list of relevant policies in the County Coastal Element:
     Policy 4.11-14         Point Arena to Whiskey Shoals Trail
     Policy 4.11-15         Mote Creek
     Policy 4.11-17         Ross Creek
     Policy 4.11-18         Schooner Gulch / Bowling Ball Beach
     Policy 4.11-19         Bowling Ball Beach
5. North Coastal Bluff Trail Potential
The bluff top to the north of Arena Cove also affords spectacular views of the ocean and
surrounding coastal lands, including the Point Arena Lighthouse, as well as foot access to small
coves and beaches. There is currently no public access. The zoning is AE (20 acre minimum).
Access is via a private road along the City's northern boundary.
The Mendocino County General Plan Coastal Element plans for an eventual trail connecting the
City of Point Arena's northern boundary and Manchester State Beach. Other lateral access
points along this route are also planned. The following is a list of relevant policies in the County
Coastal Element:

(C) Findings
Pedestrian and bicycle access along Port Road is severely restricted due to the lack of sidewalks
or trails, and the lack of visibility along the winding road. (See Circulation Element)
Although the condition of roads serving the Arena Cove area is adequate for the existing level of
usage, for safety reasons an alternate vehicular access to the cove is needed.
The current usage of access and parking facilities on the Point Arena coast is not impactive,
except for a short period in the spring during abalone fishing season. Day and night parking are
generally well met for recreational purposes, although overnight parking is prohibited in the City
lot.
In connection with the County of Mendocino, a coastal trail system could eventually be realized
from Schooner Gulch State Beach in the south, through the City and connecting to Manchester
State Beach in the north.
(D) Goals
Develop policies, programs and land use designations to carry out the provisions of the Coastal
Act regarding public access. Require new development projects to provide public access to the
shoreline and along the coast. Develop policies and programs to address and provide for
upgrades to Port Road, including widening and improving sight distances provided they are
consistent with the LCP ESHA policies..
(E) Policies
1. The City of Point Arena shall require a 25 foot wide easement along all trails
designated on the Opportunities and Constraints Map as a condition of approval to
mitigate impacts of development that would require a coastal development permit where
such impacts cannot be avoided. For any project where such mitigation is required, the
preferred implementation should be through a recorded grant of easement to the City or
to a designated private nonprofit association acceptable to the City who is willing to
accept the easement and willing to operate and maintain the public accessway or trail.
Where grants of easement are not feasible because neither the City nor private nonprofit
association is willing to accept, maintain and operate the accessway, implementation of
required access mitigation shall be implemented through a recorded Offer to Dedicate
                                             X. Coastal, Page 11
(OTD) an easement to a public agency or a designated private nonprofit association
acceptable to the City. Offers of dedication shall last for a period of 21 years from the
date of recordation of the offer.
2. For all grants of easement to the City, the City shall open the easement to the public as
soon as is feasible, and shall be responsible for operating and maintaining the accessway,
or the City shall grant the easement to a private nonprofit association that is willing to
accept, maintain and operate the accessway.
3. For all grants of easement from the City to a private non-profit association, the City shall
require the submittal of a management plan that indicates that the association will open, operate,
and maintain the easement in accordance with terms of the recorded grant of easement, and that
the association will open the easement to the public as soon as is feasible.
4. For all offers to dedicate an easement that are required as conditions of Coastal Development
Permits approved by the City, the City has the authority to approve a private association that
seeks to accept the offer. Any government agency may accept an offer to dedicate an easement if
the agency is willing to operate and maintain the easement. The City shall approve any private
association that submits a management plan that indicates that the association will open, operate,
and maintain the easement in accordance with terms of the recorded offer to dedicate the
easement.
5. The City shall pursue improvements to Port Road, or an alternate route, in order to
complete a safe pedestrian and bike path from downtown to the cove. This shall include the
adoption of a Development Impact Fee schedule and a Capital Improvement Program. Any
improvements to Port Road shall be consistent with LCP ESHA policies, including, but not
limited to, those policies governing wetland fill.
6. The City shall pursue the development of "Devil's Cutoff" as an emergency or alternate
vehicular access to the cove.
7. The City Council shall adopt the policy of protecting areas where public prescriptive
access rights may exist but which have not been specifically defined to date.
8. Pedestrian access shall be designated along trails designated on the Opportunities and
Constraints Map. This map contains previously mapped trails as well as an expanded
trail system.
9. New developments in the cove area shall be required to provide off-street parking to
serve the approved use in order to minimize impacts to public parking available for
coastal access and recreation and in order to distribute parking throughout the area; and,
10. The City shall protect, encourage, and, where feasible, provide lower-cost visitor and
recreation facilities in the Cove area and other areas in the Town. The City shall
                                          X. Coastal, Page 12
encourage, and give preference to, developments providing public recreational
opportunities, including a public park in Arena Cove.
11. The City shall strive to complete the links in the California Coastal Trail (CCT) by
participating and consulting with the National Park Service, the State Department of
Parks & Recreation, the State Coastal Conservancy, Mendocino County, and other
appropriate public and private entities and interested parties in designing, locating,
funding, acquiring, and implementing the Point Arena California Coastal Trail (CCT)
segment, including opening trails for vertical access designated on the Opportunities and
Constraints Map: Biological Resources and Trails.
12. The CCT shall be identified and defined as a continuous trail system traversing the
length of the state’s coastline and designed and sited as a continuous lateral trail
traversing the length of the City’s Coastal Zone and connecting with contiguous trail
links in adjacent Coastal jurisdictions (Mendocino County).
13. The CCT shall be designed and implemented to achieve the following objectives: ·
   Provide a continuous walking and hiking trail as close to the ocean as possible; ·
   Provide maximum access for a variety of non-motorized uses by utilizing alternative
      trail segments where feasible; · Maximize connections to existing and proposed
      local trail systems; ·
   Ensure that all segments of the trail have vertical access connections at reasonable
      intervals; ·
   Maximize ocean views and scenic coastal vistas; ·
   Provide an educational experience where feasible through interpretive facilities.
14. CCT Siting and Design Standards: The trail should be sited and designed to be
located along or as close to the shoreline where physically and aesthetically feasible.
Where it is not feasible to locate the trail along the shoreline due to natural landforms or
legally authorized development that prevents passage at all times, inland bypass trail
segments located as close to the shoreline as possible should be utilized. Shoreline trail
segments that may not be passable at all times should provide inland alternative routes.
15. Where gaps are identified in the trail, interim segments should be identified to ensure
a continuous coastal trail. Interim segments should be noted as such, with provisions that
as opportunities arise, the trail shall be realigned for ideal siting. Interim trail segments
should meet as many of the CCT objectives and standards as possible.
16. The CCT should be designed and located to minimize impacts to environmentally
sensitive habitat areas to the maximum extent feasible. Where appropriate, trail access
should be limited to pass and repass. Where necessary to prevent disturbance of nesting
birds, sections of the trail may be closed on a seasonal basis. Alternative trail segments
shall be provided where feasible.
                                            X. Coastal, Page 13

17. The CCT should be located to incorporate existing oceanfront trails and paths and
support facilities of public shoreline parks and beaches to the maximum extent feasible.
18. To provide a continuously identifiable trail along the base and shoreline of
Mendocino County, the trail should be integrated with the CCT in Mendocino County
which borders the City.
19. The CCT should be designed to avoid being located on roads with motorized vehicle
traffic where feasible. In locations where it is not possible to avoid siting the trail along a
roadway, the trail should be located off of the pavement and within the public right-of-
way, and separated from traffic by a safe distance. In locations where the trail must cross
a roadway, appropriate directional and traffic warning signing should be provided.
20. CCT Acquisition and Management: A. Trail easements should be obtained by
encouraging private donation of land, by public purchase, or by dedication of trail
easements. Trail easement dedications shall be required as a condition of approval of a
Coastal Development Permit for development on property located on the CCT route or on
designated vertical accessways to the route, when the dedication will mitigate adverse
impacts on public access and/or recreation by the project. B. The CCT plan should
identify the appropriate management agency(s) to take responsibility for trail
maintenance.
21. CCT Signage Program Standards: A. The trail should provide adequate signage at all
access points, trailheads, parking lots, road crossings, and linkages or intersections with
other trails or roads which incorporate the CCT logo (to be designed). B. The trail should
provide adequate safety signage, including but not limited to, road crossing signs and
yield/warning signs on multi-use trail segments. Where appropriate signs should be
developed in coordination with Caltrans and/or City and County Public Works
Departments and any other applicable public agencies. C. Signs shall be posted in
Spanish and in English.
22. CCT Support Facilities: To maximize access to the CCT, adequate parking and
trailhead facilities should be provided.
23. CCT Mapping: A. The final CCT map shall identify all planned or secured segments,
including existing segments, all access linkages and planned staging areas, public and
private lands, existing easements, deed restricted sections and sections subject to an
Offer-to-dedicate (OTD). The map shall be updated on a regular basis. B. The CCT shall
be identified on all applicable City Trail Maps contained in the LCP Access Component.
24. Inclusion of CCT in LCP: The LCP shall be amended to incorporate all plans and
designs for locating and implementing the CCT within the City including the final
mapped alignment.
                                           X. Coastal, Page 14
25. New development shall be sited and designed to minimize impacts to public access
and recreation along the shoreline and trails. If there is no feasible alternative that can
eliminate or avoid all access impacts, then the alternative that would result in the least
significant adverse impact shall be required. Impacts may be mitigated through the
dedication of an access or trail easement where the project site encompasses an LCP
mapped access or trail alignment, where the City, County, State, or other public agency
has identified a trail used by the public, or where there is substantial evidence that
prescriptive rights exist. Mitigation measures required for impacts to public access and
recreational opportunities shall be implemented prior to or concurrent with construction
of the approved development.
26. Mitigation shall not substitute for implementation of a feasible project alternative that
would avoid impacts to public access.
27. Public prescriptive rights may exist in certain areas along the shoreline and trails
within the City. Development shall not interfere with the public’s right of access to the
sea where acquired through historic use or legislative authorization. These rights shall be
protected through public acquisition measures or through permit conditions for new
development, which incorporate measures to provide or protect access when there is
substantial evidence that prescriptive rights exist.
28. Public accessways and trails to the shoreline and public parklands shall be a
permitted use in all land use and zoning designations. Where there is an existing, but
unaccepted and/or unopened public access Offer-to- Dedicate (OTD), easement, or deed
restriction for lateral, vertical or trail access or related support facilities e.g. parking,
construction of necessary access improvements shall be permitted to be constructed,
opened and operated for its intended public use.
29. The City shall not close, abandon, or render unusable by the public any existing
accessway which the City owns, operates, maintains, or is otherwise responsible for
unless determined to be necessary for public safety without first obtaining a Coastal
Development permit. Any accessway which the City or any other managing agency or
organization determines cannot be maintained or operated in a condition suitable for
public use shall be offered to another public agency or qualified private association that
agrees to open and maintain the accessway for public use.

Recreational boating use; encouragement; facilities.
(B) Background
The wharf area supports a diverse marine industry with a major portion devoted to commercial
and recreational boating and fishing. The spring and summer seasons are busy and the
reputation of Arena Cove as a lucrative fishing area is very good.
Facilities which are supportive of the fishing and tourist industries include the Galley Restaurant,
Arena Cove Sporting Goods, Wharfmaster's Inn, and the City-offered skiff rack storage rentals
(primarily for commercial uses), commercial and recreational boat launching services and fish
cleaning facilities.
Among persons who surf on the northern California coast, Arena Cove is known to be an
excellent surfing area.
1. Recreational Boating and Fishing
The wharf provides a launching service. Launching activity is highest on weekends, averaging
20/day. Sport fish landings include ling cod, rock cod, salmon, shad, red snapper and abalone.
In addition to private launchings, the overall recreational fishing picture is supplemented by pier
fishing and shore fishing. Fishing from the wharf does not require a license. Species of
importance to these "non-boating" forms of recreation include sea trout, perch, ling cod, black
snapper, cabezon and abalone.
Perhaps the largest, single, recreational activity generated at the Arena Cove is the "crush" of
people who visit the wharf area during the early abalone season in the spring.
2. Surfing
The City Council has recently adopted a resolution stating that it does not support the
development of a breakwater at Arena Cove. It is the City's intent to preserve the balance of
recreational and commercial activities at the Cove, promoting commercial and recreational
boating and fishing as well as surfing, which is dependent upon the breaking wave patterns at the
Cove.
3. Tourism
The visitor serving facilities at Arena Cove have grown considerably in recent years with the
addition of the Wharfmaster's Inn, the Coast Guard House Bed & Breakfast Inn, two restaurants,
                                           X. Coastal, Page 16
and other shops. The scenic value inherent in the location is one of the highest potential tourist
draws that the City of Point Arena has to offer.
(C) Findings
The balance between the multiple uses at Arena Cove of commercial and recreational fishing,
including boat mooring, storage and launching, as well as surfing and tourism, is a major
component of the recreational activities available to residents and visitors.
There is ample available undeveloped land at the cove to provide continuing development
opportunities, while maintaining a balance between recreational and other coastal dependant
uses.
(D) Goals
To maintain a balance between protecting coastal areas suited for water-oriented recreational
activities, such as fishing and surfing, and developing appropriate supportive facilities and uses
to facilitate the expansion of commercial fishing activities and tourism.
(E) Policies
1. The City shall reaffirm the policy statement of establishing the priority of
marine/coastal dependent development in the wharf area, such as commercial and
recreational fishing, boat mooring, storage and launching, and surfing. The cove shall be
protected for such uses: "The City of Point Arena, recognizing the key role that
commercial and recreational fishing and boating plays in the local and regional coastal
economy, shall continue to encourage the enhancement of coastal dependent industry at
Arena Cove by assigning a high priority status to improvement and/or expansion of
existing coastal or marine dependent uses at Arena Cove as well as encouraging new uses
which directly enhance or supplement the existing commercial/recreational boating and
fishing opportunities at the Cove."
2. Expand coastal dependent activities such as: a skin and/or scuba diving supply outlet, a
fresh fish market, boat and/or kayak rental, boat repair, marine engine repair.
3. The City shall reaffirm the policy statement of opposing a breakwater at Arena Cove.
4. The use of private lands in the cove suitable for visitor-serving commercial
recreational facilities designed to enhance public opportunities for coastal recreation shall
have priority over private residential, general industrial, or general commercial
development, but not over agriculture or coastal-dependent industry.
5. Existing, lower cost visitor-serving and recreation facilities, including overnight
accommodations, shall be protected to the maximum feasible extent. Removal or
                                           X. Coastal, Page 17
conversion of existing lower cost opportunities shall be prohibited unless the use will be
replaced with another offering comparable visitor serving or recreational opportunities.
6. Priority shall be given to the development of visitor-serving and commercial
recreational facilities designed to enhance public opportunities for coastal recreation. On
land designated for visitor-serving commercial and/or recreational facilities, priority shall
be given to such use over private residential or general commercial development. New
visitor serving uses shall not displace existing low-cost visitor-serving uses unless an
equivalent replacement is provided.
7. Adequate parking should be provided to serve coastal access and recreation uses to the
extent feasible. Existing parking areas serving recreational uses shall not be displaced
unless a comparable replacement area is provided.

(B) Background
There are four important biological marine related resources in the Point Arena area that are
dealt with in this section. They are:
1. Arena Cove
2. Arena Creek
3. Hathaway Creek
4. The Garcia River
                                          X. Coastal, Page 18
In addition, there are numerous small springs and seasonal creeks in the City that provide semi-
riparian habitat and shelter for birds and other animals, including Point Arena Mountain Beaver.
1. Arena Cove
Arena Cove is the most important biological resource within the City boundary. The upwelling
offshore provides a rich source of nutrients for a variety of marine life.
The small Cove provides mooring space for commercial fishing boats during the fishing season
and acts as a major south coastal landing pier for small recreational and sport fishing skiffs.
Party boat and shore fishing also occur at Arena Cove during spring and summer seasons,
attracting substantial participation from local residents and non-residents alike. Abalone and
Urchin harvesting are the largest attractants of business and activity to the harbor.
The biological health of Arena Cove and the surrounding waters is of the utmost importance in
maintaining a viable commercial fishing industry. The commercial fishing activities are
summarized below:
1. Commercial Fishing: Commercial fishing activities are year round, although most of
the commercial fisheries have experienced a major collapse in recent years. Crabbing is
another important commercial activity within and around the Cove.
2. Commercial Urchin Harvesting: The urchin industry created a significant new source
of commercial activity in the Cove area, although it too has declined in recent years.
3. Other activities directly related to commercial fishing include boat mooring, fish
processing and sales, skiff rack storage rentals and private boat launching from the pier.
The Point Arena municipal pier was destroyed by an ocean storm in January, 1983 and through a
joint funding effort a new pier was built and completed in 1987. With the advent of a new pier,
the harvesting of urchins took root. Since that time, the sea urchin resources in and around
Arena Cove have become a focus for commercial activity. Sea urchin roe provides a significant
source of animal protein purchased almost exclusively by the Japanese. Urchin harvesting is
done by diving. Prices of whole urchins average $1.00 lb. In 1990 Arena Cove was the number
one producer of sea urchin in the nation.
Private companies lease two hoists on the public pier and nearly all activity on those hoists is
dedicated to urchin harvesting. There is currently a loading area in the wharf area, leased by a
private property owner, utilized for the loading and shipping of the sea urchin. Although there
was a tremendous amount of urchin harvesting in the first few years, new regulations placed on
urchin harvesting coupled with depletion of the resource have combined to cause a decline in the
harvest within the past few years. It is expected that the local industry will become more static
with a certain sustainable yield expected annually.
The kelp beds located near the mouth and to the north and south of Arena Cove provide
                                           X. Coastal, Page 19
important cover and feeding areas for many of the species listed above. It is usually in kelp bed
areas where fish and other sea life populations are the largest and most diverse. Because of the
ecological vitality of kelp beds, it is a favored habitat for exploration by scuba and skin divers,
underwater photographers, and sea lions. Kelp, while often a nuisance to boaters and shore
fishermen, is an important feeding and breeding place for the myriad of organisms inhabiting
coastal waters. Thus, to assure the continued vitality of the local kelp beds the City should
protect them from degradation by pollutants and toxic substances. This can be realized by
establishing land uses which are relatively clean in the harbor and along Arena Creek, and to
adopt a policy of vigilance toward off-shore uses which may pose a threat to the biological
productivity of the kelp beds.
The following tables list commercial fishery landings at Arena Cove for recent years. (source:

2. Arena Creek
A biologically important resource, Point Arena Creek, is a small year round stream descending
to Arena Cove from three miles east of the City. It bisects the southern portion of the City,
following a deep draw to the harbor. In past years there was an abundant stealhead population,
of which only a remnant remains. The creek was substantially impacted by the direct discharge
of sewage wastes over the years, until the early 1980's. The riparian plant community consists of
willows interspersed with alders and various sedges and berry vines along its length. Nearly all
storm drains in the city eventually empty into Arena creek.
The western section runs through an area that may be designated as wetlands, near the cove area.
The stream bed near the mouth was re-routed in 1989/90 and has been the subject of an
investigation by the Army Corp. of Engineers.
The eastern section of the creek runs through pasture lands in the Hay Annexation, where
grazing cows have unrestricted access to the creek. Most of this land inside the City is zoned
RA-2 and will eventually be developed.
The main value of Point Arena Creek to the City is its aesthetics and potential as a trail area. It
is also possible that with proper care and restoration efforts the creek will again support a native
fishery. Arena Creek directly affects the waters of Arena Cove and it is, therefore, important
that the creek be as clean as possible during periods of runoff and that it be protected from
degradation by pollutants and/or impactive land uses.
The Point Arena Mountain Beaver, a federally listed Endangered Species, resides in burrows in
the Arena Creek canyon, primarily on north facing slopes.
3. Hathaway Creek Wetlands and The Garcia River and Wetlands
A significant biological resource for the Mendocino coast, including Point Arena, is located
within 1/2 to 2 miles from the City's northern boundary. This is the Garcia River and it's
tributary Hathaway Creek and their associated wetlands and flood plains.
The Garcia River is a major drainage of the southern Mendocino coastal mountains and, as such,
is a major spawning run for anadromous fish such as Silver Salmon and Steelhead. The Garcia
River is unique among other local streams in that it's mouth is open to the ocean all year. The
wetland/riparian habitat is one of two areas within Mendocino County that have been designated
by the Department of Fish and Game as "Key Marsh, Wetland and Riparian Habitat". The other
"key" area is the Big River wetland in the north coastal region of the county. The Garcia River
is recognized by the County as an "Environmental Sensitive Habitat Area" (ESHA).
The Garcia wetland is a key resting and feeding ground for migratory and resident bird
populations and also provides a winter nesting site for Whistling or Tundra Swans; a note of
distinction as they haven't been observed on other wetlands in Mendocino County.
                                          X. Coastal, Page 21
The wetlands and flood plains harbor a variety of Sensitive Species including:
1.   Point Arena Mountain Beaver, a federally listed Endangered Species.
2.   Northern Spotted Owl, a federally listed Threatened Species.
3.   Rare Whistling/Tundra Swan
4.   Foothill Yellow-legged frog
5.   California Red-legged frog
6.   Coast Lily
7.   Northwest pond turtle
Of particular concern to the City of Point Arena is the maintenance of the river's water quality
for use as a domestic water source. Point Arena Water Works has a permit from the State Water
Resources Control Board to draw 100 acre feet of water annually from a well next to the river for
use by City residents. Recent studies (Gualala Aggregates DEIR 1993) indicate that the water
allocation in the Garcia River may be greater than the annual low flow.
A second reason to maintain the water quality of the Garcia is to protect micro-organisms which
serve as the basis for the river's food chain. This chain includes sport and commercial fish in
coastal waters and ends with the coastal residents themselves. Thus, it is to the benefit of
wildlife and Point Arena citizens to assure that the biotic integrity of the Garcia River is
maintained, even enhanced, when warranted.
Anadromous fish spawning streams are ecologically fragile and very sensitive to degradation.
Both Coho Salmon and Steelhead have been list as “Threatened” under the Federal Endangered
Species Act (ESA). It is imperative that the spawning vitality of the Garcia River be maintained
if the local, and ultimately regional, salmon and Steelhead fishery resources are to be restored.
Biological productivity is maintained in the Garcia by the ecological relationships which occur
between the diverse plant and animal communities along it's course to the sea.
(C) Findings
The water and marine resources of the Point Arena area are highly diverse and contribute
substantially to the economy and the character of the City. Even though the Garcia River is
outside the City's jurisdiction, it is the source of the City's domestic water supply and it's
importance to local fisheries and the overall biological productivity of the Point Arena coast
cannot be overstated. The City should be directly involved in protecting the Garcia River and its
wetlands through collaborative efforts with County and State agencies.
Arena Cove is directly important to the commercial and recreational economies of the City and
can be enhanced by maintaining a protective policy towards the Cove and planning harbor land
uses which increase use of the harbor without impacting marine resources.
The water quality of Point Arena Creek can directly affect water quality near the shoreline. In
this regard, a new waste water treatment facility was constructed in the early 1980s.
                                             X. Coastal, Page 22

Point Arena Creek is the collection point for nearly all storm drains in the City, and as such is
impacted to an unknown degree by non-point source pollution such as motor oil from roads.
(D) Goals

    existing estuaries and wetlands shall maintain or enhance the functional capacity of
    the wetland or estuary.
    (d) Erosion control and flood control facilities constructed on watercourses can
    impede the movement of sediment and nutrients which would otherwise be carried by
    storm runoff into coastal waters. To facilitate the continued delivery of these
    sediments to the littoral zone, whenever feasible, the material removed from these
    facilities may be placed at appropriate points on the shoreline in accordance with
    other applicable provisions of this division, where feasible mitigation measures have
    been provided to minimize adverse environmental effects. Aspects that shall be
    considered before issuing a coastal development permit for such purposes are the
    method of placement, time of year of placement, and sensitivity of the placement

brackish water marshes, swamps, mudflats, and fens shall be designated as wetland. Both
mapped and unmapped areas that meet these criteria are wetlands and shall be accorded
all of the protections provided for wetlands in the LCP. The determination of what
constitutes a wetland shall not be limited to areas that are mapped. Any mapped wetland
area or otherwise determined to have previously been wetlands shall not be deprived of
protection, as required by the policies and provisions of the LCP, on the basis that the
wetland habitat has been illegally removed, filled or degraded.
2.4. Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas (ESHA)
(A) Relevant Coastal Act Sections, included by reference
30240
Environmentally sensitive habitat areas; adjacent developments.
(B) Background
Section 30107.5 of the California Coastal Act defines "environmentally sensitive areas" as "areas
in which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of
their special nature or role in an ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by
human activities and developments. include, but are not limited to certain coastal wetlands,
lagoon tide pools, creeks and riparian habitat, off-shore rocks, and kelp beds.
All of these areas are represented within and adjacent to Point Arena in varying degrees.
1. Garcia River Wetlands
The Garcia River is home to a variety of rare, threatened and endangered species including
Salmon, Spotted Owl and Point Arena Mountain Beaver. This wetland area is comprised of an
integrated network of salt, brackish and fresh water marsh systems interspersed with sand flat
                                           X. Coastal, Page 28
areas at the River's mouth.
2. Hathaway Creek/Garcia Riparian System
The Hathaway Creek riparian habitat provides abundant cover for a variety of wildlife species,
including Point Arena Mountain Beaver. The acreage of the Garcia/Hathaway systems represent
nearly 20% of all coastal marsh and 43% of all coastal riparian habitat systems in Mendocino
County. The city’s sole supply of water comes from the Garcia River.
3. Arena Creek
Point Arena Creek provides cover for various song and game birds as well as other wildlife
forms, including the Point Arena Mountain Beaver, Lotus Blue Butterfly, Behrens Silverspot and
Coast Lily. Its main attributes are it's scenic quality and its potential for hiking uses and,
hopefully, a restored fishery.
4. Other Sensitive Habitat Areas
There are numerous small springs, seasonal creeks, marsh, vernal pools and other areas
displaying wetlands characteristics through-out the City.
(C) Findings
The relative remoteness of the Garcia and Hathaway Creek wetlands has offered a certain
amount of protection from human disturbance and development. The watershed has been
severely impacted to a point that the once abundant fishery is near collapse.
Impoundment of water on the Garcia River/Hathaway Creek for agriculture or domestic
purposes could significantly impact the wetland systems if the impoundment and/or diversions
are not adequately regulated and monitored.
An illegal dump is located near the intersection of Windy Hollow Road and the Garcia River,
just upstream from the PAWW well.
Arena Creek has been heavily impacted over the years, but still contains a remnant Steelhead
population and has potential for restoration. The creek area contains considerable prime
Mountain Beaver Habitat.
(D) Goals
To work with Mendocino County to manage the sensitive habitat areas outside the city limits in a
manner that will sustain the biological productivity of stream and coastal environments for long-
term commercial, recreational, scientific and educational purposes.
                                           X. Coastal, Page 29

To protect and restore Point Arena Creek, it’s fishery and riparian habitat, including Mountain
Beaver habitat.
To protect other sensitive habitat areas within the city including, but not limited to, seasonal
creeks, vernal pools, marshes, certain wetlands, other riparian habitats, Point Arena Mountain
Beaver habitat, rare plant habitat, off-shore rocks, and kelp beds.
(E) Policies
1. Environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be protected against any significant disruption
of habitat values, and only uses dependent on such resources shall be allowed within such areas.
Development adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be sited and designed to
prevent impacts that could significantly degrade the environmentally sensitive habitat areas and
shall be compatible with the continuance of these habitat areas.
2. The City shall indicate to the County that important sensitive habitat areas adjacent to its
boundaries are of direct interest to Point Arena and emphasis of planning should be directed
toward maintaining and enhancing fishery resources in the Garcia River watershed.
3. To the maximum extent feasible, the City shall map environmentally sensitive habitat
areas inside the city including, but not limited to, certain wetlands, seasonal creeks, springs,
habitat for rare, threatened, or endangered species,and riparian habitat. The determination of
what constitutes ESHA shall not be limited by what is mapped. Restrictions shall apply to
development in and adjacent to sensitive habitat areas. Any area not designated on the LUP
ESHA Map that meets the ESHA criteria is ESHA and shall be accorded all the protection
provided for ESHA in the LCP. Revisions to the map depicting ESHA shall be treated as
LCP amendments and shall be subject to the approval of the Coastal Commission.
Any area mapped as ESHA shall not be deprived of protection as ESHA, as required by the
policies and provisions of the LCP, on the basis that habitat has been illegally removed,
degraded, or species that are rare or especially valuable because of their nature or role in an
ecosystem have been eliminated.
The following areas shall be considered ESHA:
     Any habitat area that is rare or especially valuable from a local, regional, or statewide
      basis. ·
     Areas that contribute to the viability of plant or animal species designated as rare,
      threatened, or endangered under State or Federal law. ·
     Areas that contribute to the viability of species designated as Fully Protected or Species
                                           X. Coastal, Page 30

      of Special Concern under State law or regulations. ·
     Areas that contribute to the viability of plant species for which there is compelling
      evidence of rarity, for example, those designated 1b (Rare or endangered in California
      and elsewhere) or 2 (rare, threatened or endangered in California but more common
      elsewhere) by the California Native Plant Society.
4. The City shall implement Best Management Practices (BMP) to control non-point source
pollution from the storm drain system and Point Arena Creek. New development shall be
required to mitigate Non-point Source (NPS) pollution caused by the development.
5. Development restrictions apply to the Riparian Buffer Zone along Arena Creek (see
"Overall City-wide Land-Use Policies and Programs".) The Riparian Buffer Zone is defined
in the Glossary of this General Plan asa minimum of 100 feet from the outward edge of

    a. accessory structures located at the City's waste water reclamation facility situated
    entirely within the developed, fenced area subject to securing a coastal development
    permit consistent with all other applicable provisions of the certified LCP.
6. Additional development restrictions shall apply within the Mountain Beaver Buffer Area
along Arena Creek (measured 500 feet from the centerline of the creek). The city has
incorporated the development restrictions recommended by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service
Mountain Beaver Recovery Plan into Section 5.24 of the Zoning Ordinance.
7. The City may require the establishment of conservation easements along streams, or
require an "offer to dedicate" easements at the time of development.
8. The City shall protect the non-developed flat areas of Arena Cove as a flood basin,
wildlife habitat, and critical link in the Arena Creek life-chain, insofar as possible given the
objective of enhancing the area's coastal dependent uses consistent with the Coastal Act.
Environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be protected against any significant disruption
of habitat values, and only uses dependent on such resources shall be allowed within such
areas. Development adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be sited and
                                            X. Coastal, Page 31

designed to prevent impacts that could significantly degrade the environmentally sensitive
habitat areas and shall be compatible with the continuance of these habitat areas.
9. The City will work with the county to insure the clean-up of the illegal dump located
upstream from the city water supply well.
10. The City shall continue to oppose the development of a breakwater at Arena Cove.
11. The City shall require a general plan amendment for any proposed on-shore facility to
support off-shore oil and gas exploration or development. Any such amendment shall not be
effective until a majority of the voters in Point Arena, in a general or special election, approve
the proposed amendment, unless such amendment is approved the Coastal Commission pursuant
to Section 30515 of the Coastal Act.
12. Environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be protected against any significant disruption
of habitat values, and only uses dependent on those resources shall be allowed within those
areas. Development in areas adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas and parks and
recreation areas shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly
degrade those areas, and shall be compatible with the continuance of those habitat and recreation
areas.
13. Public nature trails are considered a resource dependent use provided that (1) the length of
the trail within the riparian corridor shall be minimized, (2) the trail crosses the stream at right
angles to the maximum extent feasible, (3) the trail is kept as far up slope from the stream as
possible, (4) trail development involves a minimum of slope disturbance and vegetation clearing,
and (5) the trail is the minimum width necessary.
14. Interpretive signage may be used in ESHA accessible to the public to provide information
about the value and need to protect sensitive resources.
15. "Environmentally sensitive area" shall be defined as any area in which plant or animal life or
their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of their special nature or role in an
ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human activities and
developments.
16. North-facing slopes south of Point Arena Creek in the annexation area are confirmed Point
Arena Mountain Beaver habitat. Development proposed in this area, zoned for residential
agriculture, shall be reviewed to ensure compliance with policies of the General Plan, Zoning
Ordinance, and LCP regarding the protection of environmentally sensitive habitat areas to ensure
the preservation of the populations of Point Arena Mountain Beaver that inhabit the area.
                                            X. Coastal, Page 32
Wherever the Planned Residential Development procedure is required for development in this
area, the Comprehensive Development Plan shall include provisions to protect Point Arena
Mountain Beaver habitat consistent with the certified LCP regarding the protection of
environmentally sensitive habitat area.
17. New septic systems shall be sited and designed to ensure that impacts to ESHA are
minimized, including those impacts from grading and site disturbance as well as the introduction
of increased amounts of water. Adequate setbacks and/or buffers shall be required to protect
ESHA and to prevent lateral seepage from the leachfield(s) or seepage pit(s) into stream waters
or the ocean.
18. Land divisions of property, including certificates of compliance and lot line adjustment,
which include area within or adjacent to an ESHA or parklands shall only be permitted if each
new parcel being created could be developed (including construction of any necessary access

19. Earthmoving during the rainy season (extending from October 15 to April 15) shall be
prohibited for development that is 1) located within or adjacent to ESHA, or 2) that includes
grading on slopes greater than 20%. In such cases, approved grading shall not be undertaken
unless there is sufficient time to complete grading operations before the rainy season. If grading
operations are not completed before the rainy season begins, grading shall be halted and
temporary erosion control measures shall be put into place to minimize erosion until grading
resumes after April 15, unless the City determines that completion of grading would be more
protective of resources.
20. Where grading is permitted during the rainy season (extending from October 15 to April 15),
erosion control measures such as sediment basins, silt fencing, sandbagging, installation of
geofabrics, shall be implemented prior to and concurrent with grading operations. Such measures
shall be maintained through final grading and until landscaping and permanent drainage is
installed.
21. Grading during the rainy season may be permitted to remediate hazardous geologic
conditions that endanger public health and safety.
22. Cut and fill slopes and other areas disturbed by construction activities (including areas
disturbed by fuel modification or brush clearance) shall be landscaped or revegetated at the
completion of grading. Landscape plans shall provide that:
    (a) Plantings shall be native, drought-tolerant plant species, and blend with the existing
    natural vegetation and natural habitats on the site, except as noted below.

    (b) Invasive plant species that tend to supplant native species and natural habitats shall be
    prohibited.
    (c) Landscaping or revegetation shall provide 90 percent coverage within five years, or that
    percentage of ground cover demonstrated locally appropriate for a healthy stand of the
    particular native vegetation type chosen for restoration.
    (d) Any landscaping, or revegetation shall be monitored for a period of at least five years
    following the completion of planting. Performance criteria shall be designed to measure the
    success of the plantings. Midcourse corrections shall be implemented if necessary. If
    performance standards are not met by the end of five years, the monitoring period shall be
    extended until the standards are met.
23. Disturbed ESHAs shall not be further degraded, and if feasible, shall be restored. If new
development removes or adversely impacts native vegetation, measures to restore any disturbed
or degraded habitat on the property shall be included as mitigation.
24. Fencing or walls that do not permit the free passage of wildlife shall be prohibited in any
wildlife corridor. Fencing adjacent to ESHA shall be sited and designed to be wildlife
permeable, enabling wildlife to pass through.
25. Exterior night lighting shall be minimized, restricted to low intensity fixtures, shielded, and
directed away from ESHA in order to minimize impacts on wildlife. High intensity perimeter

agricultural use, shall not be permitted. Existing, legally established agricultural uses shall be
allowed to continue.
Development Adjacent to ESHA:
28. Development adjacent to ESHAs shall minimize impacts to habitat values or sensitive
species to the maximum extent feasible. Native vegetation buffer areas shall be provided around
ESHAs to serve as transitional habitat and provide distance and physical barriers to human
intrusion. Buffers shall be of a sufficient size to ensure the biological integrity and preservation
of the ESHA they are designed to protect. All buffers shall be a minimum of 100 feet in width
                                           X. Coastal, Page 34

and shall be larger if necessary to protect the resources of the particular habitat area from
significant degradation caused by the proposed development. No buffers may be less than 100
feet unless it can be demonstrated, based on criteria in Zoning Code Section 5.22 and after City
consultation with the California Department of Fish and Game, that 100 feet is not necessary to
protect the resources of the particular habitat area from possible significant degradation caused
by the proposed development. No buffer area may be less than 50 feet in width.
29. Required buffer areas shall extend from the following points:
     The outer edge of the canopy of riparian vegetation for riparian ESHA.
     The upland edge of a wetland for a wetland ESHA.
     The top of bluff for coastal bluff ESHA
     The outer edge of the plants that comprise the rare plant community for rare plant
      community ESHA
30. Modifications to required development standards that are not related to ESHA protection
(street setbacks, height limits, etc.) shall be permitted where necessary to avoid or minimize
impacts to ESHA
31. Development on beach or ocean bluff areas adjacent to marine and beach habitats shall be
sited and designed to prevent impacts that could significantly degrade the Environmentally
Sensitive Habitats Areas. All uses shall be compatible with the maintenance of the biological
productivity of such areas.

2.5. Agricultural Land Conversions
(A) Relevant Coastal Act Sections, included by reference
30241
Prime agricultural land; maintenance in agricultural production.
30241.5
Agricultural lands; viability of.
30242
Lands suitable for agricultural use; conversion.
30243
Productivity of soils and timberlands; conversions.
(A) Background
The Coastal Act requires that "The maximum amount of prime agricultural land shall be
maintained in agricultural production to assure the protection of the area's agricultural
economy...".
The City of Point Arena is surrounded by agricultural lands on all sides except for the coast.
Historically, agricultural products in the area have included potatoes, beef, lamb and dairy
products. At this time, most agriculture use of land in the area is confined to grazing and
livestock feed. Agricultural Exclusive (AE) zoning in the City requires a minimum 20 acre
parcel size, although there are many existing smaller parcels with AE zoning.
The larger AE zoned parcels, particularly in the northwestern and eastern portions of the City,
are comprised of high quality agricultural soils (Kneeland Loam; Agricultural II, III).
In 1989/90 the City completed the annexation and conversion of approximately 176 acres of AE
zoned land to the east, known as the Hay Annexation. This land in now zoned: Industrial (I),
Multi-Family Residential (MR), Suburban Residential 1/2 acre (SR-1/2), Suburban Residential 1
acre (SR-1), Residential Agriculture 2 acre (RA-2).
(B) Findings
While soils within the boundaries of Point Arena offer high potential for agricultural use, there is
a limited potential for modern commercial agriculture, except on the few larger parcels.
The main reasons for protecting small parcels of AE lands inside the City are for Open Space,
                                           X. Coastal, Page 36
buffer zones and small scale farming, especially when utilized in connection with Co-Housing
and other Planned Development projects.
(C) Goals
To formulate policies and land use designations necessary to protect and maintain the maximum
amount of agricultural land in production pursuant to Coastal Act Policies 30241.5 and 30242.
To encourage land owners to maintain agricultural land uses on smaller sized parcels and in
conjunction with planned development.
To change existing non-conforming AE designations of small size parcels to more realistic
zoning designations only if consistent with the agricultural protection provisions of the Coastal
Act.
(D) Policies
1. The maximum amount of prime agricultural land shall be maintained in agricultural
production; and conflicts shall be minimized between agricultural and urban land uses;
and lands suitable for agricultural use shall not be converted to non-agricultural uses
unless continued or renewed agricultural use is not feasible. All actions undertaken by
the City governing use and conversion of agricultural lands shall be governed by Sections
30241, 30241.5, 30242 and 30243 of the Coastal Act.
2. The maximum amount of prime agricultural land shall be maintained in agricultural
production to assure the protection of the areas, agricultural economy, and conflicts shall
be minimized between agricultural and urban land uses through all of the following:
    a. Stable boundaries and buffer areas where necessary shall be established separating
    urban and agriculturally zoned areas, including, where necessary, clearly defined
    buffer areas on residential lands abutting Mendocino County rangelands, utilized to
    minimize conflicts between agricultural and urban land uses.
    b. Agricultural lands around the periphery of urban areas shall not be converted to
    non-agricultural uses unless the viability of existing agricultural use is already
    severely limited by conflicts with urban uses or where the conversion of the lands
    would complete a logical and viable neighborhood and contribute to the
    establishment of a stable limit to urban development;
    c. Lands not suited for agriculture shall be developed prior to the conversion of
    agricultural lands;
    d. Public service and facility expansions and nonagricultural development shall not
    impair agricultural viability, either through increased assessment costs or degraded
    air and water quality;
                                            X. Coastal, Page 37
    e. All divisions of prime agricultural lands except those conversions approved
    pursuant to subdivision (a), and all development adjacent to prime agricultural lands
    shall not diminish the productivity of such prime agricultural lands.
3. Lands suitable for agriculture shall not be converted to non-agricultural uses unless
continued or renewed agricultural use is not feasible, or (2) such conversion would
preserve prime agricultural land or concentrate development consistent with Section
30250 of the Coastal Act. Any such permitted conversion shall be compatible with
continued agricultural use on surrounding lands.
4. The City shall encourage the recombination of agricultural parcels , through
Conservancy or other appropriate action.
5. The City shall not encourage the change of existing non-conforming (less than
minimum size) parcels on the south bluffs from AE zoning to RA-10, unless a conversion
analysis and findings made in accordance with the provisions of Coastal Act Sections
30241, 30241.5, 30242, and 30243 show that continued agricultural use is no longer
feasible, or shall encourage the recombination of said parcels.
6. Lands may not be converted from AE in order to change an existing non-conforming
use into a conforming use unless a conversion analysis is conducted and findings are
made in accordance with the provisions of the Coastal Act, and such conversion is
certified by the Coastal Commission as an LCP Amendment.
7. Stable boundaries shall be established separating urban and rural areas, including,
where necessary, clearly defined buffer areas utilized to minimize conflicts between
agricultural and urban land uses. Conversion of agricultural lands around the periphery of
urban areas shall be limited to the lands where the viability of existing agricultural use is
already severely limited by conflicts with urban uses or where the conversion of the lands
would complete a logical and viable neighborhood and contribute to the establishment of
a stable limit to urban development, and where the conversion of the land would be
consistent with Section 30250 of the Coastal Act.
8. Confined animal facilities shall be sited and designed to manage, contain, and dispose
of animal waste using BMPs to insure that waste is not introduced to surface runoff or
groundwater.

(B) Background
The general policies governing new development are discussed in detail elsewhere in this
General Plan including:
Community Character and Overall Goals
Land Use and Development Element
Open Space and Conservation Element
Community Health and Safety Element
This section addresses only those aspects of new development that are specific to the Coastal
Element:
1. Publics Services for New Development
2. Protection of Visual Resources
3. Off-shore Oil Development
(C) Findings
1. Point Arena population growth is historically very slow. At the current rate of development it
is projected to take 400+ years to reach build-out.
2. The treated sewage percolation ponds are not adequate to deal with the peak flows caused by
infiltration during major storms.
                                          X. Coastal, Page 39
3. PAWW has a permit from the Department of Water Resources to divert a maximum of 100
ac/ft per year from the underflow of the Garcia River.
4. Offshore oil development is opposed by the majority of city residents.
5. The scenic qualities in and around Point Arena are what make it special and desirable by its
residents.
(E) Policies
1. Public Services for New Development
Development may only be approved where it has been demonstrated that adequate services are
available during the project review process and provided as a condition of development
consistent with the provisions of Policy 2.5 below.
The City will develop a Capital Improvement Program, including a Development Fee Schedule,
as part of the implementation of this General Plan.
2. Reassessment of Public Services
2.1. The City will assess the domestic water supply source capacity and work with PAWW to
insure that adequate water is available for future development.
2.2. The City will implement plans to increase the capacity of the treated sewage percolation
system and reduce infiltration. Any proposed development to improve the sewage percolation
system and reduce infiltration shall be consistent with the policies of the certified LCP.
2.3. The City will implement plans to correct potential traffic problems at the Highway 1 /
Iversen Rd. intersection, as recommended in the July 1999 study by TJKM Transportation
Consultants. Any proposed development at the intersection shall be consistent with the policies
of the certified LCP.
2.4. As a precautionary measure, when the population reaches 50% of projected build-out, or
when the LCP is next updated (which ever comes first) the City shall undertake steps necessary
to reassess and insure the continued ability to meet infrastructure requirements through build-
out.
2.5 No permit for development shall be approved unless the applicant has demonstrated that such
development will be served upon completion with adequate services, including but not limited to
water, sewer, and road facilities when applicable to the proposed development.
    a. Demonstration of adequate sewer facilities shall include either (i) a written commitment
                                          X. Coastal, Page 40
    from the managers of the municipal sewage system that adequate capacity exists within the
    system to serve the development and that the municipal system will provide such service for
    the development; or (ii) a septic system site evaluation study and a preliminary approval
    from the Mendocino County Environmental Health Division that a septic system site meeting
    Division standards adequate to serve the proposed development exists on the subject
    property.
    b. Demonstration of adequate water shall include either (i) a written commitment from the
    Point Arena Water Works or its successor that that adequate capacity exists within the water
    system to serve the development and that the water purveyor will provide such service for
    the development; or (ii) evidence that the Mendocino County Division of Environmental
    Health has determined that the water quality of a proposed well or spring water source meets
    the chemical and bacteriological standards of the California Domestic Water Regulations and
    that a water quantity test performed consistent with the Division’s requirements indicates that
    sufficient water is available to serve the proposed development.
    c. Demonstration of adequate road facilities shall include information demonstrating that (i)
    access roads connecting to a public street can be developed in locations and in a manner
    consistent with LCP policies and (ii) that the traffic generated by the proposed development
    will not cause Levels of Service (LOS) of roads, streets, and intersections within the City to
    reduce below LOS (E).
Lack of adequate services to serve the proposed development shall be grounds for denial of the
development or reduction in the density otherwise indicated in the Land Use Plan.
2.6. Certain development, including but not limited to (i) Land divisions, including lot line
adjustments, mergers and issuance of conditional certificates of compliance, (ii) multi-family
dwellings allowed by use permit in areas designated with the Highway Commercial or Core
Commercial land use classification, and (iii) mobile home parks allowed by use permit in areas
designated with the Highway Commercial, land use classification may be approved only if (a)
adequate services exists to serve the proposed parcels and building sites consistent with the
requirements of Policy 2.5 above, and (b) adequate service capacity would be retained to
accommodate existing and projected future coastal dependent industrial (including commercial
fishing facilities), visitor serving, and recreational priority uses in HC, HWC, and Commercial
areas within the City allowed under the Land Use Plan. Prior to approval of a coastal
development permit, the Planning Commission or City Council shall make the finding that these
criteria have been met. Lack of adequate services to serve the proposed development and
existing and projected future priority uses shall be grounds for denial of the development or a
reduction in the density otherwise indicated in the Land Use Plan.
2.7 The following policies shall apply to proposed development in the Hay annexation area:
    a. Where required, the necessary extension of road, water, and sewer services within the Mill
    Street/Hay Annexation area shall be in two phases, as shown on Exhibit B of the Memo of
    Understanding City of Point Arena/Hay Annexation as amended dated January 10, 1990.
                                            X. Coastal, Page 41

    Phase I includes: 13 acres of Urban Residential, 3 acres of Multifamily, and 20 acres of
    Suburban Residential Zoned lands. Phase II includes: 10 acres of Suburban Residential (1/2
    acre minimum), 32.6 acres of Suburban Residential (1-acre minimum) and 62 acres of
    Residential Agriculture zoned lands. Phase 1 would commence upon approval by the City
    Council of necessary permits needed for construction of road and utility installations.
    Subdivision plans would be processed. Phase II can commence no earlier than 2 years from
    the commencement of Phase I and when the developer can provide verification that 50% of
    the Phase I site have been sold.
    b. All lands and acreages described in the MOU and policy 2.7(a) above represent the
    maximum potentially allowable development, and neither the MOU nor policy 2.7(a)
    represent an entitlement to develop. Any and all proposed development or development
    agreements in the Hay annexation area shall conform to all applicable provisions of the
    certified LCP.
    c. All proposed developments in the Hay annexation area, including subdivisions, shall be
    processed according to the Planned Residential Development Process. While development
    may proceed in phases as required by policy no. 2.7(a), approval of any development
    proposals and comprehensive development plans related to the Hay annexation area shall
    include plans for all lands in common contiguous ownership, and shall be processed at one
    time. A coastal development permit shall not be approved unless all residential lands in the
    Hay annexation area are included in a single proposed development, and unless the proposal
    conforms with all applicable provisions of the LCP.
2.8 (a) New residential, commercial, or industrial development, except as otherwise provided in
    the LCP, shall be located within, contiguous with, or in close proximity to, existing
    developed areas able to accommodate it or, where such areas are not able to accommodate it,
    in other areas with adequate public services and where it will not have significant adverse
    effects, either individually or cumulatively, on coastal resources. In addition, land divisions,
    other than leases for agricultural uses, outside existing developed areas shall be permitted
    only where 50 percent of the usable parcels in the area have been developed and the created
    parcels would be no smaller than the average size of surrounding parcels.
    b. Where feasible, new hazardous industrial development shall be located away from existing
    developed areas.
    c. Visitor-serving facilities that cannot feasibly be located in existing developed areas shall
    be located in existing isolated developments or at selected points of attraction for visitors.
2.9 The location and amount of new development shall maintain and enhance public access to
the coast by (1) facilitating the provision or extension of transit service, (2) providing
commercial facilities within or adjoining residential development or in other areas that will
minimize the use of coastal access roads, (3) providing nonautomobile circulation within the
development, (4) providing adequate parking facilities or providing substitute means of serving
                                           X. Coastal, Page 42
the development with public transportation, (5) assuring the potential for public transit for high
intensity uses such as high-rise office buildings, and by (6) assuring that the recreational needs
of new residents will not overload nearby coastal recreation areas by correlating the amount of
development with local park acquisition and development plans with the provision of onsite
recreational facilities to serve the new development.
2.10 New or expanded public works facilities shall be designed and limited to accommodate
needs generated by development or uses permitted consistent with the provisions of this division;
provided, however, that it is the intent of the Legislature that State Highway Route 1 in rural
areas of the coastal zone remain a scenic two-lane road. Special districts shall not be formed or
expanded except where assessment for, and provision of, the service would not induce new
development inconsistent with this division. Where existing or planned public works facilities
can accommodate only a limited amount of new development, services to coastal dependent land
use, essential public services and basic industries vital to the economic health of the region,
state, or nation, public recreation, commercial recreation, and visitor-serving land uses shall not
be precluded by other development.
2.11 Coastal-dependent developments shall have priority over other developments on or near the
shoreline. Except as provided elsewhere in this division, coastal-dependent developments shall
not be sited in a wetland. When appropriate, coastal-related developments should be
accommodated within reasonable proximity to the coastal-dependent uses they support.
3. Protection of Visual Resources
3.0 Section 30251 of the Coastal Act set forth below, is incorporated herein as a policy of the
Land Use Plan.
Section 30251.
The scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as a resource of
public importance. Permitted development shall be sited and designed to protect views to and
along the ocean and scenic coastal areas, to minimize the alteration of natural land forms, to be
visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas, and, where feasible, to restore and
enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas. New development in highly scenic areas such
as those designated in the California Coastline Preservation and Recreation Plan prepared by the
Department of Parks and Recreation and by local government shall be subordinate to the
character of its setting.
3.1. No new development shall be allowed in the Riparian Buffer Zone along Arena Creek. Pre-
existing non-conforming uses may continue, but no additions that may encroach upon the Buffer
Zone shall be permitted, with the following exceptions:
    a. accessory structures located at the City's waste water reclamation facility situated entirely
    within the developed, fenced area subject to coastal development permitting requirements.
                                           X. Coastal, Page 43
3.2. No new development, excluding trails, shall be allowed closer than 100 feet from the edge
of a cliff or bluff top.
3.3. Five view sheds and scenic corridors are depicted on the Opportunities and Constraints Map
and shall be protected from development that would significantly block views or would not be
subordinate to the character of its setting These viewsheds/view corridors are: to the south from
School Street; along Windy Hollow Road; along and from Riverside Drive; along Port Road; at
Arena Cove.
3.4 The City shall analyze proposed property developments on the crest of hills and bluffs, and
in canyons, in relation to views potentially lost, in order to preserve important view corridors and
viewsheds, scenic roadways, gateways to the city, and the integrity and merits of existing land
forms.
3.5 Places on and along public roads, trails, parklands, and beaches that offer scenic vistas are
considered public viewing areas. Existing public roads where there are views of the ocean and
other scenic areas are considered Scenic Roads. Public parklands and riding and hiking trails
which contain public viewing areas. The LUP Opportunities and Constraints Map: “Biological
Resources and Trails” shows public trails and other areas accessible to the public that serve as
public viewing areas.
3.6 Places on, along, within, or visible from scenic roads, trails, beaches, parklands and state
waters that offer scenic vistas of the beach and ocean, coastline, mountains, canyons and other
unique natural features are considered Scenic Areas. Scenic Areas do not include inland areas
that are largely developed or built out such as residential subdivisions and existing commercial
development.
3.7 New development shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse impacts on scenic areas
visible from scenic roads or public viewing areas to the maximum feasible extent. If there is no
feasible building site location on the proposed project site where development would not be
visible, then the development shall be sited and designed to minimize impacts on scenic areas
visible from scenic highways or public viewing areas, through measures including, but not
limited to, siting development in the least visible portion of the site, breaking up the mass of new
structures, designing structures to blend into the natural hillside setting, restricting the building
maximum size, reducing maximum height standards, clustering development, minimizing
grading, incorporating landscape elements, and where appropriate, berming.
3.8 All proposed divisions of land and boundary line adjustments shall be analyzed for
consistency of potential future development with the visual resource protection policies of the
LCP, and no division of land or boundary line adjustment shall be approved if development of
resulting parcel(s) would be inconsistent with these policies.
                                           X. Coastal, Page 44

3.9 New development shall minimize removal of natural vegetation. Existing native trees and
plants shall be preserved on the site to the maximum extent feasible.
3.10 Signs shall be designed and located to minimize impacts to visual resources. Signs
approved as part of commercial development shall be incorporated into the design of the project
and shall be subject to height and width limitations that ensure that signs are visually compatible
with surrounding areas and protect scenic views.
3.11 Existing offsite outdoor advertising billboards shall be phased out and the construction of
new billboards is prohibited.
4. Off-shore Oil and Gas Development
In 1987 the City enacted Ordinance No. 124 which provides that development of on-shore
facilities intended to support off-shore oil and gas exploration must be approved by a majority of
voters in an election.
The City shall require a general plan amendment for any proposed on-shore facility to support
off-shore oil and gas exploration or development. Any such amendment shall not be effective
until a majority of the voters in Point Arena, in a general or special election, approve the
proposed amendment, unless such amendment is approved by the Coastal Commission pursuant
to Section 30515 of the Coastal Act.

         XI. GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION: AN OVERALL PROGRAM
1. INTRODUCTION
To be effective the goals and policies of this general plan must be put into effect and carried out.
 Implementation is the responsibility of the planning commission/city council. Within each
element described in the previous chapter programs or actions are set forth to indicate what steps
are necessary in each case to implement the general plan. The following is a summary focusing
on the major actions the city is required to or chooses to initiate.
2. STATE-MANDATED PLAN-IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS
There are required tasks or actions the city council must (by State law) undertake. Adoption of
the general plan goals and policies includes a commitment to taking the following actions:
1. Updating the Zoning Map to reflect the land-use designations on the Land-Use Plan map of
this general plan. This must be done, as a legislative act, according to provisions of the
California Government Code, within a reasonable time.
2. Updating of the city's Subdivision Ordinance to reflect the land-use element and other
policies of the General Plan, which policies and plan provisions must be set forth in ordinance
form (a legislative act) and certified by the Coastal Commission before they are effective.
According to State planning law this must occur within "a reasonable time" after General Plan
adoption. The target date is hereby established as within six months of General Plan adoption.
Revising the city's subdivision regulations and procedures should include setting forth land
division policies and standards, design standards, and conditions precedent to Tentative and
Final subdivision map approval, including requirements for dedications, exactions, and
development fees.
The city's subdivision ordinance must comply with the State's Subdivision Map Act
(Government Code Section 66410 et seq) with respect to land subdivisions, lot splits, and minor
subdivisions (parcel maps), and with respect to all procedural and filing matters. The ordinance
must also comply with and be adequate to carry out the provisions of the Local Coastal Program,
and it must be submitted to the California Coastal Commission for certification before it is
effective. In the meantime the city may establish interim measures to process subdivisions
provided they do not conflict with State law, and provided they are consistent with the General
Plan.
State law mandates that tentative maps shall not be approved if they fail to be consistent with the
State's Subdivision Map Act and the city's general plan/certified LCP (Government Code Section
66473.5). The specific requirements that must be met are set forth in the chapter on permitting of
this General Plan document and in the certified zoning ordinance. As is the case with all other
                                       XI. Implementation, Page 1
development, subdivisions shall only be approved if they are consistent with all of the applicable
provisions of the certified LCP.
3. An "Open Space Action Program" shall be prepared and adhered to in accordance with
Section 65564-65567 of the Government Code which, in addition to mandating the open space
action program, requires (a) that any action by which identified open space land or any interest
therein is acquired or disposed of, or its use restricted or regulated, shall be consistent with the
Open Space Element of the General Plan, and (b) that no building permit can be issued, no
subdivision map approved, and no open space zoning regulations adopted, unless the proposed
construction, subdivision, or ordinance is consistent with said element.
Accordingly, implementation of the General Plan with respect to open space involves adoption
of an "open space action program" and appropriate open space zoning regulations.
4. As required by State planning law, preparing a capital improvement program in order to spell
out the public needs for public buildings, facilities and infrastructure. The CIP must be reviewed
annually, and updated periodically. The annual review must include a finding that the program is
consistent with the General Plan, and with any amended General Plan, pursuant to Sections
65400, 65401 of the Government Code.
The city and all other public agencies having property within the city shall submit to the city a
list of proposed public works projects recommended for the ensuing fiscal year, and the city shall
prepare a report as to the conformity of said project with the General Plan.
Under Section 65402 no real property shall be acquired by dedication or otherwise for a street,
square, public park or other public purpose, and no public building or structure authorized or
constructed, until such proposed action has been submitted to the planning commission and a
report made as to conformity with the General Plan.
5. Receiving recommendations from the planning commission regarding means for
implementing the General Plan, so that the General Plan will serve as an effective guide for
orderly growth and development, preservation and conservation of open space and natural
resources, and the efficient expenditure of public funds relating to the subjects addressed in the
General Plan. A progress report on such matters shall be prepared annually. (Government Code,
Section 65400).
When required by Government Code Section 65915, the City shall grant a density bonus that
allows the applicant to build a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 35% more units than a
property’s zoning would ordinarily allow, if the City finds:
A. The project is for any one of the types of residential projects described in Government Code
Section 65915(b);
B. The project complies with all standards set forth in Government Code Section 65915;
                                       XI. Implementation, Page 2

C. The project is a housing development consisting of five or more units.
In accordance with Government Code Section 65915 (g), the density bonus shall be calculated
based on the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning
ordinance and land use element of the LCP. The “otherwise maximum allowable residential
density” shall mean the maximum density determined by applying all site-specific environmental
development constraints applicable under the zoning ordinance and land use plan certified by the
Coastal Commission.
Any housing development approved pursuant to Government Code Section 65915 shall be
consistent with all applicable certified local coastal program policies and development standards.
In reviewing a proposed density increase, the City shall identify all feasible means of
accommodating the density increase and consider the effects of such means on coastal resources.
The City shall only grant a density increase if the City determines that the means of
accommodating the density increase proposed by the applicant does not have an adverse effect
on coastal resources. If, however, the City determines that the means for accommodating the
density increase proposed by the applicant will have an adverse effect on coastal resources, the
City shall not grant the density increase.
In addition to a density bonus, the City shall grant to a housing development that complies with
the provisions of Section A. above, one of the incentives or concessions identified in
Government Code Section 65915(h), unless the City finds that an incentive or concession is not
required in order to provide for affordable housing costs or rents. In reviewing a proposed
incentive or concession, the City shall consider all feasible alternative incentives and
concessions and their effects on coastal resources. The City shall only grant an incentive or
concession if the City determines that the development incentive or concession requested by an
applicant pursuant to this section will not have any adverse effects on coastal resources. The City
may grant one or more of those incentives or concessions that do not have an adverse effect on
coastal resources. If all feasible incentives or concessions would have an adverse effect on
coastal resources, the City shall not grant any incentive or concession.
For the purposes of this section, “coastal resources” means any resource which is afforded
protection under the policies of Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act, California Public Resources Code
section 30200 et seq., including but not limited to public access, marine and other aquatic
resources, environmentally sensitive habitat, and the visual quality of coastal areas.
7. Adopting a special ordinance, or a Zoning Ordinance amendment, that provides for the
construction of second dwelling units on already-developed residential lots, for rental purposes
only, as required by the California Government Code.
8. As necessary, amending or adopting ordinances that will ensure that the city is in local
compliance with State building and housing regulations, including regulations for fire safety,
emergency responses, noise insulation, soils reports, earthquake protection, energy conservation,
and access for the physically handicapped.
                                        XI. Implementation, Page 3

9. Adopting policies and procedures for environmental review in accordance with the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines; establishing that the City is
responsible for an Environmental Impact Report's (EIR's) adequacy and objectivity even though
the EIR may be prepared by others; and reserving the right to determine who may prepare an
EIR on any public or private project proposal for which it (the City) is the Lead Agency.
10. Preparing a noise ordinance that is consistent with and implements the Noise Element of this
General Plan and includes monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.
11. Adopting such other programs as may be necessary, appropriate and feasible to implement
the housing, community safety and other elements of this General Plan.
12. Adhering to the provisions of the present Zoning Ordinance (Section 6.08) with respect to
the making of findings prior to granting variances and use permits and coastal development
permits, which provisions are consistent with the mandates of California case law governing
situations whereby the City must issue written findings in certain circumstances.
3. ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THIS
GENERAL PLAN
The following are other actions the City intends taking in order to implement the policies and
provisions of this General Plan; they are not state-mandated but are found to be prudent for
proper implementation of this plan:
1. Reaffirm existing Zoning Ordinance provisions requiring soil and geologic investigations
prior to the issuance of a development permit and the commencement of property improvements
where appropriate and where required by the Zoning Ordinance.
2. Develop a downtown core/Main Street plan and program in order to (a) establish at least one
off-street parking lot, and (b) ensure improvements in the area's appearance and amenities,
including sidewalk and curb improvements, benches, and street tree plantings.
3. Adopt a precise plan for establishing acceptable levels of risk in the event of an earthquake,
and for bringing existing structures up to code.
4. Prepare and adopt a Historic and Architectural Preservation element of the General Plan.
(The basis for this element has been prepared by the State of California and a copy of that report
is available at City Hall).
5. Adopt an ordinance or procedure permitting the use of Development Agreements between the
City and developers of large
parcels of land, as per Section 65865 of the Government Code.
In connection with sizeable projects where Development Agreements are entered into
                                       XI. Implementation, Page 4
consideration may well be given to utilization of the "Mello-Roos Bonds" financing scheme.
This method allows establishment of a special financing district designed to relieve general
taxpayers of the burden of paying for new infrastructure serving new subdivisions or
developments. The bonds, in such cases, are paid off by the newly-housed property owners and
are secured by the value of the property within the subdivision or new development. These are
not public obligations. (See more below under "Financing Implementation of the General Plan).
6. Adopt an ordinance or procedure permitting the use of the Specific Plan provisions of the
Government Code Sections 65450- 65457, which allow for the preparation and adoption of
detailed plans and programs for special areas or projects, including projects involving the use of
Development Agreements. Specific Plans may be prepared and submitted by property owners
for consideration by the City, or may be prepared and adopted by the City for special planning
areas. In both cases Specific Plans can supersede or serve as a substitute for standard zoning
regulations for the property in subject to the plan, however Specific Plans shall be submitted to
the Coastal Commission for certification as an LCP amendment before they are effective.
7. Put into effect the provisions of the General Plan related to guaranteeing the provision of
infrastructure as part of the development process by amending existing ordinances or adopting a
new one, setting forth such procedures, filing fees, development fee schedules, and provisions
for dedications and exactions as may be necessary to implement the General Plan and ensure that
costs or needs generated by a development, such as infrastructure, are paid according to a
fair-share formula by those who are seeking permission to develop land within the city's
jurisdiction. The imposition of development fees is governed by State law (AB 1600), which
requires preparation by the City of detailed economic/fiscal analyses to justify the fees to be
charged. Moreover, there must be supportable direct "nexus" between the fees charged and the
development being charged the fee.
8. Reaffirm, and amend as necessary to make consistent with the General Plan, the City's
existing ordinances and Zoning Ordinance provisions related to off-street parking, sewer
connection requirements and fees, landscaping and screening, and the placement and design of
signs.
9. Adopt standards of site and building design for use by the Design Assistance Committee.
10. Develop a program to enforce safety standards and architectural design standards for the
design of new structures, and the rehabilitation of existing structures, and to enforce violations of
grading and site preparation ordinances and Zoning Ordinance provisions.
11. Adopt provisions and standards for inclusion in the Zoning Ordinance which will implement
the General Plan policy for mandatory use of the Planned Residential Development procedure as
required in the several residential land-use/zoning categories, where the parcel at the time of
adoption of the General Plan is ten (10) acres or more.
12. Consider the adoption of a redevelopment project for the core area as a possibly available
means for implementing the General Plan and attacking problems of urban decay and Downtown
                                       XI. Implementation, Page 5
economic development. The California Redevelopment Law gives cities extraordinary powers
and authority to use "tax increment financing" and federal/state programs and assistance to
initiate improvements and to pay for needed infrastructure through the establishment of plans
and agreements with land owners and developers which are based on both public goals and the
needs of the business community. Redevelopment in other cities has
permitted projects to improve access, circulation and parking, to foster job creation, to build
"affordable" housing, to develop physical improvement programs such as improved facades,
installation of sidewalks, creation of parking lots, rehabilitation of historic buildings,
improvement of parklands, and to rebuild failing sewage collection and treatment facilities and
establish or update drainage and runoff facilities.
13. Prepare an up-to-date sewage/wastewater treatment/drainage plan and capital improvement
program.
14. Adopt a local ordinance to regulate local point sources to control air pollutant discharges
and to not allow any development which would result in singly or cumulatively causing violation
of any regional, county or state ambient air quality plan or standard, or the location or expansion
of any use that would emit more than 0.05 tons of emissions per day, and to limit wood- burning
stove and fireplace emissions.
15. Prepare and adopt such new plans, ordinances, and regulations, or amend existing ones, that
protect and defend citizens and property alike against threats and danger from fire, seismic, soil
erosion, surface runoff, and natural hazards, and that make provisions for emergency facilities
and services.
Included should be regulations assuring adequate mitigation of safety hazards on sites having a
history or threats of safety hazards, seismic activity, inundation from surface runoff or flooding,
and fire. Also included should be proper drainage facilities and mitigation of possible impacts
that may be experienced downstream of development sites during and after construction. Safety
standards for design of new and existing structures, and geologic/seismic/soils investigations
should continue to be prepared and reviewed, as per the Zoning Ordinance, and required prior to
issuance of permits for all developments proposed on sites prone to erosion or instability.
16. Undertake road improvements as identified in the Transportation Element, and integrate
required improvements in to the Capital Improvement Program in order to achieve Level of
Service (LOS) objectives of the General Plan.
17. Utilize the established Rule 20 program to maximize the undergrounding of existing utility
facilities and establish underground districts to facilitate underground utility facilities for new
developments.
18. In order to meet the social service goals of the General Plan, the City will work with the
school district to ensure (a) maximum joint use of school facilities and grounds, and city parks,
for the special needs of children, youth, and senior
citizens, and (b) use of public school sites for before- and after-school child care, and (c)
                                       XI. Implementation, Page 6
development of indoor and outdoor facilities and recreation opportunities for teens.
19. Prepare and adopt a Specific Plan for Arena Cove, according to the Guidelines set forth in
the Harbor Commercial Area (HC) land-use designation, and in accordance with the provisions
of State planning law governing the use and status of Specific Plans.
20. Prepare precise amendments to the Zoning Ordinance to provide for the Home Occupation
Permit.
4. FINANCING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The City may use a variety of methods to finance the facilities, services and infrastructure
needed to implement the General Plan.
There are six principal funding sources:
1. Taxes. The City levies taxes to raise revenue for general government purposes. The property
tax is the principal one; it depends upon the assessed value of property in the city, and as
assessed values rise so do city revenues. Other taxes are sales taxes, admission's taxes,
hotel/motel room taxes, parking taxes, payroll and gross receipts taxes, and business license
taxes. By a two-thirds favorable vote of the people the city may also levy special taxes to finance
specific facilities and services. Not all of the allowable taxes listed above are levied in Point
Arena. The sales and room taxes currently produce most of the city's tax revenue.
The Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 authorizes cities to create community facility
districts and to levy special taxes within these districts to finance new public improvements,
police and fire protection, and school construction.
2. Special Assessments. These are for funding construction of such physical improvements as
sidewalks, sewers, streets, storm drainage facilities, lighting, and flood control. Special
assessment bonds are the traditional tool for accomplishing these purposes for the benefit of
property owners within a given area.
3. Bonds. General Obligation bonds are secured by local government's ability to levy property
taxes and are intended to raise funds for citywide benefits. Revenue bonds are secured by the
proceeds from the enterprise or service they fund.
4. Exactions. These are dedications of land, improvements, or in-lieu payments that are
imposed on new developments to ensure or fund the construction of capital facilities. The
California Subdivision Map Act specifically authorizes cities and counties to impose exactions
on subdivision maps and parcel maps. Exactions may be levied upon developments to cause the
construction of low- and moderate-income housing as a condition of map approvals or other
permits.
                                       XI. Implementation, Page 7
5. Impact/Development Fees. The power to charge fees is available to the city in order to
finance a specific activity, facility or service which confers as direct, identifiable benefit on those
paying the fee. The Subdivision Map Act authorizes a city to impose fees in lieu of dedication
of lands or improvements as a condition of subdivision approval. At present, there is a city
ordinance authorizing collection of in-lieu fees for off-street parking in connection with new
developments Downtown. Other fees are sewer connection fees, sewer standby fees, processing
fees, large-scale urban development fees, and user fees.
6. State Funding. In addition to funds that are collected in the city and returned to the city by
the state, the gas tax and the DMV fees being the most significant, the California Legislature has
created a broad range of categorical programs of grants and loans which local governments use
to finance the implementation of their general plans. These include funds for energy
conservation programs, historic preservation, affordable housing, noise mitigation, parks and
recreation facilities, solid waste management, preservation and enhancements of coastal
resources, and trafficways. All state programs are subject to change and availability of funding.
7. Federal Funding. The federal government also has a broad range of grant and loan programs.
Most are available from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the
most immediately available program is the Community Development Block Grant program,
which may be used to fund urban redevelopment, housing, and public facility projects. The
Small Cities component of this block grant program is administered by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development. The U.S. Department of Commerce's
Economic Development Administration makes grants and loans to local governments for public
works and economic development projects. All federal programs are also subject to change and
to availability of funds.
                                         XI. Implementation, Page 8
    XII. PROJECT REVIEW & PERMITTING: REQUIREMENTS & PROCEDURES
1. PERMITS
Located throughout this General Plan document are policies and regulations that place limits or
conditions on, or prescribe desirable outcomes for, the alteration, usage, site preparation and
development of all parcels in the city, or seek to secure for the benefit of the general public
dedications of land and exactions as part of the development process. These policies and
regulations may apply to the city, other public agencies, and property owners alike, depending
upon the particular policy, regulation or circumstance.
In this chapter these various regulations and conditions, and the circumstances under which they
apply, are summarized. Reference should be made in each case to the General Plan element
where the policies are set forth, or to existing city ordinances or State codes.
1. Zoning Regulations and Permits. Every parcel of land in Point Arena has a zoning
classification, and for each classification, with the exception of the Industrial zone, there are
listings of principal permitted uses (uses permitted by right) and conditional uses (uses permitted
only by use permit if certain conditions are met, at the discretion of the planning
commission/city council). As well, in the Zoning Ordinance, each zone has been assigned
certain "standards of development" that must be adhered to, such as, for example, building set
back and yard requirements, building height limits, open space provisions, landscaping and
screening. All development, whether for a principal permitted use or conditional use, shall
require a coastal development permit that may be approved with conditions.
The most significant public policy governing each residential parcel, in addition to its permitted
and conditional uses, is its density: the number of dwelling units permitted on the amount of
land available.
Reference should be made to the Zoning Ordinance and the Zoning Map for the particulars with
respect to each lot in the city.
Zone changes (i.e, the changing of a zoning classification on any parcel of land) after adoption of
the General Plan may not by State law occur without there first being an official amendment to
the Land-Use Element of the General Plan and a Coastal Commission-approved amendment to
the City's Local Coastal Program (LCP). (See also the chapter in this document regarding
General Plan amendments).
2. Subdivision Regulations and Approvals/Denials. All parcels for which there are proposals to
subdivide into two or more parcels are subject to the city's subdivision ordinance and to coastal
development permitting requirements. All subdivisions are subject to the provisions and policies
of the Certified LCP, and require a coastal development permit.
                                       XII. Review/Permits, Page 1
Parcels may be subdivided only if consistent with the Subdivision Map Act, California Coastal
Act, and the City’s certified LCP. The State Subdivision Map act is absolute and specific with
respect to (a) the time frames within which decisions must be made by the City, and (b)
situations mandating denial by the City of a Tentative Map.
The Act mandates that a proposed subdivision not be approved if the City Council makes any of
the following findings:
    a. the map is inconsistent with the General Plan.
    b. the site is not physically suitable for the type or density of the development proposed.
    c. the design or improvements are likely to cause substantial environmental damage or
    substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat
    d. the subdivision is likely to cause serious public health problems.
    e. the design or types of improvements will conflict with easements of record acquired by the
    public at large for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. (See
    California Subdivision Map Act).
Since proposed subdivisions are defined as "projects" under CEQA they also are subject to
environmental review prior to approval of tentative and parcel maps, and findings must be made
regarding potential environmental damage. In addition, since subdivisions are “development” as
defined by the Coastal Act, they are subject to coastal development permitting requirements.
The California Subdivision Map Act sets forth in detail specific requirements which may be
imposed by local ordinance, including but not limited to dedications of lands for public purposes,
fees for various public purposes, certain investigations and reports, grading and erosion control
standards, public access to public resources, energy conservation, standards and criteria for
public improvements, various design and improvement standards, and environmental protection
standards.
The Coastal Act sets forth in Section 30600(a) that a coastal development permit must be
obtained before development is undertaken in the coastal zone. “Development” is defined in
Coastal Act Section 30106 to expressly include subdivisions. That statute provides in relevant
part that development includes:
change in the density or intensity of the use of land, including, but not limited to subdivision
pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act (commencing with Section 66410 of the Government
Code), and any other division of land, including lot splits.
Thus, in addition to any approval required by the California Subdivision Map Act, the Coastal
Act requires a CDP before lands within the coastal zone may be subdivided.
                                        XII. Review/Permits, Page 2

3. Environmental Review (CEQA actions). The environmental review process is mandated by
State law (The California Environmental Quality Act - CEQA) and is administered by the City
on behalf of the State in order to implement State environmental goals and in order to ensure that
the public is fully informed as to possible negative environmental impacts associated with a
proposed land use or development project whether public or private. The process can be
complicated and time consuming where a large-scale, potentially environmentally-damaging or
controversial project is under consideration, or where mitigation measures require continuing
study and/or agreements between the project proponent and the City. For most small projects the
environmental review process is handled in connection with securing a zone change, minor
subdivision approval, or use permit.
The process for review is set forth in the State's "CEQA Guidelines", as are the obligations of the
City to conduct proper environmental review. The City must follow CEQA procedures, and
ensure that Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs) or Negative Declarations are objective, that
they are prepared by individuals or firms acceptable to the City Council, and that the
environmental document reflects the independent judgment of the City, which is responsible for
the adequacy and objectivity of any EIR or Negative Declaration.
4. Design Review Approvals. In order to implement the overall public appearance policies of
the General Plan, as well as the building and site design standards, the historic preservation and
architectural standards, the off-street parking standards, and the sign standards of the Zoning
Ordinance, most substantial alterations and all new developments other than single-family
dwelling projects, are subject to review by and approval of the Design Assistance Committee
before a building permit can be issued. The significance of design review and the role of the
Design Assistance Committee is hereby confirmed.
The features of any site or building design that shall be subject to design review are: landscaping
and screening (Section 5.14) and architectural and historic significance (Section 5.16).
5. Coastal Development Permits. Since all of Point Arena is within the State coastal zone,
coastal development permits are required under provisions of the California Coastal Act for all
proposed “development” as defined in Section 30106 of the Coastal Act and as listed in the
General Plan/LCP glossary and in all circumstances set forth in the Act. The standard of review
when considering an application for or appeal of a CDP is the City's "Local Coastal Program
(LCP", which is comprised of the General Plan, otherwise known as the Land Use Plan,
including the Opportunities and Constraints Maps and not including the Housing Element, the
Land Use and Development Map and associated support documents and the Implementation Plan
(IP), which includes the Zoning Ordinance, Zoning Map and Second Dwelling Ordinance. The
standard of review for projects located between the first through road and the sea shall be the
certified LCP and the public access and recreation policies of the Coastal Act. The City shall
attach conditions to ensure compliance with the LCP and shall "make findings" as a precedent to
adopting any conditions. Actions taken by the City to amend the LCP are not legally final, nor
may development be approved under the proposed amended provisions, until the Commission
has certified the LCP or any amendment to it and such certification becomes effective consistent
                                       XII. Review/Permits, Page 3

with Section 13544 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations.. (See Sections 6.02 and
6.03 of the Zoning Ordinance.)
Properties designated AE-Agricultural Exclusive in this General Plan may not be re-designated
or rezoned, or a Coastal Development Permit issued, unless and until it is found that the proposal
complies with the following sections of the California Coastal Act: 30212, 30241, 30241.5 and
30243.
City ordinances should be amended where appropriate to place a two-year time limit for
commencement of development authorized by Coastal Development Permits, with extensions
possible with City Council approval.
6. Site Preparation . The removal of existing residential buildings, the alteration of existing land
forms including tree removal and any grading, or any action that might affect any stream or
riparian area, or natural habitat, shall not proceed without a coastal development and any other
necessary permits first being secured from the City to do so, subject to all applicable policies and
provisions of the LCP.
7. Use Permits and Variances. Where use permits are required by the Zoning Ordinance, the
public policy intent is to give the City discretion as to whether a "conditional use permit" may be
acceptable, and if so under what specific conditions. Conditional uses, as contrasted to principal
permitted uses, are not allowed by right. They may be permitted, or not permitted, at the
discretion of the City Council, and if they are permitted the City may attach conditions to ensure
compliance with and implementation of the policies of the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and
other relevant city ordinances and State statutes. The conditions must be related to a public
purpose, environmental goal or policy, or matter of public safety as set forth in the General Plan
and Zoning Ordinance, or in other City ordinances. The City is obliged by California case law to
"make findings" as a precedent to adopting any conditions.
The requirements governing the use permit process, as well as the variance process, are set forth
in Section 6.08 of the Zoning Ordinance, and are hereby reaffirmed.
8. Sewer Connection Policies and Requirements. Current City policies as set forth in the city
sewer ordinance shall continue to remain in effect and shall be implemented.
9. Planned Residential Developments. In all instances where the initial planning area (parcel,
portion of a parcel, one or more entire parcels or portions of one or more parcels, as shown on
the latest County Assessor's rolls) is ten (10) acres or more or any two or more abutting parcels
of less than 10 acres in the same ownership or under the same control totals 10 acres or more, the
Planned Residential Development procedure as defined in the Zoning Ordinance and Glossary
shall be followed and adhered to.
Any land owner/developer may voluntarily elect to use this procedure in other residential zones
or for planning areas less than ten (10) acres.
                                       XII. Review/Permits, Page 4
This procedure shall be provided for in the Zoning Ordinance, which shall set forth the specific
steps required to secure a Planned Residential Development approval. The objectives of the
procedure are (a) to allow and encourage flexibility and creativity in lot layout and design, and in
building placement and design, and to relax conventional standards for minimum required yards,
street widths and street pavement widths, lot sizes, and building types; and (b) to require as a
condition of plan approval the designation of a fixed percentage of the planning area of a
planned residential project in any residentially-zoned area as open space (see Open Space
Element for definitions and methods of providing open space). Flexibility of use types and
encouragement of mixed uses are additional objectives.
In all such planned development proposals the City may also require that "development
agreements" (as defined by Sections 65864-65869.5 of the California Government Code and as
summarized in the Glossary) be executed between itself and the land owner/developer. However,
any such development agreement may only be approved consistent with the provisions of the
certified LCP.
The underlying zone within which this procedure shall or may apply shall be set forth in the
Zoning Ordinance and on the Zoning Map. Said zone shall set forth permitted and conditionally
permitted uses, as well as the maximum residential densities allowed.
10. Geologic Studies. As required by Sections 5.20 and 5.21 of the city's existing Zoning
Ordinance, proposed development approval in all zones shall continue to be subject to a
determination by the Planning Commission that proposed developments shall not significantly
increase erosion and slope instability, or be subject to risk from ground shaking, and that all
adverse environmental impacts will have been mitigated prior to or as part of the development
process. The Planning Commission's determination shall be based on an independent report by a
registered geologist, a certified engineering geologist, or a professional civil engineer with
expertise in soils or foundation engineering.
11. Wetland and Sensitive Habitat Mitigation Review. As a condition for a Coastal
Development Permit the Planning Commission shall require that a developer mitigate impacts to
wetland or other sensitive habitat areas as a result of earth moving, diking, dredging, filling and
excavation. Mitigation may include restoration, open space dedications, dike or fill removal, and
plantings. Approvals may be denied if proposed mitigation measures are not satisfactory. The
Planning Commission is required by law to be, and shall continue to be, governed by Sections
5.22, 5.23 and 5.27 of the City Zoning Ordinance, and by both federal and state wetland
regulations, and by the federal Endangered Species Act, if and where applicable in Point Arena.
12. Performance Bonds. A common means for ensuring that infrastructure is built according to
plan and as agreed to as part of the development approval process, or landscaping and screening
is installed, or other conditions met, is the posting with the City of a performance bond by the
developer. The City will study this technique and be ready to employ it where necessary or
prudent to guarantee project performance according to the city's expectations and standards.
                                       XII. Review/Permits, Page 5
2. THE NECESSITY FOR FINDINGS
Under the following circumstances the City is required by California case law and the California
Coastal Act to set forth in writing how it arrives at certain land-use decisions...especially when
acting in a non- legislative capacity. The record must show the legally-relevant subconclusions
that reveal the City's mode of analysis in arriving at a final decision. There must be evidence in
the record to support all findings (staff reports, written and oral testimony, EIRs or Negative
Declarations, exhibits, etc.).
Findings of fact are not normally required for legislative acts: adoption of ordinances and
rezonings for example, although there are several exceptions. (For legislative acts, consistency
requirements must be met).
Findings of fact are required in the following circumstances: when the City issues a variance,
conditional use permit, tentative subdivision map approval or denial, development agreement
approval, design review approval, planned residential or commercial development approval, or
any other permit relating to matters addressed in the General Plan and required by a city
ordinance. For all approvals of Coastal Development Permits, the City must make findings that
the proposed development is in conformity with the Local Coastal Program, and for development
between the nearest public road and the sea, shall also include a specific finding that the
development is in conformity with the public access and recreation policies of Chapter 3 of the
Coastal Act.
Section 6.08 of the City's Zoning Ordinance implements California requirements by setting forth
the findings of fact that must be made prior to the taking of any action to deny, approve, or
approve with conditions, an application for a permit.
Moreover, The State Subdivision Map Act specifies that findings must be made when approving
a Tentative Map, or when denying one. The City's list of findings of fact that must be made in
writing is as follows (Section 6.08 of the Zoning Ordinance):
A. That the proposed development at the size and intensity contemplated, and at the proposed
location, will provide a development that is necessary or desirable for, and compatible with, the
neighborhood or the community; and
B. That such use as proposed will not be detrimental to the health, safety, convenience or general
welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to property improvements or
potential development in the vicinity, with respect to aspects including but not limited to the
following:
    1) The nature of the proposed site, including its size and shape, and the proposed size, shape
    and arrangement of structures;
                                       XII. Review/Permits, Page 6
    2) The accessibility and traffic pattern for persons and vehicles, and the type and volume of
    such traffic, and the adequacy of proposed off-street parking and loading;
    3) The safeguards afforded to prevent noxious or offensive emissions such as noise, glare,
    dust and odor;
    4) Treatment given, as appropriate, to such aspects as landscaping, screening, open spaces,
    parking and loading areas, service areas, lighting and signs; and
    C. That such use or feature as proposed will comply with the applicable provisions of this
    ordinance, will be consistent with the policies and programs of the Land Use Plan and will
    assist in carrying out and be in conformity with the Point Arena Coastal Program; and
    D. That the proposed use or feature will have no significant adverse environmental impact or
    there are no feasible alternatives, or feasible mitigation measures, as provided in the
    California Environmental Quality Act, available, which would substantially lessen any
    significant, adverse impact that the actions allowed by the conditional use permit may have
    on the environment.
3. MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT
Requirements and conditions attached to permits issued by the city often require compliance by
the permittee and imply monitoring and enforcement by city officials. Section 6.09 of the
existing Zoning Ordinance states that "violation of any specification or condition...imposed shall
constitute a violation of this ordinance and may constitute grounds for revocation of
the...permit". Section 6.15 sets forth the procedure for permit revocation. Sections 7.01 through
7.05 further prescribe the duties and authority of the City Clerk to enforce the Zoning Ordinance.
 (Section 7.01 shall be amended to include all land-use violations).
With respect to State laws, such as the Subdivision Map Act, the Coastal Act, and the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City is obliged not only to act within the laws and to
implement them locally, but also to ensure that they are lived up to in all their particulars.
Reference is made to each act for the provisions that detail enforcement procedures, including
Coastal Act Sections 30800 – 30822.
Under California law, cities may by ordinance adopt procedures setting forth enforcement
processes, including mandatory citation hearings and the imposition of infractions. More serious
violations may be brought as legal actions in superior court.
                                       XII. Review/Permits, Page 7

4. CONSISTENCY IS REQUIRED
The city is required by State law to base its land-use and development controls (including zoning
and subdivision regulations) on its general plan policies. This means the controls and
regulations in effect in Point Arena must be "consistent" with (conform to and not conflict with)
the city's General Plan.
Consistency must exist between tentative and final map approvals, zoning ordinance and map
changes, and a host of other actions. It must also exist among the various elements of the
General Plan itself, including the Coastal Element, given that the entire City of Point Arena is in
the Coastal Zone.
Consistency with the General Plan (and consistency findings also may be required) is either
required or advised when the City Council adopts or approves any of the following:
      Amendments to the zoning ordinance or map;
      Subdivision and other General Plan implementing ordinances;
      Adoption of any new General Plan element;
      Adoption of a capital improvement program;
      Creation of a redevelopment project area and plan;
      Adoption of the State-mandated open space action program;
      Approval of assisted housing programs and projects;
      Adoption of any ordinance requiring dedications, fees, and exactions in connection
        with any development approval or permitting procedures;
      Development agreements;
      Specific plans as the term is defined by state planning law;
      Issuance of conditional use permits;
      Adoption of design review procedures,

5. RIGHTS OF THE REGULATED
The California Legislature has adopted the Permit Streamlining Act (Section 65920 et seq of the
Government Code) to require that localities clearly specify the requirements which must be met
in connection with the approval or denial of development projects, and to expedite decisions on
such projects. The Act requires cities and counties to follow a standardized process and to finish
their review within strict time limits. Cities are required to compile one or more lists specifying
in detail the information needed from a project applicant, and to make such list or lists available
to anyone who requests them.
Reference to the Act itself is an essential responsibility of the City Council and the City Clerk,
whose duties include complying with this act in all of its particulars.
In addition, property owners and developers who are subject to city policies and requirements
are entitled to the constitutional rights of equal protection and due process. Accordingly, the
City must act reasonably in exercising its planning and zoning powers, must give proper notices,
and must make proper findings where findings by state law or local ordinances are required.
Above all, the city must take its actions in procedurally correct fashion, for it is here that suits
brought by citizens against cities and counties are most often upheld by the courts: for failure to
correctly follow the procedures outlined by California law and local ordinances, and for failing
to properly make the necessary findings in writing, for not conducting the necessary public
hearings, and for failing to follow the letter of CEQA.
Furthermore, the City is obligated to avoid land-use regulations that are unduly restrictive so that
an action or decision causes a "taking" of a landowner's property without just compensation. As
well, land-use regulations must substantially advance a legitimate public purpose or interest.
The issue of unlawful "takings" is the subject of much litigation throughout the United States and
is not discussed here, except to make two valid statements: (a) "too much regulation" can be the
basis for legal action, but "too much" is difficult to define except on a case- by-case basis, and
(b) the courts tend toward giving cities the benefit of the doubt with respect to the adoption of
local regulations, provided they do not damage property through a taking, violate civil rights, or
deny due process and equal protection. Consistent with Coastal Act Section 30010, the Point
Arena Certified LCP is not intended, and shall not be construed as authorizing the City to
exercise its power to grant or deny a permit in a manner which will take or damage private
property for public use, without the payment of just compensation therefore. The LCP is not
intended to increase or decrease the rights of any owner of property under the Constitution of the
State of California or the United States.

                    XIII. GENERAL PLAN REVIEW AND AMENDMENTS
Once adopted the General Plan is the official statement of policies and programs required by
California planning law to direct and guide decision-makers in determining the city's appropriate
physical development. However, it is not a fixed and static document in that it may and should
be amended from time to time, and should be updated approximately each five years.
Once certified by the California Coastal Commission, the General Plan and all its associated
maps and subsequent amendments will become the Land Use Plan (LUP) portion of the Point
Arena Local Coastal Program (LCP) as required by the California Coastal Act.
State law permits up to four General Plan amendments per year. (Section 65358[b]). The
California Coastal Act permits no more than three LCP amendment applications to the California
Coastal Commission per calendar year (Coastal Act Section 30514) Any citizen wishing to
amend the plan should follow the rules and procedures for doing so that may be adopted from
time to time by the city council and which are incorporated into the zoning ordinance. The
council shall be governed and guided by the same rules and procedures. Environmental review
as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) will be required of every
proposed General Plan amendment.
No amended land-use designation or zoning map change, or Zoning Ordinance amendment, or
other proposal to amend a land-use ordinance, or to adopt any new land-use policies or
regulations, may be processed without there first being a General Plan amendment. Any such
change shall be accompanied by a development plan, or other documentation, of sufficient scope
and detail as to make it possible for the public and the city council to ascertain the potential
impacts of the proposed use, project, or change on the site, the surrounding area, and the city as a
whole. What constitutes "sufficient detail" shall be determined by the planning commission and
city council and shall include information consistent with the definitions of Land Use Plan and
Implementing Actions contained in Sections 30108.5 and 30108.4 of the Coastal Act and shall
include the filing information required for a Local Coastal Program amendment pursuant to
Section 13553 of Title 14 California Code of Regulations. Any decision on a General Plan
amendment must be supported by findings that the proposed amendment is (a) in the public
interest, (b) is consistent with the rest of the General Plan, (c) will not cause negative
environmental impacts, and (d) has been processed in accordance with the applicable planning
provisions of the California Government Code and CEQA. Any and all amendments to the Local
Coastal Program must be certified by the California Coastal Commission for certification before
the amendment can take effect.
At adoption the City Council needs to confirm that this General Plan will be comprehensively
reviewed not later than five years from the date of adoption. This time frame is mandatory for
the Housing Element (Government Code Section 65588). It is to be borne in mind that any
amendment to any one element may impact on the integrity of the remaining elements, so a
favorable finding needs to be made in the case of each amendment that the element being
amended will not cause any inconsistency among or conflict with the various other elements of
this plan.

require in order to have a full picture of a development proposal and its likely impacts.
Conditional Use. Use that is not an entitlement or use by right, which may or may not be
acceptable to the City, or may be acceptable only if certain conditions are met. At its sole
discretion the City may or may not issue a Conditional Use Permit, or may, after making
appropriate findings, attach such reasonable conditions as it sees fit and are in the public interest,
which conditions are binding on the owner/developer.

dB. (decibel) A unit of sound measurement used to express the relative intensity of a sound.
The decibel measuring scale is logarithmic. Zero (0 dB) on the scale is the lowest sound level
that a normal ear can detect under very quiet ("laboratory") conditions, and is referred to as the
"threshold of hearing."
dB(A). Sound pressure level in decibels (dB) as measured on a sound level meter using the "A-
weighted" filter network. "A-weighting" de-emphasizes very low and very high frequencies in a
manner similar to the response of the human ear. An increase of 10 dB(A) is equivalent to a
doubling in perceived sound level. When used by itself, dB(A) denotes either a sound level at a
given instant, a maximum level, or a steady-state level.
Dedication. The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and the
acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public
function for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites, open spaces, or
other public uses often are made conditions for City approval of a development.
Dedication, In lieu of. Cash payments which may be required of an owner or developer as a
substitute for a dedication of land, usually calculated in dollars per lot or square foot of land or
building area, and referred to as "in lieu fees" or "in lieu contributions."
Density. For housing, density is the number of permanent residential dwelling units per gross
amount of land. All densities specified in the General Plan are expressed in maximum number
of units per gross acre or square feet. Density can be controlled through zoning in the following
ways: minimum lot-size requirements, floor area ratio, land use-intensity ratio, setback and yard
requirements, minimum house-size requirements, ratios comparing number and types of housing
units to land area, limits on units per acre, and other means. Maximum allowable density often
serves as the major distinction between residential districts.
Density Bonus. The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate
additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the
parcel is zoned, usually in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity, or inclusion
of affordable housing units, at the same site or at another location. Density bonuses governed by
Government Code Section 65915 are defined as a density increase over the otherwise maximum
                                             Glossary, Page 7
allowable residential density under the applicable zoning ordinance and land use element of the
general plan as of the date of application by the applicant to the city, county, or city and county.
The applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus. The amount of density
bonus to which the applicant is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the
percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the percentage established in subdivision (b) of
Government Code Section 65915.
Design Assistance/Design Review. The process of subjecting a development proposal to
technical and public scrutiny and review, and to possible modification, in order to ensure that
suitable attention is given in site and building design to landscaping and screening, preservation
of natural resources, preservation of architectural and significant historic resources, preservation
of coastal resources, and to site planning. A "design assistance committee" is authorized by the
Zoning Ordinance to carry out the city's design assistance and review functions.
Developable Acres, Net. The portion of a site remaining after removing or deducting public or
private road rights-of-way and land not developable, and which can then be built upon. Net
acreage includes required yards or setbacks.
Developable Land. Land which is suitable as a location for structures or uses and which can be
developed free of development hazards, and without disruption of, or significant impact on,
natural resource areas and coastal resources.
Developer. The person, group of persons, corporation, partnership, firm or association
proposing to undertake a development as defined in this General Plan.
Development. Development means, on land, in or under water, the placement or erection of any
solid material or structure: discharge or disposal of any dredged material or of any gaseous,
liquid, solid, or thermal waste; grading, removing, dredging, mining, or extraction of any
materials; change in the density or intensity of use of land, including, but not limited to, sub-
division pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act (commencing with Section 66410 of the
Government Code), and any other division of land, including lot splits, except where the land
division is brought about in connection with the purchase of such land by a public agency for
public recreational use; change in the intensity of use of water, or of access thereto; construction,
reconstruction, demolition, or alteration of the size of any structure, including any facility of any
private, public, or municipal utility; and the removal or harvesting of major vegetation other than
for agricultural purposes, kelp harvesting and timber operations, which are in accordance with a
timber harvesting plan submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Z'berg-Nejedly Forest Practice
Act of 1973 (commencing with Section 4511).
As used in this plan, "structure" includes, but is not limited to, any building, road, pipe, flume,
conduit, siphon, aqueduct, telephone line, and electrical power transmission and distribution line.
Development Agreement. A legal and enforceable instrument binding the city and a developer
equally, which may specify conditions, terms, restrictions and regulations pertaining to all
                                            Glossary, Page 8
aspects of a development. Development agreements are subject to: public hearings, the making
of findings as to consistency with the city's general plan, and recordation with the County

(10 pm - 7 am) sound levels.
Leq. The energy equivalent level, defined as the average sound level on the basis of sound energy
(or sound pressure squared). The Leq is a "dosage" type measure and is the basis for the
descriptors used in current standards, such as the 24-hour CNEL used by the State of California.
The steady-state A-weighted sound level containing the same energy as a time-varying signal; an
average of the sound levels for a given sample time, typically 1-24 hours. Leq(5) would indicate
a five hour sample time.
Level of Service (LOS). A scale that measures the operating capacity likely to be encountered on
a roadway or at the intersection of roadways, based on a volume-to-capacity ratio, with levels
ranging from A to F, with A representing the lowest volume-to-capacity ratio and the highest level
of service. (See "Volume-to-Capacity Ratio.")
Level-of-Service A represents free flow. Individual users are virtually unaffected by the
presence of others in the traffic stream. The general level of comfort and convenience
provided to the motorist or passenger is excellent.
Level-of-Service B is in the range of stable flow, but the presence of other users in the
traffic stream begins to be noticeable. There is a slight decline in the freedom to maneuver
within the traffic stream. The level of comfort and convenience provided is somewhat less
than at LOS A, because the presence of others in the traffic stream begins to affect
individual behavior.
Level-of-Service C is in the range of stable flow but marks the beginning of the range of
flow in which the operation of individual users becomes affected by interactions with
others in the traffic stream. Maneuvering within the traffic stream requires vigilance on
                                           Glossary, Page 18
the part of the user. The general level of comfort and convenience declines at this level.
Level-of-Service D represents high-density but stable flow. Freedom to maneuver is
severely restricted, and the driver experiences a generally poor level of comfort and
convenience. Small increases in traffic flow will generally cause operational problems at
this level.
Level-of-Service E represents operating conditions at or near the capacity level. Freedom
to maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely difficult, and it is generally
accomplished by forcing a vehicle or pedestrian to "give way" to accommodate such
maneuvers. Comfort and convenience levels are extremely poor, and driver frustration is
generally high. Operations at this level are usually unstable, because small increases in
flow or minor disturbances within the traffic stream will cause breakdowns.
Level-of-Service F is used to define forced or breakdown flow. This condition exists
wherever the amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount which can traverse
the point. Queues form behind such locations. Operations with the queue are
characterized by stop-and-go waves, and they are extremely unstable. Vehicles may
progress at reasonable speeds for several hundred feet or more, then be required to stop in
a cyclic fashion.

(c) zoning district maps, and (d) within sensitive coastal resource area, other implementing
actions, which, when taken together, meet the requirements of, and implement the provisions and
policies of, the Coastal Act, , and upon re-certification must be adhered to, implemented by the
City, and monitored by the Coastal Commission. [The pre-2006 LCP consisted of the 1981 Land
Use Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. The 2006 certified LCP consists of the General Plan/LUP,
not including the Housing Element, the Zoning Ordinance, and the Second Dwelling Unit
Ordinance].

    marshes, swamps, mudflats, and fens. Wetlands are usually lands where the water table is at,
    near or above the land surface long enough to do either of the following: a) promote the
    formation of (hydric) soils that are saturated with water at or near the surface and are
    deficient of oxygen long enough during the growing season to result in soil properties that
    reflect dominate wetness characteristics near the soils surface (within 10"); or b) support the
    growth of hydrophytic plants which grow in water or in wet habitats, and include those types
    of wetlands where vegetation is lacking and soil is poorly developed or absent as a result of
    frequent and drastic fluctuations of surface water levels, wave action, water flow, turbidity or
    high concentrations of salts or other substances in the substrate. Such wetlands can be
    recognized by the presence of surface water or saturated substrate at some time during each
    year and their location within, or adjacent to, vegetated wetlands or deep-water habitats. The
    upland limit of a wetland shall be defined as:
        (A) the boundary between land with predominantly hydrophytic cover and land with
        predominantly mesophytic or xerophytic cover;
        (B) the boundary between soil that is predominantly hydric and soil that is predominantly
        nonhydric; or
        (C) in the case of wetlands without vegetation or soils, the boundary between land that is
        flooded or saturated at some time during years of normal precipitation, and land that is
        not.
    (2) The term "wetland" shall not include wetland habitat created by the presence of and
    associated with agricultural ponds and reservoirs where:
        (A) the pond or reservoir was in fact constructed by a farmer or rancher for agricultural
        purposes; and
        (B) there is no evidence (e.g., aerial photographs, historical survey, etc.) showing that
        wetland habitat pre-dated the existence of the pond or reservoir. Areas with drained
        hydric soils that are no longer capable of supporting hydrophytes shall not be considered
        wetlands.
Workplace Use. Businesses, from office to research and development to light industry to
warehousing, located in structures built with open floor plans, so as to leave most interior
improvements to the tenants to design to their needs.
Yard. An open space abutting a lot line unobstructed and unoccupied from the ground upward
except for certain exceptions allowed herein. A yard shall be measured at right angles to the lot
line and shall extend into the lot to the exterior wall of the building.
Yard, Front. A yard extending the full width of the lot abutting the front lot line.
Yard, Rear. A yard extending the full width of the lot abutting the rear lot line.

Yard, Side. A yard which extends from the front yard, or front lot line where no front yard
exists, to the rear yard or rear lot line where no rear yard exists, and abutting the side lot line.
Zone. A portion of the territory of the City of Point Arena within which certain uniform
regulations and requirements or combination thereof apply under the provisions of these
Regulations. (Also see "Land-use Categories")
Zoning. The division of the City by legislative regulations into areas, or zones, which specify
allowable uses for real property and size restrictions for buildings within these areas; a program
that carries out policies of the General Plan.
Zoning District. A designated section of the City for which prescribed land-use requirements
and building and development standards are uniform. (See also "Land-use Categories")
