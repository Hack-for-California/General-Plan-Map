      Community design is integral to balancing aesthetic qualities and functionality for the
      many different land uses, which are required of a complete community. Such balance
      is necessary to maintain and enhance a community that is highly enjoyable for living,
      working, and recreation. In Rancho Cucamonga, a strong emphasis on community
      design has allowed the City to achieve a particular identity, incorporating the history
      and character qualities of the three communities that preceded it: Alta Loma,
      Cucamonga, and Etiwanda.
      Preservation of historic resources has allowed Rancho Cucamonga to retain its rich
      culture and heritage while facing growing and expanding development. The City is
      committed to preserving and developing aspects of the community that provide a
      sense of its origin and history.
      This Chapter focuses on land use, community design, and historic resources, and
      how they help shape the physical features of Rancho Cucamonga.
      Achieving Our Vision
      Rancho Cucamonga’s stable residential neighborhoods, diverse commercial and
      industrial development, extensive parks and recreational facilities, and high-quality
      community amenities can be attributed to the City’s long-standing commitment to
      land use planning and urban design. The City of Rancho Cucamonga’s vision for
      land use, community design, and historic resources is reflected in the following Spirit
      of Rancho Cucamonga Guiding Principles:
      The Spirit of Family
          Rancho Cucamonga is a people-first community with a focus on families. We
             strive to create an environment that leads to stable and healthy families.
            We continue to develop and maintain a system of high-quality, world-class
             community parks and sports complexes that appeal to all ages and all
             interests, from local and regional leagues to national events.
            We encourage the retention, rehabilitation, and development of a diverse
             housing stock that caters to residents in all stages of their lives.
      The Spirit of Innovation and Enterprise
          We maximize the industrial economic development power of our rail and
             highway connections. The Foothill Boulevard, State Route 210, and I-15
             corridors are the core of our commercial development and provide both jobs
             for our families and revenues for our community services. Our economic base
             maintains a mix of cultural, residential, industrial, and local and regional
             commercial uses with stable development.
            As we mature as a City, infill development will maintain our high standards and
             will complement existing development.
      The Spirit of Heritage
          We have an abiding respect for the heritage we share. Our historic
             communities – Alta Loma, Cucamonga, and Etiwanda – are at the heart of our
             City and must be preserved, honored, and enhanced. We encourage the
             preservation and restoration of historical buildings and cultural resources to
             recognize the contributions of our forefathers.

    Foothill Boulevard (Route 66) is the historic thread that ties our community
     together. We must continually revitalize the corridor while telling the story of
     the past and balancing preservation. This will be done through the adaptive re-
     use of buildings, strong architectural design, and public art.
    We promote the use of citrus and vineyard plantings to remind us of our
     agricultural past.
    Our outstanding views of the mountains, the varied natural topography of the
     area, and the trails that allow us to access these open spaces are assets and
     must be preserved.
The Spirit of Leadership
   We have a strong dedication to community planning. The quality of our built
     environment is by design. Our government leads by example. We are
     committed to achieving higher standards for community development,
     architecture, and landscaping. Our streetscapes reflect the high-quality
     development that we demand while embracing the concept of water
     conservation and ease of maintenance.
    We promote sustainable neighborhood and building design.
The Spirit of Tomorrow
   We are dedicated to a sustainable balance in land use patterns (residential,
     business, educational, agricultural, recreational, open space, and historic
     uses) and supporting transportation.
    We are proactive in the design and use of lands within our Sphere of
     Influence, being vigilant in maintaining open space wherever possible.
    We continue to provide a stable City government which respects the decisions
     of the past while being committed to long-range planning initiatives and the
     positive impacts of future development.

      Land Use
      In Rancho Cucamonga, vacant land has become a scarce resource. Land use
      decisions must be carefully crafted to protect established residential neighborhoods
      and plan for appropriate infill development while connecting land uses and
      transportation modes. These key objectives provide the framework for the City’s land
      use strategies.
      Land use is a term that describes different types of activities that occur in a particular
      area. For example, some areas in Rancho Cucamonga contain homes while other
      areas contain stores, warehouses, parks, or schools. In some places, like Victoria
      Gardens, a mixture of uses creates an active and vital commercial and cultural
      center. This Land Use section describes the general location, type, and intensity of
      development throughout Rancho Cucamonga.
      The maps, graphics, and text in this section also define the distribution, intensity, and
      preferred form of land uses within residential neighborhoods, along key corridors, and
      on specific sites. The Land Use Policy Map (Figure LU-1) presents a pictorial
      representation of land use policy. Cumulatively, these policies will shape future
      development to maintain and enhance all areas of Rancho Cucamonga.
      Planning Context
      The pattern of development within Rancho Cucamonga is characterized by
      essentially a north/south split roughly along Foothill Boulevard. The northern two-
      thirds of the City are predominately residential, while the southern third is largely
      industrial. Commercial centers are primarily clustered along Foothill Boulevard, Base
      Line Road, and several other major roadways. The northern edge of the Sphere of
      Influence is dominated by open space and hillside terrain. Table LU-1 identifies the
      land use distribution for the City and Sphere of Influence by general categories as of
      2009.

The residential character of Rancho Cucamonga can be described as primarily low-
density and consisting of high-quality, stable neighborhoods. Most residential uses
located in the northern areas include large lot, detached homes. The lots become
gradually smaller south of Banyan Street. Higher-density housing such as
townhomes, condominiums, and apartment complexes are located in the central
portion of the City, in the Terra Vista and Victoria neighborhoods.
Commercial uses vary greatly, from regional shopping centers to smaller
neighborhood retail stores. Regional-serving commercial uses can be found on
Foothill Boulevard, east of Haven Avenue, and at Victoria Gardens, located between
Day Creek Boulevard, Foothill Boulevard, and I-15. Neighborhood shopping centers
are distributed throughout the City and can be found at most major intersections.
Many older neighborhood shopping centers located in the western portion of the City
are struggling with vacancies, financial instability, and physical decay. Some of these
centers may need revitalization or facelifts.
Industrial uses range from heavy industrial such as Tamco Steel and Mission Foods,
to warehouses, distribution centers, and light industrial that includes business parks
and office uses. Most of the industrial uses are located south of Foothill Boulevard,
with the heavy industrial uses located on both sides of I-15.

      Public facilities include government buildings such as City Hall, fire stations, and
      multi-purpose community facilities. Also included in this category are infrastructure
      such as cellular towers; water, gas, and electrical transmission lines; electrical plants
      and facilities; water district facilities; and flood control facilities (catch basins, levees,
      storm drainage channels, and spreading basins).
      Rancho Cucamonga is a community that supports life-long learning with four
      elementary school districts (Alta Loma, Central, Cucamonga, and Etiwanda), one
      high school district (Chaffey Joint Union High School District), one community college
      (Chaffey College), and satellite facilities for other institutions of higher learning
      (University of La Verne and University of Redlands are examples). These facilities
      are distributed throughout the community.
      One of the City’s most attractive assets is Rancho Cucamonga’s world-class park
      system. The system features facilities throughout the community designed to meet
      the needs of residents of all ages. Preserving open space for environmental and
      aesthetic value is a primary objective of the General Plan. Open space can serve
      multiple functions such as groundwater recharge, wildlife corridors, and
      neighborhood connections. The largest significant open space remains within the
      City’s Sphere of Influence.
      Many vacant lands have already been entitled for development but construction has
      not occurred. These parcels will continue to contribute to the community in the future
      through thoughtful design and development.
      Land Use Growth Strategy
      The General Plan reinforces established land uses attained in the City over the last
      10 to 15 years by emphasizing protection of existing residential neighborhoods, and
      targeting of new residential, office, and commercial growth along major corridors,
      such as Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue south of Foothill Boulevard, where
      development opportunities exist on vacant or underutilized properties.
      The land use growth strategy will focus on the following three objectives:
                Protect and maintain established residential neighborhoods
                Target new infill development opportunities
                Integrate land use and transportation
      Protection of Established Residential Neighborhoods
      The City’s neighborhoods reflect the history, strength, and character of Rancho
      Cucamonga, and the General Plan continues the City’s practice of protecting,
      maintaining, and enhancing established residential neighborhoods. New
      development will be required to complement and reinforce the unique character of
      each neighborhood through sensitive infill projects and transitions in scale of
      development.
      Existing neighborhoods are stable and provide good access to parks and schools.
      The City is committed to fostering strong, safe, and vibrant neighborhoods, and
      ensuring that parks and schools are connected to a comprehensive trails and
      sidewalk pedestrian system.

Infill Development
Between 1999 and 2009, development largely occurred in the northeast Etiwanda
portion of the City and around the Terra Vista and Victoria neighborhoods. In fact,
most of those neighborhoods are now fully developed. However, many small
opportunity areas remain, and vacant lots are located throughout the City where new
development can take place. Struggling commercial shopping centers also present
opportunities for revitalization.
Successful infill development is characterized by overall residential densities that
support public transit and commercial districts that offer a wider variety of
convenience services and amenities. Well-planned infill can create cultural, social,
recreational, and entertainment opportunities, gathering places, and bring vitality to
historic roadway corridors (e.g., Foothill Boulevard) and neighborhoods. Attention to
the design of infill development is essential to ensure that the new development fits in
with the established physical context and gains acceptance from surrounding
residential neighborhoods. A cooperative partnership between government, the
development community, neighborhood organizations, and other resources is
essential to achieve infill success. Successful infill development has already
occurred. For example, the Town Square development at the southwest corner of
Haven Avenue and Foothill Boulevard has integrated residential and commercial
development.
                                                                                         The Town Square

                            Infill development can provide the following benefits:
                                      Responds to the Needs of the Community. Infill can contribute to unmet
                                       economic, social, or civic needs in the community. Through sensitive
                                       design, infill can introduce new development into the community and
                                       achieve a balanced mix of well-designed housing types, sizes, and prices
                                       for all income levels, in combination with a variety of commercial and/or
                                       civic and cultural uses.
                                      Appearance and Viability. Infill development can be designed to
                                       complement surrounding development, create connected and sociable
                                       places, and ultimately increase property values. Infill development can
                                       address gaps in the existing community structure, provide for continuity and
                                       enclosure of the streetscape, and add elements that give a place definition
                                       and security.
                                      Walkability. Infill development can enhance circulation and walkability of a
                                       community by replacing vacant, deserted sites with revitalized businesses
                                       that relate to the surrounding neighborhood through street-friendly and
                                       pedestrian-friendly design.
                                      Infrastructure. Infill development capitalizes on existing infrastructure and
                                       minimizes the need for costly new improvements. Although some
                                       infrastructure may require upgrading to meet new demand, the broader
                                       community is likely to benefit from those improvements.
                                      Access to Healthy Food. In connection with the City's commitment to a
                                       Healthy Mind, Body, and Earth, the City recognizes the need to support
                                       land uses that improve access to healthy food in the community.
                                       Community gardens, school gardens, farmers’ markets, and edible estates
                                       have a unique purpose, function, and placement within the community.
                                       They provide a means for the community to enjoy the benefits of land uses
                                       that will produce healthier food choices while gaining social, cultural, and
                                       fitness benefits as well. Refer to Chapter 5: Community Services, for

                            Land Use and Transportation Connections
                            An important component of the General Plan is its focus on connecting all areas of
       See the Community    the City with transportation options. Transportation options may include bus or shuttle

                            shopping, or elsewhere in the community. However, the General Plan incorporates
                            greater transportation options, such as walking and transit, particularly through infill
                            and Mixed Use development. For example, residents living in a new Mixed Use
                            development should not only be able to walk a few blocks to grab a bite to eat or get
                            a cup of coffee, but also to access a transit line.
                            The General Plan includes planning for new trails that link established residential
                            neighborhoods and connect them with shopping centers, employment areas, and
                            schools and parks. The Pacific Electric Trail will serve as an important east-west
                            connector to the City’s comprehensive trail network.

Land Use Plan
The Land Use Plan guides the development, maintenance, and improvement of land
and properties in Rancho Cucamonga. The Land Use Plan, illustrated in Figure LU-2
and described below, will allow the City to both preserve the unique qualities that
define Rancho Cucamonga and forge a new path toward a sustainable future.
  Rancho Cucamonga actively works toward creating a community with a balanced
mix of land uses that fosters economic, environmental, and social sustainability. The
City continues to lead Inland Empire cities in testing new ideas that support emerging
business practices and lifestyle trends, such as high-density housing and flexible
business space. New approaches to land use planning and development are driven
by the need to create connections between land use and transportation choices, and
to achieve more sustainable development approaches.
Density and Intensity
Density and intensity are quantitative measures used to describe how much
development may occur on a property. For residential uses, the term “density” is
used. The Rancho Cucamonga General Plan describes density in terms of the
number of dwelling units allowed per net acre (du/acre), exclusive of streets and
public rights-of-way.
For nonresidential land use categories (e.g., commercial or industrial), the term
“intensity” is used. Development intensity addresses the amount of building square
footage that is on a particular parcel or lot. Intensity can be described in many ways,
including total building square footage, the percent of the lot the building occupies,
the mass of a building, or floor-area ratio. The General Plan uses floor-area ratio, or
FAR, to measure nonresidential intensity. FAR is the ratio of the total gross floor area
of all buildings on a lot to the total net area of the lot. It does not include the area
within parking structures (see Figure LU-1).
                                                                                        Figure LU-1:
                                                                                        Floor-Area Ratio (FAR)
   Example:
              Gross Building Area (all floors)               50,000 sq. ft.
   FAR =                                        0.5 FAR =
                         Lot Area                           100,000 sq. ft.
The determination of development intensity or density at which a proposed project
can occur is a function of: 1) General Plan policies intended to maximize public
safety, achieve high-quality site planning and design, retain significant natural

                        contained in the Development Code, public works standards, and other City
                        regulations.
                        Residential Designations
                        Six residential land use designations are established to preserve the character of
                        existing residential neighborhoods and to create opportunities for new housing types.
                        While residential uses are the primary permitted uses, other complementary and
                        compatible uses can be entitled as Development Code regulations permit, such as
                        parks, trails, special residential uses addressed by State law, child care facilities,
                        schools, and places of religious assembly.
                                     Each of the residential use categories includes a range of allowable
                                     densities. The maximum density defines the maximum number of units
                                     per net acre at which development can occur within a given area. The
                                     determination of precise density, development location, and lot coverage
                                     on any residential property is a function of: 1) the provisions of the
                                     General Plan that are intended to maximize public safety, achieve high-

                                     Very Low Residential (0.10 to 2.0 Dwelling Units per Acre)
                                     The Very Low Residential designation is characterized by detached, very
                                     low-density single residential units on 0.5-acre lots or larger, with private
                                     yards and private parking. This designation generally applies to the
                                     foothill areas north of Banyan Street and north of the Pacific Electric Trail
                                     in the Etiwanda area. There are some areas below Banyan Street that
                                     are also required to meet the same requirements as the Equestrian/Rural
 Low Residential                     Overlay area (see Land Use Overlay discussion below). New

                                     Low Residential (2.0 to 4.0 Dwelling Units per Acre)
                                     The Low Residential designation is characterized by detached, low-
                                     density single residential units on individual lots forming a cohesive
                                     neighborhood, with private yards and private parking. Typical population
                                     density is 6-13 persons per acre.

                                     The Low Medium Residential designation is characterized by detached
                                     or attached housing structures that contain either one or two individual
                                     dwelling units, such as single-unit zero-lot-line homes, cluster and patio
                                     homes, and duplexes. All development approaches include private,
                                     individually accessible parking for each unit. Development of townhomes
                                     at the upper end of the range may be suited to locations near
                                     commercial areas and along major arterials. This designation
                                     encourages housing diversity without changing the low-intensity
                                     character of the neighborhood. Typical population density is 13-26

Medium Residential (8.0 to 14.0 Dwelling Units per Acre)
The Medium Residential designation is characterized by detached and attached
residential units, including small-lot subdivisions, duplexes and triplexes, and
attached townhouse-type developments that provide private open space and multi-
unit structures that comprise a cohesive development incorporating common open
space areas. Mobile home parks are also allowed in this designation. Residential
units may contain private yards and private parking or open common areas and
shared parking. Building intensity at the lower end of the density range is suitable
adjacent to low and very low-density residential areas. Typical population
density is 26-45 persons per acre.
Building intensity at the higher end of the range is more appropriate
adjacent to parks, along transit routes and arterial roads, and near activity
centers. Development at the higher densities normally consists of a semi-
detached or attached unit design. The Medium Residential designation
also serves as an appropriate buffer between low-density residential areas
and areas of higher-density commercial activities.
Medium High Residential (14.0 to 24.0 Dwelling Units per Acre)
The Medium High Residential designation is characterized by low-rise           Medium High Residential
condominiums and apartment buildings. Approaches to development may
consist of multiple-unit buildings or groups of buildings, with both private
and common open space areas provided. This density is appropriate near
major community facilities, employment centers, and along major
thoroughfares with transit availability. Typical population density is 45-77
persons per acre.
High Residential (24.0 to 30.0 Dwelling Units per Acre)
The High Residential designation is characterized by higher-density, multi-
story residential development with a focus on providing an urban intensity
and function at locations within walking distance to transit, recreation and
community facilities, employment centers, and commercial services.
Development typically is characterized by buildings between three to six       High Residential
stories in height and with open common areas. On-site amenities for
residents are provided. Typical population density is 77-97 persons per acre.
Commercial Designations
Four commercial designations establish opportunities for varied commercial business
enterprises. Commercial areas provide places where residents and visitors can shop
for goods and services, and where businesses can locate to serve local, regional,
and international markets.
Each of the non-residential designations indicates a probable and
maximum level of development intensity. The building intensity is
measured according to the FAR. The FAR describes the intensity
of the use on a site and not the building height or site coverage. It
does not include the area within parking structures. The lower
number in the FAR range indicates the probable FAR on average
but in some cases, it may be lower. The higher number is the
maximum FAR for any specific project. The FAR is applied to the
gross acreage of a project or lot, less that portion of the site to be
dedicated to arterial highways, flood control channels, and
easements, as defined in the Community Mobility Chapter.

                         The Office designation concentrates office-oriented business activities near centers
                         of commercial activity and avoids the building of individual, isolated office buildings.
                         Office developments may include low-rise, multi-tenant garden-type arrangements,
                         particularly along the I-15 corridor, Haven Avenue Office Overlay district, and within
                         Mixed Use designated areas. Business activities permitted within this category
                         include corporate headquarters, administrative and professional offices, finance,
                         legal, insurance, real estate services, banks, and business support services.
                         Supportive convenience retail and service commercial uses such as restaurants may
                         also be allowed to serve the needs of employees and visitors.
                         Neighborhood Commercial (Probable FAR of 0.25 and Maximum FAR of 0.35)
                         The Neighborhood Commercial designation provides for small-scale shopping
                         centers (5 to 15 acres in size) located near or within residential neighborhoods and
                         offering convenient retail goods and services for residents. Examples of permitted
                         uses include small-scale restaurants, grocery and convenience stores, service
                         businesses that generate limited traffic, and boutique retail sales. Neighborhood
                                                     Commercial centers should be compatible in design and
                                                     scale with adjacent residential areas. Convenient paths for
                                                     pedestrian and bicycle access into and around the center
                                                     should also be provided.

                                                     The General Commercial designation applies to properties
                                                     along major activity corridors. This designation provides for
                                                     a wide range of community-oriented and regional-oriented
                                                     commercial businesses, including businesses that cater to
                                                     tourists traveling on Historic Route 66 (Foothill Boulevard).

Mixed Use Designation
The Mixed Use designation recognizes that portions of Rancho Cucamonga are
evolving into more urban places, and that the community desires the creation of new,
more sustainable development forms. Mixed Use development approaches offer
opportunities for people to live close to work or near transit stops, to walk to
neighborhood stores and parks, to enjoy indoor and outdoor entertainment close to
home, and to experience exciting pedestrian districts.
Mixed Use (Probable FAR of 0.40 and Maximum FAR of 1.0)
The Mixed Use designation offers opportunities for more intensely developed districts
that combine complementary commercial, office, residential, and community uses in
areas with easy access to transit. Mixed Use development may occur in two ways: 1)
as a combination of uses within a single building (for example, retail on the first floor
and residential or office on the upper floors); or 2) as a combination of uses on
multiple parcels within a specified district of the City. In either case,
the intent is to achieve a complete integration of the uses and their
support functions into a livable development that fosters a strong
sense of place.
The desired outcome of the Mixed Use designation is to create
special urban places within the general suburban pattern of single-
purpose uses. Victoria Gardens and the Town Center at Haven
Avenue and Foothill Boulevard are exemplary developments that
incorporate highly successful Mixed Use concepts.
Community expectations of Mixed Use developments involve
excellence in site planning, design, public safety, and use
configurations based on the following criteria:
                                                                                          Mixed Use
       Development projects will be interconnected rather than being rigidly
        separated.
       New commercial and Mixed Use development will emphasize pedestrian
        orientation in site and building design and promote a walkable environment
        with active street frontages, well-scaled buildings, and usable public spaces
        such as small plazas, courtyards, and sidewalk cafes that are highly
        accessible and convenient to residents and visitors.
       Parking lots and enclosed parking facilities will generally be located to the
        rear of buildings or at other locations where they are not visible from major
        streets.
       Safe and convenient pedestrian movement will be provided into and within
        the site.
       The mix of uses will promote walkability by offering goods and services that
        appeal to and meet the needs of adjacent and nearby residents.
       Development forms will consist of generally higher intensities of use than in
        surrounding areas.
       Projects will express a common design theme that may be carried out by
        architectural styles, landscaping and lighting treatment, street improvements
        and street furniture, and other means of unifying the development. This does
        not preclude an eclectic mix of architectural styles, but development will be

                                      Development approaches will involve a variety of scales and spaces to
                                       provide interest and diversity.

                                      Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles will be
                                       integrated into development approaches to provide both the reality and
                                       perception of public safety.
                                      Adequate emergency vehicle access will be provided to address public

                                      All development will provide a unique and engaging experience for residents
                                       and visitors to the City, similar to those often found in older, walkable towns
                                       and cities.
Victoria Gardens integrates
           a retail shopping
     experience with public
          spaces, including
 courtyards, squares, open

                      plazas.
                              Each application of the Mixed Use designation on the Land Use Plan has a specific
                              intent, and the designation includes guidance tailored to the individual area. Flexibility
                              is provided in the ranges to permit combinations of uses at a variety of intensities.
                              Tables LU-2 through Table LU-14 identify the standards for each Mixed Use area.
                              Unless otherwise specified, the most intensive combination is the most desirable.
                              The successful application of Mixed Use provisions inherently favors large area
                              master planning allowing for greater development flexibility. Such master planning
                              generally requires consolidated ownership or partnership agreements within the
                              Planning Area. Mixed Use planning over fragmented ownership patterns and smaller
                              project area size is problematic. Consolidation for development of Mixed Use projects
                              is strongly encouraged. Alternatively, development proposals that contain fragmented
                              ownership patterns within a Mixed Use area should be required to master plan
                              adjoining areas outside of the proponent’s site. The Mixed Use areas include
                              (numbers correspond with Figure LU-3):

Industrial Designations
Industrial areas in Rancho Cucamonga benefit from their strategic location near the I-
15 and I-10 freeways, the Metrolink station, and railway lines. A variety of light
industrial, business park, office, manufacturing, heavy industrial, and similar business
and industrial uses have been established, providing diverse employment
opportunities for residents throughout the Inland Empire. Three Industrial
designations are established that continue to provide many industrial development
opportunities.
Industrial Park (Probable FAR of 0.40 and Maximum FAR of 0.60)
The Industrial Park designation accommodates master-planned
concentrations of light industrial, research and development
businesses, green technology, and general and medical office
uses. The designation also allows for limited convenience goods
and services for employees and visitors. Industrial Park uses are
typically labor intensive, meaning that the number of employees
per acre is higher than uses involving mostly manufacturing or
warehousing. The Industrial Park designation applies to major
traffic corridors in the City, including 4th Street, Haven Avenue,
Arrow Highway, and Foothill Boulevard, near the largest
concentrations of civic and commercial activity.                                         Industrial Park
General Industrial (Probable FAR of 0.50 and Maximum FAR of
0.60)
The General Industrial designation permits a wide range of industrial activities that
include manufacturing, assembling, fabrication, wholesale supply, heavy commercial,
green technology, and office uses. Where adjacent to residential uses, properties
designated General Industrial should be designed for office uses, or site planning
should incorporate buffering techniques to minimize noise and traffic impacts
associated with the industrial activity.
Heavy Industrial (Probable FAR of 0.40 and Maximum FAR of 0.50)
The Heavy Industrial designation permits heavy manufacturing, compounding,
processing or fabrication, warehousing, storage, freight handling, and truck services
and terminals, as well as supportive service commercial uses. Heavy Industrial areas

                               are located to take advantage of rail lines and arterial roadway access, and to
                               minimize impacts on surrounding land uses.
                               Open Space Designations
                               The Open Space designations identify areas devoted to the preservation of natural
                               resources and outdoor recreation. The General Plan establishes four Open Space
                               designations.
                               Hillside Residential (0.10 to 2.0 Dwelling Units per Acre)
                               The Hillside Residential designation is established to: 1) maintain the natural open
                               space character of sensitive areas in the Sphere of Influence; 2) protect natural land
                               forms from extensive grading and minimize erosion; 3) provide for public safety
                               against wildland fire, fault, and flooding hazards; 4) protect water, plant, and animal
                               resources; and 5) provide design standards that allow for limited residential
                               development that respects and responds to the sensitive environmental conditions in
                               the hillsides. The maximum dwelling unit density may not exceed two units per net
                               buildable acre in accordance with the provisions of the Development Code. Buildable
                               acre is considered to be a contiguous area of the lot, which is less than 30 percent in
                               natural slope, or the area determined through the environmental studies and
                               investigation as buildable and is subject to slope/capacity factor calculations
                               contained in Section 17.24.080 of the Development Code. Maximum population
                               density is 1.6 persons per acre.
                                                Open Space (0 to 0.10 Dwelling Units per Acre)
                                                The Open Space designation, which applies to both public and
                                                privately owned lands, is designed to: 1) establish protection in areas
                                                of fire, geologic, seismic, or flood hazards through restriction of
                                                intensive uses; 2) promote the retention of open space for
                                                recreational use and the protection of natural resources; and 3)
                                                promote the preservation of open spaces that protect natural
                                                features, offer views to residents, and maintain open areas where
                                                flood, fire, geologic, and seismic conditions may endanger public
                                                health and safety. Recreational uses, including golf courses, are
                                                permitted where terrain and access are appropriate to accommodate
                                                such uses.
                                                On private lands designated Open Space, one residential unit is
Open Space                                      permitted per 10 acres, with at least one unit permitted on lots less
                                                than 10 acres in size. Maximum population density is 0.3 persons
                                                per acre.
                                                 Conservation (FAR Not Applicable)
                                                 The General Plan recognizes the sensitivity of the Riversidian
                                                 Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub (AFSS) habitat and the benefits it provides
                                                 for wildlife conservation. The purpose of the Conservation
                                                 designation is to identify sensitive areas like AFSS habitat that will be
                                                 managed to preserve and protect sensitive habitat, wetland
                                                 resources, and sensitive plant and animal species potentially
                                                 occurring in designated areas.
                                                 In cooperation with the County of San Bernardino, the City has
                                                 designated vital AFSS areas within the Sphere of Influence as
                                                 Conservation, and distinct and defined conservation areas have
Flood Control/Utility Corridor                   been set aside as mitigation sites for various State, County, City, and

private projects. Additional parcels may be purchased in the future as mitigation for
other projects in the region.
As development of habitable structures is not permitted within the Conservation
designation, no FAR standard applies.
Flood Control/Utility Corridor
The Flood Control/Utility Corridor designation includes lands primarily used for flood
control purposes and to support public utilities. Improvements typically include flood
control channels, drainage basins, and major utility corridors, such as high-tension
electric power transmission lines and towers. Flood control facilities include improved
channels and natural waterways under the control of the City and the San Bernardino
County Flood Control District. Both Deer and Day Creeks, along with utility
easements within the Sphere of Influence, are key elements of the Flood
Control/Utility Corridor designation.
As development of habitable structures is not permitted within the Flood
Control/Utility Corridor designation, no FAR standard applies until they are deemed
surplus, rezoned, and subdivided.
The majority of this designation falls in the City’s Sphere of Influence
where the area is subject to flooding, potential wildland fires, and
geologic and seismic hazards. To provide a high level of public safety,
these areas should be left natural for the most part, offering residents the
additional benefits of a scenic and recreational resource with limited
development potential.
Public Facility Designations
The Public Facility designations refer to uses operated for public benefit.
The General Plan establishes the following three Public Facility
designations.                                                                   Civic/Regional
Civic/Regional (Probable FAR of 0.40 and Maximum FAR of 1.0)
The Civic/Regional designation applies to diverse public and quasi-public
uses, including the Civic Center and police station, the County
Courthouse facilities, the county jail/detention center, City fire stations,
City libraries, post offices, and the City public works yard.
Schools (Probable FAR of 0.10 and Maximum FAR of 0.20)
The Schools designation identifies both existing and planned schools
within the City and Sphere of Influence. Elementary, junior high, high
school, and college locations are indicated by type on the Land Use
Policy Map. School sites indicated as “planned” may change as growth
projections and student forecasts dictate.                                      Schools
Parks
The Parks designation identifies both existing and planned public parks
within the City and Sphere of Influence. Existing parks include developed
parkland owned by the City. Parklands include traditional neighborhood-
level and community-level parks, as well as multi-purpose recreation-
oriented lands such as the Epicenter and Central Park. Planned park
sites are identified generally in areas where future residential
development will occur. The location of future parks will be further
defined by detailed neighborhood site planning and the City’s desire to
locate new parks adjacent to and integrated with school sites. The City         Parks

       also controls 130 acres of undeveloped parkland not including undeveloped trail
       acreage.
       Land Use Overlays
       To add additional flexibility for land development while maintaining other community
       goals and priorities, the City has created overlay zones for very specific areas. These
       include the Haven Avenue Office District, the Equestrian/Rural Area, and the Master
       Plan Overlay. The benefit of overlay zones is the ability to customize development
       agreements to achieve higher standards and appropriate densities that support the
       overall goals of the district. In addition to these, the Development Code also includes
       a Senior Housing Overlay District and the Hillside Overlay District.
       Haven Avenue Office Overlay
       The Haven Avenue Office Overlay District provides an area for intensive, high-quality
       office development at this highly visible community gateway. A progressive,
       sophisticated, and urban style of development is required for the area, which is
       envisioned as the City’s premier office corridor. Haven Avenue has a unique
       combination of access to I-10 and LA/Ontario International Airport, making it an ideal
       location for high-end office development.
       Equestrian/Rural Overlay
       The Equestrian/Rural Overlay District allows for the keeping of horses and other farm
       animals, subject to regulations specified in the Development Code. All new
       developments within this overlay zone are required to provide community and local
       trails for equestrian use in accordance with the Hiking and Riding Trails Plan (see
       Chapter 5, Community Services). Properties designated as Very Low Residential are
       also subject to the Equestrian/Rural Overlay regulations.
       Master Plan Overlay
       The Master Plan Overlay District provides a tool to look beyond the limits of a
       particular property to solve area- or district-wide circulation, drainage, and
       neighborhood compatibility issues. The Master Plan Overlay creates an opportunity
       for the City to address the special or unique needs or characteristics of certain areas
       so designated by the General Plan, to ensure a harmonious relationship between
       existing and proposed uses, and to coordinate and promote the community
       improvement efforts of both private and public resources. The requirement for
       implementation of a project using the Master Plan Overlay is to prepare a conceptual
       master plan as a precursor to entitlement approval. Figure LU-2 identifies the
       locations of the Master Plan Overlays.
       Planning Direction for Mixed Use Areas
       Mixed Use designations assume a significant role in this General Plan. The majority
       of these designations are arrayed along Foothill Boulevard. Their location is of critical
       importance because of the pivotal nature of Foothill Boulevard as the City’s core
       commercial spine.
       Each Mixed Use designation applies different development parameters, including the
       use mix, to each individual area as described in the following sections. The land use
       percentages shown in each of the tables are to be used as guidelines only; the
       application of site planning principles and performance criteria is central to achieving
       high-quality development.

Mixed Use: Victoria Gardens/Victoria Arbors
The Victoria Gardens/Victoria Arbors Mixed Use area (#1 on Figure LU-3) is bounded
by Foothill Boulevard, Base Line Road, I-15, and the Day Creek Flood Control
Channel. This Mixed Use area is intended to:
        Achieve a powerful commercial magnet within the region
        Create a unique urban village
        Establish a City and regional landmark of visual excellence
        Include a performing arts/cultural center of regional significance
A majority of the regional commercial component has already been completed,
including a performing arts/cultural center - the Victoria Gardens Cultural Center. A
portion of the site will include additional residential, retail, and office development.
Public/Quasi Public uses, in addition to the Victoria Gardens Cultural Center, include
public parks, privately owned spaces open to the public during normal hours of
operation, pedestrian paths and sidewalks, bikeways, landscape and hardscape
areas within and connecting to public spaces, schools to serve residential uses, and
other public facilities necessary to achieve a well-supported development and ensure
a high level of amenities.

Residential uses are intended to be an integral part of the development rather than
developed as separate enclaves isolated from other activities and uses. Buffering,
building design and orientation, lighting control, noise control, and other
considerations to ensure a high standard of quality for residential development are
required. The intent is to create a truly contemporary urban complex based on the
best urban design practices. A variety of densities and housing types, from multi-unit
condominiums and apartments to detached single unit residential, is envisioned.
Housing types that cater to the lifestyles of couples and professionals without
children are one example of the emerging market niche that is particularly suited to
this area. Building types and standards need not conform to residential designations
applied elsewhere in the City, but a mix of housing types is required. Table LU-2
specifies the uses and the range of development for each type of land use. The land
use categories are broad to allow for a high degree of flexibility and responsiveness
to the market. Figure LU-3 identifies the locations of the Mixed Use designations.

Mixed Use: Town Center (Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue)
The Town Center Mixed Use Area (#2 on Figure LU-3) functions as a vibrant
community activity center at the southwestern corner of the Haven Avenue and
Foothill Boulevard intersection. The other three corners are comprised of a mix of
public service, commercial, office, and historic uses. The intent of the Mixed Use
designation at this location is to:
         Complete and strengthen the town center complex with complementary,
          community-oriented uses.
         Introduce a distinct, intensified, Mixed Use development project that
          maximizes the potential of this key site and relates to surrounding uses in the
          node.
         Reinforce the Haven Avenue office corridor and anchor it at the north end.
         Contribute to a unique architectural presence by providing a design contrast
          to the City Hall/County Courthouse facilities, Town Center commercial
          complex, and the historic Virginia Dare winery building.
The primary, but not exclusive use is shown in Table LU-3, with the Town Center
node at Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue. Office uses, when completed, will be
located along Haven Avenue and will provide convenient pedestrian access to
nearby commercial and civic uses. Commercial uses include specialty restaurants,
cafes, small retail stores, and other service commercial uses catering to the large
employee population along Haven Avenue and the nearby industrial area. The
design and façade treatment of commercial uses complement and provide visual
interest. Common outdoor spaces provide comfort and shelter within an attractive
landscaped/hardscaped setting, and connect to the Foothill Boulevard and Haven
Avenue intersection.
Public/Quasi Public uses complement the City Hall and the County Courthouse
facilities. Government offices, community meeting facilities, and a public plaza or
sculpture garden represent some of the possibilities. Public spaces provide
connections, both physically and visually, to other uses within the Town Center node.
This area offers a special opportunity to reflect a strong visual recognition of the
vineyard historical heritage in this central portion of the City; this topic is also
discussed in the Community Design section of this Chapter.

       Residential uses are an integral part of the development, oriented to the Town Center
       node. The location is well suited for workers seeking condominiums and higher-end
       apartments close to jobs and community services. Pedestrian connections between
       residential and non-residential uses are lined with open space paseos and well-
       lighted paths.
       Table LU-3 specifies the uses and the range of development for each land use
       category. The commercial and residential components have been completed.

       The Terra Vista Mixed Use Area (#3 on Figure LU-3) is located along the north side
       of Foothill Boulevard and is bisected by Milliken Avenue. This area is part of the
       Terra Vista Community Plan, approved in 1981, and one of the key remaining areas
       left to be developed within the Terra Vista Community. The intent is to:
                 Establish a large office complex with an emphasis on medical corporate
                  offices and financial services.
                 Complement the concentration of health care and medical facilities in the
                  area.
                 Incorporate a high-density residential component near commercial and public
                  services.
       Table LU-4 specifies the uses and range of development allowed.

Mixed Use: Foothill Boulevard between Hermosa Avenue and
Center Avenue
This site is located on the north side of Foothill Boulevard, between Hermosa Avenue
and Center Avenue (#4 on Figure LU-3). A Master Plan was approved and
implemented for the site, which includes a 10.5-acre, 166-unit workforce multi-unit
housing project, an existing restaurant at the northwest corner of Foothill Boulevard
and Center Avenue, and commercial, office, and restaurant land use at the northeast
corner of Hermosa Avenue and Foothill Boulevard. Table LU-5 specifies the uses

                           Hellman Avenue
                           This area (# 5 on Figure LU-3) is comprised of a stretch of small properties along the
                           north side of Foothill Boulevard that are candidates for revitalization. Since Foothill
                           Boulevard is also Historic Route 66, it has seen much change over the years. Many
                           of the shopping centers reflect a different style and set of standards than more
                           contemporary developments. Therefore, their vitality has been limited and, over the
                           course of time, will diminish.
                           Revitalization can occur either on an individual parcel basis or more comprehensively
                           through land assembly. A large portion of this area has already been developed for
                           residential use (Main Street at Route 66). The remaining corners at Hellman and
                           Archibald Avenues have not been redeveloped. This Mixed Use designation will
                           facilitate the re-use of challenging parcel sizes and dimensions through flexibility in
                           site planning and use configuration. The intent is to achieve:
                                    A revitalized “mini-district” that has unique appeal to residents and visitors
                                    An intimate, walkable character with an interesting mix of businesses
                                     integrated with residential
                                    A distinct appearance and ambiance that sets the area apart from other
                                     portions of Foothill Boulevard
                                    A small but distinct complex of multi-unit housing that gives the neighborhood

Retail uses may be combined with office uses to achieve multi-story buildings. The
clustering of buildings is desirable, along with shared parking facilities. The overall
design should provide a pedestrian ambiance that is distinct from the surrounding
auto-oriented commercial development.
Residential development is an integral part of this Mixed Use area. A range of
housing types is envisioned, including condominiums, apartments, and lofts. The
inclusion of home enterprise (live/work) uses may involve more activity than typical
home occupations but will still present a fundamentally residential character. The
creative integration of residential development will add variety and ongoing activity
along this segment of Foothill Boulevard.
In an effort to encourage the assembly of parcels, particularly at the intersection of
Foothill Boulevard and Archibald Avenue, a higher density (30 du/ac) will be allowed
only if lot consolidation can yield a minimum lot size of 75,000 square feet. A Master
Plan Overlay will be required for the remaining developable sites. Table LU-6
specifies the uses and the range of development for each classification.

       This site is located on Foothill Boulevard between Helms Avenue, Hampshire Street,
       and Malachite Avenue (#6 on Figure LU-3). The long-established commercial
       shopping center presents an opportunity to revitalize this site with neighborhood
       commercial-serving uses and residential development. The self-storage facility
       located at Helms Avenue and Hampshire Street will buffer the low-density residential

       Mixed Use: Foothill Boulevard and Mayten Avenue
       This site is located on Foothill Boulevard and Mayten Avenue (#7 on Figure LU-3).
       The relatively large vacant site should provide a combination of restaurants,
       entertainment, retail, hospitality, office, and residential opportunities within an urban
       village setting. Commercial uses should be located along Foothill Boulevard, with
       retail buildings fronting the boulevard to create a more pedestrian-friendly street
       frontage. Large-scale retail business and “big box” buildings are allowed so long as
       they accommodate automobile, pedestrian, and transit modes of transportation.
       Smaller retail and restaurant buildings are encouraged to be grouped continuously
       along the street, while individual building pads separated by large parking areas are
       discouraged. Table LU-8 specifies the uses and range of development allowed.
       A pedestrian-friendly, gridded street network is recommended for the interior to
       connect the commercial and residential areas, while surface parking areas are
       encouraged to be located behind buildings. Pedestrian connections to Foothill
       Boulevard and transit stops will also be important.

The residential component will provide connections in the form of small interior
streets and pedestrian paseos to the commercial and office components of the
development. Residential development should also include an active street front
instead of blank walls along Mayten Avenue and Malaga Drive, and interior streets to
connect the various parts of the development. Isolated and gated residential
development that is walled off from adjoining uses would be prohibited.
Nearly two acres of public space in the form of public plazas and fountains will
provide people with gathering areas in the commercial component of the
development. Additional recreational amenities are also encouraged for the
residential component of the development.

development is entirely built out. It surrounds an 18-hole golf course and includes the
Metrolink Station off Milliken Avenue. The Industrial Area Specific Plan (Empire
Lakes) Mixed Use area reflects the mixed land use approved under the Rancho
Cucamonga IASP Sub-Area 18 Specific Plan. The intent of the Mixed Use
designation is to:
        Promote planning flexibility to achieve more creative and imaginative
         employment-generating designs
        Integrate a wider range of retail commercial, service commercial, recreation,
         and office uses within this industrial area of the City
        Allow for the sensitive inclusion of high-density residential development that
         offers high-quality multi-unit condominiums and apartments for employees
         desiring housing close to work and transit
Table LU-9 specifies the uses and range of development allowed.

       Mixed Use: Foothill Boulevard and Deer Creek Channel
       This site, located at Foothill Boulevard along Deer Creek Channel (#9 on Figure LU-
       3), provides an excellent opportunity to integrate commercial and residential uses into
       a cohesive development. Commercial development will be sited along the Foothill
       Boulevard frontage, while residential development will be located toward the
       southern area of the property. Development should provide pedestrian access
       between uses and direct pedestrian connections to Foothill Boulevard and transit
       stops. High-density development should step down to detached residential
       development along the western boundary providing a transition to the adjacent low-
       density residential development. Public street connections to Hampshire Street and
       Devon Street in the adjacent residential neighborhood will be discouraged, except for
       emergency vehicles.

Mixed Use: Haven Avenue and Church Street
This 14.77-acre site, located on the south side of Church Street between Center and
Haven Avenues, was once the location of a San Bernardino County Flood Control
District retention basin (#10 on Figure LU-3). Deemed surplus due to drainage
improvements within the City of Rancho Cucamonga, it became available for private
development. Site development, as approved through a master plan, is nearly
completed, with Low Residential units lined along Center Avenue and Medium
Residential units located within the interior of the site.
Table LU-11 specifies the uses and range of development allowed.

Mixed Use: Western Gateway (Bear Gulch Area)
This area (#11 on Figure LU-3) serves as the entrance to the City from the west, and
is part of an important historical heritage that has not been able to compete
successfully in the market place. The intent is to achieve:
        A dynamic entrance to Rancho Cucamonga that reflects and sustains the
         historic character represented by a few existing structures in the area
        A “target district” that attracts specialty businesses and is attractive to both
         local residents and visitors to the community
        A significant example of the Historic Route 66 theme to exemplify the
         important role of the Rancho Cucamonga area during that historic era
        A sustainable economic vitality
The primary, but not exclusive, proposed uses are retail and service commercial
serving the Red Hill and Bear Gulch neighborhoods, as well as selective markets on
a more regional scale. This area has served as a “dinnerhouse” district, which is a
desirable continued role as exemplified by the Sycamore Inn and the Magic Lamp
Restaurants. However, there is not enough vitality in the area to sustain that
specialty. By allowing a mix of commercial, tourist commercial, office, and residential
development with somewhat greater intensities than currently prevail, the possibility
exists to generate investment interest in this area. Tourist-serving commercial uses
are an important component of this concept, but it must be recognized that the
location limits access to as large a market as could be achieved at a freeway
location. Office development is proposed as a means of achieving some level of
daytime and early evening population in the area. Residential development should be
multi-unit condominium and apartment types to energize the district during day and
evening business hours.

       northwest corner of Historic Route 66 Foothill Boulevard and Vineyard Avenue (#12
       on Figure LU-3). Like other newly designated Mixed Use areas, this site presents an

Mixed Use: Historic Alta Loma (Amethyst Site)
This is a relatively small, but significant, site within the historic Alta Loma commercial
area (#13 on Figure LU-3) that was once the location of a large citrus packing house.
The site is strategically located on the east side of Amethyst Street, between the
neighborhood elementary school and original downtown for the Alta Loma
community. This site, already developed, brings new activity into the historic town
center with multi-unit residential development. Table LU-14 specifies the uses and
range of development allowed.

Implications of Land Use Policy
Over time, the distribution of uses within the community will change as vacant
properties develop and application of land use policy will facilitate evolution toward
the mix of uses the City envisions. Table LU-15 summarizes the level of development
expected through the 2030 planning horizon year. The anticipated change from year
2009 baseline conditions are shown as well.
As planned infrastructure improvements, long-term public facility and service needs,
and resource use set forth in the other General Plan Chapters have been based on
these growth projections, the City will continue to track development to monitor
projected versus actual conditions, and to adjust policies and implementation
programs accordingly.
Tables LU-16 through LU-18 summarizes the build-out capacity in detail for each
land use designation.

       Notes: 
       1.  The Density Factor is based upon actual development that has occurred in the City and represents a level midway between 50% and 75% of the range. It is used to 
            calculate  the  target  number  of  dwelling  units.  This  factor  is  only  applied  to  vacant  developable  lands.  A  different  Density  Factor  was  applied  to  existing 
            development to obtain an accurate baseline number. 
       2.  The range of dwelling units is derived by multiplying the lower and upper threshold of density/intensity range by the number of acres, and rounded to the nearest 
            whole number. This range represents the theoretical potential. Some development will produce densities at or near the top of the range; however, most will not. 
       3.  Target dwelling units is the probable level of development based on historical development patterns, except for Mixed Use Residential, which is based primarily on 
            a target density. 
       4.  Mixed Use allows both residential and non‐residential uses. 
       5.  Open Space is generally a non‐residential category that permits a very limited number of residential units on privately owned properties. Within the City, Open 
            Space applies to the golf courses and the Pacific Electric Trail. In the northwest quadrant of the City, a few properties are designated Open Space and could yield 
            residential units. However, any such development would be limited to a density of 0.1 units per acre (or one unit per parcel on lots less than 10 acres in size) and 
            would be subject to the slope, drainage, flood zones, and fault zone analysis at a minimum under the Hillside Overlay Ordinance, further limiting any residential 
            development potential.

Focus Areas
The process of preparing the General Plan involved focusing on potential areas of
change, both from a geographic standpoint and a strategic or policy standpoint. For
each of these potential areas of change, or focus areas, existing conditions were
evaluated, and alternative directions were developed and analyzed. These focus
areas are Foothill Boulevard, South Haven Avenue, Southwest, Southeast, and the
Hillsides (see Figure LU-4: Focus Areas).
Foothill Boulevard
The Foothill Boulevard Focus Area covers most of the length of Historic Route 66 as
it runs through the City. While commercial uses predominate all along Foothill
Boulevard, the western and eastern portions of the boulevard have distinct land use
patterns. The western portion, which stretches from the western border of the City to
roughly Haven Avenue, is fronted by comparatively small parcels, with housing
developments directly behind them. In some instances, the residential uses extend all
the way to Foothill Boulevard. The eastern portion, which runs from Haven Avenue to
East Avenue, is fronted by much larger parcels that feature extensive retail centers
surrounded by parking lots. The eastern portion also includes some of the large,
vacant commercial lots remaining in Rancho Cucamonga, while the western portion
is largely built out.
The main issues for this focus area include:
        Encouraging commercial and Mixed Use development appropriate for the
         land use patterns of the Boulevard
        Concentrating commercial uses at major intersections to prepare Foothill
         Boulevard for the future integration of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service
         currently planned by Omnitrans
        Improving the visual feel of Foothill Boulevard to better recognize that as the
         City’s major east-west thoroughfare, it is the main public face of Rancho
         Cucamonga
                                                                                         Mercury Insurance office
                                                                                         building on Foothill
                                                                                         Boulevard.

                            The vision for this area includes:
                                   Involving the concentration of community- and regional-serving uses east of
                                    Haven Avenue, while neighborhood-serving uses are focused on the western
                                    portion
                                   Allow new Mixed Use, commercial, residential, and civic development
                                    opportunities along the length of the Boulevard
                                   Design new development in such a way as to accommodate both transit and
                                    automobile access
                            South Haven Avenue
                            The South Haven Avenue Focus Area covers a portion of Rancho Cucamonga that
                            the City envisions as its major office corridor. The Development Code supports this
                            vision through the use of an overlay district that offers incentives for office
                            development.
                            Haven Avenue, which north of the focus area runs past City Hall, is one of Rancho
                            Cucamonga’s most significant north-south corridors. To the south, the focus area
                            borders the City of Ontario, making the large vacant property just inside the City of
                            Rancho Cucamonga a prime location for a large “gateway” development to mark the
                            entrance to the City.
                            Established uses in the focus area range from small-scale office and commercial to
                            large-scale light industrial and warehousing. Large vacant parcels exist throughout
                            the area, although many have proposed or approved plans.

                            The vision for this area includes:
                                   Creating a central business hub at the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and
                                    Haven Avenue
                                   Encouraging development with an emphasis on the creation of pleasant,
                                    well-landscaped, office park settings, with restaurants and other amenities
                                    that are within walking distance for employees and visitors
                                   Attracting multi-story Class A office buildings

Southwest
The Southwest Focus Area is bordered to the south by the City of Ontario and to the
west by the City of Upland. The area is divided north from the south by a Metrolink
rail line that runs adjacent to 8th Street.
Uses in the focus area are primarily light industrial and warehousing, but planned
residential neighborhoods border the area to the southwest and the northeast. The
residential neighborhood to the southwest is isolated from commercial and retail uses
(e.g., grocery stores, restaurants, dry cleaners, etc.) in Rancho Cucamonga, and
those residents are likely to do much of their daily shopping in Ontario. The focus
area has several large vacant parcels remaining, although many have approved
development plans.
The focus area and the immediate surrounding area have several community
centers, including the Mulberry Early Learning Center, Northtown Community Center,
and the RC Family Resource Center. The historic neighborhood of Northtown, which
developed around the railroad tracks in the 1930s, is also located here, as is the
historic Biane Winery.
The City of Rancho Cucamonga applied for and received in 2009 a $360,000 four-
year grant from the prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to develop a
program and community partnership for the purpose of reducing childhood obesity in
Southwest Cucamonga. The focus of the grant will be to promote healthy eating and
active living for families and children.
The vision for this area includes:
          Allowing for the development of commercial and community services needed
           by the adjacent residential neighborhoods
          Implementing community design improvements and reducing truck traffic
           impacts on the residential neighborhoods
          Encouraging the re-use and rehabilitation of historic or high-quality buildings
           to the greatest extent possible
Southeast
The Southeast Focus Area is bordered to the west by I-15 and to the east by
unincorporated San Bernardino County and the City of Fontana. Heavy industrial
uses, primarily steel and pipe manufacturing predominate. Development located
directly north of the focus area includes a shopping center, a Metropolitan Water
District reservoir, and a multi-unit residential neighborhood. The focus area surrounds
Reliant Energy’s Etiwanda Power Plant on Etiwanda Avenue.
This area supports the only remaining land in Rancho Cucamonga devoted to heavy
industrial uses; these businesses are a valuable source of employment and revenue.
The focus area also benefits from proximity to the freeway, although the circulation
system requires improvements to meet the needs of the intensive truck traffic
generated by the industrial uses. (This issue is addressed in the Community Mobility
Chapter.)
For the health of residents as well as for the long-term economic viability of this part
of Rancho Cucamonga, wherever possible, the “greening” of businesses in the area
is strongly encouraged. The development of green businesses represents a

       tremendous opportunity for Rancho Cucamonga to maintain its leadership in the
       environmental arena.
       The vision for this focus area includes:
               Concentrating heavy industrial uses
               Supporting infrastructure improvements to attract industrial, manufacturing,
                and green technology uses
               Preventing encroachment of conflicting uses that would diminish the utility of
                the area for heavy industry
       Hillsides
       The Hillside Focus Area is in unincorporated San Bernardino County, adjacent to
       Rancho Cucamonga’s northern border; it lies within the City’s Sphere of Influence.
       Most of the area consists of undeveloped hillsides, although large-lot residential
       subdivisions have been established in the areas designated Hillside Residential (0.1
       to 2.0 du/ac) and Open Space (0.0 to 0.10 du/ac). The area also has significant land
       set aside for resource conservation in Day and East Etiwanda Canyons, where no
       development is allowed.
       Hillside development in Rancho Cucamonga is regulated by the Hillside Development
       Ordinance, which applies to all projects on land with natural slopes of eight percent
       grade or greater, with some exceptions, as indicated in the Ordinance. The Hillside
       Overlay District, as depicted on the Development District Map in the Development
       Code, defines the boundaries. The Hillside Overlay District also applies to areas
       outside of this focus area.
       The Ordinance includes a comprehensive set of guidelines and standards that seek
       to allow for reasonable development of hillside areas while minimizing the adverse
       effects of grading, protecting environmentally sensitive areas, and providing for public
       health and safety. The Ordinance contains basic design guidelines and minimum
       development standards. The intent is to encourage innovative and alternative
       development solutions, as well as to establish minimum acceptable criteria.
       Clustering of units is encouraged where feasible, and positioning the units to “fit” the
       land and minimize grading is required.
       The most significant provisions of the Ordinance involve the use of:
               Slope development standards, which require development integration with
                the slope and increasingly restrictive grading and structural design as the
                slope increases
               A slope density formula, which limits the maximum possible density allowed
                based upon the slope gradient
               Building envelopes, which limit the maximum allowable building height to 30
                feet, as measured from the finished grade
       Table LU-19: Slope Development Guidelines establishes the design, grading, and
       development criteria associated with various slope conditions. These guidelines are
       further defined in the Hillside Development Ordinance.

5 or less                This is not a hillside condition. Grading with conventional, fully
                         padded lots and terracing is acceptable.
5 to 7.9                 Development with grading is permitted in this zone, but existing
                         landforms must retain their natural character. Padded building sites
                         are permitted, however, techniques such as contour grading,
                         combined slopes, limited cut and fill, and split level architecture, or
                         padding for the structures only, may be required to reduce grading.
                         When in conjunction with the techniques described above, and for a
                         project within a master plan which includes special design features
                         such as a golf course, extensive open space, or significant use of
                         green belts or paseos, the Planning Commission may consider the
                         use of mass grading techniques adjacent to these special design
                         features as partial compliance with this standard.
8 to 14.9                This is a hillside condition. Special hillside architectural and design
                         techniques that minimize grading are required in this zone.
                         Architectural prototypes are expected to conform to the natural
                         landform by using techniques such as split level foundations of
                         greater than 18 inches, stem walls, stacking and clustering. In
                         conjunction with the alternative techniques described above, and for
                         a project within a master plan which includes special design
                         features such as a golf course, extensive open space or significant
                         use of green belts or paseos, the Planning Commission may
                         consider padded building sites adjacent to those special features
                         when it is found that said grading creates a better relationship
                         between that special design feature and the adjacent lots.

                         visually prominent slopes, and then only where it can be shown that
                         safety, environmental and aesthetic impacts can be minimized. Use
                         of larger lots, variable setbacks and variable building structural
                         techniques such as stepped, or pole foundations are expected.
                         Structures shall blend with the natural environment through their
                         shape, materials, and colors. Impact of traffic and roadways is to be
                         minimized by following natural contours, or using grade separations.
30 and over              This is an excessive slope condition and development is prohibited.
 
The vision for the Hillside Focus Area includes:
          Limit development to densities that do not exceed the capacity of the City to
           provide public services and adequate public safety or the capacity of the
           land; in particular, the City’s ability to protect any new development from
           wildland and fires is a significant concern
          Protect visually prominent natural landforms and other sensitive land
           resources
          Protect natural resources and sensitive habitat
          Provide opportunities to experience natural habitats through education
           programs for students and trail extensions
          Maintain a natural “visual frame” for the northern edge of the City

       General Plan Implementation Tools
       Conventional zoning districts consistent with land use designations in the General
       Plan will be used to implement the General Plan in many instances. By law, these
       districts and land use categories must be consistent with each other. The Rancho
       Cucamonga Development Code identifies the Development Districts that govern the
       use of properties. Table LU-20 identifies the consistency between the General Plan
       Land Use Designations and Development Districts.
       However, a number of considerations suggest that some form of customized zoning
       is appropriate as an implementation device. Several techniques are authorized under
       the General Plan, such as the Master Plan Overlay District, Specific Plan, and
       Planned Community Zoning.
       Master Plan Overlay District
       The Master Plan Overlay District is a combining district included in the Development
       Code that calls for preparation of a conceptual master plan as a precursor to
       development approval. Use of this implementation tool requires attention to
       development issues that may not be readily resolved through the use of conventional
       zoning districts or site development standards. The Master Plan Overlay District
       allows the City to address issues such as circulation, drainage, open space linkages,
       trail connections, compatibility with adjacent uses, and similar concerns through a
       comprehensive approach and creative design flexibility. Where Mixed Use
       designations are involved, use combinations and proportions can also be used to
       create more satisfactory results. Locations requiring this approach are shown on the
       General Plan Land Use Policy Map, Figure LU-1.
       Specific Plan
       Specific plans allow for flexibility in design and customized development standards
       tailored to specific needs and conditions. The Specific Plan is one of the most
       creative tools available for guiding and regulating development, but also requires
       considerable attention to detail and may be too involved for some situations. As
       specified by the California Government Code, a specific plan must be consistent with
       the General Plan and must respond to all of the required General Plan topics to the
       extent that they apply to the area in question.
       One of the problems associated with any customized zoning approach is that it
       imposes additional administrative burdens on the City. This is because each specific
       plan contains customized rules that may not be found elsewhere in the City’s
       regulatory system. To simplify the situation, development regulations for these plans
       have been incorporated into the Rancho Cucamonga Development Code.
       Planned Community Zoning
       Planned Community Zoning may be thought of as a less comprehensive form of a
       Specific Plan. It does allow custom design and development regulations, but its
       scope can be limited to only those aspects of the plan that deviate from conventional
       zoning requirements. It may include as many land use categories as are needed to
       implement the applicable General Plan designations. It is typically accompanied by
       thorough design guidelines to ensure a coherent, quality result as the Planning Area
       is built out.

       Etiwanda North Specific Plan
       The same development pressure that prompted the 1983 Etiwanda Specific Plan also
       necessitated the need for the Etiwanda North Specific Plan, adopted in 1992. The
       plan area is located just north of the Etiwanda Specific Plan. A portion of the Specific
       Plan area lies outside the City and outside the Sphere of Influence. Open space is
       the most prominent feature of the Etiwanda North area, which is comprised of a
       gently sloping alluvial fan and chaparral habitat situated on the lower slopes of the
       foothills. Drainage courses throughout the Etiwanda North area support a variety of
       tree species, including oak, sycamore, and walnut, among others. A unique feature of
       the area is a freshwater marsh, approximately 11 acres in size, located in the
       northwestern portion of the area. Open space is expected to remain a prominent
       feature even after development occurs. The Specific Plan builds upon the unique
       character and charm of the Etiwanda Specific Plan area by providing a land use
       pattern that extends the low-density character of Old Etiwanda into the Etiwanda
       North area.
       Etiwanda Specific Plan
       Etiwanda can be described as a rural community, characterized by large land
       parcels, eucalyptus tree rows, remnants of citrus groves and vineyards, stone curbs,
       and other elements that convey its unique and historic sense of place. The Specific
       Plan area is located within the northeast corner of the City and is roughly bounded by
       the I-15 to the southeast, the City’s Sphere of Influence to the north, the Victoria
       Planned Community to the west and the City’s industrial area to the south. The
       Specific Plan project area encompasses over 3,000 acres. The main purpose of the
       Specific Plan is to ensure the continued rural character of this portion of the City.
       Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan
       The Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan provides a balanced and unified pattern of
       development along Foothill Boulevard by taking advantage of opportunities in future
       community growth. The plan calls for a series of activity centers and gateways, linked
       through a unifying suburban parkway design.

An additional purpose is to capture and reflect the historic significance of this route as
part of the legendary Route 66 that linked Los Angeles and Chicago for several
critical decades during the twentieth century. Such landmarks as the Sycamore Inn
and the Magic Lamp Restaurant symbolize that memorable period in the emergence
of Southern California as a mecca for families seeking a better life. The combination
of use patterns, development standards, and design guidelines of the plan testify to
the area’s complex planning issues and the need for creative regulatory devices.
Ultimately, the goal of the Specific Plan is to give this critical centerpiece of the City
the prominence it deserves.
Industrial Area Specific Plan
The Industrial Area Specific Plan is a particularly significant specific plan due to its
successful role in the development of the City’s industrial base (which is a critical
component of an overall long-term balance of uses). Part of this success can be
attributed to the quality standards incorporated into the Specific Plan and the
protection those standards afford to business investors in this area. The Specific
Plan, encompassing nearly 5,000 acres, has been divided into three zones and 19
subareas. The subareas represent specific land use characteristics and development
constraints which can be dealt with on a subarea basis rather than through the
application of broadly applied development standards. The purpose of the Specific
Plan is to establish specific standards and guidelines that will be used for
development throughout the City’s industrial area.
Industrial Area Specific Plan Sub-Area 18 Plan (Empire Lakes)
The purpose of the Sub-Area 18 Specific Plan is to provide for a broader mix of land
uses than was originally permitted within the Industrial Area Specific Plan. The plan
was expanded to include such uses as recreational, hotel/conference center, retail,
restaurant, and entertainment, as well as office, research and development, and light
industrial uses. These uses are intended to surround the existing 18-hole golf course.
A subsequent amendment to further expand the use list included limited multi-unit
residential development to maximize potential use of the Metrolink Station near
Milliken Avenue.
Adopted Planned Communities
Caryn Planned Community Development Plan
The Caryn Planned Community Development Plan, now completed, lies north of the
Victoria planned community. The community’s special identity is provided by an
elementary school, single-unit residential development, and walking trails that tie the
community together.
Terra Vista Community Plan
The Terra Vista Community Plan area is centrally located in Rancho Cucamonga and
encompasses 1,321 acres. It is comprised of four distinct neighborhoods, with a
greenway serving as the backbone connector. The area is planned for a mix of
residential and commercial uses, with a large concentration of commercial and office
uses along Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue that serves as a community-wide
activity center.
Victoria Community Plan
The Victoria Community Plan area encompasses 2,150 acres and provides for a
series of residential villages and related support uses, designed around a central
spine called Victoria Park Lane. Victoria Community Plan includes the Victoria
Arbors Master Plan and the Victoria Gardens Master Plan.

                             Areas Subject to Flooding
                             According to State law as revised in 2007 (AB 162), General Plan land use chapters
                             must identify and annually review the areas covered by the General Plan that are
                             subject to flooding, as identified by floodplain mapping by either the Federal
                             Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Water Resources
                             (DWR). Flooding concerns are discussed in detail in the Public Health and Safety
                             Chapter. See Figure PS-5, Flood Hazards, in the Public Health and Safety Chapter
                             for map identifying flood hazards.

                             The State Department of Water Resources has initiated the Awareness Floodplain
                             Mapping project, with the goal of identifying all pertinent flood hazard areas in
                             California by 2015 for areas that are not mapped under the FEMA National Flood
                             Insurance Program, and to provide the community and residents with an additional
                             tool for understanding potential flood hazards that are currently not mapped as a
                             regulated floodplain. The awareness maps identify the 100-year flood hazard areas
                             using approximate assessment procedures. As of 2009, the State Department of
                             Water Resources had not prepared any flood studies for San Bernardino County.

Key Land Use Issues
Key issues relative to land use are:
        Protecting Established, Stable Residential Neighborhoods. Rancho
         Cucamonga’s stable residential neighborhoods are an asset to the
         community. While proposed development in and around predominantly
         single-unit residential neighborhoods needs to be carefully evaluated, it is
         also important to recognize that some land use compatibility issues can be
         addressed through proper design. Transitions between single-unit
         residential and more intensive uses are inevitable, and new development
         will incorporate strategies and measures that will continue to protect single-
         unit residential neighborhoods.
        Infill Development. Rancho Cucamonga will be encouraging development
         of vacant or underutilized land located in the built-up areas of the City. Any
         new infill development should be planned to be complementary with
         surrounding development and to minimize impacts. Appropriate
         infrastructure and supporting services must be adequate or in place to
         serve new infill development without sacrificing services to the existing
         population. Rancho Cucamonga must also work hard to assist in land
         assembly and lot consolidation to create more successful infill development
         projects.
        Linking Transportation and Land Use. As Rancho Cucamonga moves
         forward, it will be essential to connect land use decisions with transportation
         improvements. As stated earlier, Rancho Cucamonga is a very automobile-
         oriented community, but new opportunities such as Mixed Use development
         along Foothill Boulevard, the opening of the Pacific Electric Trail, and
         Victoria Gardens show the potential to increase walking, bicycling, and
         transit options. See the Community Mobility Chapter for more information
         regarding transportation and land use linkages.
        Revitalizing Older, Deteriorating Areas. Some areas of Rancho
         Cucamonga are showing signs of deterioration, deferred maintenance, and
         the inadequacy of pre-incorporation standards for development. Attention
         must be given to these areas before conditions become worse.
        Protection of Hillsides. Hillside development is a sensitive issue since it
         involves the loss of open space, fire protection issues, and can disrupt
         views of mountainsides. Issues that need to be addressed when
         considering hillside development include, but are not limited to, views and
         vistas, fire safety, excessive grading and scarring of land, and habitat
         protection.

Land Use Goals and Policies
The following goals and policies are aimed at providing guidance and policy direction regarding land use in Rancho
Cucamonga.
  GOAL LU-1:          Ensure established residential neighborhoods are preserved and
                      protected, and local and community-serving commercial and
                      community facilities meet the needs of residents.
                 Policy LU-1.1:     Protect neighborhoods from the encroachment of
                                    incompatible activities or land uses that may have a negative
                                    impact on the residential living environment.
                     Discussion:    Rancho Cucamonga has many stable, high-quality residential
                                    neighborhoods that constitute a significant part of the City’s
                                    character. Without land use controls, new development could
                                    encroach on these areas and diminish the quality of life in these
                                    neighborhoods.
                 Policy LU-1.2:     Designate appropriate land uses to serve local needs and be
                                    able to respond to regional market needs, as appropriate.
                     Discussion:    Rancho Cucamonga is located near major transportation
                                    corridors including the I-10, I-15, and SR-210 freeways, as well
                                    as major roadways such as Foothill Boulevard and Base Line
                                    Road. Because of the recognized quality of development within
                                    Rancho Cucamonga, the City can serve both local and regional
                                    needs.
                 Policy LU-1.3:     Encourage commercial centers that serve a broad range of
                                    retail and service needs for the community.
                     Discussion:    The community seeks a range of neighborhood, community, and
                                    regional commercial centers at convenient locations throughout
                                    the City. The locations of various types of centers, as guided by
                                    the General Plan land use designations, are expected to provide
                                    reasonable competition and choice of merchandise for residents
                                    and visitors.
                 Policy LU-1.4:     Continue code enforcement activities to ensure proper
                                    maintenance of homes, buildings, yards, and neighborhoods
                                    in all areas of the City, and work with businesses and
                                    homeowners to gain compliance.
                     Discussion:    Although many of Rancho Cucamonga neighborhoods and
                                    commercial businesses are stable and attractive, it is important to
                                    maintain a high level of maintenance standards to prevent
                                    deterioration that would impact property values and the overall
                                    character of the City.
                 Policy LU-1.5:     Development of densities and intensities shall be
                                    implemented within the ranges specified in the General Plan;
                                    neither higher nor lower than the limits of the range.
                                
                                                   Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic Resources 
  LU‐56                                         R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

                 Discussion: To achieve the goals of the General Plan, land resources should
                             be developed as efficiently as possible, yet should not exceed
                             the ranges specified in the land use categories. If a land use
                             change is proposed, a General Plan amendment is required in
                             order to properly evaluate and consider that change.
                             Development within the allowed density/intensity range is
                             performance-driven, and only rarely will development be allowed
                             at the upper end of the range.
             Policy LU-1.6:  Encourage small-lot, single-unit attached and/or detached
                             residential development (5,200-square-foot lots or smaller)
                             to locate in areas where this density would be compatible
                             with adjacent residential neighborhoods.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga takes pride in the quality of its residential
                             neighborhoods and the predominantly single-unit character. The
                             General Plan seeks to retain that primary character while also
                             providing for a variety of housing densities. Diversity of housing
                             types is important for long-term sustainability of the community,
                             and a variety of housing densities can be accommodated in
                             appropriate locations.
GOAL LU-2: Facilitate sustainable and attractive infill development that
                 complements surrounding neighborhoods and is accessible to
                 pedestrians, bicycles, transit, and automobiles.
             Policy LU-2.1:  Plan for vibrant, pedestrian-friendly Mixed Use and high-
                             density residential areas at strategic infill locations along
                             transit routes.
                 Discussion: Based on a comprehensive land use analysis, the General Plan
                             identifies areas that are appropriate for Mixed Use development.
                             Generally, these areas are located along Foothill Boulevard,
                             although other limited areas designated for Mixed Use
                             development are located within the southern industrial section of
                             the City. The General Plan allows considerable latitude in terms
                             of the mix of uses and development density/intensity to
                             encourage excellence of design, integrated uses, and
                             sustainability in Mixed Use development.
            Policy LU-2.2:   Require new infill development to be designed for
                             pedestrians and automobiles equally, and to provide
                             connections to transit and bicycle facilities.
                 Discussion: While the development pattern of Rancho Cucamonga demands
                             significant automobile usage to get from one use to another, the
                             General Plan seeks to achieve a more balanced mix of
                             transportation choices as the City evolves. Consequently, the
                             General Plan expands the potential for Mixed Use development
                             in key areas. Development of higher-density housing mixed with
                             a variety of commercial and civic uses, and public spaces, with
                             convenient access for pedestrians, bicycle riders, and transit
                             users will have positive impacts on air quality, mobility, and other
                             general quality of life measures.

         Policy LU-2.3:   Provide direct pedestrian connections between development
                          projects where possible.
              Discussion: Development should include access for pedestrians, bicycles,
                          transit, as well as automobiles. Focus should be placed on
                          creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment that encourages
                          both walking and bicycling. This connectivity will provide for and
                          maintain the existing high level of public safety provided to
                          residents.
         Policy LU-2.4:   Promote complementary infill development, rehabilitation,
                          and re-use that contribute positively to the surrounding
                          residential neighborhood areas.
              Discussion: The General Plan encourages the development of vacant
                          residential lots where they are largely surrounded by other
                          residential development to maximize efficient use of existing
                          infrastructure and to meet housing demand. Land use controls
                          that include development standards will ensure that infill
                          development is compatible with neighboring uses.
         Policy LU-2.5:   Facilitate effective use of land constrained by challenging
                          parcel sizes and dimensions, and encourage consolidation
                          of parcels to provide greater development flexibility.
              Discussion: Where properties or vacant lands have not been developed or
                          revitalized due to insufficient property sizes, the General Plan
                          encourages consolidation of properties. Financial incentives,
                          increased density/intensity bonuses to help spur development, or
                          greater flexibility in development standards are effective tools
                          that can be utilized to facilitate parcel consolidation where
                          desired.
GOAL LU-3:    Encourage sustainable development patterns that link
              transportation improvements and planned growth, create a
              healthy balance of jobs and housing, and protect the natural
              environment.
          Policy LU-3.1:  Encourage the creation and maintenance of regional
                          employment, cultural and retail destinations, as well as a full
                          range of amenities and services to support residents of
                          Rancho Cucamonga.
              Discussion: The Rancho Cucamonga community currently enjoys a wealth of
                          various employment, cultural, entertainment, and retail
                          destinations. The General Plan recognizes that the City will need
                          to continue to attract and maintain a balanced mix of uses, a
                          range of amenities, and high-quality development to adequately
                          meet the needs of the growing population base.
         Policy LU-3.2:   Encourage a mix of retail, service, industrial and
                          manufacturing, and professional uses that create diverse,
                          well-paying employment opportunities.

                 Discussion: A diverse employment base that includes different business
                             sectors allows for a diverse workforce and income levels. This
                             diversity allows for competitive salaries and rewarding
                             employment opportunities for all levels of society. Further, a
                             diverse employment base maximizes job opportunities for
                             Rancho Cucamonga residents. The General Plan establishes a
                             comprehensive set of land use designations that allows flexibility
                             and responsiveness to market conditions and supports a diversity
                             of businesses.
            Policy LU-3.3:   Locate regionally serving land uses with immediate access
                             to the regional transportation network that is designed to
                             provide maximum access capabilities and permit maximum
                             dispersal of traffic.
                 Discussion: Regional-serving businesses depend on good access to the
                             regional transportation network. Consequently, the General Plan
                             designates areas near the I-15 corridor and the area surrounding
                             Foothill Boulevard and the I-15 for important commercial and
                             Mixed Use development.
            Policy LU-3.4:   Promote development that is sustainable in its use of land
                             and that limits impacts to natural resources, energy, and air
                             and water quality.
                 Discussion: Since incorporation, development in the City has been held to
                             very high site development standards and exacting aesthetic
                             requirements. The level of community standards are high and it is
                             important to preserve the qualities that Rancho Cucamonga has
                             achieved. The General Plan carries forward the community
                             expectations of excellence, and enhances those expectations
                             with new policies and guidelines that strongly encourage new
                             development to incorporate sustainability in site design,
                             construction and building materials, and long-term operations.
            Policy LU-3.5:   Work toward a sustainable jobs-housing balance by
                             accommodating a range and balance of land uses within
                             Rancho Cucamonga.
                 Discussion: The General Plan establishes diverse commercial, industrial, and
                             Mixed Use land use designations that allow many opportunities
                             for business development. Prime commercial and industrial areas
                             are protected from encroachment of uses that will diminish the
                             utility of those areas for their intended purpose. The Mixed Use
                             designations also promote a sustainable mix of residential and
                             commercial development.
            Policy LU-3.6:   Create focused, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods that are
                             reminiscent of the qualities found in earlier days, particularly
                             within the original communities of Cucamonga, Alta Loma,
                             and Etiwanda, and along Historic Route 66 (Foothill
                             Boulevard).

             Discussion: Many historic neighborhoods built in Southern California were
                         designed for walking, so older neighborhoods in Rancho
                         Cucamonga are often more walkable than newer developments.
                         Improved walkability means better pedestrian connections
                         between neighborhoods and schools, parks and open space, and
                         commercial centers. Pedestrian-friendly approaches should be
                         incorporated into all new development as part of the Healthy RC
                         Initiative.
        Policy LU-3.7:   Encourage new development projects to build on vacant
                         infill sites within a built-out area, and/or redevelop
                         previously developed properties that are underutilized.
             Discussion: Infill development puts more people near shops, restaurants, and
                         other amenities, which increases the liveliness of an area and the
                         economic viability of its businesses. Infill projects can provide
                         neighborhood centers with a Main Street flavor, including the
                         presence of civic buildings and public places. Infill and
                         redevelopment of this nature creates more sustainable
                         development that improves efficiencies in the use of
                         infrastructure and the use of land, and over time improves
                         efficiencies in energy and transportation.
        Policy LU-3.8:   Implement land use patterns and policies that incorporate
                         smart growth practices, including placement of higher
                         densities near transit centers and along transit corridors,
                         allowing Mixed Use development, and encouraging and
                         accommodating pedestrian movement.
             Discussion: Smart growth emphasizes accessibility, meaning that the
                         activities people use frequently are located close together. Its
                         practices integrate transportation and land use decisions by
                         encouraging more compact, Mixed Use development within
                         existing urban areas and along transit lines, such as Omnitrans
                         bus routes and possible future Bus Rapid Transit lines. Higher-
                         density development along transit corridors could lead to fewer
                         automobile trips as residents opt for transit use, particularly along
                         Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue.
        Policy LU-3.9:   Facilitate revitalization of aging commercial centers by
                         working with property owners, developers, local businesses,
                         and other community organizations to coordinate efforts.
             Discussion: Several aging commercial shopping centers located in the
                         western portion of Rancho Cucamonga are in need of
                         revitalization or a major facelift. Revitalization of aging
                         commercial centers will assist in maintaining a healthy, strong tax
                         base and provide improved commercial services for surrounding
                         residential neighborhoods.
       Policy LU-3.10:   Reserve appropriate areas of land for institutional uses to
                         ensure that necessary services are provided to all areas of
                         the community, and to encourage the creation of job
                         opportunities for Rancho Cucamonga residents.
             Discussion: Industrial land areas are limited and a precious economic
                         resource. The City needs to pay close attention to maintaining a
                         proper balance of uses and will assist non-industrial users in
                         finding appropriate locations throughout the City.

            Policy LU-3.11:  New development should be permitted especially where it is
                             logical to extend existing infrastructure improvements and
                             includes housing of varied densities.
                 Discussion: Our Planning Area is almost 50 square miles, and we seek to
                             have the City develop in an organized fashion. We much prefer
                             to expand in a cost-effective way by avoiding the leapfrog
                             development patterns typical of some areas that experience high
                             growth pressures.
GOAL LU-4:       Establish a pedestrian-friendly Foothill Boulevard corridor that
                 facilitates transit use and provides a range of commercial
                 destinations to serve both local and regional needs.
             Policy LU-4.1:  Provide new Mixed Use development opportunities along the
                             Foothill Boulevard Corridor to allow residential, commercial,
                             and civic uses, and to accommodate both transit and
                             automobiles.
                 Discussion: A key focus of the Foothill Boulevard planning concept is the
                             design of an attractive, pedestrian-oriented corridor that
                             promotes the use of walking, biking, and transit, and that
                             supports the potential for higher-density mixed commercial and
                             residential uses throughout the corridor.
            Policy LU-4.2:   Concentrate community- and regional-serving uses on
                             Foothill Boulevard (east of Haven Avenue), providing a
                             range of commercial, office, residential, restaurant, and
                             entertainment-related uses.
                 Discussion: Eastern Foothill Boulevard (east of Haven Avenue) will focus
                             more on community and regionally focused retail and commercial
                             service land uses. There will be some opportunities to integrate
                             residential, commercial, office, and medical uses. These uses are
                             meant to work together to create an environment that is
                             pedestrian friendly, but also accommodates transit, bicycle, and
                             automobile use.
            Policy LU-4.3:   Focus neighborhood-serving uses on Foothill Boulevard
                             (west of Haven Avenue), and encourage a range of
                             commercial and residential uses.
                 Discussion: Western Foothill Boulevard (west of Haven Avenue) should focus
                             on improving neighborhood-serving retail and commercial
                             services to better meet the needs of surrounding residential
                             neighborhoods. There will be opportunities to integrate residential
                             and commercial uses as Mixed Use at designated properties.
            Policy LU-4.4:   Concentrate commercial uses near major intersections.

             Discussion: Concentrating large commercial centers at major intersections
                         will result in an improved critical mass of commercial activity at
                         accessible locations and accommodate greater vehicular traffic,
                         while addressing commercial needs of the community. Better
                         defined and designed commercial development at these
                         locations also has the potential to become community focal
                         points.
        Policy LU-4.5:   Continue to reinforce the identity of the intersection of
                         Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue by supporting
                         development projects that are comparable to the quality of
                         the Civic Center and County Courthouse complex, Terra
                         Vista Town Center, and the adaptive re-use of the historic
                         Virginia Dare Winery.
             Discussion: The intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue is an
                         important area of the City due to the civic uses of the City Hall
                         and Courthouse complex, the re-use of the Virginia Dare Winery,
                         the Town Square Mixed Use project, and the Terra Vista Town
                         Center Shopping Center.
        Policy LU-4.6:   Accommodate land uses that support the activity centers
                         envisioned in the Historic Cucamonga sector, as identified in
                         the Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan.
             Discussion: Creating identifiable centers is important in placemaking. Building
                         on the City’s historic routes is a viable way to create meaningful
                         places with appropriate land uses. See the Historic Resources
                         section of this Chapter for more information regarding historic
                         districts.
GOAL LU-5: Support a regionally serving office district that provides
             professional and technical employment opportunities for the
             Inland Empire.
         Policy LU-5.1:  Create a central business hub at the intersection of Foothill
                         Boulevard and Haven Avenue, extending south to 4th Street,
                         with higher-intensity office, commercial, and public/quasi-
                         public uses.
             Discussion: To accommodate more office and professional uses in Rancho
                         Cucamonga, Haven Avenue, between Foothill Boulevard and the
                         City’s southern boundary, is planned as the City’s office district.
                         The proximity to transportation, including the freeways, Metrolink,
                         and the proposed Bus Rapid Transit system will benefit workers
                         as well as reducing the need for the automobile for commuting.
        Policy LU-5.2:   Encourage development along the Haven Avenue Corridor
                         that incorporates appropriate intensity and design
                         excellence for an important gateway to Rancho Cucamonga.

                 Discussion: Haven Avenue is a major gateway into the City from the south
                             and I-10; consequently, development in this area is very
                             important to the City’s image. Future office and business park
                             development at this gateway location, particularly at major street
                             intersections such as Haven Avenue and 4th Street, should be
                             appealing, eye-catching, and representative of the design quality
                             found throughout the City. Further, the inclusion of certain iconic
                             design elements can foster a unique gateway identity.
            Policy LU-5.3:   Promote the Haven Avenue Corridor as a distinctive,
                             attractive, and pleasant office park atmosphere that caters to
                             professional, technological, and similar businesses in a
                             campus-like setting with a prestigious identity.
                 Discussion: The Haven Avenue Corridor is an outstanding location for
                             office/business park usage. The proximity to the Civic Center,
                             freeways, Metrolink, and the proposed Bus Rapid Transit system
                             is convenient for business and reduces the need to commute by
                             automobile. The location is close to the LA/Ontario International
                             Airport without any of the negative impacts of being near such a
                             facility.
            Policy LU-5.4:   Promote a pedestrian-friendly corridor where employees can
                             walk to restaurants, commercial services, and other
                             amenities in the area.
                 Discussion: Haven Avenue is planned to accommodate a more pedestrian-
                             friendly environment with retail and dining opportunities within
                             walking distance so that employees and visitors can walk to
                             amenities.
            Policy LU-5.5:   Require development to provide courtyards and plazas,
                             public art, and landscaped open spaces that promote safe
                             and convenient pedestrian movement with continuous
                             landscaped pathways between buildings and along Haven
                             Avenue.
                 Discussion: As an important gateway to the City, Haven Avenue is intended
                             to accommodate a well-designed, business-friendly environment
                             that can be enjoyed by employees and visitors. High-quality
                             public spaces that connect to other buildings and other
                             properties, parking areas, sidewalks, streets, and transit are
                             design features that contribute to walkability, and the creation of
                             sustainable development. These public spaces can include public
                             art, shaded resting areas, and a variety of hardscape and
                             softscape surfaces to create a more pleasant environment.
            Policy LU-5.6:   Support the integration of transportation facilities, including
                             transit, to support the office environment.
                 Discussion: Haven Avenue is a heavily used roadway that connects major
                             land uses in the City, including Chaffey College, Terra Vista
                             Town Center, the Civic Center, large office complexes, and
                             LA/Ontario International Airport. Over the long term, it will be
                             important to integrate land uses with transportation opportunities
                             due to the various activity centers located along Haven Avenue.

              Discussion: The residential neighborhoods in southwest Rancho Cucamonga
                          are not well served by any commercial shopping centers, in large
                          part due to a lack of proximity. The closest centers are located
                          south in neighboring Ontario or in the Foothill Boulevard and
                          Vineyard Avenue areas. However, there are several community
                          centers in southwest Rancho Cucamonga, including the
                          Northtown Community Center (affiliated with the Northtown
                          Housing Development Corporation) and the RC Family Resource
                          Center, that provide community services to area residents.
         Policy LU-6.2:   Minimize impacts of industrial development and truck traffic
                          in residential areas or on residential streets.
              Discussion: Southwest        Rancho      Cucamonga        contains     residential
                          neighborhoods that are interspersed with industrial development.
                          Some pockets of residential uses are located in close proximity to
                          industrial uses and can be affected by noise, vibrations, and truck
                          traffic. Wherever possible, these impacts existing from
                          development should be addressed through code enforcement.
                          New development should include mitigation such as limits on
                          hours of operation, buffering through sound walls, site design and
                          landscaping, and traffic control enhancements to reduce adverse
                          impacts to residential neighborhoods.
         Policy LU-6.3:   Protect and preserve historical sites that reflect the area’s
                          long-standing agricultural heritage.
              Discussion: The historic Northtown community is located in southwest
                          Rancho Cucamonga. Several historic structures are still standing
                          within this community. It is vital to the heritage of the community
                          to preserve these buildings, wherever possible. The General Plan
                          encourages adaptive re-use and other historic incentives to
                          protect buildings. See the Historic Resources section of this
                          Chapter for more information regarding historic structures.
         Policy LU-6.4:   Support infrastructure improvements that
                          investment in southwest Rancho Cucamonga.
                                                                                   encourage
              Discussion: Maintenance and investment in infrastructure and services are
                          essential to improving the stability and vitality of southwest
                          Rancho Cucamonga. The condition of the area’s infrastructure
                          and buildings, particularly sidewalks and streetscapes, as well as
                          availability of services or lack thereof, communicate a great deal
                          about a community identity. Well-maintained, inviting,
                          aesthetically pleasing elements make a strong quality statement
                          about Rancho Cucamonga as a whole, and are particularly
                          important in conveying the message that southwest Rancho
                          Cucamonga is a desirable area for business investment.

            Policy LU-6.5:   Encourage the re-use and rehabilitation of historic or high-
                             quality existing buildings.
                 Discussion: Re-use of existing buildings conserves building materials in a
                             way that is not possible for new development, and is therefore
                             highly consistent with the sustainability goals of the community.
                             Historic buildings, if preserved, can significantly contribute to the
                             unique character of a neighborhood. See the Historic Resources
                             section of this Chapter for more information regarding historic
                             structures.
GOAL LU-7:       Encourage diverse employment-generating land uses that are
                 clean and modern, and that incorporate green technologies.
             Policy LU-7.1:  Concentrate heavy industrial and utility-related uses in the
                             area immediately surrounding the electrical power plant.
                 Discussion: Historically, more intensive industrial uses have located near the
                             electrical power plant in an area on Etiwanda Avenue, south of
                             Arrow Highway. Continued use of this area for heavy industrial
                             activity will help the City avoid dependency on too narrow a
                             spectrum of industrial and commercial businesses, and some
                             accommodation of heavy industry is important for the City’s
                             economic health and jobs-housing balance. However, future
                             economic development does not require a significant expansion
                             of heavy industrial uses, particularly of a visually intrusive nature.
            Policy LU-7.2:   Support infrastructure improvements to attract light
                             industrial and manufacturing uses, green technology uses,
                             energy-related businesses, and research and development
                             uses.
                 Discussion: Future development of a range of light industrial uses will create
                             job opportunities for Rancho Cucamonga residents. By investing
                             in infrastructure that serves green technology businesses, and by
                             providing desired amenities, Rancho Cucamonga can establish
                             itself as a leader in green and clean technologies. This reputation
                             will further attract desirable industries that, in turn, further
                             improve the jobs-housing balance.
            Policy LU-7.3:   Support public and quasi-public uses in southeast Rancho
                             Cucamonga that are complementary to heavy industrial land
                             uses.
                 Discussion: The West Valley Detention Center, Reliant Energy Etiwanda
                             Generating Station, and Metropolitan Water District facilities are
                             all located in southeast Rancho Cucamonga. Additional uses that
                             could be accommodated in the area include complementary
                             public and quasi-public uses such as passive solar and wind
                             power generation plants and recycling facilities.

GOAL LU-8:    Encourage visually attractive hillsides where the natural
              environment is protected, a sustainable level of development is
              ensured, and appropriate measures to protect against hazards
              are in place.
          Policy LU-8.1:  Regulate development on natural slopes of eight percent
                          grade or greater through the City’s Hillside Development
                          Ordinance.
              Discussion: The Development Code contains a comprehensive set of hillside
                          development regulations that are applied to all projects within a
                          hillside area (eight percent slope or greater), including parcel
                          maps, tentative tract maps, and site plans. The regulations
                          establish special review procedures; methods for slope
                          determination; guidelines and standards for site design, road
                          construction, landscaping, architecture, drainage, and grading;
                          and provisions for transfer of dwelling unit allocations. The
                          Ordinance encourages innovative design that is sensitive to the
                          unique characteristics of hillside areas. The Hillside Ordinance
                          applies to areas within the City and the Sphere of Influence,
                          although the County of San Bernardino has final land use
                          decision power if the area is not annexed to the City.
         Policy LU-8.2:   Approve only those residential densities that do not exceed
                          the capacity of the land or the ability to reasonably provide
                          public services and adequate public safety.
              Discussion: The Hillside Development Ordinance provides slope density
                          regulations that correlate the intensity of development to the
                          steepness of the terrain in order to establish the carrying capacity
                          of a site (buildable area). This ensures that the amount of
                          development in slope areas can be adequately supported by
                          roads and other essential services. Regulating density based on
                          the terrain is also used to minimize grading impacts, minimize
                          removal of vegetation, and address landslide and fire hazards.
         Policy LU-8.3:   Require adequate access for emergency vehicles and
                          evacuations.
              Discussion: Providing access in the event of an emergency is crucial for the
                          public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Hillside
                          residents must be able to evacuate and emergency vehicles
                          must be able to get to properties in a timely manner. Multiple
                          roadway options shall be required in the event that one of the
                          roadways is blocked or inaccessible. Roadway planning in the
                          hillside terrain must be reviewed by the Fire District and the
                          Engineering Department.
         Policy LU-8.4:   Prohibit extensive disturbances and scarring of ridgelines
                          and other distinctive landforms in the hillsides.

                 Discussion: The scarring of hillsides through extensive grading can be visible
                             to most of Rancho Cucamonga. This scarring is unattractive,
                             changes the hillside character, removes native vegetation, and
                             visually impacts most of the community. Hillside development can
                             be accomplished through sensitive site design and grading
                             techniques.
            Policy LU-8.5:   Protect natural resources and sensitive habitat areas, and
                             avoid encroachment from new hillside development.
                 Discussion: The hillsides of Rancho Cucamonga include important natural
                             resources such as water recharge areas and sensitive habitat
                             such as the alluvial fan sage scrub. In order to continue to supply
                             the City with adequate water, recharge areas must be
                             maintained. An additional benefit is the preservation of wildlife
                             corridors.
            Policy LU-8.6:   Require that hillside development minimize alteration of
                             natural landforms, and encourage clustering where feasible
                             to retain maximum open space.
                 Discussion: The objectives for managing development in hillside areas are to
                             maintain existing slopes, vegetation, wildlife corridors, drainage
                             patterns, knolls, rock outcrops, and ridgelines wherever feasible.
                             Furthermore, the City should avoid development that would result
                             in fire, flooding, landslide, erosion, and other safety hazards. The
                             City seeks hillside development that limits the extent of grading
                             alterations to natural landforms, and provides for innovative
                             design and arrangement of building sites that retain significant
                             natural habitats and features. Clustering is a way of laying out a
                             project whereby the structures are “clustered” together and open
                             space is shared by the residents.
            Policy LU-8.7:   Blend hillside development with natural surroundings
                             through architecture and the use of appropriate construction
                             materials, colors, and natural vegetation.
                 Discussion: Building designs can accommodate the natural terrain by
                             incorporating split pads or stepped footings, or by detaching part
                             of the dwelling such as the garage. Building massing, height, and
                             roof design are also important elements in preserving the
                             character of the hillside. Construction materials that blend with
                             the terrain include treated wood, wood-like materials, or river
                             rock. Landscaping standards around hillside properties include
                             erosion control and the use of fuel modification zones around all
                             structures in hillside areas, as required by the Fire District. This
                             includes the use of fire resistant vegetation, proper spacing of
                             trees and shrubs, and annual clearance of debris.

        Policy LU-8.8:   Provide conveniently located places to experience nature in
                         the northerly reaches of the Planning Area, particularly
                         through trail extensions and educational programs.
             Discussion: Trails located in the hillsides and Sphere of Influence can provide
                         opportunities for the public to experience the natural
                         environment. The North Etiwanda Preserve is an example of
                         providing trails for the public to enjoy within protected open space
                         areas. Other examples include access to Cucamonga Canyon or
                         the San Bernardino National Forest. Linear buffer parks are
                         another example. Such parks simultaneously manage, maintain,
                         and preserve the natural ecosystem while providing a visually
                         appealing, educational, and light recreational use fire break
                         between hillside development and the open undisturbed Wildland
                         areas.
        Policy LU-8.9:   Restrict intensive uses and activities in areas where they
                         would be threatened by natural or man-made hazards.
             Discussion: Certain portions of our City are vulnerable to flooding and wildfire
                         damage. Though other hazards exist, these two are the most
                         prevalent. We want to make sure that intensities of development
                         in areas vulnerable to these hazards are kept to a minimum and,
                         in the limited cases where they do occur, that life and property
                         are protected to the maximum degree feasible.
       Policy LU-8.10:   Hillside development shall be controlled by customized
                         regulations.
             Discussion: Public safety and aesthetic implications for the limited hillside
                         terrain in our City require special design attention. Moreover,
                         particularly in the Sphere of Influence area, the visual impact of
                         development on the rest of our community is substantial.
                         Consequently, we will maintain and apply stringent hillside
                         development standards.

Community Design
Rancho Cucamonga has long stood apart from other communities in the Inland
Empire by focusing on high-quality development with a persistent attention to detail in
matters of design. This investment in community design has created an excellent
foundation for continuing these practices, and this General Plan identifies how the
City will continue to sustain and build upon its past achievements.
Community design is not just about aesthetics; community design has distinct
functional dimensions as well. This is especially true in Rancho Cucamonga. The City
evolved from three historic communities (Alta Loma, Cucamonga, and Etiwanda).
The City faced the challenge of not only respecting the qualities of these
communities, but achieving a coherence and identity for the City as a whole. Design,
therefore, applies at multiple levels, from citywide, to district, to neighborhood, and
down to individual projects. Community design policies at any scale must lead to
creating places and environments that are alive, function effectively, promote health
and sustainability (public, social, and economic), respect people, have meaning, and
create a sense of identity and place. Linear systems—highways, streets, sidewalks,
trails, and open space corridors, for example—must perform both a useful function as
well as contribute to the aesthetic qualities that make an enjoyable living
environment.
General Design Principles
The principles for achieving this overall objective include the following:
         Innovative design, regardless of its style, is more important to the
          achievement of “quality” than the use of any predetermined theme.
          Innovative design promotes the use of novel variations to solve common and
          unique problems in urban development. (An exception is where both theme
          and innovation are essential in districts with a strong historical character).
         High quality is the result of extensive consideration in providing innovative
          and appropriate solutions to all aspects of the design.
         Developments should be designed to serve the community’s residents,
          businesses, and visitors, as well as reflect the community’s aesthetic values.
         Designers are expected to respect and work in concert with community
          goals, as well as address client requests.
         Designers should not view their project singularly, but as part of a larger
          master plan area in which they are responsible for design continuity and
          compatibility.
         Rancho Cucamonga does not depend on standardized design solutions; “off
          the shelf” model buildings which may be accepted elsewhere are not
          necessarily the acceptable measure of quality design in the community.
         New developments should acknowledge the positive aspects of nearby
          existing buildings by incorporating compatible features.

                                      Architectural styles should complement and augment surrounding
                                       development. They should convey a sense of thoughtfulness and not
                                       expediency.
                                      Building elevations should give equal attention to architectural detail and
                                       interest on all faces, including the rear.
                                      Design in Rancho Cucamonga pays careful attention to detail because that is
                                       where real quality is manifested.
                                      Be wary of the same architectural style repeated too often or over too large
                                       an area. It can become boring and, as a result, no longer communicate
                                       quality.
                                      Encourage the use of “green” design techniques as outlined in the City’s
                                       “green” building standards.
                              Pattern and Scale of Development
                              Rancho Cucamonga exhibits a wide variety of building types and forms, from homes,
                              to large shopping centers, to industrial plants. Together these buildings create
                              variation in the form and character of the City. In both direct and indirect ways, the
                              built environment can either foster or inhibit the pursuit of varying lifestyles. In the
                              northwest area of the City for example, a rural pattern of development (large irregular
                              lots and low-scale, large structures) allows for lifestyles that are more agrarian, such
                              as equestrian and agriculture uses. Much of the City exhibits a more suburban
                              pattern of development (small lots, majority single-unit homes) that accommodates
                              family oriented lifestyles, requiring a closer relationship between home, school, and
                              recreation. Within urban centers, such as Victoria Gardens, a more urban
                              development pattern (combined and integrated mix of compatible uses, higher-
                              density, and taller structures) helps create a focused multi-use district. Urbanized
                              areas are intended to be unique and engaging experiences that offer more
                              pedestrian and transit opportunities, convenient access to activities, public spaces,
                              and a wide array of uses.
                              Rancho Cucamonga welcomes and embraces the diversity of form and scale of
                              development. A gradual transition between these various patterns and development
                              styles is desired and needs to be an important consideration in proposed building
                              scale and form. Within this established pattern, distinguishable places have evolved
Rancho Cucamonga exhibits     that this General Plan refers to as “districts,” “neighborhoods,” “urban centers,” and
   a wide variety of building “corridors.” Each of these has different roles and design elements that need to be

Districts and Neighborhoods
The City has subareas that contain special qualities or unique features that
distinguish them. These subareas exist at various scales in size, function, and
identity, but may be generally categorized as districts or neighborhoods. Districts
tend to be larger areas that may contain a historic or functional similarity.
Neighborhoods are smaller areas with a more local focus and identity.
Distinguishable districts and neighborhoods can be defined in Rancho Cucamonga
using one or more of the following criteria:
        The area is an historic community that eventually became surrounded by
         newer development.
        The area has been master-planned and designed to look and function as a
         distinguishable place.
        The area stands apart due to the clustering of similar land uses.
The historic communities, or districts, of Alta Loma, Cucamonga, and Etiwanda each
has its own style of development and types of uses. Within the newer sections of
town, the planned communities of Terra Vista and Caryn, for example, have master-
planned neighborhoods with ample landscaping.
Neighborhood Organization and Design
Most established neighborhoods in Rancho Cucamonga have developed around five
basic principles:
        Neighborhood commercial centers are located conveniently to serve
         residential neighborhoods.
        Housing at higher densities is appropriate near shopping centers and along
         transit corridors.
        Schools and neighborhood parks are centrally located within neighborhoods.
        Bicycle and pedestrian paths connect housing with schools and shopping
         centers.
        Neighborhood identity is achieved through architectural, landscape, and
         entry design.

     Pedestrian paths and
     open greens create a
        quality residential
           neighborhood.
                            These principles have been implemented through various means: specific plans,
                            planned community projects, and incrementally through individual subdivision and
                            commercial developments. Approved specific plans and planned communities are
                            discussed in the Land Use section of this Chapter. Both architectural and landscape
                            design for housing, commercial, and public uses are typically integrated within each
                            specific plan and planned community. Based on Planning Commission actions and
                            policy direction, comprehensive design guidelines for residential development have
                            been prepared by the Planning Department for use by developers, property owners,
                            architects, landscape architects, and others involved in any aspect of housing
                            development. These guidelines cover the following subjects:
                                    Desirable site planning techniques for multi-unit and single-unit housing that
                                     create active street fronts
                                    Proper layout of a subdivision that slows automobile through-traffic, but
                                     allows for pedestrian connections and adequate public safety response
                                    Architectural guidance for creating a varied and attractive streetscape, with
                                     well-thought out design solutions
                                    Grading techniques and standards
                                    Appropriate use of drought-tolerant landscaping to create a pleasant
                                     environment and tie new development into the surrounding context and fire
                                     resistant landscaping
                                    Preferred fencing materials
                                    Trail design for pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian use
                            In general, neighborhood commercial centers should be designed as pedestrian-
                            oriented commercial areas that connect with adjacent residential areas. Site planning
                            should incorporate outdoor gathering areas such as plazas and courtyards.
                            Streetscapes should encourage pedestrian and bicycle activity and include shade,
                            drinking fountains, benches, trash receptacles, and newspaper stands. The Planning
                            Department has prepared design guidelines for commercial development (both

neighborhood and community level) to inform developers, property owners,
architects, planners, landscape architects, and civil engineers. These guidelines
cover proper site planning techniques, architectural design considerations, landscape
design techniques, proper signage, and master planning requirements.
Urban Centers and Corridors
The General Plan’s focus on Mixed Use areas will result in the development of new
urban centers within Rancho Cucamonga, extending the range of choice in how the
community can live, work, and play. Creative site planning, design, and use
configuration will be applied to create urban places that emphasize convenient non-
vehicular modes of transportation, “park once” parking facilities, interconnection of
uses, usable public spaces, strong architectural design, and variety in scale and
open space to provide diversity. The City helps promote healthy lifestyles through
design features of urban places. The General Plan requires that urban centers be
designed so that people can interact and enjoy outdoor amenities such as gardens,
courtyards with fountains, quiet shaded areas for working or reading, and interesting
paths to walk to nearby stores and businesses―all activities that provide both
emotional and physical stimulation (see Figure LU-6: Community Design
Framework). Victoria Gardens will continue to be an important contributor to the
diverse offering of lifestyles. New development or redevelopment adjacent to these
established urban centers should relate to these areas both physically and
functionally.
                                                                                       Urban centers are

                                                                                       that include public spaces.
Travel Corridors and Streetscapes
Travel corridors in Rancho Cucamonga include roadways, bicycle and pedestrian
paths, equestrian trails, and railways. Travel routes are not just modes of access but
an important way of experiencing the City. Roadways in particular are a means of
organizing land uses, welcoming and directing visitors, and establishing a consistent
and aesthetically pleasing image through landscape and streetscape design. See the
Community Mobility Chapter regarding complete streets and the City’s plan to design
and operate an entire roadway network with all users in mind, including bicyclists,
public transportation vehicles and riders, and pedestrians of all ages and abilities.

                             interchanges at both the I-15 and SR-210 freeways. The proximity of the freeways
                             also creates important freeway views to commercial, office, and industrial uses within
                             Rancho Cucamonga.
                             The City’s adopted street classifications contain a hierarchy of roadways designed to
                             accommodate the traffic volumes and turning movements of anticipated traffic. Street
                             types vary in street width, the number/size of travel and turning lanes, median size
                             and design, and parkway size and design, as shown on Figure CM-3: Typical
                             Roadway Cross Sections in the Community Mobility Chapter. Future roadways will
                             provide the final links within the transportation system and will be designed based on
                             their functional role from both a traffic and land use standpoint.
                             Special Boulevards
                             Street classifications are further defined in Rancho Cucamonga by different patterns
                             of landscape design, layout of bike and pedestrian paths, setback of adjacent
                             structures, street furnishings, lighting, and hardscape treatments. Variations in design
                             may occur along a particular roadway, but the overall intent is to establish certain
                             character and consistency in the appearance of the roadway to reinforce users’
                             mental image or perception of the route. Major intersections have also received
                             special design treatment to distinguish between different districts or neighborhoods,
                             identify major developments or urban centers, or to direct/orient travelers to key
                             destination points.

The roadways in Table LU-22 are designated “Special Boulevards” and are to
incorporate extensive landscape setback areas, and denote where landscape and
hardscape design, trails, and setback standards will be master planned and
implemented. All major arterials (divided and undivided) are identified as Special
Boulevards, as well as several important secondary and collector segments. The
landscape prominence of these roadways has been and will continue to be a focus in
the design process for both the private and public sectors. These linkages are
described in Table LU-22 in terms of location, improvement classification, and
applicable implementation mechanism.

Beautification Master Plans
During the late 1980s and into the early ‘90s, Rancho Cucamonga prepared
Beautification Master Plans for many of the Special Boulevards. These plans sought
to provide consistent direction to development and establish attractive design themes
that would reinforce the City’s high design standards.
In general, the Beautification Master Plans go beyond the typical parkway street tree
concept and integrate street enhancement plans into a broader landscape fabric
within the entire parkway setback area. Most of the concepts incorporate background
or accent trees, rockscape, and even perimeter walls. Design objectives of the
Beautification Master Plans are to:
         Provide identifiable themes along major streets
         Provide attractive, enduring, and maintainable streetscapes
         Complement other community improvements
         Protect the public’s health, safety, and welfare
These plans are being successfully implemented throughout the City. Table LU-23
lists the Beautification Master Plans and the design focus of each concept.

       Historic/Special Design Streets
       Certain roadway sections are worthy of special treatment due to their historic
       character: Etiwanda Avenue, Hillside Road, Hellman Avenue, and Foothill Boulevard.
       Provisions for maintaining and/or replacing the trees should be developed to address
       fire and public safety issues as they occur.
                Etiwanda Avenue. Etiwanda Avenue, from Wilson Avenue to Foothill
                 Boulevard, was established in 1883 as the main north/south spine through
                 the Etiwanda Colony Lands. The street retains the original rock curbs,
                 eucalyptus tree windrows, and rural character associated with low-density
                 development. Future roadway designs have been adopted as part of the
                 Etiwanda Specific Plan. The basic design intent is to maintain the current
                 street widths, rock curbs, and existing street trees where possible, and
                 enhance the rural character with additional informal plantings, trails, and
                 extensive setbacks. As future development is proposed, the City needs to
                 carefully define those areas where change to the historic streetscape is
                 required because of traffic demand and public safety. Implementation
                 strategies to discourage the use of Etiwanda Avenue for through traffic
                 should be developed and considered in all future projects along this route.
                Hillside Road. The segment of Hillside Road between Alta Loma Channel
                 and Hermosa Avenue has been designated for special historic significance,
                 and plans have been developed consistent with its historic character.
                Hellman Avenue. The segment of Hellman Avenue between Base Line
                 Road and 19th Street has been designated for special historic significance
                 and should be studied to establish street requirements consistent with its
                 historic character.
                Foothill Boulevard/Historic Route 66. Foothill Boulevard is a unique
                 historic route for the City of Rancho Cucamonga, Southern California, and
                 the western United States. Officially, the numerical designation 66 was
                 assigned to the Chicago-to-Los Angeles route in the summer of 1926. From
                 the outset, public road planners intended Route 66 to connect the main
                 streets of rural and urban communities along its course for the most practical
                 of reasons: most small towns had no prior access to a major national

          thoroughfare. Route 66 runs east to west through Rancho Cucamonga and
          contains historic resources potentially significant for their association with
          Route 66.
Foothill Boulevard/Historic Route 66 Visual Improvement Plan
Supplemental to the Special Boulevards designation, the Foothill Boulevard/Historic
Route 66 Visual Improvement Plan (adopted January 2002) guides the design
concepts for the streetscapes, entry areas, and rights-of-way of Foothill
Boulevard/Historic Route 66 through the entirety of its run through Rancho
Cucamonga. The plan acknowledges the importance of Foothill Boulevard/Historic
Route 66 to America’s culture and heritage, and works to enhance and reflect the
unique historic elements of Historic Route 66 and Rancho Cucamonga.
The plan draws upon positive improvements to Foothill Boulevard/Historic Route 66
and develops a set of unique and unifying historic themes that will be implemented
along the Boulevard. The plan provides specific design concepts for the western and
eastern gateways into the City, and for eight centers along the Foothill Boulevard
corridor. The plan also provides concepts for the Suburban Parkway Enhancement
Areas at various locations, a unifying palette of streetscape furniture, unique Route
66 icons, artwork, and various other visual enhancement concepts that can be
utilized in future developments and improvements along the Boulevard.                    Foothill Boulevard/Historic

Improving the visual streetscape in Rancho Cucamonga can be accomplished by              reflect the culture and

districts and residential neighborhoods have had most utility lines installed
underground during their initial development. However, many older neighborhoods
still have overhead utility lines. Placing overhead utilities underground remains an
important aspect of enhancing the aesthetic quality in neighborhoods and major
street corridors.
A major impediment to undergrounding utility lines is cost. Rancho Cucamonga will
consider undergrounding utilities along commercial corridors where it can enhance
the streetscape and improve the overall image of the street. Residential
neighborhoods interested in removing overhead utilities must work with the City and
possibly set up an assessment district or other financing system to help pay for the
costs of such improvement.
Entry Monuments
Entry monuments provide the first impression of Rancho Cucamonga as visitors
enter the City. Special attention has been given to the development and design of
these gateways. A plan for entry monuments was developed, and a number of
intersections have entry monuments installed. The number and location of entry
monuments are shown in Figure LU-7: Entry Monument Locations. The letters
identifying each gateway correspond to a description of the gateway, provided in
Table LU-24: Entry Monuments Design Elements. Each site will have to be designed
to complement the surrounding streetscape and architecture, while following the
design.

                              Pedestrian Connectivity
                              Walking to local destinations is a wonderful way to get exercise, reduce short vehicle
                              trips, and contribute to reduced pollutant emissions. The built environment and
                              community design can influence walking behavior. Rancho Cucamonga residents
                              look for opportunities to walk and bicycle, both to recreate and socialize. The General
                              Plan policies respond by encouraging changes in the built environment that will
                              increase walking. This includes building more sidewalks and trails, making the
                              streetscape more pedestrian friendly, creating better connectivity between
                              destinations, and increasing pedestrian safety.
                              The City’s aim is to design streets for people to use them and assume people will
                              walk. Creating a pedestrian environment involves more than laying down a sidewalk
                              or installing a signal. A truly viable pedestrian system involves paying attention to the
                              smallest details, including how a commercial center provides connections to
                              residential neighborhoods and what paving materials are used for walkways.
                              Facilities should be accessible to all pedestrians, especially those with disabilities
                              and children.

The walking environment should be open and inviting, not sterile and vacant.
Pedestrians need more than sidewalks adjacent to parking and crosswalks across six
lanes of traffic. In addition to protecting pedestrians from motor vehicle traffic, it is
important to have a secure, pleasant, and interesting walking environment to
encourage people to walk. The following strategies improve the built environment for
walking:
        Move buildings toward the street and make them accessible from
         sidewalks. Avoid large blank walls and expansive parking areas. Create an
         interesting environment for pedestrians along the streets.
        Create linkages such as walkways, corridors, and shared-use paths that
         connect pedestrian facilities. Linkages increase pedestrian convenience by
         providing short cuts to destinations. Linkages often provide travel routes
         that are more appealing than walking next to traffic.
        Promote the uniform design and distribution of street furniture, information
         kiosks, receptacles, trees and planting boxes, and public and private
         signage. Work with developers to provide pedestrian amenities such as
         street lighting, benches, and streetscape improvements for new
         developments.
        Require all new developments to provide safe and convenient pedestrian
         environments and access through building orientation, site layout, traffic
         management, and connections to transit service and local commercial and
         community facilities.
        Continue to require development to provide and maintain benches and
         shelters at key transit locations.
        Along major transit routes, continue to provide amenities such as
         continuous sidewalks, canopies, arcades, shade trees, and seating areas to
         improve the pedestrian environment along major commercial streets.
        Continue to design and engineer safe and accessible roadways and
         pedestrian facilities. Provide adequate lighting along major pedestrian
         routes and trails to encourage walking in the evenings.
                                                                                          Sidewalks, benches, trees,

       Accessibility
       Accessibility for all people, including those with special needs, has always been an
       important commitment for Rancho Cucamonga. The Federal Americans with
       Disabilities Act (ADA) was enacted in 1990 to ensure that people with disabilities
       have equal opportunities and access to public spaces as those who do not have
       disabilities. People with disabilities may have diminished mobility, limited vision, or
       reduced cognitive skills. In some instances, individuals may experience a
       combination of disabilities, which is more common as a person grows older. A person
       may experience a disability on a permanent or temporary basis. Without accessible
       pedestrian facilities, people with disabilities will have fewer opportunities to engage in
       employment, school, shopping, recreation, and other everyday activities. New or
       altered facilities must provide access for all pedestrians.
       Street designs that accommodate people with disabilities create a better walking
       environment for all pedestrians. Adequate time to cross streets, well-designed curb
       ramps, limited driveways, and sidewalks that are wide and clear of obstructions and
       have minimal cross-slope are examples of design features that accommodate
       pedestrians with disabilities, persons using strollers, and indeed, all pedestrians.
       Sustainable Landscaping
       Sustainable landscaping for the local climate requires minimal resource inputs, such
       as water, pesticides, and labor for maintenance. Sustainable landscaping begins with
       an appropriate design that includes functional, cost-efficient, visually pleasing,
       environmentally friendly and maintainable areas. Rancho Cucamonga’s general
       criteria for landscaping design include the following:
                Landscaping to enhance streetscapes and prominent entryways
                Water-efficient landscaping principles
                Improving water quality through landscaping
                Landscape maintenance and protection
                Historical landscaping and trees

Water Efficiency Principles
Water imported from distant sources is costly and in diminishing supply. As the
Cucamonga Valley Water District (CVWD) focuses on obtaining more water from
local groundwater sources, water conservation in Rancho Cucamonga becomes a
higher priority. Rancho Cucamonga’s attractive landscaped environment must be
balanced with the ever-present need to conserve water. The City Council has
adopted a Water Efficiency Ordinance that requires reduced consumption of water in
landscapes through the following principles:
         Planning and Design. Appropriate planning and design of landscaping can
          lead to more sustainable landscaping over the long run. It can conserve
          water, create beautiful and visual scenery, and create a more sustainable
          landscape that is good for the environment.
         Drought-Tolerant Plant Materials. Using plants that can survive periods of
          time with little or no water assists in the efforts to conserve water. Lawns
          can be removed or reduced in size and replaced with drought-tolerant
          plants, which can save a significant amount of water over the year,
          particularly during the dry and hot summer months. Artificial turf has come a
          long way in design and durability, and should also be considered as an
          alternative.
         Efficient Irrigation Systems. Irrigation systems can be designed to water
          different groupings of plant types based on water needs. Drip irrigation can
          be used where plants need little water. Smart irrigation systems, which
          employ weather sensors, can efficiently irrigate plants based on weather
          conditions. Systems can automatically shut off irrigation when it rains.
         Use of Mulch. Using mulch can insulate soils and retain moisture, which
          helps conserve water. Mulch also suppresses weeds, minimizing landscape
          maintenance and labor.

                         Improving Water Quality
                         Landscaping can be used to improve water quality, particularly during rain storms
                         when polluted urban runoff enters creeks and channels. Stormwater is polluted by oil
                         and grease from roads, pesticides from lawns and agriculture, sediment from
                         construction sites, and carelessly discarded trash. Landscaped parkways and
                         medians, such as those found on Haven Avenue or Milliken Avenue, can be
                         retrofitted with vegetated bioswales that include native and drought-tolerant plants.
                         Bioswales are landscape elements designed to retain runoff and remove silt and
                         pollution from it. Pollutants can be filtered out as water sits in the vegetated swales or
                         is filtered by underground systems. Draining water into bioswales can also help
                         recharge groundwater basins.
                         Parking lot planters can also be developed with bioswales, where water can flow from
                         asphalt surfaces and into these swales. Bioswales are a natural way to clean water
                         and help keep a healthy earth. There are various other methods and programs
                         available to help improve water quality. See Chapter 6: Resource Conservation for
                         more information regarding water quality improvement initiatives.
                         Landscape Maintenance and Protection
                         Rancho Cucamonga undertakes design strategies to reduce operation and
                         maintenance costs within the City’s Landscape Maintenance Districts and other
                         publicly funded areas. Some of the design strategies are applied to both new
                         development and existing landscapes, and include educating, informing, and
                         involving the public. Many medians on major streets do not use turf, which requires
                         continual maintenance and plenty of water to maintain a green and manicured
                         appearance. Use of creek rocks and drought-tolerant, low-maintenance plants
                         minimizes maintenance labor.
                                                                                      Landscape design can be

                         open space or areas of natural vegetation and generally would occur surrounding the
                         perimeter of a subdivision or isolated development of a single-unit dwelling.
                         In high fire-hazard areas, landscape plans for private and public development must
                         be reviewed and approved by the Fire District to ensure proper use of fire-resistant
                         plants and adequate vegetation management zones. For further discussion and
                         information regarding Public Safety and fire hazard areas, please see Chapter 8:

Historic Landscaping and Trees
Historic landscaping and trees provide reminders of Rancho Cucamonga’s agrarian
past and highlight the importance of mature landscaping as a design component.
Trees contribute to the scale and character of the environment and provide many
essential functions. Trees provide cooling shade, reduce heat, provide protection
from high winds, contribute to clean air, create sound barriers, support wildlife, and
increase property values. Street and shade tree canopies can lower temperatures
along sidewalks and encourage walking even during the hottest times of the year.
Large canopy trees can shade expansive parking areas, cooling hot asphalt.
Within Rancho Cucamonga, certain types of vegetation also provide a historic link to
the City’s agricultural past. Stands of eucalyptus tree windrows in Alta Loma and
Etiwanda were planted in the late 1800s to protect crops from severe winds.
Remaining vineyards and citrus trees enhance the historic rural atmosphere of the
City, and are scenic and historical assets. New vineyards are being included in the
landscape design of new developments, providing aesthetic and functional features;
the grapes can be used for commercial wine-making. Preservation of historic
agricultural landscapes is discussed in detail in the Historic Resources section of this
Chapter and in Chapter 6: Resource Conservation.

Rancho Cucamonga has adopted a Tree Preservation Ordinance (Chapter 19.08 of
the Municipal Code) that deals specifically with trees, including heritage trees. The
purpose and intent of the ordinance includes:
        The eucalyptus, palm, oak, sycamore, pine, and other trees growing within
         the City are a natural aesthetic resource, which help define community
         character. Such trees are worthy of protection to preserve scenic beauty,
         prevent soil erosion, provide shade, wind protection, screening, and
         counteract air pollution. It is pertinent to the public peace, harmony, and
         welfare that such trees be protected from indiscriminate cutting or removal,
         especially where such trees are associated with a proposal for development.
        The ordinance establishes regulations for the preservation of heritage trees
         on private property to retain as many trees as possible, consistent with the
         purpose of this Chapter and the reasonable economic enjoyment of such
         property.
        In particular, the eucalyptus windrows are a unique inheritance whose
         cumulative value as a windbreak system is a resource. The City aims to
         perpetuate a windbreak system through protection of selected blue gum

                          View Corridors
                          Rancho Cucamonga is rich in scenic resources. The orientation of the roadway
                          network and elevation changes provide spectacular views of the foothills, the San
                          Gabriel Mountains, and the San Bernardino National Forest. From the foothill area,
                          long, open vistas to the south provide outstanding views of the City and beyond.
                          These north-south views are particularly prominent along the straight alignments of
                          Archibald, Haven, and Etiwanda Avenues. Additional scenic resources include the
                          remaining stands of eucalyptus windrows, vineyards, and natural vegetation
                          associated with flood control lands and utility corridors. Views of these resources are
                          most prominent from the roadways and in certain locations from places of work and
                          residences.
                          Long-range vistas can be preserved and framed within a development project, as
                          well as along roadways. However, mountain backdrops cannot be viewed or
                          appreciated if screened by buildings or scarred by poor hillside development. View
                          corridors within Rancho Cucamonga can be carelessly diminished or destroyed by
                          the indiscriminate placement of communication towers, advertising signs, buildings,
                          tall trees, or other human-built features. The design policies for maintaining view
                          corridors are meant to be combined with policies on landscaping and Special
                          Boulevards to create scenic corridors and attractive travel ways that will orient
                          travelers and enhance foreground and distant views.

                          Public Art
                          Public art refers to works of art in any media located in a public setting, with the
                          purpose of beautifying public spaces and buildings, drawing attention to the message
                          the artwork may communicate, and educating the public. Public art can increase the
                          intrinsic and monetary values of the places it graces; it can express a civic and
                          corporate pride. A city with public art is a city that thinks, feels, and grows.
                          An existing art installation in Rancho Cucamonga is the piece located at the
                          northeast corner of Haven Avenue and Foothill Boulevard, at the entry plaza of the
                          Terra Vista Town Center Shopping Center. Public art takes many forms, including

statues, sculptures, lighting effects, street furniture, paving, railings, signs, fountains,

Many cities allot funding to public art. Some employ public art programs, where a
certain percentage of building costs (often one percent) has to be used to create
public art.

Foothill Boulevard/Route 66 Mural Program
The Foothill Boulevard/Route 66 Mural Program, led by the Redevelopment Agency,
has been designed to enhance economic opportunities for businesses along Foothill
Boulevard, and to encourage additional investment in properties along the City's
primary retail/commercial thoroughfare. The mural program will help create an
aesthetically pleasing environment for residents and visitors, and may also provide
economic benefits for merchants through increased interest and activity along Foothill
Boulevard.
In addition to the economic benefits, the program will create cultural, educational, and
artistic value, providing residents and visitors the opportunity to connect with the rich
history of the Rancho Cucamonga community through a series of colorful visual
displays.
Signs
The City recognizes the need for signs as a means for business advertising and
identification. One characteristic that distinguishes Rancho Cucamonga from other
communities in the area is its sensitivity to sign design and insistence on attractive
signage. The City aims to maintain a visually attractive community through high-
quality site planning, building designs, landscaping, and signs. Well-designed signs
are not only pleasing in appearance, but can enhance the economic value and
accessibility of a project. The Sign Ordinance contains a reasonable system of
controls and provides incentives and flexibility for variety and good design. The
objectives of the Sign Ordinance are to:

                        Larger-scale multi-tenant projects require a Uniform Sign Program to establish
                        standard designs and technical signage criteria. These criteria are applied uniformly
                        to create coordinated yet distinct signage for businesses within a single development.
                        Standards are developed through coordination of City staff and the property
                        owner/developer to ensure that a project retains a quality visual environment. The
                        adoption of Uniform Sign Programs allows places such as shopping centers, office
                        parks, and multi-tenant developments to communicate to tenants the expectations for
                        quality signage.

Community Design Issues
Key issues relative to land use are:
       Pattern and Scale of Development. The integration of various
        neighborhoods, districts, and urban centers into a coherent City structure and
        image will continue to be important as the City fills in. The design of
        connectors or retrofits of existing neighborhoods built independent of each
        other, new infill projects, or even brand new development will have to be
        considered to balance integration, yet preserve a neighborhood character
        within the City as a whole.
       High-Quality Design Standards. Design standards must uphold the high
        quality Rancho Cucamonga demands, but must be flexible enough and
        contain enough options so as not to prevent desirable development from
        locating in the City.

Community Design Goals and Policies
The following goals and policies are aimed at providing guidance and policy direction regarding community design
in Rancho Cucamonga.
  GOAL LU-9:          Foster a cohesive, healthy community through appropriate
                      patterns and scales of development, including complementary
                      transitions between districts, neighborhoods, and land uses.
                Policy LU-9.1:      Preserve and enhance the special qualities of existing
                                    districts and neighborhoods through focused attention on
                                    land use, community design, and economic development.
                     Discussion:    Rancho Cucamonga has distinguishable districts and
                                    neighborhoods that either evolved historically around agriculture,
                                    have been more recently master planned, or have been
                                    encouraged to develop as a concentration of uses such as the
                                    industrial area of the City. The City’s intent is to maintain the
                                    integrity of these districts or neighborhoods as they continue to
                                    age over time. Therefore, the City seeks compatible infill
                                    development or redevelopment where necessary, preservation of
                                    historic resources, implementation of a streetscape design that
                                    reinforces the established image or theme, and focused attention
                                    on the economic viability and sustainability of these districts and
                                    neighborhoods.
                Policy LU-9.2:      Integrate districts and neighborhoods into the overall City
                                    structure and image.
                     Discussion:    Programs that seek to enhance the identity of individual
                                    neighborhoods or districts must be balanced with the need to
                                    establish a coherent City structure and image. Methods to
                                    provide this integration include the use of clear linkage systems
                                    such as pedestrian and bicycle paths, open space corridors, and
                                    landscaping that is compatible in form and color. Adherence to
                                    the overall General Design Principles will also result in the quality
                                    design that is a hallmark of Rancho Cucamonga.
                Policy LU-9.3:      As the City revitalizes areas through redevelopment and
                                    infill development, provide a transition between the
                                    developed and natural (unbuilt) environment through
                                    landscaping techniques, open space linkages, preservation
                                    of landforms, sensitive site planning, architectural design,
                                    and public art.

  LU‐94                                          R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

                 Discussion: New development within Rancho Cucamonga’s foothill areas or
                             rural areas such as Etiwanda should utilize a variety of design
                             techniques to create a project that blends with the surrounding
                             environment, while maintaining a balance with fire-safe
                             landscape design. Techniques such as the preservation of
                             mature trees onsite, the use of native plant materials,
                             development of linear buffer parks or the incorporation of special
                             vegetation such as vineyards or groves within the project design
                             can create a more harmonious setting for new development. In
                             addition, sensitive grading techniques and the preservation of
                             landforms in hillside development can minimize the visual impact
                             of development in predominately open space areas. Project site
                             planning should consider visual impacts to surrounding open
                             space areas or distant views from roadways and should
                             incorporate features of the natural environment through the
                             design and landscaping of open space areas and corridors.
                             Landscape setbacks adjacent to permanent open space areas
                             should be sufficient in distance and landscape design to provide
                             fire protection, defensible space, and a transition between the
                             natural and built environment. The overall intent is to provide a
                             more harmonious transition between development and the
                             surrounding natural environment, as well as adhering to fire-safe
                             landscape principles.
            Policy LU-9.4:   Ensure that infill development is sensitive and compatible
                             with the design and scale of all adjacent historic properties.
                 Discussion: Every act of construction is an opportunity to repair, enhance, or
                             embellish a district. The best way is to create infill development
                             that is sensitive to and inspired by the existing conditions. This
                             includes materials, scale, and massing.
            Policy LU-9.5:   Establish Mixed Use areas as higher intensity “urban
                             centers” where there is sensitive integration of land uses,
                             convenient modes of transportation, and a focused “sense
                             of place” that emanates from the architectural and
                             landscape design.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga has a well-established pattern of suburban
                             and rural development. The City has the opportunity to enhance
                             this pattern with the development of more urbanized centers of
                             activity within suitable locations. This General Plan provides
                             detailed land use and design guidance for each of the Mixed Use
                             areas, which are envisioned as concentrations of activity at
                             carefully selected locations within the City.
            Policy LU-9.6:   Maintain the rural development pattern and character of the
                             Etiwanda area through the Etiwanda Specific Plan.
                 Discussion: Etiwanda is recognized as a special rural town established in
                             1883 by George and William Chaffey for agricultural production.
                             Rancho Cucamonga has adopted the Etiwanda Specific Plan to
                             further enhance and preserve the remaining rural characteristics
                             of the area through land use, density/intensity of development,
                             streetscape design, preservation of significant vegetation, and
                             detailed design guidelines. The Etiwanda Specific Plan is the
                             primary tool for implementing this policy and will be upheld
                             through the project design, review, and approval process.

GOAL LU-10: Encourage sustainable landscaping and streetscape design.
         Policy LU-10.1:  Continue to require implementation of the City’s Water
                          Efficiency Ordinance, which should be reviewed and
                          updated periodically.
              Discussion: The Water Efficiency Ordinance establishes a water conservation
                          plan to reduce water consumption in the landscape environment
                          using water-efficient landscaping principles.
         Policy LU-10.2:  Encourage the planting of edible landscapes, using citrus
                          trees, box gardens, vineyards, and other edible plant
                          materials whenever possible.
                          Edible landscaping is the process of planting edible plants in
                          spaces other than in a traditional garden. Edible landscapes save
                          space as they combine landscaping and food-growing into a
                          single space. It is a very sustainable method of landscaping that
                          refers back to Rancho Cucamonga’s beginnings as an agrarian
                          community. Converting power line utility corridors to this use can
                          promote and preserve the heritage of Rancho Cucamonga while
                          significantly reducing the fire hazards presented by these
                          uninterrupted rights of way. Utility corridors and the invasive
                          grasses that they support have a high potential for transporting
                          hillside wildfires into the residential and urban areas of the City.
         Policy LU-10.3:  Promote low water
                          defensible space.
                                                        usage,     and   emphasize     fire-safe
              Discussion: With water a limited resource and wild fires a constant threat, the
                          use of drought tolerant or fire resistant plant material can make a
                          big difference.
         Policy LU-10.4:  Encourage streetscape design and landscaping programs
                          for commercial frontages that create vibrant places which
                          support walking, bicycling, transit, and sustainable
                          economic development.
              Discussion: The design of streetscapes can create walkable environments
                          that support walking, bicycling, and transit as well as supporting
                          new and existing commercial development.
         Policy LU-10.5:  Consult with and coordinate with the Santa Fe Railway to
                          develop and install a landscape plan for the enhancement of
                          the railroad right-of-way.
              Discussion: Metrolink service along the Santa Fe Railway is an important
                          transportation resource within Rancho Cucamonga. Landscaping
                          along this travel route and around the Metrolink station should
                          convey an aesthetically pleasing image, while providing desired
                          screening or framing of particular views. The City will pursue the
                          planning and installation of a landscape design that will create a
                          pleasant travel experience for all passengers traveling to or
                          through the community.
         Policy LU-10.6:  Continue to pursue strategies to reduce long-term operation
                          and maintenance costs within the City’s Landscape
                          Maintenance Districts and other publicly funded areas.

                 Discussion: Reducing landscape maintenance along the City’s street medians
                             and corridors saves maintenance labor costs, water, and energy,
                             creating a more sustainable environment. Where possible, turf
                             areas and lawns should be removed from streetscapes and
                             replaced with low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plantings and
                             natural hardscape materials. Continue to implement “smart”
                             landscape watering systems in medians.
GOAL LU-11:      Ensure that community aesthetics are maintained through
                 appropriate regulations.
             Policy LU-11.1: Continue to implement and update as necessary the City’s
                             Sign Ordinance in order to provide for a reasonable system
                             of review and incentives for well-designed signs throughout
                             the City.
                 Discussion: The objectives of the existing Sign Ordinance include: efficiently
                             directing people to various locations; ensuring a high-quality
                             visual environment; requiring signs that are well designed and
                             placed, and are pleasing in appearance; minimizing overhead
                             clutter; enhancing economic value of properties; promoting signs
                             that are compatible with adjacent uses; reducing possible traffic
                             and safety hazards through good sign design; and protecting the
                             general health and welfare of the community.
            Policy LU-11.2:  Continue to require the undergrounding of utility lines and
                             facilities wherever feasible to minimize the unsightly
                             appearance of overhead utility lines and utility enclosures.
                 Discussion: Undergrounding utilities can remove visual clutter and can
                             eliminate wind-related power outages. Utility wire undergrounding
                             and relocation projects, however, are expensive and residential
                             neighborhoods must work with the City and utility providers
                             before committing to such a task.
            Policy LU-11.3:  Require communication towers to be located and designed
                             to blend with the surrounding environment.
                 Discussion: Communication towers can be designed to blend with the
                             surrounding environment to increase aesthetics and reduce
                             visual clutter. The towers can also be retrofitted to look like trees
                             or concealed in windmills and other similar features. They can
                             also be located on buildings or other tall features. These
                             installations are generally referred to as concealed cell sites or
                             stealth cell sites.
GOAL LU-12:      Foster a variety of travel routes that are enjoyable ways to
                 experience Rancho Cucamonga.
            Policy LU-12.1:  Ensure that streetscape design along roadways creates a
                             strong landscaped edge, provides a coherent high-quality
                             appearance along each route, and enhances the image of
                             adjacent development.

              Discussion: The Community Design section of the General Plan establishes
                          Special Boulevards within Rancho Cucamonga for which the
                          landscape/hardscape design, trails, and setback standards shall
                          be master planned and consistently applied throughout the length
                          of the Special Boulevard segment or route. The application of
                          special paving materials, plant materials, lighting, signing, and
                          siting of structures at key intersections shall also be incorporated
                          in Special Boulevard designs. Many of the streetscapes for
                          Special Boulevards have been conceptually designed and
                          adopted through specific plans and planned community projects,
                          followed by the preparation of more detailed Beautification
                          Master Plans. Streetscape design for all other roadways should
                          adhere to the basic principles of creating a strong landscape
                          edge and providing a high-quality, consistent appearance. The
                          City expects all streetscape designs to incorporate water
                          efficiency principles and design strategies for publicly landscaped
                          areas.
         Policy LU-12.2:  Require the design of transit stops to be compatible with
                          adjacent development and provide for adequate seating,
                          signage, shade, and refuse receptacles.
              Discussion: Most transit stops in Rancho Cucamonga are built as a condition
                          of approval for an adjacent project. The City expects transit stops
                          to be designed as an “extension” of a developer’s project and
                          seek individual design solutions that are compatible with adjacent
                          development in terms of shelter/shading design, seating, and
                          other user amenities. The City also expects convenient, well-
                          designated pedestrian paths linking the transit stop to adjacent
                          uses.
         Policy LU-12.3:  Support development projects that are designed to facilitate
                          convenient access for pedestrians, bicycles, transit, and
                          automobiles.
              Discussion: Development should include access for pedestrians, bicycles,
                          and transit, as well as automobiles. Focus should be placed on
                          creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment that encourages
                          both walking and bicycling.
         Policy LU-12.4:  Retrofit, where feasible, existing neighborhoods to allow for
                          convenient, multi-modal access to schools, parks, and
                          shopping centers.
              Discussion: Current design standards call for a high level of connectivity for
                          alternative modes of transportation (bicycles, walking, equestrian,
                          etc.) to destinations. Older developments were not held to these
                          same standards. Over time, the retrofit of these neighborhoods
                          and districts will add to the public realm and encourage alternate
                          ways of getting around.
GOAL LU-13:    Take full advantage of view lines and vista points with carefully
               designed development.

            Policy LU-13.1:  On north-south roadways, open space corridors, and other
                             locations where there are views of scenic resources, trees,
                             and structures, encourage framing and orientation of such
                             views at key locations, and endeavor to keep obstruction of
                             views to a minimum.
                 Discussion: Scenic resources include the San Gabriel mountains and
                             foothills, long vistas of the City from hillside areas, and other
                             views of special vegetation or permanent open space lands.
                             Project-level site planning, landscape design, placement of signs,
                             and other human-made features must consider the impacts upon
                             views from roadways and through a project site to the foothills,
                             valley vistas, or other scenic resources. The City’s desire is to
                             see the “framing” of views through new development, not
                             obstruction. This may be accomplished through the clustering of
                             trees or structures, selection of landscape materials, or the
                             building orientation and footprint.
GOAL LU-14:      Support public art as an important amenity of a beautiful City.
            Policy LU-14.1:  Pursue the placement of public art in prominent locations
                             particularly along major travel corridors.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga recognizes the value of including public art
                             within development sites and within public rights-of-way to
                             enhance the quality of a project and the image of the community.
                             The City will continue to require art as a condition of approval for
                             projects at key locations and will continue to seek funding to
                             provide public art within public rights-of-way, including the
                             Metrolink corridor.
           Policy LU-14.2:   Continue to promote the establishment of entry
                             monumentation as a means of identifying communities,
                             districts, and neighborhoods.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga developed plans for gateways to enhance
                             the impressions of the City at the points of entry. These plans
                             include both identification of monument locations and conceptual
                             designs for different types of gateways. A number of the
                             gateways have been constructed and successfully beautify the
                             entries into the City. Since that time, SR-210 and Day Creek
                             Boulevard have been added to the City’s street system. As part
                             of this General Plan Update, the City has augmented the number
                             of entry gateways to reflect entrances produced by the new
                             routes.
          Policy LU-14.3:    Incorporate a public art ordinance in the Development Code.
                 Discussion: Developing a public art ordinance program would help spur
                             additional public art pieces throughout the City with the intent of
                             promoting a rich, diverse, and stimulating cultural environment. In
                             preparing such an ordinance, the City must prepare proper
                             guidelines and regulations for setting up the program.

        Historic Resources
        As Rancho Cucamonga developed out of expansive swaths of vineyard and citrus
        groves into residential neighborhoods and industrial and commercial centers, some
        of the City’s long-standing historical buildings have been torn down. Other structures
        have been lost to disrepair, neglect, redevelopment, and fire. Recognizing that
        economic prosperity and growth can sometimes overrun the historic fabric of the
        community, historic preservation groups and the City have made efforts to protect the
        historical buildings and landmarks that remain. The General Plan reinforces this
        commitment to recognizing, protecting, and maintaining Rancho Cucamonga’s past.
        Rancho Cucamonga History
        The following narrative provides a glimpse into Rancho Cucamonga’s past.
        Understanding the past and how the City has transformed over the years leads to
        understanding of the importance of protecting and maintaining many of the City’s
        historic buildings.
        The Beginnings of Our Community
        Early History
        Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the City of Rancho Cucamonga has been a
        center of land development opportunity since Franciscan priests and Spanish
        soldiers entered and began their occupation of the area in the late eighteenth
        century. The name “Cucamonga,” a Shoshone word for “sandy place,” first appeared
        in a written record of the San Gabriel Mission dated 1811.
        Development of the three towns of Cucamonga, Alta Loma, and Etiwanda began in
        the late 1870s and 1880s as a direct result of acquisition and distribution of land and
        water and the availability of rail transit through the region. In the 1930s a fourth
        distinct neighborhood, Northtown, developed along the Santa Fe Railroad.
        Etiwanda
        The first European settlers came to the Etiwanda Colony, located in the eastern
        portion of Rancho Cucamonga, in the early 1860s. Having made his fortune in the
        California gold mines, Captain Joseph S. Garcia (1823-1902) of the Azores Islands
        (located off the coast of Lisbon, Portugal), purchased a large amount of land in the
        Cucamonga Valley and in 1881, sold off much of the land comprising Etiwanda—560
        acres—to brothers George and William Chaffey for $30,000. This purchase included
        Garcia’s house and the water rights to local water sources, including Day Canyon
        and a creek to the east. The Chaffeys made other land purchases in the Etiwanda
        area over time, eventually creating a tract of over 7,500 acres. They named the
        colony “Etiwanda” after an Indian chief who had been a friend of their uncle.

Cucamonga
In 1870, Jewish immigrant Isaias Hellman, a prominent Los Angeles businessman
and one of the original 23 founders of the Farmers and Merchants Bank in downtown
Los Angeles, along with several of his associates, came into ownership of the
Rancho Cucamonga at a cost of approximately $50,000. They immediately sold a
small amount of the land, turning a quick profit, and kept the remaining 8,000 acres.
Under a newly formed partnership, Cucamonga Company (later Cucamonga
Vineyard Company) and Hellman and his associates subdivided the residual
acreage, planted it with a variety of crops, and oversaw restoration of the local
vineyards, resulting in the Cucamonga Valley becoming the biggest winemaking area
in California. Some Cucamonga Company lands were sold, ultimately comprising
portions of Alta Loma and Etiwanda. A dramatic effort was undertaken, tunneling
horizontally into Cucamonga Canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains to the north with a
primary labor force of local Chinese immigrants, to access water from natural springs
in the mountains. Water was delivered to Cucamonga in 1887.
                                                                                      Cucamonga Winery, built
                                                                                      in 1835, is said to be
                                                                                      California’s oldest winery
                                                                                      (photo taken in 1939).

        Alta Loma
        In 1880, Pasadena-based horticultural land developer Adolph Petsch and a group of
        associates purchased 160 acres of land in northern Alta Loma, naming the land
        Hermosa. They also purchased the water rights to nearby Deer and Adler Canyons
        and formed the Hermosa Land and Water Company in 1881. In 1883, they
        purchased more land in present-day Alta Loma, establishing the “Iowa Tract” on 500
        acres. The Iowa Tract was joined with Hermosa in 1887, and the entire area was
        renamed Ioamosa. The Hermosa Land and Water Company was incorporated in the
        same year to handle the consolidated land holdings which amounted to over 700
        acres. Petsch and the Hermosa Land and Water Company were able to sell lands
        quickly because of their ability to supply each parcel with a dependable supply of
        water, using a method of irrigation similar to that which was being used in Etiwanda.
        The Alta Loma area produced high quantities of citrus fruits, including lemons,
        oranges, and grapefruit beginning in the 1880s, and continued to grow citrus on a
        large scale for the next 60 years. Ioamosa was renamed Alta Loma when colonists
        determined that a new town should be built along the incoming Pacific Electric
        Railway in 1913.
        Northtown
        The Northtown neighborhood, named for its position to the township of Guasti to the
        south, is a historically Latino community that began along the Santa Fe Railway in
        the 1930s when Mexican immigrants began moving to the region looking for work
        during the Great Depression, eagerly answering the demand for agricultural laborers
        to pick grapes, maintain vineyards, and harvest and pack citrus. Located south of the
        original town center development of Cucamonga, Northtown comprises
        approximately a square mile roughly bounded by the Santa Fe Railway to the south,
        Feron Boulevard to the north, Archibald Avenue to the west and Haven Avenue to
        the east. The community was, for a time, a distinctly defined land area surrounded by
        vineyards, orchards, and empty fields on all sides. In the early 1900s, several other
        Latino neighborhoods were located throughout the City, including a neighborhood on
        Monte Vista Street in Alta Loma and one on Base Line Road in Etiwanda, where I-15
        now passes through the City. Mexican immigrants also lived in Guasti, a self-
        contained wine company town located south of Northtown (currently in the
        neighboring City of Ontario). The 1930s-era worker housing in Northtown tended to
        be small in size, containing only one or two bedrooms, one outhouse, and sometimes
        a garage or additional outbuilding. Northtown was connected to Cucamonga by
        commercial development along Archibald Avenue.
        Railroads and Early Town Development (1887-1945)
        Construction of railroads through the Cucamonga Valley allowed for tremendous
        growth of the local agriculture industry, the success of land sales, and subsequent
        development of the towns of Cucamonga (including the Northtown neighborhood),
        Alta Loma, and Etiwanda. Similar to other Southern California boomtowns,
        construction of railroads through the region created a rapid increase in local
        development, enabling both people and goods to move in and out of Rancho
        Cucamonga at an unprecedented speed, which dramatically increased agricultural
        production and sales. From the early 1900s to the 1950s, the northern portion of the
        City’s landscape consisted of mostly citrus groves, while the southern portion was
        dominated by vineyards.
        The San Bernardino Line of the Pacific Electric Railway, with stations in Claremont,
        Upland, Alta Loma, Etiwanda, Fontana, and Rialto, was the Pacific Electric’s longest
        line. It was completed through Rancho Cucamonga via stations at Alta Loma and
        Etiwanda in July 1914, offering competition to the older Santa Fe Railway to the
        south. Initially the Pacific Electric Railway was mostly used to transport citrus,
        although it carried a variety of freight.

Winemaking (1858-1970)
Granted the 13,000-acre Rancho Cucamonga in 1839, Tiburcio Tapia planted a small
vineyard from vine clippings likely obtained from the neighboring San Gabriel
Mission, established by Franciscan priests in 1771, and also formed a small-scale
winery. Tapia’s original vineyard passed through the hands of several individuals
before being sold to John Rains in 1858, who added greatly to the original vineyard,
doubling it in size. As a result of this effort, Cucamonga became the most important
business point between San Bernardino and Los Angeles, and shortly thereafter, the
wines produced here became known far and wide. Following Rains’ death, the
vineyard was taken over by Pierre and Jean Louis Sansevain, who also improved the
vineyards, but the vineyards were later destroyed, falling victim to locust infestation.
                                                                                         View of the Cucamonga
                                                                                         Valley, home to numerous
                                                                                         acres of vineyards in 1942.
Despite the loss of Tapia’s original vineyard, the winemaking industry continued to
develop and flourish in the Cucamonga Valley, moving from modestly sized wine
making operations to larger-scale wine production facilities. Secondo Guasti’s Italian
Vineyard Company, established in 1883, was among the first production-oriented

        wine-making companies in the region, covering over 5,000 acres with wine-producing
        grapes by the early 1900s. By comparison, the entire Cucamonga Valley contained
        over 16,000 acres of wine grapes by 1919.
        In 1919, the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed,
        establishing nation-wide prohibition of the sale, manufacturing, or transportation of
        alcoholic beverages. It lasted approximately 15 years and had a pronounced effect
        on the local wine-making industry. While many wineries were forced to close down
        operations, others conceived of creative ways to keep their businesses open despite
        Prohibition. Some wineries continued to harvest grapes, using their facilities to
        produce a variety of products, including table grapes, grape juice, grape and wine
        jellies, and beef and liver additives. As taking wine with meals was an important
        custom for Italian immigrants, home winemaking was allowed at a maximum quantity
        of 200 gallons per year for family use. Despite hardships placed on grape growers
        during the Prohibition era, the amount of land used for vineyards continued to grow in
        the Cucamonga region, increasing from 16,000 acres in 1919 to 21,000 acres in
        1930.
        Prohibition was repealed in December of 1933, and many United States wineries
        restarted their operations. During this time, the wine-making industry largely shifted
        from small- to large-scale production. To compete with large-scale wineries, small-
        scale wineries joined with one another to form cooperatives such as the Cucamonga
        Pioneer Vineyard Association (formed 1934); members would pool their fruit and
        share revenue on a percentage basis determined by the quantity of fruit contributed
        by each grower. Improvements in the handling and transportation of wine grapes that
        came about upon the repeal of Prohibition also facilitated recovery and success of
        the winemaking industry in the Cucamonga Valley, which continued to flourish until
        the early 1950s.
        The postwar alteration of Cucamonga Valley’s rural landscape began in 1947 with
        construction of Henry J. Kaiser’s large steel mill in Fontana. Then, in 1951, the City of
        Ontario removed a vineyard purchased 11 years earlier for expansion of its airport;
        Ontario continued to acquire more vineyards as the airport grew. Meanwhile, tastes
        in wine were changing, and sweet wines traditionally produced in the Cucamonga
        Valley were losing market share to drier varietal wines produced in Northern
        California. Bad weather conditions in the early 1950s led to poor harvests. Suburban
        sprawl sent real estate prices and property taxes soaring, and increased air pollution
        adversely affected agriculture. In 1950, 20 wineries were operating in the Rancho
        Cucamonga area. By 1970, only five remained.
        Route 66 (1926-1970)
        Completed in the late 1930s, United States Highway 66 (Route 66) resulted from a
        nation-wide effort to create a highway linking small towns and larger cities from
        Chicago to Los Angeles. In Rancho Cucamonga, Route 66 is Foothill Boulevard
        running east-west through the City. Several historic resources potentially significant
        for their association with Route 66 remain. Aided by the financial backing and large-
        scale organization of the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 and the Federal Highway Act
        of 1921, Route 66 (also referred to as The Mother Road) was commissioned in 1926.
        Nationwide prosperity following World War II afforded many people the opportunity to
        travel for leisure. Automobile excursions west on Route 66 quickly evolved into a
        cultural phenomenon, attracting a multitude of tourists anxious to see the West and
        visit the interesting roadside businesses that had sprung up alongside Route 66.
        These roadside attractions appealed to the tourist market with an array of food and
        refreshment options, trading posts, references to Native American culture, and more
        obscure sources of entertainment, such as snake pits, petting zoos, and exotic
        carnival games. The popularity of Route 66 indirectly led to its demise and ultimately

to its decommissioning in 1985. Experiencing heavy traffic by tourists and by the
trucking industry, Route 66 became crowded and fell into disrepair. In addition,
beginning in the 1950s, modern highways and interstate systems were built
throughout the nation, often bypassing small towns that had grown dependent on
Route 66 travelers for business. Despite the dramatic decline in traffic, some Route

Postwar Development (1945-1977)
Following World War II in 1945, Rancho Cucamonga’s landscape began to shift from
a rural to suburban environment, reflecting the nation-wide trend toward
decentralization of the city. Driven by rapid highway construction, increasing
automobile ownership, availability of modern building technologies, and the Baby
Boom, the postwar period brought about an increase in housing demand and rising
land values, spawning development of tract housing and light industry in Rancho
Cucamonga. The area that is now Rancho Cucamonga (not yet incorporated and
under the jurisdiction of San Bernardino County) became a sprawling suburb during
this time, with neighborhood-scale shopping centers and office parks and proliferating
surface parking. As lands once occupied by agricultural uses were needed to
accommodate this new pattern of development, the citrus groves and vineyards that
had once characterized the local landscape eventually gave way almost entirely to
suburbanization.
Consolidation and Incorporation (1977)
Encouraged by the initial boom in land values and development, Rancho Cucamonga
activists began discussing the possibility of incorporating the three towns of
Cucamonga, Alta Loma, and Etiwanda as early as 1887. Despite attempts at
consolidation over the years, it was not until many decades later that this dream was
realized. The City of Rancho Cucamonga was finally incorporated in 1977,
consolidating Cucamonga, Alta Loma, and Etiwanda into one municipality, reaching a
milestone sought after by local residents for nearly 100 years. Incorporation halted
the uncontrolled growth that had been occurring in the area and provided numerous
other benefits, including increased recreational opportunities and park development,
improvements to existing neighborhoods, construction of new neighborhoods, and
advances in local economic development. The three historic towns became part of
the larger whole, providing opportunities for growth and improvement but also
absorbing the character of each town center. As a result, the City now has the

        recognize the historic communities from which it came.
        Preservation Framework
        The following programs are incentives that have been used to preserve and
        recognize local historic resources.
        Federal and State Programs
        National Historic Preservation Act
        To be eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, the quality or
        significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, or cultural
        achievement must be present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that
        possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and
        association and possess one of the following:
                 The project is associated with events that have made a significant
                  contribution to the broad patterns of American history.
                 The project is associated with the lives of persons significant in the past.
                 The project embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or
                  method of construction, or represents the work of a master, or possesses
                  high artistic values, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity
                  whose components may lack individual distinction.
                 The project has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
                  prehistory or history.
        The Casa de Rancho Cucamonga (Rains House Museum) at 8810 Hemlock is the
        only building in Rancho Cucamonga on the National Register of Historic Places, as of
        2009.
        California Register of Historical Resources
        The California Register of Historical Resources program is designed to allow State
        and local agencies, private groups, and citizens to identify, evaluate, register, and
        protect historical resources. It is also an authoritative guide to the State's significant
        historical and archeological resources. The California Register of Historical
        Resources includes buildings, structures, objects, sites, and districts significant in the
        architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social,
        political, military, or cultural annals of California.
        As of 2009, five properties were listed in the California Register, including:
                 Padre/Biane Winery, 9951 8th Street (1909)
                 Ernst Mueller House, 6563 East Avenue (date unknown)
                 James G. Isle House, 6490 Etiwanda Avenue (date unknown; moved to 7086
                  Etiwanda Avenue)
                 Herbert Goerlitz House, 6558 Hermosa / 9893 Highland Avenue (1926;
                  moved to 6558 Hermosa Avenue)
                 John Rains House, 7869 Vineyard Ave (1859; currently at 8810 Hemlock

           SBR-075)
Mills Act
In 1972, California State senator James Mills introduced a bill known as the Mills Act
to grant property tax relief to owners of qualified historic properties. The Mills Act is a
preservation tool created by the California legislature to encourage the preservation
and restoration of historic properties. The Act enables cities to enter into historical
property agreements with owners of qualifying properties; these agreements will
result in reductions to the owner’s property taxes. The agreements provide a benefit
to cities in that they ensure preservation and guarantee authentic rehabilitations and
a high level of maintenance of cultural resources important to communities.
Local Programs
In 1978, the City adopted the Historic Preservation Commission Ordinance to
“designate, preserve, protect, enhance, and perpetuate those historic structures and
sites which contribute to the cultural and aesthetic benefit of Rancho Cucamonga.”
The Ordinance established a Historic Preservation Commission to review
applications for Landmark designation, review plans for physical alterations or
change of use to Landmarks, and maintain the register of Landmarks.
Pursuant to the Ordinance, a Landmark Designation Program was established. An
important element of the program is the identification of benefits and incentives to
encourage participation. The City has designated many Landmarks and Points of
Interest within Rancho Cucamonga and the Sphere of Influence. Each is
photographed and described in the Historic Landmarks and Points of Interest
booklet, prepared by the Community Development Department (see Figure LU-8:
Historic Resources).

        Historic Districts and Neighborhood Character Areas
        In an effort to recognize historic communities in Rancho Cucamonga and groupings
        of historic resources and places of interest, the General Plan recommends evaluating
        the potential creation of historic districts and/or neighborhood character areas.
        A historic district is a definable unified geographic entity that possesses a significant
        concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united
        historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development. It can be distinguished
        from surrounding properties and presents the same constraints and opportunities as
        individually listed properties. Historic districts can be designated at the national,
        State, and local level. Each level of designation has its own specific criteria, although
        the California Register and most local inventories base their designation criteria on
        those contained in the National Register. In addition, each level of designation entails
        a different level of protection, triggers different levels of review, and makes the
        property potentially eligible for various preservation incentives.
        A neighborhood character area, also commonly referred to as a conservation district,
        is a tool used to define a group of significant historic resources that do not retain
        adequate integrity to qualify as a historic district but still maintain important levels of
        cultural, historic, or architectural significance. The focus of a neighborhood character
        area is on maintaining basic community character of an area, but not necessarily
        specific historic details of buildings or landscapes. Neighborhood character areas are
        designated as a zoning overlay geographically over a neighborhood and may be
        coupled with other regulations. Conceptually, a neighborhood character area creates
        “buffer zones” to transition from historic districts to surrounding development.

         register of historic resources. By updating the Historic Preservation
         Ordinance to be consistent with State and Federal preservation standards
         and maintain a local register of historic resources, greater protection and
         community awareness of historic resources will be achieved. Existing
         historic resource survey efforts, local inventory of historic resources, and
         local registry of historic resources needs to be clearly identified,
         distinguished from one another, and updated over time.
        Lack of Preservation Incentives. The variety of available preservation
         incentives should be consolidated into one program to increase awareness
         and streamline use of available incentives. The City currently utilizes the
         Mills Act and should expand it to create an incentive program that includes
         a variety of available incentives for properties listed in the local register.
        Loss of Cultural Landscapes. Agriculture was the leading industry
         responsible for development of Rancho Cucamonga beginning in the late
         1880s, made possible by the acquisition and distribution of water to
         Cucamonga, Alta Loma, and Etiwanda, and the availability of rail transit
         through the three communities. As such, important cultural landscape
         features in Rancho Cucamonga include but are not limited to vineyards,
         citrus groves, windbreaks, resources related to water acquisition and
         distribution, railway rights-of-way, and uniquely designed curbs and gutters.
        Loss of Historic Town Center Identity. Rancho Cucamonga existed as
         three distinct towns until the City incorporated in 1977. However, the unique
         identities of the historic towns of Cucamonga, Alta Loma, and Etiwanda
         have become difficult to discern, and are increasingly threatened as historic
         buildings are altered or demolished and cultural landscapes vanish,
         diminishing a historic sense of place within each community. The City
         should identify and retain character in these historic centers to the
         maximum extent feasible. In accordance with General Plan policy that
         approves the creation of specific plans for identified areas in the City,
         specific plans have been prepared for Etiwanda (adopted 1983), Etiwanda
         North (adopted 1992), and Foothill Boulevard (adopted 2002). The creation
         of specific plans for Alta Loma and Cucamonga should become priorities.
        Preservation of Post-World War II Historic Resources. The City of
         Rancho Cucamonga is home to post-World War II buildings and tract
         housing developments that have recently become old enough and/or
         developed sufficient significance to be considered historic resources. As the
         age threshold for determining whether or not a property is “historic” is
         typically 45 to 50 years, early tract housing is beginning to present itself as
         a potential historic resource. Buildings may be individually eligible for the
         local register or may qualify for eligibility only as an intact grouping (tract).
         This topic warrants further research in Rancho Cucamonga, as the City is
         home to some of the earliest tract housing development in the Inland
         Empire.

           Interpretation of Historic Resources. Interpretation of historic resources
            refers to the way in which historic buildings, objects, and sites are identified
            and communicated to the public. An effective interpretation program helps
            preserve a sense of local history and enhances opportunities for cultural
            heritage tourism.
           Lack of Resources for Educating Residents about Identifying and
            Caring for Historic Properties. Property owners often alter historic
            properties in a manner that causes significant loss of architectural integrity,
            rendering potential historic resources ineligible for inclusion in the local
            inventory, register and/or historic district. Likewise, City employees charged
            with preservation program implementation and code enforcement often do
            not have sufficient training in dealing with historic resources to adequately
            address historic preservation. The City’s Library does not have a
            preservation resource center but does have a small local history collection
            of books.

Historic Preservation Goals and Policies
The following goals and policies are aimed at providing guidance and policy direction regarding historic resources
in Rancho Cucamonga. The goals and policies allow for the continued protection, preservation, maintenance,
recognition, and documentation of historic resources so that future Rancho Cucamonga residents can enjoy what
many residents value today.
GOAL LU-15:         Maintain a local historic resource survey, local inventory of
                    historic resources, and local register of historic resources.
               Policy LU-15.1:    Regularly update the City’s historic context statement,
                                  historic resource survey, and the inventory of historic
                                  resources.
                    Discussion:   The historic context statement will be updated regularly.
                                  Exclusion from this document will not preclude a finding of
                                  significance for any resource.
                                  The City should identify and thoroughly document historic
                                  resources throughout the City by conducting research, historic
                                  evaluation, and documentation using accepted methodology and
                                  standards of the profession. The City will perform an intensive,
                                  comprehensive survey of all historic resources Citywide to the
                                  maximum extent feasible, prioritizing survey of areas of
                                  importance identified in previous surveys. Existing City status
                                  codes will be changed to be consistent with California Register
                                  Historical Resource Status Codes. Regularly updating the City’s
                                  historic resource survey creates an opportunity for regularly
                                  updating the local inventory of historic resources.
                                  The inventory will, along with the survey, be updated regularly.
                                  To distinguish the inventory from the local register of historic
                                  resources, the City will formally adopt the name, “Rancho
                                  Cucamonga Inventory of Historic Resources” to describe
                                  buildings, structures, objects, sites, and districts surveyed and
                                  found to meet eligibility criteria established by the City and
                                  aligned with the California Register. Existing City status codes
                                  will be changed to be consistent with the California Register
                                  Historical Resource Status Codes. Properties listed in the
                                  National or California Registers will be considered for automatic
                                  listing in the inventory.
              Policy LU-15.2:     Identify funding sources to support regularly updating the
                                  historic context statement and historic resource survey.

              Discussion: There are many approaches toward identifying a stable funding
                          source for preservation activities. For example, the City could
                          assume the majority of the cost of maintaining a current context
                          statement and survey by including in the City’s Historic
                          Preservation Ordinance a requirement for the City to periodically
                          update and supplement its historic resource survey. Alternatively,
                          property owners could be made primarily responsible for the cost.
                          For example, the demolition review process could be amended to
                          provide for review of proposed demolition of properties in general
                          over 45 years of age. Findings from these demolition reviews
                          could then be used by the City to supplement the existing historic
                          resources inventory. In addition, the City could consider charging
                          a nominal fee on all permits in order to help maintain a Citywide
                          historic resource survey.
         Policy LU-15.3:  Continue to encourage listing local historic resources in the
                          California and National Registers.
              Discussion: By pursuing designation of eligible resources identified in the
                          local inventory of historic resources for National or California
                          Register listing, increased protection will be provided.
         Policy LU-15.4:  Define local register of historic resources.
              Discussion: The local register of historic resources contains the inventory of
                          historic resources, as well as resources otherwise identified to be
                          historically significant and is officially adopted by the City Historic
                          Preservation Commission. The City will officially establish “local
                          landmarks” included in the list as the local register of historic
                          resources. Historic resources currently designated will form the
                          core of the register; properties listed as “potential historic sites”
                          will be retained in the inventory and will be reevaluated prior to
                          inclusion in the local register. As part of the register, the City will
                          record all contributing features including secondary buildings and
                          structures, as well as non‐architectural site and landscape
                          features.
         Policy LU-15.5:  Designate local landmarks from the inventory.
              Discussion: Determine which surveyed resources already contained in the
                          inventory of historic resources or otherwise evaluated as
                          historically significant, such as through a National or California
                          Register nomination, are currently eligible for listing in the local
                          register of historic resources.
GOAL LU-16:    Protect historic resources.
         Policy LU-16.1:  Incorporate historic preservation principles into the City’s
                          project review process.

LU‐114                                  R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

                 Discussion: The City will continue to minimize potential impacts to historic
                             resources when developing and enforcing land use, design
                             review, zoning, building code, fire code, environmental review,
                             and other City regulations. The City will use the Secretary of the
                             Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and
                             Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring and
                             Reconstructing Historic Buildings and the Secretary of the
                             Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and
                             Guidelines for the Treatment of Cultural Landscapes (collectively,
                             Secretary’s Standards) as the standard of review for
                             development projects affecting historic resources. The City will
                             continue to evaluate and present to the City Historic Preservation
                             Commission reviews for proposed exterior changes to surveyed,
                             inventoried, and listed historic resources to evaluate project
                             conformance with the Secretary’s Standards.
           Policy LU-16.2:   Avoid illegal demolition
                             “demolition by neglect.”
                                                                 of   historic   resources    and
                 Discussion: The City will create an ordinance or modify the existing Historic
                             Preservation Ordinance to address illegal demolition of identified
                             historic resources. Such an ordinance will include means of
                             addressing historic properties that are being neglected and have
                             fallen into disrepair, either in the Historic Preservation Ordinance
                             or in a separate ordinance designed to deal specifically with this
                             problem.
GOAL LU-17:      Expand preservation incentives.
            Policy LU-17.1:  Allow for use of the Williamson Act (California Land
                             Conservation Act).
                 Discussion: The City will investigate the use of the Williamson Act, which
                             encourages the City to enter into legal contracts with private
                             landowners to restrict development on certain parcels of land to
                             agriculture or open space use; in exchange, property owners will
                             receive lower property tax assessments.
           Policy LU-17.2:   Create a conservation easement program for historic
                             resources.
                 Discussion: The City will investigate such programs that provide a legal
                             agreement between property owner and easement holder that
                             are designed to protect significant historic/architectural and
                             archaeological/cultural resources.
           Policy LU-17.3:   Develop a preservation grant program.
                 Discussion: The City will investigate a preservation grant program to provide
                             financial and technical assistance to qualifying property owners
                             that require assistance to repair their historic resources.
           Policy LU-17.4:   Facilitate acquisition of preservation loans.

             Discussion: The City will investigate facilitating preservation loans that can be
                         used for historically sensitive maintenance and rehabilitation of
                         historic resources. Revolving loans involve an initial fund,
                         established with a set amount of money, which is then distributed
                         in the form of a loan to qualified projects or property owners.
                         Interest and principal from the loans is paid back into the fund, to
                         be redistributed for future loans.
        Policy LU-17.5:  Continue to pursue designation as a Certified Local
                         Government (CLG).
             Discussion: The CLG program requires the City to maintain a qualified
                         historic preservation review commission, a historic resource
                         survey, and to enact and enforce preservation regulations.
                         Benefits of becoming a CLG include recognition of the City’s
                         preservation program, direct participation in Federal and State
                         preservation programs, and access to designated funding,
                         including funding for updating the City’s historic context
                         statement and historic resource survey. Certain changes to the
                         City Historic Preservation Commission may be required to meet
                         Office of Historic Preservation requirements.
        Policy LU-17.6:  Continue to utilize Community Development Block Grant
                         (CDBG) funds for historic preservation.
             Discussion: CDBG funding can be used to support planning (for example,
                         General Plan updates), historical resources surveys, re-use
                         plans, consultant services, property acquisition, and
                         rehabilitation, preservation, and restoration of public or private
                         properties, among other efforts.
        Policy LU-17.7:  Continue to promote use and knowledge of the California
                         Historical Building Code (CHBC).
             Discussion: The CHBC is an alternative building code that enables owners of
                         historic properties to employ reasonable alternatives or levels of
                         equivalency to standard or prevailing code and/or regulation
                         compliance when conformance with established codes and/or
                         regulations would adversely affect the appearance or economic
                         viability of qualified historic properties. The Historic Preservation
                         Ordinance should cross reference use of the CHBC, which
                         should also be included by reference in the local building code.
        Policy LU-17.8:  Promote the use of the Federal Historic Preservation Tax
                         Incentives Program.
             Discussion: This program encourages private sector rehabilitation of historic
                         properties by offering a Federal tax credit for building
                         rehabilitation projects completed in conformance with the
                         Secretary’s Standards. A 20 percent tax credit is available for the
                         certified rehabilitation of certified historic structures, and a 10
                         percent tax credit is available for the rehabilitation of non-historic,
                         non-residential buildings built before 1936.
        Policy LU-17.9:  Address adaptive re-use in the Historic Preservation
                         Ordinance.

                 Discussion: Ordinances supporting adaptive re-use of historic properties
                             encourage private property owners to adapt historic buildings to
                             new uses, often by streamlining the permitting process for such
                             development projects. Establishing development standards that
                             apply to projects on a systematic rather than individual basis
                             provides greater certainty that a re-use project can receive
                             necessary entitlements, including parking waivers. While
                             adaptive re-use of historic properties can be addressed in the
                             City’s Historic Preservation Ordinance, a separate Adaptive Re-
                             use Ordinance could also address re-use of older, non-historic
                             properties.
          Policy LU-17.10:   Employ the use of floor area incentives.
                 Discussion: The City will investigate the Transfer of Development Rights
                             (TDR) or Transfer of Floor-Area Ratio (TFAR) measures as a
                             means of protecting land or redirecting development away from
                             historic properties by transferring the rights to develop from one
                             area and giving them to another. Such incentives could be used
                             to avoid densification of the City’s historically large lots that
                             contain a single-unit residence surrounded by a historic vineyard
                             or citrus grove, which is an increasingly rare property type in the
                             City.
           Policy LU-17.11:  Continue to make available land development incentives and
                             modifications to development standards.
                 Discussion: Incentives, such as relief from parking requirements (waivers),
                             allowing for excavation of side yards, increased height and story
                             allowances, and flexible setback requirements, will be considered
                             and made available to property owners of historic resources.
                             Such incentives can be added to the Historic Preservation
                             Ordinance.
          Policy LU-17.12:   Promote the use of the National Park Service (NPS) Route 66
                             Corridor Preservation Program’s cost-share grant program
                             for preservation of Historic Route 66 resources.
                 Discussion: The NPS provides cost-share grant funds for preservation,
                             restoration, and rehabilitation projects completed in conformance
                             with the Secretary’s Standards.
GOAL LU-18: Identify and protect cultural landscape features.
            Policy LU-18.1:  Prepare a Cultural Landscape Report.
                 Discussion: The City will create a comprehensive plan for local cultural
                             landscape preservation to complement architectural preservation
                             efforts, beginning with development of a Cultural Landscape
                             Report (CLR) that documents the history, significance and
                             treatment of a cultural landscape [and] evaluates the history and
                             integrity of the landscape including any changes to its
                             geographical context, features, materials, and use. Cross
                             reference cultural landscapes to the survey and inventory.
           Policy LU-18.2:   Update files for identified historic resources to include
                             extant cultural landscape features.

             Discussion: Extant historic landscape features will be considered contributing
                         features of historic properties in the City that have been
                         identified, starting with properties listed in the local register. Files
                         for such resources will be updated to reflect contributing cultural
                         landscapes.
        Policy LU-18.3:  Create a conservation easement program for cultural
                         landscapes.
             Discussion: Conservation easement programs are an effective means of
                         preserving significant historic, architectural, archaeological, and
                         cultural resources or agricultural lands for future generations. An
                         easement on a property can be donated to a local preservation or
                         nonprofit organization or governmental agency. Such an
                         easement agreement would stipulate that the property remain in
                         its current use for a period of time or in perpetuity. In exchange,
                         the property owner gets a one-time tax deduction for donation of
                         the easement while retaining ownership of the property. Future
                         development and certain alterations to the property will require
                         approval by the organization holding the easement. If title to the
                         property changes hands, the easement remains in effect in
                         perpetuity or for the number of years specified in the original
                         easement donation.
        Policy LU-18.4:  Continue to rebuild agricultural landscapes.
             Discussion: The City will continue to rebuild agricultural landscapes by either
                         requiring or encouraging incorporation of historic landscape
                         features, such as vineyards, fruit trees, and windbreaks into new
                         development projects. Additionally, the City could identify land
                         uses that are not suitable for development such as power line
                         utility corridors where agricultural landscapes could be
                         incorporated. These large swaths of visually displeasing land use
                         could support agricultural landscaping while simultaneously
                         eliminating a community fire hazard and promoting the City’s
                         beautification, healthy living, and historic preservation goals.
        Policy LU-18.5:  Retain and restore windbreaks where appropriate.
             Discussion: The City will retain and rebuild historic tree windbreaks
                         throughout the City to the maximum extent feasible using
                         approved tree species for planting in Very High Fire Hazard
                         Severity Zones (VHFHSZs) in conformance with the Secretary’s
                         Standards. Apply the California Historic Building Code (CHBC) in
                         limited instances where extant historic windbreaks would
                         otherwise be removed due to fire concerns.

GOAL LU-19:      Identify and protect historic districts and Neighborhood
                 Character Areas (NCAs).
            Policy LU-19.1:  Identify historic districts and Neighborhood Character Areas
                             (NCAs).
                 Discussion: Identify potential boundaries for and contributing features of
                             potential historic districts and NCAs in the survey. The City
                             Historic Preservation Commission will recommend these
                             boundary locations to make official the designation of historic
                             districts and NCAs.
           Policy LU-19.2:   Create new, and modify existing, specific plans to guide
                             development of historic districts and Neighborhood
                             Character Areas (NCAs).
                 Discussion: Plans should reflect the City’s design context, setting, and
                             community character established by historic patterns of
                             development in a manner that is consistent with the Secretary’s
                             Standards. The existing Etiwanda and Foothill Boulevard Specific
                             Plans will be amended to include plans to guide development of
                             historic districts and NCAs.
           Policy LU-19.3:   Evaluate post-World
                             significance.
                                                          War     II   buildings    for   historic
                 Discussion: The City will perform a historic resource survey of all post‐World
                             War II buildings and housing tracts to determine eligibility of
                             these resources for the local inventory and register of historic
                             resources, and will add historic resources to the local inventory
                             and register as appropriate.
GOAL LU-20: Develop a historic resource interpretation program.
           Policy LU-20.1:   Create a historic resource interpretation program aimed at
                             enhancing both public awareness of local history and
                             opportunities for heritage tourism.
                 Discussion: Although the City currently identifies local landmarks with
                             markers and way-finding signage denoting proximity, these
                             efforts should be expanded upon. The City will investigate and
                             identify particularly popular historic sites, such as the John Rains
                             House, Maloof Compound, Regina Winery, and Pacific Electric
                             multi-use trail, with informational signage about local history and
                             maps highlighting locations of other local historic resources.
                             Individual historic resources and districts can be identified with
                             markers and/or entry signage as they are designated. Points of
                             entry to/from Pacific Electric Trail at Historic Town Centers will be
                             highlighted with appropriate signage. The City will also need
                             signage for “neighborhood identification.”

GOAL LU-21:   Preserve and interpret Historic Route 66 for residents, visitors,
              and business owners.
         Policy LU-21.1:  Evaluate Route 66 properties and designate Route 66-related
                          historic resources.
              Discussion: Buildings erected on Foothill Boulevard from 1926 to 1970, the
                          established nationwide period of significance for Route 66
                          properties, may be historically significant for their association with
                          Route 66 and as such, the City will develop a method to evaluate
                          these properties now to avoid loss of potentially significant
                          historic resources. A survey can be conducted on the Route 66
                          properties in Rancho Cucamonga.
                          Historic resources found to be significant for their association with
                          Route 66 should be added to the local inventory and listed in the
                          local register of historic resources.
         Policy LU-21.2:  Amend the existing Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan
                          (Development Code § 17.32) to include a linear Route 66
                          Neighborhood Character Area (NCA).
              Discussion: As extant Route 66 properties are few in number, tend to be
                          altered, and are generally interrupted by new development, a
                          linear Route 66 NCA can be established to include the roadway
                          right-of-way and adjacent historic resources, including automobile
                          service stations, roadside eateries, and motels. Remaining Route
                          66 resources are clustered, such as the Bear Gulch
                          neighborhood. These groupings will be recognized with
                          interpretive signage.
         Policy LU-21.3:  Clarify the Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan and Route
                          66/Foothill Boulevard Visual Improvement Plan/Foothill
                          Boulevard/Route 66 Mural Program to include policies that
                          prioritize preservation of documented historic character of
                          Route 66.
              Discussion: Scale, setback, and architectural design of new construction
                          along Historic Route 66 will emphasize Foothill Boulevard as a
                          center of commercial activity. Development will occur close to the
                          road and not set back by large parking lots. Land uses and
                          property types that historically lined Foothill Boulevard will be
                          encouraged for future development. The City will consider
                          replication of original Route 66 signage, encourage authenticity,
                          and avoid adding non-historic streetscape features. The City will
                          continue to encourage contemporary murals celebrating Route
                          66.
GOAL LU-22: Create interpretative programs for the Pacific Electric Railway
              right-of-way.
         Policy LU-22.1:  The City shall maintain and build on existing programs for
                          Pacific Electric Trail development and interpretation.

                 Discussion: Existing programs include extension of the Pacific Electric Trail
                             throughout the City, construction of north-south trail systems to
                             provide access from the Pacific Electric Trail to a variety of
                             locations throughout the City, and wayfinding and informational
                             signage and outdoor recreation amenities, such as benches and
                             water fountains. The City is expanding recreational opportunities
                             along the trail and providing public restrooms. The City can
                             incorporate signage along the trail that publicizes the trail as a
                             means of experiencing the City’s historic town centers and
                             connecting historic sites such as the Maloof Compound and
                             Etiwanda Depot. Additional improvements to the trail that
                             emphasize its role in development of Rancho Cucamonga’s
                             historic town centers will be included in local planning efforts, as
                             well as in future amendments to the Pacific Electric Inland Empire
                             Trail Master Plan (adopted November 2000), as appropriate.
GOAL LU-23: Educate residents and City staff to address historic properties.
           Policy LU-23.1:   Continue to work with City staff and homeowners’
                             organizations, historical societies, and historic preservation
                             advocacy groups to develop education programs about the
                             maintenance and care of historic buildings.
                 Discussion: Programs can train owners how to be stewards of historic
                             properties. Topics covered should include basic maintenance,
                             along with techniques for appropriate renovation, restoration, and
                             rehabilitation, as well as re-use of historic properties. The City
                             could assign this task to a local organization and should establish
                             a fund to be used to produce educational materials to support
                             these efforts. Other historic preservation advocacy organizations,
                             such as the California Preservation Foundation, could be utilized.
                             Sponsorship of a statewide workshop in the City would highlight
                             the importance of historic preservation in the community.
           Policy LU-23.2:   Continue to train City staff in historic preservation.
                 Discussion: City staff, including plan checkers, inspectors, and code
                             enforcement officers, will be trained to review historic properties
                             and detect inappropriate alterations to historic resources. The
                             City will regularly inspect historic properties to enforce code
                             compliance and appropriate preservation treatments.
                             Development of a thorough understanding of how to use and
                             apply the Secretary’s Standards and California Historical Building

                             seeking permits. City staff will participate in statewide
                             preservation conferences when possible and report on their
                             experience at conference and workshops.

      Achieving Our Vision
      The City of Rancho Cucamonga’s vision for community mobility is reflected in the
      following Spirit of Rancho Cucamonga Guiding Principles:
      The Spirit of Innovation and Enterprise
             We emphasize development of a balanced, integrated, multi-modal
                circulation system which includes sidewalks, bikeways, streets, equestrian
                and hiking trails, and mass transit. The system is efficient and safe, and
                connects neighborhoods to jobs, shopping, services, and active and
                passive open space.
               We maximize the industrial economic development power of our rail and
                highway connections. The Foothill Boulevard, State Route 210, and
                Interstate 15 corridors are the core of our commercial development,
                providing both jobs for our families and revenues for our community
                services. Our economic base maintains a mix of cultural, residential,
                industrial, and local and regional commercial uses with stable development.
      The Spirit of Tomorrow
            We are dedicated to a sustainable balance in land use patterns (residential,
               business, educational, agricultural, recreational, open space, and historic
               uses) and supporting transportation.
      Community Mobility
      Strategies
      This General Plan takes transportation in a new direction. It provides the framework
      for creating a comprehensive and efficient “Complete Streets” system. These policy
      directives aim to increase transportation choices, and to more closely tie
      transportation and land use decisions. Because Rancho Cucamonga’s street system
      is well developed, goals and policies emphasize enhancing the existing system with
      options that allow residents choices when deciding how to get to various locations in
      the City.
               A System of Complete Streets. This Chapter provides for a balanced
                system of Complete Streets that accommodates safe and convenient
                access and travel for all users including: motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians,
                transit riders, children, older adults, the mobility impaired, and movers of
                commercial goods.
                Complete Streets are streets that support all transportation modes, where
                feasible, and are consistent with roadway capabilities. The Complete
                Streets concept recognizes that while many streets may support many
                modes, it may not always be possible or appropriate for every street to
                support every mode. The key to a system of Complete Streets is that as an
                overall street system, streets should provide an integrated network that
                connects all parts of the City by all transportation modes, and that allows all
                users to move safely and conveniently.
       
                                                                         Community Mobility 
CM‐2                    R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

        This General Plan addresses the Complete Streets concept by: 1)
        identifying the hierarchy of travel corridors in Rancho Cucamonga; 2)
        defining a Citywide Transit Plan; 3) identifying a Citywide Bicycle Network;
        4) including provisions for bike lanes on many roadway types in the
        roadway design standards; and 5) including policies and implementation
        actions to encourage use of transit, bicycling, and walking.
       Transportation for a Healthy and Sustainable Community. This Chapter
        supports the General Plan goals for a healthy and sustainable community. It
        provides for and encourages alternatives to the automobile, such as
        bicycling and walking, which allow people to exercise. It also provides
        opportunities for reducing overall vehicle miles traveled in the City through
        transit use, bicycling, and walking; through transportation demand
        management programs to reduce trip making; and by encouraging use of
        low/zero emission vehicles. All of these features of the Community Mobility
        Chapter will reduce reliance on the automobile and help to reduce energy
        consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
       Increasing Transportation Choices. This Chapter supports convenient
        use of these alternate modes to the automobile to provide choices in
        transportation and reduce the dependence of residents and employees on
        private cars. By making trips by other modes to destinations in the City
        more convenient, people can opt not to drive their cars for short trips. The
        Community Mobility Chapter plans for convenient access to transit and to
        accommodate the latest bus technologies, and defines a complete bicycle
        network connecting all parts of Rancho Cucamonga.
        These multiple transportation modes will connect many types of
        destinations: neighborhoods, schools, parks, employment centers,
        community and civic facilities, retail and commercial centers. All
        neighborhoods will be within easy reach of transit service and the bicycle
        network.
       Connecting Transportation and Land Use. The local transportation
        system and the mobility of its users are linked to the patterns and densities
        of land uses within the City. The success of land uses depends on
        adequate access, not only within the community but also between Rancho
        Cucamonga, adjacent communities, and the surrounding region.
        Historically, primary importance has been focused on arterial highways and
        the freeway system because of the predominant role of the automobile in
        our lives. That has changed with the emergence of, and public interest in,
        ways to reduce air pollution and roadway traffic. The emergence of rail and
        bus transit to serve employment centers and provide access to jobs
        elsewhere in the region brings people into Rancho Cucamonga to work and
        gives residents commute options. Thus, the transportation system is
        designed to provide flexibility and choice in how people move through the
        City. The location and densities of land use maximize convenient access to
        transit.
        Finally, because the roadway network occupies almost 20 percent of land
        area in the City, its place extends beyond the functional aspects of mobility.
        The streets not only provide the “frame” around neighborhoods, commercial
        centers, and cultural facilities, but they also contribute substantially to part
        of the “visual City.” Thus, the quality of the streetscape continues to be one

                 of the hallmarks of Rancho Cucamonga and a direct form of enhancement
                 of the living environment beyond the mobility functions of the streets.
                Providing an Efficient and Comprehensive Street System. The street
                 system should operate safely and efficiently for all transportation modes.
                 Traffic flow should operate at adequate levels of service (defined in the
                 Streets Standards Section in this Chapter). Transportation infrastructure
                 should be adequately maintained. New technologies should be incorporated
                 into the operation of the street system – such as intelligent transportation
                 systems – where beneficial and feasible.
                 This Chapter requires that the transportation system continues to be
                 coordinated with land use development. Most of the street system is
                 already in place and operating satisfactorily. However, certain key links are
                 missing and have yet to be built. This Community Mobility Chapter requires
                 that the street system be fully developed to support planned land uses.
      Community Mobility:
      The Street System
      Efficient movement within and through Rancho Cucamonga and the region will be
      facilitated by developing and maintaining a well-designed, integrated circulation
      network. Easy and convenient access to bus and rail transit and pedestrian and
      bicycle options are essential to an efficient network. The various modes need to be
      coordinated so that mobility and the design of City streets accommodate
      transportation options beyond cars and trucks.
      Regional Access
      Rancho Cucamonga is strategically located in the west Inland Empire, with excellent
      access to regional transportation facilities, including freeway, arterial roadways,
      passenger rail connections, and the LA/Ontario International Airport.
      The City is served by three freeways: Interstates 10 and 15 and State Route 210.
      Interstate 10 (I-10) is located just south of the City limits. However, interchanges with
      I-10 occur at major north/south arterials, including Vineyard Avenue, Archibald
      Avenue, Haven Avenue, and Milliken Avenue. Interstate 15 (I-15) runs along the
      eastern edge of the City, with interchanges at Summit Avenue, Base Line Road,
      Foothill Boulevard, and 4th Street. State Route 210 (SR-210) runs through the
      northern portion of the City, with interchanges located at Carnelian Street, Archibald
      Avenue, Haven Avenue, Milliken Avenue, and Day Creek Boulevard.
      Improvements planned by regional agencies to the freeway system include the
      following:
                Addition of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes on I-10 from I-15 to the
                 Riverside County line (extending from Milliken Avenue in the City of Ontario
                 to Ford Street in the City of Redlands)
                Addition of High Occupancy Toll Lanes on I-15 from the Riverside County
                 line in the south to the I-15/I-215 interchange to the north
       
                                                                           Community Mobility

          Base Line Road and I-15 Freeway interchange improvement
The Circulation Plan provides for one new interchange on I-15 and Arrow Highway,
which will provide for improved freeway access for truck traffic to/from the industrial
area in the southeastern portion of Rancho Cucamonga.
Circulation Plan
Streets and highways are grouped into classes or systems according to the character
of the service they are intended to provide. This grouping is called “functional
classification.” An integral part of functionally classifying streets is recognizing that
individual roads and streets do not serve travel independent from the rest of the
highway system. Rather, most travel involves movement along a network of roads, so
it is necessary to determine how this travel can be channeled within the network in a
logical and efficient manner. Roadway classification defines the nature of this
process by defining the role that a particular road or street should play in serving the
flow of trips within a highway network.
General Roadway Hierarchy
The general roadway hierarchy in Rancho Cucamonga is intended as a general
description only to understand the movement of people and vehicles, and to identify
connections to the transit and bicycle networks. The actual classification of streets
and associated street standards are described in detail under Roadway
Classifications and Roadway Design Standards below.
East-west arterial roadways carry more traffic overall than north-south arterials. This
is primarily because the east-west arterials also serve as regional connections to
neighboring communities to the east and west. Figure CM-1 shows the general
hierarchy of streets and travel corridors in Rancho Cucamonga.
          Principal Travel Corridors. Principal travel corridors include Foothill
           Boulevard and 4th Street for east-west travel, and Haven Avenue and
           Milliken Avenue for north-south travel. These principal travel corridors
           traverse the City and extend beyond the City limits to connect to freeways
           and adjacent communities. Principal travel corridors are typically six-lane
           streets and carry the highest traffic volumes – typically in the range of
           30,000 to 40,000 daily vehicles, with more than 40,000 vehicles in certain
           locations.
          Secondary Travel Corridors. Secondary travel corridors are Base Line
           Road and Arrow Highway for east-west travel, and Carnelian
           Street/Vineyard Avenue, Archibald Avenue, and Day Creek Boulevard for
           north-south travel. These corridors generally extend across the entire City
           and in most cases, connect with freeways and extend to other communities.
           They are typically four-lane streets, although certain locations may be six
           lanes, and they carry lower but still substantial traffic volumes – typically in
           the range of 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day.
          Tertiary Travel Corridors. A system of tertiary travel corridors supports
           and provides access to the primary and secondary corridors, and includes
           Wilson Avenue, Church Street, Banyan Street, and 6th and 19th Streets in
           the east-west directions, and Hermosa Avenue, Rochester Avenue,
           Etiwanda Avenue, and East Avenue in the north-south direction. These
           streets are more locally oriented, are more locally traveled, and are often

                                      four-lane streets. However, two-lane streets occur in certain locations, and
                                      typically carry in the range of 10,000 to 15,000 vehicles per day.
                           Roadway Classifications
                           The Circulation Plan shown in Figure CM-2 defines the ultimate street network for
                           arterial roads and highways, which is required to provide adequate capacity to
                           support the land use plan at the City’s desired service levels. The Circulation Plan
                           defines the roadway classification for each segment of existing and future proposed
                           arterial roads and highways within the City and Sphere of Influence. Table CM-1:
                           Classifications of General Plan Roadways, identifies road segments by their
                           classifications. Road alignments of planned but unbuilt segments, particularly in the
                           Sphere of Influence area, are subject to future precise alignment based on
                           development plans and engineering criteria.
                           Roadway Design Standards
                           The City has adopted standards for each of the roadway classifications identified in
                           the Circulation Plan, as illustrated in Figure CM-3: Typical Roadway Cross Sections.
                           The key features involving access restriction, intersection spacing, curbside parking,
                           and other aspects of roadway design are further defined in Table CM-2: Roadway
                           Functional Design Guidelines.
                           Some streets have been developed with reduced rights-of-way, based on
                           design/technical review and subject to certain conditions specified in the
                           Development Code. For residential streets, reductions in street widths may be
                           allowed pursuant to the Development Code, based on historical elements, hillside
                           conditions, natural features, or projects that include attached condominium or
                           townhouse development.
                           Roadway and intersection monitoring will also be required and will include traffic
                           impact studies for proposed projects in accordance with City and San Bernardino
                           Associated Governments (SANBAG) criteria. At that time, analyses can be done to
                           determine whether required roadway improvements may exceed the cross sections
                           in Figure CM-3 at specific intersections; and site-specific access studies may be
                           deemed necessary by the City Traffic Engineer to determine the feasibility of
                           proposed access locations.

Performance (Level of Service) Standards
Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure describing operating conditions
at an intersection or along a roadway segment. It describes operating conditions
in terms of factors such as speed, freedom to maneuver, traffic delay, comfort
and convenience, and safety. LOS D or better is the adopted standard. This
standard serves as a foundation for providing a street network that moves people
and goods safely and efficiently throughout the community, while ensuring that
traffic delays are minimized.
Private Streets
Private streets are allowed, under limited conditions, subject to approval by the
Planning Commission. Private streets may be desirable in new developments
where they would enhance neighborhood identification, provide control of
access, and where special design concepts may be involved. Section 17.08.040
of the Development Code specifies the conditions and standards for private
streets. The City’s objective, however, is to require private streets to be
constructed to public street standards wherever possible. Private drives within
multi-unit residential projects serve multiple purposes: 1) as the primary means of
access for residents; 2) as emergency access by fire and police; 3) as access to
visitor parking; and 4) as the typical location where routine “parking-involved”
activities such as car washing and deliveries take place. The design/technical
review process considers not only adequacy of the drive aisle width and visitor
parking, but also addresses the need for convenient parking for residents so that
drive aisles are not partially blocked to through traffic.
Transit
Promoting the use of transit within, to, and from Rancho Cucamonga can reduce
the number of vehicles on the road and subsequently the volume of fossil fuels
consumed by commuters. By using transit we reduce traffic congestion, reduce
the need for costly roadway improvement projects, improve air quality, and
ensure a healthier population. Also, many Rancho Cucamonga residents cannot
drive or choose not to drive, including pre-teen and teenage youth, older adults
living in residential care facilities, and older adults living on their own. Rancho
Cucamonga residents have consistently supported initiatives to provide better
public transportation.
Bus Transit
Two types of bus transit services are provided in Rancho Cucamonga: fixed-
route and demand responsive. Fixed-route services are operated by Omnitrans
and include seven routes that traverse the City. These routes are not exclusive to
Rancho Cucamonga and connect to other destinations in the region. Two routes
originate at Chaffey College, and one route originates at the Civic Center. All
other routes have start and end points outside the City.
Within Rancho Cucamonga, these routes run primarily along Haven Avenue, Day
Creek Boulevard, Milliken Avenue, Carnelian Street/Vineyard Avenue, Base Line
Road, Foothill Boulevard, and Arrow Highway, and along parts of Banyan Street,
Victoria Park Lane, and 4th Street, but do not provide access to all neighborhoods
and business districts.

                              service. This service complies with the requirements of the Americans with
                              Disabilities Act (ADA). Reservations must be made in advance, and pick-up and
                              drop-off must be provided within a three-quarter mile range of the existing
                              Omnitrans fixed bus routes and during the same service hours as those routes.

                              Improvements in transit service and geographic coverage in the City are
                              anticipated. This will necessitate coordination with Omnitrans as the regional
                              transit operator.
                              The Transit Plan, shown in Figure CM-4, identifies expectations for future bus
                              service in Rancho Cucamonga. Two major transit corridors – an east-west transit
                              spine along Foothill Boulevard and a north-south transit spine along Haven
                              Avenue – will form the backbone of bus transit service in the City. Bus Rapid
                              Transit (BRT) could operate along these two corridors.
                              BRT is a rapidly developing form of enhanced bus transit that offers more
                              frequent service, fewer stops, and higher average speeds than traditional bus
                              service. It uses higher-capacity vehicles with low floors and specially designed
                              station platforms for quick boarding. In some areas, busses travel in exclusive
                              lanes for greater mobility through high-demand areas. In other areas, busses
                              may receive priority treatment over other vehicles. SANBAG (through its Draft
                              Long Range Transit Plan) and Omnitrans will plan for BRT along key corridors in
                              San Bernardino County.

In Rancho Cucamonga, BRT service could operate along Foothill Boulevard and
possibly along Haven Avenue, with bus stops at key arterials and destinations,
as shown in Figure CM-4: Transit Plan.
The Transit Plan also anticipates the reorientation and addition of bus routes to
operate on a one-mile street grid on the major arterial roadways in the City. This
would bring fixed-route transit service within a half-mile of all locations in the City,
operating along the heaviest traveled arterials and serving the primary centers of
activity within the community. The Transit Plan will add transit service for both
east-west and north-south connections.
This concept plan will need to be evaluated and implemented by Omnitrans
based on operational criteria. Consideration of expanded services are typically
evaluated based on density/intensity of development and land use types in the
vicinity of the requested service, projected market demand, and budget
considerations.
The Transit Plan (Figure CM-4) defines the following transit corridors:
         Primary Transit Corridor. A Primary Transit Corridor is a street that is
          expected to carry the highest levels of transit service, particularly
          regional service, with the most bus routes and the highest frequency of
          service.
         Secondary Transit Corridor. A Secondary Transit Corridor is a street
          that is expected to carry lower but still significant levels of transit
          service, and probably with a greater orientation to local rather than
          regional bus routes. In both cases, the design and operation of the
          streets need to reflect and accommodate transit vehicles.
Bus Transit Centers (where routes may terminate or where transfers between
bus routes are provided) are planned at Chaffey College and proposed at
Victoria Gardens.
The fixed-route bus transit system will serve all major destinations and activity
centers, including major shopping centers, community centers, government
offices, Chaffey Community College, and employment centers. Enhanced transit
connections to Victoria Gardens, the Epicenter, and the Metrolink Station will be
pursued.
Park-and-Ride Facilities
Park-and-Ride sites for ridesharing and for certain BRT stations will be most
appropriately located within or near major activity centers or at freeway
interchanges. Opportunities will be pursued to locate Park-and-Ride facilities
within major developments and/or activity centers that are planned within those
areas.
Internal City Local Transit Service
The City looks to establish a localized internal circulator transit service to connect
neighborhoods to schools, parks, commercial centers, and key destinations such
as the Civic Center, Central Park, the Metrolink Station, the Epicenter, and
Victoria Gardens. A system such as this would benefit teens, older adults, and
others within the City. This local service could be operated by the City or
Omnitrans through a joint effort. The feasibility of funding sources for this type of
service will be actively explored with Omnitrans. A fixed-route service, with

                             smaller vehicles and routes along collector and/or local streets, would be most
                             effective. This service would feed into and support regional fixed-route service,
                             significantly enhancing transit access citywide.
                             Figure CM-5: Local Transit Service Areas, identifies three possible internal
                             circulator transit service areas, which would provide connections from all
                             neighborhoods to key destinations east, northwest, and southwest. A local transit
                             center in the Terra Vista Town Center would provide for transfers among routes.
                             Community transit service could be implemented in phases based on available
                             funding and projected ridership levels.
                             Rail
                             Railroads historically have helped shape land use patterns in Rancho
                             Cucamonga and influenced the types of businesses established to take
                             advantage of freight and passenger rail service. Beginning with the Santa Fe
                             Railroad and Pacific Electric Red Cars, and continuing today with Metrolink and
                             the potential extension of the Metro Gold Line, rail transit provides options for
                             Rancho Cucamonga residents who wish to travel beyond the City and for people
                             coming to the City to work.
                             Metrolink
                             Metrolink, operated by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, is a
                             regional rail system that provides reliable transportation and mobility for the
                             region, and is the result of a multi-agency effort involving the counties of Los
                             Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino. The City is served by the San
                             Bernardino Line with a station at Milliken Avenue. The line links San Bernardino
                             to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. Metrolink trains on the San
                             Bernardino Line operate daily, including weekends.
                             The Metrolink Station located on Milliken Avenue could provide more convenient
                             access to employment centers if it were relocated to Haven Avenue. Also, a
                             Haven Avenue location would allow for coordination with bus transit, including a
                             possible BRT route along Haven Avenue.

Metro Gold Line
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority of Los Angeles County, or Metro, is
responsible for light rail service operations in Los Angeles County, and will
extend operations to San Bernardino County with the planned extension of the
Gold Line. Plans as of 2009 have the line terminating in Montclair (with the other
end at Los Angeles’ Union Station). The Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension
Construction Authority is currently studying a potential extension of the Gold Line
light rail line from its planned terminus in Montclair eastward to LA/Ontario
International Airport. Route options have been narrowed down to two key
options, both of which extend only slightly into the southwest corner of Rancho
Cucamonga.
These two options are:
         1) Along the Pacific Electric right-of-way to Foothill Boulevard and then
              south via either Cucamonga Creek or along Vineyard Avenue to
              Ontario Airport
         2) Along the Metrolink right-of-way to either Vineyard Avenue or
              Cucamonga Creek Channel and then south to Ontario Airport
Potential station sites include: the Pacific Electric right-of-way and Foothill
Boulevard, Metrolink right-of-way at 8th Street and Vineyard Avenue, Metrolink
right-of-way at 8th Street and Cucamonga Creek, and the right-of-way at 4th
Street and Cucamonga Creek. Ongoing studies will identify one or more locally
preferred routes and station locations to take forward for more detailed study of
engineering and environmental issues.

destinations using convenient routes. Continuing to allow bicycles on busses and
providing secure bicycle parking facilities will further encourage bicycling and
promote the use of multiple transportation modes. The opening of the Pacific
Electric Trail in 2007 resulted in a near explosion of bicycle use in the City.
The Bicycle Plan defines a citywide network of bicycle facilities that connects
residential neighborhoods to schools, parks, commercial centers, and activity
centers. This planned system builds upon established bike paths, bike lanes, and
bike routes to create an integrated citywide system. It builds on previous plans,
and reflects the ultimate bikeway system at build-out of the community.

                               Rancho Cucamonga recognizes three classes of bicycle routes: Class I - Bike
                               Paths or Bike Trails, Class II - Bike Lanes, and Class III - Bike Streets. Figure
                               CM-6 illustrates cross sections for each bicycle classification.
                                        Class I - Bike Path or Bike Trail. Class I facilities are bicycle trails or
                                         paths that are essentially off street and separated from automobiles.
                                         They are a minimum of eight feet in width for two-way travel and include
                                         bike lane signage and designated street crossings where needed. A
                                         Class I Bike Path may parallel a roadway (within the parkway) or may
                                         be a completely separate right-of-way that meanders through a
                                         neighborhood or along a flood control channel or utility right-of-way.
                                         Class I Bike Paths are encouraged in the master planning of large
                                         residential developments to provide convenient and safe access from
                                         housing to schools, parks, and nearby services.

                                         a curb or parking lane. If located next to a curb, a minimum width of five
                                         feet is recommended. However, a Bike Lane adjacent to a parking lane
                                         can be four feet in width. Bike Lanes are exclusively for the use of
                                         bicycles and include bike lane signage, special lane lines, and
                                         pavement markings.
                                        Class III – Bike Street. This is a street providing for shared use by
                                         motor vehicles and bicyclists. While bicyclists have no exclusive use or
                                         priority, signage – both by the side of the street and stenciled on the
                                         roadway surface – alerts motorists to bicyclists sharing the roadway
                                         space and denotes that the street is an official bike route. These streets
                                         are called “Bike Streets,” and are enhancements of the standard Class
                                         III Bike Route, which is only indicated by small wayside signs. Class III
                                         Bike Streets are identified in this Chapter in locations where Class II
                                         Bike Lanes are not feasible but when it is necessary to provide
                                         connections in the citywide bicycle network. The signage, both by the
                                         side of the street and on the street surface itself, will clearly identify
                                         such roadway sections as being on the bike network. Over time,
                                         streets designated as Class III should be improved to Class II Bike
                                         Lanes when and where it becomes feasible and where sufficient right-
                                         of-way exists.

       The Bicycle Plan
       The Bicycle Plan shown in Figure CM-7 builds upon previous plans and on the
       success and popularity of the Pacific Electric Trail. The network’s two key routes
       are cross-city bicycle trails. The east-west route will be the completed Pacific
       Electric Trail. North-south routes consist of two new trail systems implemented
       along Deer Creek Channel and Day Creek Channel. The existing north-south
       route along the Cucamonga Canyon Channel will be enhanced.
       Other established or planned Class I Bike Paths include paths that run along the
       Cucamonga Channel and Demens Creek in the western part of the City, on
       Wilson Avenue and Etiwanda Avenue in the northeast, and within the Terra Vista
       community. These Class I Bike Paths will provide a backbone system for a
       supporting citywide system of Class II Bike Lanes and Class III Bike Streets.
       Class II Bike Lanes will be provided on many streets. These bike lanes will
       provide connections from the Class I Bike Paths to many Rancho Cucamonga
       destinations. The Bicycle Plan provides for Class II facilities to be provided on
       virtually all of the principal and secondary travel corridors.
       Class II Bike Lanes continue to be planned on Foothill Boulevard and Haven
       Avenue. However, these are also routes identified for Bus Rapid Transit, as well
       as being major traffic arteries and truck routes. As planning proceeds in the
       future for the Bus Rapid Transit corridors, it may not be possible or desirable to
       retain the bike lanes on these two streets. The Bicycle Plan provides various
       alternative and adjacent bike routes to Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue in
       the event that future conditions would preclude retaining the bike lanes on those
       streets – including Class II Bike Lanes on Arrow Highway and Church Street, a
       Class I Bike Path along the Deer Creek Channel, and a Class II/Class III Bike
       Lane/Street on Hermosa Avenue.
       In the western part of the City, some streets are older and were built before
       bicycle lanes became popular; street width is inadequate to accommodate
       dedicated bike lanes. Thus, in certain locations, the Plan identifies Class III Bike
       Streets in locations where Class II Bike Lanes are not feasible.
       The Trail Implementation Plan
       The City has adopted a Trail Implementation Plan that addresses bicycle routes
       and hiking and riding trails. The Trails Advisory Committee reviews and
       recommends changes to the trails system. The Trail Implementation Plan:
                 Provides a more detailed analysis of trail conditions and strategies to
                  address bikeway issues.
                 Includes preliminary cost estimates for bikeway construction.
                 Identifies funding mechanisms for bikeway implementation.
                 Defines the roles of various City departments in the implementation of
                  the bikeway system.
                 Addresses horseback riding and hiking trail issues.
       Horseback riding and hiking trails are discussed in detail in the Community
       Services Chapter (Chapter 5).

Accommodating Pedestrians
The City promotes walking both as a means to reduce auto travel and as healthy
exercise. The City has a well-developed system of pedestrian trails, including the
popular Pacific Electric Trail. People also use the street-adjacent sidewalks for
walking to and from destinations, and the City’s streets should be pedestrian
friendly to encourage walking as a viable alternative to driving for short trips. This
is particularly important around commercial and employment centers and
recreational destinations, where building and site design should facilitate
pedestrian access.
Typical pedestrian enhancements and improved amenities on streets that serve
as key pedestrian routes include adequate or wider sidewalks, street furniture,
utility boxes that do not impede pedestrian movements, improved lighting,
seating, enhanced landscaping, street trees for shade, and trash receptacles. At
intersections or streets around schools with high or potentially high pedestrian
volumes, key enhancements include distinctive sidewalk paving, wider
crosswalks, pedestrian signage, and sidewalk bulbouts, where feasible.
                                                                                       This pedestrian crossing is
                                                                                       well marked and provides a

                                                                                       crossings.
Walkability Improvements and Pedestrian
Amenities
Rancho Cucamonga supports proactive integration of pedestrian-oriented
improvements and amenities within the street system. These principles should
also be applied to roadways within Rancho Cucamonga, where feasible and
appropriate.
Sidewalks
All streets in residential neighborhoods in Rancho Cucamonga should have
sidewalks or pathways. In addition to providing a basic transportation route,
sidewalks and pathways create appealing public spaces that reflect community
pride and invite people to walk.

       Some streets in older neighborhoods are lacking completed sidewalks. Certain
       streets that were developed prior to incorporation never had sidewalks, and
       where some blocks have vacant lots, sidewalks are discontinuous. Sidewalks are
       typically desirable and required on both sides of the street, except in the
       rural/equestrian areas of the City, where sidewalks are required on only one side
       of the street, as defined in the Development Code.
       In many cases, improvements to existing sidewalks, rather than new sidewalks,
       are needed for safety purposes. Curb ramps at intersections allow for easy
       accessibility on or off sidewalks for people with limited mobility and for strollers.
       The City will continue to construct curb ramps wherever needed to accommodate
       individuals with limited mobility, and require new development to provide
       sidewalks.
       Landscaping and Street Trees
       Appropriate and aesthetically pleasing landscaping welcomes users to walkways,
       and can provide a sense of calm as the user moves through the space. Street
       and shade tree canopies ensure that temperature-relieving shade encourages
       use even during the hottest times of the year.
       Routes to Schools and Parks
       Schools in Rancho Cucamonga were designed with the assumption that most
       students would walk. Some of Rancho Cucamonga’s schools were also paired
       with neighborhood parks at the planning and design stage. Each of these
       characteristics presents opportunities to encourage sustainable pedestrian travel
       to these quality schools and parks.
       However, trends indicate that many parents will continue to prefer using their
       cars to drop off and pick up children from school. Associated traffic results in
       unique congestion problems on local streets that were not designed to handle
       large, peak-hour loading queues.
       Rancho Cucamonga seeks both to recapture the sustainable practices of walking
       and bicycling to and from schools and parks, and to reduce congestion in areas
       immediately surrounding these facilities. The City will work with the school
       districts to provide accessible pedestrian routes from surrounding neighborhoods
       to local schools.
       Freight and Goods
       Movement
       The efficient movement of goods and freight support the economic success of
       the City. The transportation system needs to respond to the needs of businesses
       to easily access regional routes, and to shopping centers to attract patrons with
       minimal driver agitation. The designation of truck routes and maintained rail lines
       and spurs are central to these needs.

Truck Routes
Truck routes through the community are adopted by ordinance and shown in
Figure CM-8: Truck Routes. These truck routes identify the streets that trucks
must use when traveling through the City, and when traveling from local
destinations to/from the regional freeway system. Truck routes are limited to
major and secondary arterials, and are designed to protect neighborhoods from
the intrusion of truck traffic. All streets within the Industrial Area Specific Plan are
also designated truck routes.
The City has also identified streets which cannot safely accommodate the
operation of full-size trailers or semitrailers. These designated streets are signed
to limit trucks to trailers or semitrailers with a 38-foot kingpin to axle distance or
less. The designation of truck routes by ordinance allows the City to effectively
manage truck traffic, minimize truck/auto conflicts, and optimally plan capital road
improvements.
Freight Rail Lines
Local freight service operates through trackage rights on the Metrolink San
Gabriel subdivision (formerly owned by Santa Fe Railroad) through Rancho
Cucamonga – the same line that carries Metrolink trains on the San Bernardino
line. This is not a main freight line; both the Union Pacific and Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF Railway) main lines are located farther south.
The line does not serve through-freight traffic except for occasional diversions
when the main freight lines to the south are closed or restricted for limited
periods. Freight traffic levels are very light, with only infrequent service to local
industrial uses.
The line serves local freight traffic and switchers to various spur lines to industrial
areas and lineside industries in south Rancho Cucamonga, including:
          A spur line between Archibald Avenue and Hermosa Avenue, with
           sidings to the south just east of Haven Avenue
          Spur tracks north of the tracks just west of Milliken Avenue
          Spurs to both the north and the south between Milliken Avenue and
           Rochester Avenue
          Spur tracks to the north between I-15 and Etiwanda Avenue
Due to the infrequent use of rail spurs by industrial businesses and a desire to
minimize       roadway      and       railroad    crossings,     the   City     supports
closure/abandonment of railroad spurs. The City has not identified specific spur
lines for closure, but will monitor use over time to determine when abandonment
would best serve local land use and circulation objectives.
Citywide, railroad lines cross most streets at grade, including on Vineyard,
Hellman, Archibald, Hermosa, Rochester, and Etiwanda Avenues. The grade-
separated crossings at Milliken Avenue and Haven Avenue have been
constructed along these key travel corridors. A grade separation at Etiwanda
Avenue and the BNSF Railway line will be pursued to better accommodate truck
traffic.

Aviation
LA/Ontario International Airport
LA/Ontario International Airport is a medium-hub, full-service airport with
commercial jet service to major U.S. cities and many international destinations.
The airport, located in the City of Ontario, is approximately one mile from Rancho
Cucamonga’s southern boundary. It serves the growing passenger and cargo
transportation needs of the Inland Empire. In 2008, over six million passengers
departed from and arrived at the airport on over 124,000 commercial and general
aviation flights. In addition, over 480,000 tons of freight moved through the
airport. The proximity of these services benefits residents and businesses in
Rancho Cucamonga and the region.
Although aircraft flight patterns fall within Rancho Cucamonga’s boundaries,
noise from aircraft is not a significant issue in the City. A portion of the Airport
Influence Area, which are areas surrounding an airport that can be affected by
airport operations, overlaps the City’s southern boundary, generally along Church
Street to Etiwanda Avenue. The Public Health and Safety Chapter discusses the
requirements of the Airport Influence Area.
Related Transportation Plans
Many transportation issues are not specific to Rancho Cucamonga; the roads,
freeways, transit network, bike routes, etc., extend into adjacent jurisdictions and
regions beyond. The City, therefore, coordinates with adjacent cities and regional
agencies such as SANBAG, the County of San Bernardino, Caltrans, and the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) on regional
transportation issues, policies, and infrastructure development to ensure that
Rancho Cucamonga benefits from appropriate regional transportation
infrastructure improvements, and that such improvements do not negatively
impact the City. Many of these organizations prepare transportation plans.
Regional Transportation Plan
The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is prepared by SCAG for the six-county
SCAG region. This long-range transportation plan (approximately 30-year
horizon) projects population and employment growth, and defines the vision and
overall goals for the regional multi-modal transportation system. The RTP
identifies future transportation infrastructure needs and defines planned multi-
modal transportation improvements, including freeways, high-occupancy vehicle
facilities, bus and rail transit, freight movement, and aviation. This plan therefore
sets the framework for the regional transportation infrastructure system that
serves Rancho Cucamonga.

       Measure I 2010-2040 Strategic Plan
       Measure I authorizes a half-cent sales tax in San Bernardino County for use
       exclusively on transportation improvement and traffic management programs.
       Originally approved by voters in November 1989, it was renewed in November
       2004 and extended to run until March 2040. The Measure I 2010-2040 Strategic
       Plan is the official guide for the allocation and administration of the combination
       of local transportation sales tax, State and Federal transportation revenues, and
       private fair-share contributions to regional transportation facilities to fund delivery
       of the Measure I 2010-2040 transportation programs. The strategic plan identifies
       funding categories, allocations, and planned transportation improvement projects
       in the County for freeways, major and local arterials, bus and rail transit, and
       traffic management systems.
       SANBAG Long-Range Transit Plan
       SANBAG updates its Long-Range Transit Plan (LRTP) to address transit needs
       for an approximate 25-year horizon. The LRTP prioritizes goals and projects for
       transit growth. With the passage of SB375 by the State legislature in 2008, the
       LRTP has been modified to more closely tie land use and transportation planning
       strategies. The LRTP addresses countywide travel challenges and creates a
       system aimed to increase the role of transit in future travel choices. The LRTP
       anticipates that a premium transit service, such as rapid busses and rail modes,
       will offer solutions to future travel demands by providing competitive travel times
       and increased reliability, mobility, and accessibility. Premium transit will reduce
       dependence on cars, encourage community revitalization, and encourage more
       balanced transit-oriented land use development.
       Congestion Management Program (CMP)
       Proposition 111, passed in June 1990, provided additional transportation funding
       through an increase in the State gas tax. Included with the provision for
       additional transportation funding was a requirement to undertake a Congestion
       Management Program within each county with an urbanized area having a
       population of 50,000 or more, to be developed and adopted by a designated
       Congestion Management Agency (CMA). Within San Bernardino County,
       SANBAG is the designated CMA.
       The Congestion Management Program process is essentially a monitoring
       process to analyze the impacts of on-going land use decisions made by local
       jurisdictions on regional transportation systems, including an assessment of
       improvements and costs to mitigate impacts. SANBAG implements the mitigation
       implementation of the CMP in San Bernardino County through its Development
       Mitigation Nexus Study, which is the basis for identifying fair-share contributions
       from new development for regional transportation improvements (freeway
       interchanges, railroad grade separations, and regional arterial highways).
       In compliance with the Congestion Management Program, the City monitors
       intersection levels of service, requires new development to conduct traffic impact
       analysis, and has adopted a Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
       ordinance. The TDM ordinance requires new commercial, industrial, and Mixed
       Use developments estimated to employ 100 persons or more to implement
       actions to reduce vehicle trips. The City complies with the CMP requirement for
       mitigation participation through its Transportation Fee Schedule, adopted by the
       City in 2005, which is in compliance with the San Bernardino County Measure I
       Ordinance and the CMP Development Mitigation Program.

Community Mobility Issues
Key issues relative to community mobility are:
      Incomplete Bicycle Network. The Pacific Electric Trail provides bicycle
       connectivity through eastern and western residential neighborhoods in
       Rancho Cucamonga. There is a bicycle path along Cucamonga Canyon
       Channel that provides connectivity along the western area of the City.
       However, there are no completed north to south Class I Bicycle Paths in
       the central and eastern areas of the City. The City will continue to
       establish trails along utility corridors and drainage channels to provide the
       north and south connections. The grade increase toward the northern
       portion of the City can make bicycling difficult for the recreational cyclist.
      Pedestrian Circulation. Neighborhoods that either lack sidewalks or have
       sidewalks in poor condition create barriers for pedestrians.
      Low-Density Residential Neighborhoods Cannot Support Transit.
       Some of Rancho Cucamonga’s low-density residential neighborhoods do
       not have the population density necessary to support regular and frequent
       transit service.
      Reduce Vehicle Trips. Reducing vehicle trips results in positive impacts
       on local air quality, traffic congestion, noise, and energy consumption.
       Methods to reduce vehicle trips involve the arrangement and density of
       land uses, the appropriate location of park-and-ride facilities adjacent to
       freeways, and offering other convenient modes of travel. Site planning
       techniques encouraged by the City’s Planning Department include
       increasing residential densities near activity centers or commercial
       centers, providing convenient pedestrian and bicycle access to and within
       commercial/office developments, promoting high-speed internet access for
       home-office use, and various site planning techniques. Rancho
       Cucamonga has also taken a more direct approach through the adoption
       of a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance that establishes
       regulations aimed at trip reduction to be implemented for major employers
       and employment centers. The Ordinance covers provisions for on-site
       video conference facilities, pedestrian walkways connecting buildings with
       public sidewalks, shower facilities for those who walk or bicycle to work,
       priority parking for carpools/vanpools, and measures related to bicycle
       facilities.

Community Mobility Goals and Policies
GOAL CM-1:   Provide an integrated and balanced multi-modal transportation
             network of Complete Streets to meet the needs of all users and
             transportation modes.
         Policy CM-1.1:    Provide a safe and efficient street system in the City to
                           support mobility goals, all transportation modes, and the
                           goals of the Managing Land Use, Community Design, and
                           Historic Resources Chapter.
             Discussion:   The Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic
                           Resources Chapter focuses on coordinating land use and
                           transportation decisions. The Chapter also addresses pedestrian
                           accommodations in land use planning.
        Policy CM-1.2:     Provide an integrated network of roadways that provides for
                           convenient automobile, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian
                           circulation movement around the City.
             Discussion:   This policy recognizes that not all streets need to serve all
                           transportation modes, but that certain streets may also need to
                           fully allow for the efficient and convenient use by travel modes
                           other than the automobile.
        Policy CM-1.3:     Complete the circulation system by constructing new
                           roadway facilities and freeway interchanges pursuant to the
                           Circulation Plan (Figure CM-2).
             Discussion:   The Community Mobility Chapter plans for a new freeway
                           interchange at I-15 and Arrow Highway. Roadway extensions will
                           be completed in the northern Etiwanda area.
        Policy CM-1.4:     Provide access for seniors and those with physical
                           disabilities in all elements of the transportation system.
             Discussion:   This is part of the Complete Streets Plan to ensure that all users
                           have access to the transportation system, including access to
                           transit and along pedestrian pathways and walkways.
        Policy CM-1.5:     Implement street design standards. Modified standards may
                           be applied where appropriate on arterial corridors relating to
                           transit, bicycle facilities, sidewalks, and on-street parking to
                           be context sensitive to adjacent land uses and districts, and
                           to all roadway users, including transit, bicycles, and
                           pedestrians.
             Discussion:   This policy applies to both public and private roadways. Private
                           roadways may be constructed with slightly reduced standards
                           pursuant to the Development Code. The standards for various
                           roadway types have been established to accommodate the
                           forecast traffic volumes and functions of the existing and future
                           roadways.

            Policy CM-1.6:   Pursue a railroad grade separation at Etiwanda Avenue and
                             the BNSF Railway line.
                 Discussion: Grade separations currently exist at Haven and Milliken Avenues.
                             Due to truck traffic associated with the southeast industrial area,
                             the City supports creating a railroad grade separation at Etiwanda
                             Avenue and the BNSF Railway line.
GOAL CM-2:       Plan, implement, and operate transportation facilities to support
                 healthy and sustainable community objectives.
            Policy CM-2.1:   Facilitate bicycling and walking citywide.
                 Discussion: The Community Mobility Chapter supports alternative
                             transportation options, including bicycling and walking that are
                             sustainable modes and contribute to a Healthy RC.
           Policy CM-2.2:    Encourage all feasible measures to reduce total vehicle
                             miles traveled by automobiles, including enhanced transit
                             access and land use approaches that provide compact and
                             focused development along major transit corridors.
                 Discussion: Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is the total number of miles driven
                             by all vehicles within a given time period and geographic area.
                             VMT can be significantly reduced by the following land use and
                             transportation attributes: placing new development in already
                             developed areas; higher residential densities; providing a variety
                             of walking-distance destinations; convenient bicycle options; and
                             frequent, reliable, and comfortable transit service.
           Policy CM-2.3:    Support the use of hybrid, electric, and low/zero emission
                             vehicles.
                 Discussion: Most automobiles produce pollutants that are harmful to health
                             and the environment, including hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide,
                             nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, and particulates. Supporting the
                             use of hybrid, electric, and low/zero emission vehicles can reduce
                             these pollutants and move toward better air quality.
           Policy CM-2.4:    Replace City vehicles with energy-efficient and alternative
                             fuel source models when replacing vehicles or adding to the
                             City’s fleet.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga has committed to replacing existing City
                             vehicles with new energy/or fuel efficient models. The City, has
                             already purchased hybrid vehicles and plans to acquire additional
                             vehicles. The City is also working on replacing diesel-powered
                             vehicles with compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, including
                             street sweepers, dump trucks, heavy trucks, fire equipment, and
                             tractors.
           Policy CM-2.5:    Establish priority parking locations for hybrid, electric, and
                             low/zero emission, and alternative fuel vehicles.
                 Discussion: Providing incentives for hybrid, electric, and low/zero emission,
                             and alternative fuel vehicles can help increase their use.

        Policy CM-2.6:   Accommodate charging and fueling stations for alternative
                         fuel vehicles, and put forth strong efforts to have charging
                         facilities provided at employment centers.
             Discussion: As a shift in the automobile industry pushes toward alternative
                         fuel vehicles powered by ethanol, biodiesel, natural gas,
                         hydrogen, and electricity, Rancho Cucamonga will look to
                         accommodate these different types of technologies as they
                         emerge in popularity and effectiveness.
        Policy CM-2.7:   Require new developments of more than 100 employees (per
                         building or per tenant/company) to develop Transportation
                         Demand Management programs to minimize automobile trips
                         and to encourage use of transit, ridesharing, bicycling, and
                         walking.
             Discussion: Transportation Demand Management programs are aimed at
                         reducing auto driver trips through the use of other modes, and
                         thereby achieving a more balanced transportation system and
                         reducing vehicular emissions.
        Policy CM-2.8:   Support the installation of high-speed communications
                         infrastructure to facilitate the ability of residents to work at
                         home.
                         Encourage private sector development to complete a fiber optic
                         network and other advance technologies that provide high-speed
                         data sharing.
GOAL CM-3:    Provide a transportation system that includes connected transit,
              bicycle, and pedestrian networks.
         Policy CM-3.1:  Consult with regional transit operators to maintain and
                         improve the coverage and frequency of transit service in the
                         City.
             Discussion: Continue to work with Omnitrans, Metrolink, and other transit
                         providers to increase access to the public transit network. The
                         outcome should be a system that provides a true alternative to
                         single-occupant vehicles.
        Policy CM-3.2:   Support Omnitrans’ expansion of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
                         into Rancho Cucamonga, along Foothill Boulevard, with
                         stops at all major north-south streets, and with direct routing
                         via Victoria Gardens.
             Discussion: Foothill Boulevard is an ideal corridor to expand BRT services.
                         Many of the City’s higher residential densities and major
                         commercial retail centers are located on or near Foothill
                         Boulevard. This corridor connects many regional destinations
                         located throughout San Bernardino County. This General Plan
                         envisions additional Mixed Use development along Foothill
                         Boulevard and supports creating a more pedestrian-friendly
                         environment for this corridor.

           Policy CM-3.3:    Provide local transit circulator service in the City to serve
                             local neighborhoods, Victoria Gardens, the Metrolink
                             Station, the Civic Center, Central Park, and key destinations.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga’s low-density residential neighborhoods may
                             not be able to support regular and frequent bus services.
                             However, a local transit circulator service may be able provide
                             transit services for local needs that can connect residents to and
                             from important destinations in the City.
           Policy CM-3.4:    Consult with Omnitrans to establish and maintain transit
                             hubs at Victoria Gardens, Chaffey College, the Metrolink
                             Station, and other locations as appropriate to facilitate use
                             of transit and transfers between transit services.
                 Discussion: Victoria Gardens, Chaffey College, and the Metrolink Station are
                             some of the major activity centers in Rancho Cucamonga that
                             can support transit services.
           Policy CM-3.5:    Consider and evaluate the relocation of Metrolink Station to
                             Haven Avenue to provide improved connections to transit
                             and to support planned transit-oriented land uses along
                             Haven Avenue.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga is focusing on developing Haven Avenue,
                             south of Foothill Boulevard, as the City’s office corridor district,
                             potentially creating a large employment center. This General Plan
                             also establishes Haven Avenue as a planned Primary Transit
                             Corridor, with Chaffey College serving as a Transit Center. Haven
                             Avenue also connects to the LA/Ontario International Airport.
                             Based on this direction, it would be more convenient to have the
                             Metrolink Station located on Haven Avenue to better serve
                             existing and future transit services, and to be accessible to a
                             greater employment population. If funding were to become
                             available and the technical logistics of moving the station to
                             Haven Avenue were to become realistic and feasible, Rancho
                             Cucamonga would support moving the station.
           Policy CM-3.6:    In addition to requiring private development to provide
                             transit amenities, consult with regional transit operators to
                             provide attractive and convenient bus stops, including
                             shade/weather protection, seats, transit information, and bus
                             shelters as appropriate.
                 Discussion: Providing transit amenities will provide a more pleasurable
                             experience for transit riders and encourage new users.
           Policy CM-3.7:    Continue to develop and maintain a citywide bicycle network
                             of off-street bike paths, on-street bike lanes, and bike streets
                             to provide connections between neighborhoods, schools,
                             parks, civic center/facilities, recreational facilities, and major
                             commercial centers.
                 Discussion: The Bikeways Plan, Figure CM-6, will be the basis for
                             implementing a system of Class I, Class II, and Class III bike
                             paths. The Trails Implementation Plan will be updated to maintain
                             consistency with the General Plan.

        Policy CM-3.8:   Continue to encourage the provision of bicycle facilities,
                         such as bicycle lockers and secure bike parking, throughout
                         the City.
             Discussion: Bike racks and lockers should be encouraged at major activity
                         centers, including parks, schools, community centers, shopping
                         centers, libraries, major employers, major transit stations, and
                         other similar areas.
        Policy CM-3.9:   Identify and implement a dedicated funding source for
                         implementation and completion of the bicycle network as
                         identified in the Bicycle Plan.
             Discussion: The creation of an integrated, complete bicycle network is an
                         important step toward the creation of mobility options for
                         residents and workers. Pursuing a stable funding source will
                         make this vision possible.
       Policy CM-3.10:   Continue to complete the installation of sidewalks and
                         require new development to provide sidewalks.
             Discussion: The Development Code and Standard Drawings establish the
                         standards for the provision of sidewalks along roadways.
                         Sidewalk width standards vary depending on their location and
                         design, but must be a minimum of four feet wide. Sidewalks are
                         typically required on both sides of the street, except in the
                         rural/equestrian areas of the City north of Highland Avenue where
                         sidewalks are required on only one side of the street, as defined
                         in the Development Code. Locating utilities within sidewalks
                         should be avoided so that pedestrian travel is uninhibited.
                         Sidewalks must be accessible by the elderly and disabled, in
                         accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
        Policy CM-3.11:  Continue to require pedestrian amenities on sidewalks on
                         major streets that are key pedestrian routes, including the
                         provision of benches, shade trees, and trash cans.
             Discussion: One of the best ways to encourage use of public transit systems
                         is to make the wait as comfortable as possible. This can be done
                         through the use of adequate and appropriate station design,
                         street furniture, and other pedestrian amenities. These amenities
                         have the additional benefit of creating a sense of place for the
                         users.
       Policy CM-3.12:   Continue to require that the siting and architectural design
                         of new development promotes safety, pedestrian-friendly
                         design, and access to transit facilities.
             Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga will continue to ensure that project site
                         planning incorporates the needs of the pedestrian by providing
                         designated walkways from parking lots to buildings, between
                         buildings, and to adjacent uses where appropriate.
       Policy CM-3.13:   Establish a number of bike hubs in the City (centralized
                         locations with convenient bike parking for trip destinations
                         or transfer to other transportation modes) at key transit
                         nodes and at commercial nodes.

                 Discussion: Transit systems with clear destinations where people really want
                             to go are the ones that are most successful. The identification of
                             bike hubs will allow the City to prioritize the use of limited funds
                             for amenities to enhance the overall system and increase usage.
          Policy CM-3.14:    Enhance pedestrian and bicycle access to local and regional
                             transit, including facilitating connections to transit.
                 Discussion: Bike racks and lockers at transit stations and bike racks on
                             busses allow bicyclists to connect to bus and rail services,
                             increasing mobility. Pedestrian walkways and shortcuts that
                             connect to transit stops can increase transit use.
          Policy CM-3.15:    Coordinate the provision of the non-motorized networks
                             (bicycle and pedestrian) with adjacent jurisdictions to
                             maximize sub-regional connectivity.
                 Discussion: The Pacific Electric Trail is planned to connect with neighboring
                             jurisdictions, including Fontana, Rialto, Upland, and Claremont.
                             Planned bike paths along Deer Creek and Cucamonga Channel
                             are intended to connect to bicycle facilities in Ontario.
          Policy CM-3.16:    Establish fixed-route local circulator bus service connecting
                             major activity centers.
                 Discussion: To enhance pedestrian access, a local fixed-route circulator
                             system would benefit older adults, teens, and others, helping
                             them to get to major activity centers.
GOAL CM-4:       Maximize the operational efficiency of the street system.
            Policy CM-4.1:   Continue to implement traffic management and traffic signal
                             operation measures along the arterial roadway to minimize
                             delay and congestion for all modes, without adversely
                             impacting transit, bicycles, and pedestrians.
                 Discussion: The City will provide traffic management and traffic signal
                             operation measures and promote safe and efficient traffic signal
                             timing at all existing signalized intersections. Maximizing traffic
                             flow efficiencies at major intersections decreases congestion on
                             roadways.
           Policy CM-4.2:    Continue to design and operate arterials and intersections
                             for the safe operation of all modes of transportation,
                             including transit, bicyclists, and pedestrians.
                 Discussion: If users do not feel safe, they will not take advantage of
                             alternative transit systems. With Rancho Cucamonga’s wide
                             streets and high speed traffic flows on certain streets, it is
                             especially important to be aware of the potential harm that could
                             come to transit riders, bicyclists, and pedestrians.
           Policy CM-4.3:    Continue to implement Intelligent Transportation System
                             (ITS) measures and advanced traffic management
                             technologies where appropriate.

             Discussion: Intelligent Transportation Systems involve applying the latest
                         technologies in computers, electronics, and communications to
                         improve the management and operation of the transportation
                         system in the City. This can include the monitoring and control of
                         traffic signal operations to better manage traffic flow on major
                         arterials, which leads to improved incident and special event
                         response times, improved traffic operations and safety, and
                         reduced vehicle emissions.
        Policy CM-4.4:   Maintain the City’s transportation infrastructure in good
                         condition; develop and maintain adequate funding sources
                         for its ongoing maintenance and upkeep.
             Discussion: Maintaining the City’s transportation infrastructure is costly.
                         However, ignoring ongoing improvements can be costlier in the
                         long run.
GOAL CM-5:    Require that new development mitigate transportation impacts
              and contribute to the improvement of the City’s transportation
              system.
         Policy CM-5.1:  Continue to require that new development participates in the
                         cost of transportation mitigation and improvements
                         necessitated by new development, including non-automobile
                         solutions.
             Discussion: The mitigation of traffic is a responsibility that is shared by all new
                         development. Working with developers to fully integrate all modes
                         of transit is a proper step in that direction.
        Policy CM-5.2:   Require evaluation of potential traffic and transportation
                         impacts associated with new development prior to project
                         approval, and require adequate mitigation measures,
                         including non-automobile solutions prior to, or concurrent
                         with, project development.
             Discussion: Traffic impacts associated with new development are evaluated
                         pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
                         Mitigation measures are based on the roadway and intersection
                         improvements required to support the development based on the
                         roadway standards and Level of Service standards established in
                         the General Plan. For projects impacting a roadway or
                         intersection identified by the Congestion Management Program
                         (CMP) in this portion of San Bernardino County, the traffic
                         analysis must be prepared according to the guidelines adopted
                         by SANBAG. Mitigation will be designed to address Level of
                         Service problems before they actually occur, pursuant to the
                         Level of Service Standards adopted in this General Plan. Impacts
                         beyond the boundaries of this General Plan may result in
                         negotiations        with      other      jurisdictions     to      bring
                         roadways/intersections into conformance with the CMP.

           Policy CM-5.3:    Require that new and substantially renovated office, retail,
                             industrial, and multi-family developments implement transit
                             amenities, including bus turnouts, transit shelters, and other
                             streetscape elements, as appropriate.
                 Discussion: As Rancho Cucamonga moves toward more transit options for
                             both residents and employees, it is important to provide transit
                             amenities in advance. Transit amenities should be focused on all
                             transit routes, particularly along primary and secondary transit
                             corridors.
           Policy CM-5.4:    Require that new and substantially renovated office, retail,
                             industrial, institutional and multi-family developments
                             include bicycle and pedestrian amenities on site and/or in
                             the vicinity of the development to facilitate bicycling and
                             walking, including on-site bike paths where appropriate,
                             secure off-street bicycle parking, sidewalk improvements,
                             and benches. The City will encourage such developments to
                             provide bicycle facilities including showers and changing
                             rooms.
                 Discussion: To encourage residents to bicycle to work, businesses must
                             provide amenities and programs to make bicycling more
                             convenient. Amenities can include shower units and bicycle
                             lockers or racks. Businesses can initiate incentive programs that
                             make biking to work more attractive to employees.
           Policy CM-5.5:    Allow shared parking between land uses where feasible and
                             appropriate, and encourage “park-once” strategies to
                             facilitate the efficient use of parking resources.
                 Discussion: The shared parking concept provides for parking spaces that are
                             shared by more than one user, which allows parking facilities to
                             be used more efficiently. Shared parking assumes that most
                             parking spaces are only used part time by a particular motorist or
                             group, and many parking facilities have a significant portion of
                             unused space, with utilization patterns that follow predictable
                             daily, weekly, and annual cycles.
           Policy CM-5.6:    Evaluate proposed parking and circulation plans for new
                             school sites, and coordinate with school districts to provide
                             for safe pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular access to and
                             around schools.
                 Discussion: The City recognizes the importance of proper planning for safe
                             pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular access to schools. The City
                             may also seek to consult with local school districts to establish
                             standards for parking and access controls that can be applied to
                             future school sites.
GOAL CM-6:       Coordinate with other jurisdictions on regional transportation
                 issues.
            Policy CM-6.1:   Actively pursue Federal, State, and regional funds for local
                             and regional roadway improvements.

            Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga will remain a leader within the region and
                        continue to seek appropriate resources to enhance its mobility
                        network.
       Policy CM-6.2:   Support appropriate regional plans for high-occupancy
                        vehicle lanes, Bus Rapid Transit and express bus, rail
                        transit, and high-speed rail, provided it does not negatively
                        impact the City.
            Discussion: Throughout the Inland Empire, the population is expected to
                        grow. Growth will be followed by increased traffic congestion,
                        which may have impacts on economic growth. Providing safe,
                        dependable alternative forms of transit is consistent with a
                        maturing City.
       Policy CM-6.3:   Maintain consistency with the South Coast Air Quality
                        Management District air quality mandates, SANBAG’s
                        Congestion Management and Nexus Programs, and SCAG’s
                        Regional Mobility Plan requirements.
            Discussion: As the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions becomes a driving
                        force in the region, it is to the economic benefit of Rancho
                        Cucamonga to demonstrate leadership on this issue.
       Policy CM-6.4:   Require the provision of appropriate mitigation of traffic
                        impacts in surrounding communities resulting from
                        development in Rancho Cucamonga. Work with surrounding
                        communities to ensure that traffic impacts in Rancho
                        Cucamonga resulting from development outside the City are
                        adequately mitigated.
            Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga must work closely with neighboring
                        jurisdictions to address regional and local mobility issues.
                        Consultation and coordination during the development review
                        process can avert future traffic issues.
       Policy CM-6.5:   Consult with Caltrans, SCAG, the South Coast Air Quality
                        Management District, SANBAG, Omnitrans, San Bernardino
                        County, and the cities of Upland, Fontana, Ontario, and
                        Montclair to coordinate regional transportation facilities, and
                        to pursue Federal, State, and regional funds for local and
                        regional traffic improvements.
            Discussion: Many transportation projects are funded and implemented by
                        regional planning agencies. It is important that Rancho
                        Cucamonga consult with these agencies so that they can
                        participate and be involved with such large-scale transportation
                        projects that directly affect the City. Also, adjacent cities’
                        transportation projects can directly impact the street system in
                        Rancho Cucamonga.

GOAL CM-7:       Maintain an efficient and safe network of goods and freight
                 movement that supports the needs of the business community.
            Policy CM-7.1:   Continue to maintain a truck circulation system that defines
                             truck routes, directs the movement of trucks safely along
                             major roadways, and minimizes truck travel on local and
                             collector streets.
                 Discussion: Trucking-related land uses, such as distribution centers and
                             warehouses, are located in the industrial areas of the City, with
                             immediate access to major roadways and freeways.
                             Southwestern Rancho Cucamonga does contain several areas
                             where residential neighborhoods are in close proximity to
                             industrial uses. To maintain safety, it is important to enforce truck
                             routes near residential neighborhoods.
           Policy CM-7.2:    Support the abandonment of railroad spurs that no longer
                             serve industrial-support services.
                 Discussion: Existing conditions, new development, traffic, and other
                             conditions may necessitate the need to have use of one or more
                             railroad spurs cease. Abandonment will be examined on a case-
                             by-case basis.
GOAL CM-8:       Balance support of the benefits of LA/Ontario International
                 Airport with the City’s desire to minimize impacts of aircraft
                 operations on Rancho Cucamonga.
            Policy CM-8.1:   Support regional transit options that improve access
                             between Rancho Cucamonga and LA/Ontario International
                             Airport.
                 Discussion: The proximity of the LA/Ontario International Airport to Rancho
                             Cucamonga benefits residents and businesses. It is important to
                             support transportation options that connect the City and the
                             airport. Connecting the airport with transit service and potentially
                             the Gold Line light rail system would provide valuable
                             transportation options.
           Policy CM-8.2:    Consult with LA/Ontario International Airport officials to
                             minimize noise, safety, and land use impacts on Rancho
                             Cucamonga.
                 Discussion: Airport planning efforts can directly impact Rancho Cucamonga
                             due to the proximity of the runways. The Airport Influence Area
                             extends into Rancho Cucamonga. Rancho Cucamonga staff
                             should consult with the LA/Ontario International Airport and the
                             City of Ontario to ensure that aircraft operation impacts are
                             minimized.

Introduction
A healthy local economy is one that is home to diversified businesses and industries    Chapter 4:
that serve local and regional needs, and one that supports a highly trained and         Economic Development

In the last few decades, Rancho Cucamonga has grown from a relatively small,
                                                                                          Long-Term Fiscal

Cucamonga will need to seek out commercial and industrial infill and revitalization
opportunities, and attract professional and “green” technology employers to continue
its economic expansion and diversification. The City will face the additional issues of
increasing transportation costs and a growing desire among local residents to
continue to create a vibrant, diversified local economy.

      Achieving Our Vision
      Rancho Cucamonga is a premier City in the Inland Empire. The many businesses in
      the community provide numerous opportunities for local residents to also work here.
      The City’s economic development strategies—in addition to creating locational
      advantages for employment and commerce—have provided a sound financial
      foundation for the provision of quality public services. Rancho Cucamonga’s
      economy is diverse and healthy in both the industrial and commercial economic
      sectors, and includes an expanding number of knowledge-based businesses that
      take advantage of both location and an educated work force. These factors combine
      to create an attractive, well-planned, highly mobile, and engaged community that
      continues to attract new businesses.
      The City of Rancho Cucamonga’s vision for economic development is reflected in the
      following Spirit of Rancho Cucamonga Guiding Principles:
      The Spirit of Family
           Our economic development priorities are to support individuals and families by
             providing high-quality services and facilities.
      The Spirit of Innovation and Enterprise
           We are a business-friendly community. We are committed to a fair,
             entrepreneurial, and successful structure of fees, assessments, and
             community contributions which provide the funding for the City governance,
             public safety, and the development and maintenance of quality infrastructure,
             recreational programs, and open space-related facilities.
            We emphasize development of a balanced, integrated, multi-modal circulation
             system which includes sidewalks, bikeways, streets, equestrian and hiking
             trails and mass transit. The system is efficient and safe, and connects
             neighborhoods to jobs, shopping, services, and active and passive open
             space.
            We maximize the industrial economic development power of our rail and
             highway connections. The Foothill Boulevard, State Route 210 (SR-210), and
             Interstate 15 (I-15) corridors are the core of our commercial development and
             provide both jobs for our families and revenues for our community services.
             Our economic base maintains a mix of cultural, residential, industrial, and local
             and regional commercial uses with stable development.
            As we mature as a City, infill development will maintain our high standards and
             will complement existing development.
      The Spirit of Leadership
           The City promotes a balanced approach towards development that pays
             attention to long-term economic strength and fiscal responsibility. A
             sustainable economy requires a diversified employment and fiscal base. We
             take pride in the fiscal soundness enjoyed by our City as a result of solid
             development decisions, prudent financial management, and a strong
             commitment by residents to add value through their efforts.
      The Spirit of Tomorrow
           We recognize there is an interdependent relationship between an educated
             citizenry, economic development, and a thriving community.

Economic Overview
As one of the last cities in southwestern San Bernardino County to urbanize, Rancho
Cucamonga’s early landscape was dominated by citrus farms and vineyards.
Although some vineyards remain today, Rancho Cucamonga’s agricultural landscape
was replaced largely with single-family residential neighborhoods and commercial
and industrial development in the 1980s and 1990s. At that time, new residents and
industries were drawn to the City by the low cost of land. Manufacturing and
warehousing companies were particularly attracted by Rancho Cucamonga’s easy
freeway and rail access to the ports and coastal counties. These industries
dominated the local economy for two decades, but beginning in the late 1990s,
regional-serving retail and office-based industries have become integral to the
Rancho Cucamonga economy. Major development milestones include:
        Extension of the SR-210 freeway, completed in 2002
        The success of Victoria Gardens, a regional-serving lifestyle shopping
         center, initiated in 2004
        Construction of the Epicenter sports complex (1992) and Central Park (first
         phase completed in 2005)
        Significant new housing and office construction between 2002-2006
Whereas many Inland Empire communities developed in the mid-twentieth century,
Rancho Cucamonga’s most significant non-housing growth occurred starting in the
mid-1980s, continued through the 1990s well into the early 2000s. As a result,
Rancho Cucamonga’s economy has diversified rapidly, and developed with less
dependency on workers commuting great distances to jobs centers and better
integration with the economies of surrounding cities.
Redevelopment and Investment
Redevelopment is a process created by the State of California to assist local
governments in eliminating blight and revitalizing specific areas. Redevelopment
provides communities with a funding mechanism to make infrastructure
improvements, acquire property, and support new development and rehabilitation. A
portion of redevelopment funds must also be used to promote affordable housing
opportunities in the City.
Since its formation in 1981, the Rancho Cucamonga Redevelopment Agency has
conducted an aggressive effort to eliminate blight in the City. Rancho Cucamonga's
redevelopment plan has contributed to the City’s success in attracting quality jobs
and new commercial development, and creating affordable housing. The Agency
proactively seeks desirable new businesses and development that will provide
employment and revenue for the community.
The Redevelopment Project Area encompasses approximately 8,500 acres of land
generally located in the central and eastern portion of the City, between the SR-210
Freeway and 4th Street (Figure ED-1). Through the Agency's assistance in the
construction of major infrastructure improvements, the economic strength of the
project area has been enhanced.

Diverse and Sustainable Economic Base
Since incorporation in 1977, Rancho Cucamonga has placed a high priority on
ensuring that local residents have access to a diverse local job base. As a result, the
City enjoys some of the healthiest manufacturing, office, and retail job concentrations
in the region.
Many cities seek to achieve a healthy jobs-housing balance, which allows residents
to enjoy shorter, less congested commutes by living close to their place of work.
While many suburban communities are unable to achieve this balance as they lack a
major concentration of jobs, Rancho Cucamonga has achieved a nearly equal
balance between job growth and housing growth. The ratio of jobs to employed
residents in Rancho Cucamonga has increased over the years. In 2007, there were
0.84 jobs for each employed resident which represents a 20 percent increase since
2001 when there were 0.70 jobs for each resident.
However, this does not necessarily mean that City residents are employed in
businesses located in Rancho Cucamonga. To achieve a high proportion of people
both living and working in the City (and the quality of life afforded by this opportunity),
the City endeavors to match the types of jobs and land uses with the skill levels and
career aspirations of our residents.
Between 1990 and 2000, the share of residents who worked in Rancho Cucamonga
increased to 23 percent, and almost two-thirds of local residents worked someplace
in San Bernardino County. Businesses in Rancho Cucamonga draw most of their
employees from the counties of San Bernardino, Riverside, and eastern parts of Los
Angeles, and particularly from cities just to the south and east of Rancho
Cucamonga, including Ontario, Fontana, Rialto, San Bernardino, and Riverside.
Workforce Characteristics
San Bernardino County has long been one of the fastest growing counties in the
nation. As one of the newest cities in the county, Rancho Cucamonga has seen its
population and housing stock grow significantly faster than the county rates over the
last several decades. Between 2000 and 2009, the City’s population increased 40
percent (from approximately 127,700 residents to about 179,200), while the county
as a whole grew 21 percent.
As Rancho Cucamonga’s population has grown, it has also become increasingly
diverse, with rapid growth among the Latino population. In response to the needs of
the population, the housing stock has also grown increasingly diverse. While owner-
occupied, single-family homes dominate the City’s landscape, the number of multi-
units has expanded, reflecting not only the diversifying population but also Rancho
Cucamonga’s policy of encouraging construction of apartments and condominiums to
serve young professionals and older adults.
Rancho Cucamonga has a larger share of families and highly educated, upper-
income residents than the county at large. In 2008, approximately 23 percent of
Rancho Cucamonga’s population over the age of 25 had attained a Bachelor’s
degree or higher, compared to 16 percent in the county, and the City’s 2008 median
income of $76,379 was 45 percent higher than county median.
Most of Rancho Cucamonga’s residents are employed in office-based jobs in
industries that include education, health and social services, finance, insurance, and
real estate. A significant number of residents have jobs in the retail, manufacturing,
and construction industries.

      The high level of educational attainment among residents often makes residents
      more closely qualified for office-based jobs than for the core manufacturing, retail,
      and support jobs that dominate the City’s local economy. While Rancho Cucamonga
      has a growing share of the regional jobs in office-based sectors that require a
      bachelor’s degree or higher, we must take into account that many of the City’s
      residents tend to work in more highly skilled, service-oriented positions than the local
      economy currently offers (Table ED-1).

      The strong presence of manufacturing and industrial jobs in Rancho Cucamonga is
      nonetheless a critical and much desired component of the City’s economy.
      Manufacturing jobs tend to offer a median wage for workers who do not have formal
      education beyond a high school degree, and requirements for long-term on-the-job
      training offer workers job stability and room for upward mobility.
      Land Uses and the Economy
      In 2007, Rancho Cucamonga accommodated over 63,000 jobs, or approximately five
      percent of the Inland Empire’s1 economy. Since 2001, the City’s economy has grown
      by 38 percent, compared with an increase of 22 percent in the Inland Empire.
      Although early economic growth in the Inland Empire was fueled by the warehousing
      and logistics industries, Rancho Cucamonga has demonstrated an ability to attract a
      wider range of industry types, including heavy and light industrial, office, and retail.
      Industrial
      Rancho Cucamonga offers a highly competitive location for manufacturing and
      industrial businesses. Warehousing and manufacturing users find the City’s
      accessibility to major population centers in the Los Angeles region to be a significant
      advantage; warehousing users in particular take advantage of proximity to the ports
      of Los Angeles and Long Beach via rail and freeways. This locational advantage may
      be slightly compromised by rising land costs, but increases in gas prices and other
      transportation costs will boost Rancho Cucamonga’s competitiveness over lower-
      priced areas to the north and east. As a result, there may increasingly be situations
      where local industrial employers want to expand, but to do so could require

modification of the City’s parking regulations and a reduction of available large land
parcels. Also, competition for relatively less expensive industrial properties (relative
to commercial lands) by large-scale churches and similar community service uses
could begin to diminish the inventory of land for industrial enterprises. In addition,
non-industrial uses in industrial districts give rise to complaints (by the non-industrial
users) of traffic, noise, and smells. With growing competition for large industrial
parcels, the City will need to reevaluate its policies and regulations pertaining to land
uses in industrial areas to avoid future land use conflicts.

                                                                                           and east of Milliken Avenue
The City has updated its industrial zoning regulations to better recognize the needs
of different industries. However, brokers and businesses interviewed as part of the
General Plan Update process cited regulatory requirements as a barrier to industrial
development and expansion; therefore, the City will continue to pursue strategies to
address this issue. Should it prove challenging in the future to encourage key
manufacturing businesses to move to, expand, or stay in Rancho Cucamonga, the
City may need to conduct additional reviews of its parking regulations, noise
ordinances, wastewater discharge, circulatory, and mixed-use office/industrial zoning
regulations.
Office
While manufacturing continues to dominate the employment base in Rancho
Cucamonga, office, retail, and housing developments have established a more
diverse local economy, which will create greater economic stability in the long run.
Prior to the economic downturn of 2007-2010, growth among office-based industries
was rapid as firms relocated to take advantage of the concentration of highly
educated residents in Rancho Cucamonga.
Rancho Cucamonga anticipates significant growth among office-based industry
groups as relatively new Class A office space becomes occupied. One of the key
issues for the City is to ensure that this space can attract the widest range of office
tenants to support continued diversification of the local economy. The City will
endeavor to pursue growth in front-office operations in industries such as finance,
insurance, and information, and continue to encourage growth in the healthcare
industry.
Finally, with its highly educated labor force, wonderful public amenities, shopping
opportunities, and relatively low cost of living, Rancho Cucamonga has distinct
advantages that will allow it to attract a greater share of the knowledge-based

                             industry group, or creative class,2 to locate new businesses here. To enhance the
                             amenities that will draw these types of jobs, City economic goals include expansion
                             of the local retail base to include more dining and shopping options in the Haven
                             Avenue Overlay District area. The City should also closely monitor new office space
                             near Victoria Gardens to determine whether this area is successful in attracting
                             knowledge-based office users who place a high priority on quality-of-life amenities
                             such as nearby dining, shopping, and residential opportunities.
                             Retail
                             Rancho Cucamonga’s retail shopping areas are organized along three main
                             corridors: Foothill Boulevard, Base Line Road, and SR-210. Shopping centers in the
                             southern and western parts of the City were built in the late 1970s and 1980s to
                             serve the immediate surrounding neighborhoods that were built around the same
                             time. Commercial development to the east, on the other hand, occurred later and has
                             been designed to serve the region’s burgeoning, increasingly upper income
                             population. The proximity of I-15 and the large parcels available on Foothill Boulevard
                             helped drive the construction of a number of large, regional-serving shopping centers
                             during the 1990s and 2000s. Victoria Gardens and the surrounding centers and big-
                             box developments represent the latest wave of this trend, targeting an increasingly
                             affluent market sector in the Inland Empire with a variety of goods in a lifestyle
                             setting.
  Victoria Gardens offers a
unique “lifestyle” shopping
                 experience.
                             The dispersed nature of retail centers throughout Rancho Cucamonga offers
                             opportunity to move toward the Healthy City objectives established by this General
                             Plan, and to create high-quality work environments for local businesses. To achieve
                             the vision of a City where nearly all local residents can bike, walk, or take transit for

Road and north-south corridors such as Haven Avenue will need to expand the range
of goods and services desired by local neighborhood residents. A safe and well-
marked street environment will be needed to encourage bicycling and walking,
especially for residents who need to cross SR-210 to access the neighborhood-
serving retail nodes in northern Rancho Cucamonga. One way to use targeted
development as a catalyst would be the addition of more dining options near the
Haven Avenue office corridor, as allowed by the Haven Avenue Overlay District. This
will create a significant amenity that will draw knowledge-based industries to this new
space.
Residential
Demographic projections and the labor force needs of local employers suggest a
future demand for new housing for diverse household compositions: single persons,
young couples with no or very small children, and older adults looking to downsize
from their suburban homes. Developers can respond to demands that are different
from Rancho Cucamonga’s traditional single-family neighborhoods through General
Plan and zoning opportunities that allow construction of condominiums, apartments,
compact and clustered detached housing, and townhomes. With a greater diversity of
housing options, the City will be able to accommodate a resident workforce that
meets the needs of local firms. Specifically, more workforce housing located near
transit stops, the Metrolink station, and the proposed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line
will be particularly critical to attract new residents that work in the local manufacturing
and warehousing companies. Young professionals in office-based industries may
prefer condominiums and apartments rather than detached housing on lots that
require weekend time for maintenance and care. Higher-density attached housing
types and mixed-use development along corridors will help stimulate
underperforming commercial nodes and corridors, west Foothill Boulevard in
particular.
Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability
To maintain the high quality of life and community amenities that residents expect,
Rancho Cucamonga will need to continue its good fiscal management and maintain
consistent revenue sources to fund City services. The General Fund, which provides
the most significant source of revenue for local services and improvements, is funded
largely by the dollars generated by the City’s economic base and revenue structure
(sales tax and property tax). Future development creates new opportunities to
enhance and diversify the City’s revenue stream, and to provide resilience through
future economic cycles.
Rancho Cucamonga’s taxable retail sales have increased dramatically over time,
growing by 117 percent between 1998 and 2007. Most of this growth took place
between 2003 and 2005, driven by the development of Victoria Gardens and several
other major regional retailers, and by rapid population and housing growth.
As a result of this rapid growth, Rancho Cucamonga’s total taxable retail sales are
the fourth highest in San Bernardino County. However, in per capita terms, the City’s
taxable retail sales were about average compared to other cities in the county (2006
data). This is largely because the City lacks the automobile dealerships that have
historically represented the greatest sales tax contributors in other cities.3 Instead,
the City’s retailers serve an increasingly high-end local and regional residential

       market, showing competitive sales performance in apparel, general merchandise,
       and home furnishings compared to its neighbors. With the development and
       continued expansion of Victoria Gardens, Rancho Cucamonga is becoming the
       premier location in the Inland Empire for high-end retail, a niche that was previously
       unfilled.
       In addition to retail sales tax, property tax provides a portion of the General Fund. A
       healthy housing market keeps property values high. As older homeowners who
       benefitted from the tax advantages of Proposition 13 move from their large homes
       into housing better suited for seniors, the reassessment of existing housing will help
       build property tax revenues. To further diversify General Fund revenues, Transient
       Occupancy Tax, or hotel bed tax, can also provide substantial revenue to the City.
       Quality of Life
       Rancho Cucamonga has always placed a priority on quality, comfortable living and
       working environments. By continuing to promote quality of life (defined in this
       document as a Healthy Mind, Body, and Earth) as a key community value, Rancho
       Cucamonga will see real economic benefits. The City will benefit from businesses
       looking to associate with a city that has admirable standards and a business-friendly
       attitude. It will benefit from people wanting to spend their money in Rancho
       Cucamonga stores and restaurants. The results of interviews with ten major
       companies that have located in Rancho Cucamonga in the last ten years revealed
       that many professional and technical office firms have located here because it
       provides the residence of choice in the Inland Empire for executives. Workers cite the
       range of housing options available for all household income ranges, which allows
       professionals and laborers alike to live near work places.
       While low land costs might once have been a competitive advantage of doing
       business in San Bernardino County, that will not always be the case in the next
       decades. This is especially true in cities that have limited remaining vacant land.
       Therefore, maintaining the highest quality of life for residents, employers, and
       workers in Rancho Cucamonga will enable the City to attract and successfully
       compete for desired new businesses into the future.
       Healthy RC Initiative and the Local Economy
       Rancho Cucamonga is a leader in the region in facilitating the development of a
       Healthy City in all aspects of life. Economic components of the Healthy RC initiative
       include:
                Reducing commute times and shifting commute modes toward walking,
                 biking, and transit with an eye on reducing obesity and improving air quality
                Creating local work opportunities for residents, and attracting new residents
                 who work in existing local jobs
                Building a range of housing types within walking distance of jobs and
                 commercial services
                Limiting non-work car trips by encouraging walking, biking, and taking transit
                 for both recreational and shopping trips
                Diversifying the City’s industry mix in order to better withstand fluctuations in
                 the regional and national economy
        
                                                                         Economic Development

         Attracting high-tech green businesses
Setting the Bar High: Development Standards
Rancho Cucamonga residents are proud of the beauty of their neighborhoods,
business districts, parks, and the foothills abutting the City’s northern edge. When
Rancho Cucamonga incorporated, City leaders stressed the importance of quality
and well-maintained places as a way to encourage investment. By establishing clear
standards for quality development, the City has been able to ensure that new
development produces attractive buildings and building complexes, public and
private landscaping, accessible public art, supportive infrastructure, and outstanding
public facilities. Rancho Cucamonga definitively expresses its expectations for any
contribution to the private development realm, and the City leads by example in the
design and maintenance of public places. This image is a critical component in the
City’s ability to continue to attract new businesses.
Regional Connectivity
Despite City efforts to match the creation of local jobs with the education levels and
income requirements of local residents, many residents will continue to commute
outside of Rancho Cucamonga daily. Also, many workers will come to Rancho
Cucamonga from nearby cities. The San Bernardino Metrolink line provides a
convenient alternative to driving for people who live and work near a Metrolink
station, and serves as an option for folks who live in Rancho Cucamonga and work in
San Bernardino or downtown Los Angeles. Further, enhancing transit-oriented
development near the Metrolink station in Rancho Cucamonga will encourage local
residents to commute via the train.
However, many Rancho Cucamonga residents work in areas that are not well
connected via rail or bus transit.4 Encouraging expanded development of alternatives
to driving, such as enhanced bus access, bicycle/pedestrian trails, bicycle lanes, and
light rail extension from the west will help reduce congestion, eliminate commute
stress, and encourage biking and walking. The City would also benefit from an
enhanced Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT) along Foothill Boulevard such as the one
proposed by Omnitrans. Further study will need to be done to document the impacts
that such a BRT system would have on the local circulation system and roadway
infrastructure.

       Economic Development Issues
       Key issues relative to economic development include:
             Diverse and Multi-Focused Local Economy. A diverse economic base is the
              fundamental building block for the creation of a wide range of employment
              opportunities, reaching a balance between housing and jobs, and achieving
              financial stability based on sustained revenues. The City will need to support
              such economic diversity through allocation of land uses, supporting diversified
              businesses (e.g., retail, professional, and industrial), attracting “green”
              businesses, and continuing to be business friendly.
             Quality of Life. The quality of life can be a significant factor in business
              decisions to locate and stay in Rancho Cucamonga. The City will need to
              support programs and initiatives that provide desirable services to residents,
              promote high-quality private and public building design, fund public realm
              enhancements, promote Healthy City objectives, and provide alternative
              transportation modes.
             Knowledge-Based Businesses. Given the high educational attainment of
              many of its residents, Rancho Cucamonga has the potential to be home to an
              increasing number of knowledge-based or creative class-type businesses. The
              City should focus a marketing effort for these types of businesses that
              highlights more work choices for residents and decreased commuting and
              related health and environmental impacts.
             Retail Expansion. Increasing retail opportunities allows residents to walk,
              bike, or take transit to meet their daily shopping needs. New mixed-use
              development can help meet this need. In addition, new retail will also support
              long-established local businesses.
             Industrial Job Base Retention. As the population grows, increasing pressure
              to convert industrial lands to non-industrial uses is likely. The City will need to
              carefully analyze these proposals to avoid future land use conflicts and ensure
              retention of properly located and sized industrial land. In addition, the City will
              need to analyze regulations to ensure that businesses wanting to expand and
              remain in Rancho Cucamonga may do so. This includes warehousing
              converting to higher end industrial uses.

Economic Development Goals and
Policies
The following goals and policies provide guidance and policy direction for economic development strategies and
decisions.
GOAL ED-1:          Achieve and maintain a diverse and sustainable economic base.
               Policy ED-1.1:    Support quality professional and corporate office
                                 environments in the Haven Avenue and Victoria Gardens
                                 areas.
                   Discussion:   Rancho Cucamonga has experienced growth in highly-skilled
                                 office industries, and the demand will continue, given the highly
                                 educated nature of the local workforce and Rancho Cucamonga’s
                                 locational advantages. To encourage these and other office uses,
                                 the City will continue to support established office clusters along
                                 Haven Avenue, and near the Foothill Boulevard/I-15 intersection.
                                 Such support will include maintaining consistently high design
                                 standards for new office development, encouraging supporting
                                 retail and service uses as appropriate, and continuing tenant- and
                                 business-attraction efforts through an Economic Development
                                 Strategy.
               Policy ED-1.2:    Retain manufacturing industries in industrial areas.
                   Discussion:   Rancho Cucamonga’s industrial areas enjoy a strong presence of
                                 manufacturing jobs relative to other cities in Southern California.
                                 These types of jobs offer local workers livable wages, and
                                 provide job security and room for upward mobility among workers
                                 who do not have a college education. Further, manufacturing
                                 firms employ more workers per acre than other uses, such as
                                 warehousing, that also occupy the City’s industrial areas.
                                 Therefore, the City will continue to support the continued
                                 presence and success of manufacturing businesses.
               Policy ED-1.3:    Encourage the re-use of vacant warehousing facilities and
                                 other sites in industrial zoned areas to attract new,
                                 innovative industries, particularly green technology.
                   Discussion:   Partnering jurisdictions in the Green Valley Initiative, which
                                 includes Rancho Cucamonga, have prioritized the attraction of
                                 green technology firms in the Inland Empire. Consistent with this
                                 initiative, the City will continue to support the development of new
                                 buildings and reuse of existing buildings to accommodate the
                                 evolving spatial needs of innovative firms, particularly those
                                 supporting green technology. The exact type of firm included in
                                 the “green tech” category may change over time, but these firms
                                 will be supported in Rancho Cucamonga’s industrial area, so long
                                 as their day-to-day operation is compatible with other uses in the
                                 industrial area.

                          access to the full range of retail needs in appropriate areas
                          throughout the City.
              Discussion: A strong, diverse retail environment supports a quality local work
                          environment and enables residents to shop within their own city.
                          Over time, the spatial needs of retail tenants and the
                          characteristics of successful shopping environments may evolve;
                          the City will support the provision of retail space that meets the
                          evolving needs of successful retail tenants. Additionally, the City
                          will support development of retail and service space in its
                          employment areas because providing such space directly fills the
                          ancillary needs of nearby workers. Such ancillary uses may
                          include, for example, office supply stores, daily services such as
                          dry cleaning or copy service, and lunchtime dining options.
          Policy ED-1.5:  Support housing opportunities for workers of all income
                          ranges.
              Discussion: The City has, and will continue to support, housing for the local
                          workforce. Because a diverse economy requires workers of all
                          ages, skill sets, and incomes, the City will continue to support
                          development of housing for the widest variety of household types
                          and needs.
GOAL ED-2:     Maintain local long-term fiscal sustainability.
          Policy ED-2.1:  Enhance the City’s major corridors as generators of both
                          jobs and revenue.
              Discussion: As gateway arterials into the City, Foothill Boulevard and Haven
                          Avenue offer opportunities for revitalization and development. By
                          providing high-quality retail and mixed-use development along
                          Foothill Boulevard, the City can also meet the full range of
                          shopping needs among local residents and workers, and
                          enhance the City’s sales and property tax bases.
         Policy ED-2.2:   Diversify the City’s retail base.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga supports new development that attracts
                          retail and service tenants that meet the full range of shopping
                          needs. Diversifying the City’s retail options will provide for a
                          steady stream of sales tax revenue that is more resilient in
                          economic downturns, compared with retail that is focused just on
                          one sector (vehicle sales, neighborhood needs, tourism,
                          comparison goods, etc.).
         Policy ED-2.3:   Expand recreation and cultural attractions to enhance
                          tourism/visitor potential and to boost sales and transient
                          occupancy tax.

                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga has been able to attract a number of high-
                             profile hotel chains serving business visitors. Its proximity to the
                             LA/Ontario International Airport and major job centers makes
                             Rancho Cucamonga a desirable location for business travelers.
                             By expanding its visitor potential to include cultural tourism as
                             well, the City can enhance and diversify its local revenue base.
                             Enhancement of cultural amenities, including regional
                             entertainment options, recreation, and historic preservation, will
                             help to enhance the City’s reputation as a destination for a wide
                             range of visitors.
            Policy ED-2.4:   Expand lodging choices in the City through the recruitment
                             and placement of full-service hotels that will complement the
                             existing select-service hotel portfolio.
                 Discussion: Building upon the success of Victoria Gardens, the Cultural
                             Center, the Epicenter Sports Complex, and many other
                             developments, the City is poised to benefit from cultural tourism.
                             A number of high-quality hotels have opened since 2000, and a
                             clear demand exists for additional hospitality services. A full-
                             service Class A hotel facility will remain a priority goal for the
                             Redevelopment Agency.
GOAL ED-3:        Continue to emphasize quality as a core community value as it
                  applies to local workers and residents.
             Policy ED-3.1:  Continue to make public safety a priority.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga will continue to be a safe place to live and
                             do business. The City has historically invested substantially in
                             programs, facilities, and personnel that make Rancho
                             Cucamonga one of the safest communities in the U.S.
            Policy ED-3.2:   Provide community and cultural amenities.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga can reinforce its reputation as a great place
                             to live, work, and play by supporting the highest quality parks and
                             community facilities, as well as cultural arts and programs,
                             libraries, historic landmarks, and services.
            Policy ED-3.3:   Maintain a healthy fiscal balance.
                 Discussion: High-quality programs, facilities, and services can only be
                             provided if the City continues to attract and maintain revenue-
                             generating businesses.

       Policy ED-3.4:   Improve internal circulation for all modes of transportation,
                        consistent with the concept of “Complete Streets.”
            Discussion: By minimizing congestion on the roads and enhancing
                        opportunities to walk, bike, or take transit, the City will be able to
                        meet the overall General Plan goal of creating a Healthy City by
                        reducing air pollution and encouraging exercise. This Healthy RC
                        movement is another critical component of improving upon the
                        high quality of life in Rancho Cucamonga. Moreover, enhanced
                        walking, biking, and transit opportunities can help reduce the
                        future transportation costs for local residents and workers, which
                        will create lasting economic sustainability.
       Policy ED-3.5:   Facilitate development of additional local and regional
                        entertainment venues.
            Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga is known as a good community for families
                        with children, but has not been as successful at attracting other
                        demographic groups such as young professionals. Rancho
                        Cucamonga can become known as a place for young
                        professionals to live and work as well, by continuing to expand
                        the range of housing types offered, and by providing more
                        entertainment options. Such diversification will ensure that
                        employers have local access to their full workforce needs, from
                        the entry level to the executive.
       Policy ED-3.6:   Leverage the City’s quality of life amenities to attract more
                        knowledge-based workers.
            Discussion: There is a small but growing concentration of knowledge-based
                        industries in Rancho Cucamonga. This industry group includes
                        firms in professional and technical services, such as engineers,
                        architects, and accountants, requiring a highly educated labor
                        pool. These types of industries have historically not maintained a
                        strong presence in the Inland Empire but will become a greater
                        share of the regional economy in the future. Therefore, Rancho
                        Cucamonga should continue to enhance its quality of life
                        amenities with a particular focus on attracting knowledge-based
                        workers. Among many knowledge-based workers, quality of life is
                        a critical factor when deciding where to live and work, so much so
                        that it trumps other location considerations such as the cost of
                        housing. Public safety is also a major concern and the City can
                        continue to build on that success. Rancho Cucamonga is well
                        positioned to experience growth in its knowledge-based
                        industries, given the existing concentration of highly educated
                        residents, and superior parks, schools, housing stock, and
                        community amenities.
       Policy ED-3.7:   Support access to local and regional educational resources
                        that provide educational opportunities to local residents and
                        workers.
 
                                                                                    Economic Development 
ED‐16                                R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga’s residents are highly educated compared to
                             residents of surrounding areas, and the City will continue to
                             support higher education as a priority for all residents. Clearly,
                             enhancing ongoing educational opportunities for local residents
                             and workers will generate lasting economic benefits by preparing
                             the local workforce for a wide range of employment opportunities.
                             In addition to local higher education resources such as Chaffey
                             Community College, the City will support improved access to
                             regional education amenities.
GOAL ED-4:        Implement consistent high-quality standards for all future
                  development.
             Policy ED-4.1:  Encourage high-quality design for infill development and
                             continue to support new high-quality uses.
                 Discussion: As Rancho Cucamonga becomes built out, the majority of future
                             development opportunities will be on infill or underutilized parcels.
                             Building on these sites will take a greater level of patience,
                             particularly to ensure the same high-quality design standards that
                             the City has upheld in the past. Moreover, to achieve new types
                             of development – such as high end, multistory office buildings or
                             mixed-use, walkable development along western parts of Foothill
                             Boulevard – the City will at times need to wait for the market to
                             make such uses feasible.
            Policy ED-4.2:   Make green building and green business a priority.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga has been an active participant in the Green
                             Valley Initiative, a collaborative effort between local governments,
                             businesses, and community leaders to make the Inland Empire a
                             hub for green technology. In support of this initiative as well as
                             the General Plan’s goals to integrate and promote the three
                             components of a healthy community (Healthy Mind, Body, and
                             Earth), the City will continue to pursue strategies that support
                             green building and jobs. This will include potential policies and
                             standards that encourage LEED equivalent building standards in
                             addition to other green building standards that exceed the
                             minimum State thresholds, and make future buildings in Rancho
                             Cucamonga more energy efficient and environmentally
                             sustainable.

       Policy ED-4.3:   Improve connectivity between development projects to
                        create a more cohesive atmosphere.
            Discussion: The City will work to ensure that future development projects are
                        not just linked to major road arterials, but also maintain internal
                        connectivity. An increase in circulation between individual
                        development projects will reduce congestion on the City’s
                        arterials, and create a more pleasant pedestrian environment,
                        thus creating a healthier Rancho Cucamonga. Further, internal
                        connectivity will remove the need for excessive trips between
                        adjacent developments. As sites throughout the City are
                        redeveloped, connectivity will be a priority. This internal
                        connectivity will further support the goals of creating “Complete
                        Streets,” as referenced in other Chapters of this General Plan.
       Policy ED-4.4:   Focus on enhancements to Foothill Boulevard and Haven
                        Avenue.
            Discussion: As the City’s major commercial and office corridors, Foothill
                        Boulevard and Haven Avenue respectively offer significant
                        potential to create high-quality commercial and civic gateways to
                        the City. In particular, opportunities for future infill and
                        revitalization should focus on west Foothill Boulevard. Design
                        could include and build upon the historic architecture and other
                        elements inherent along the corridor. Therefore, consistent and
                        clear development standards for these arterials should be
                        articulated and enforced.
       Policy ED-4.5:   Review and understand the fiscal, job creation, and
                        economic benefits of new proposed uses in the City’s
                        industrial-zoned areas.
            Discussion: As Rancho Cucamonga becomes increasingly built-out,
                        redevelopment of large, industrial parcels for other types of land
                        uses will be an attractive option for land owners and developers.
                        A growing trend in California’s other built-out cities is the
                        conversion of industrial-zoned parcels for residential, retail, and
                        institutional uses. These industrial parcels offer some of the best
                        redevelopment opportunities because they are often the largest
                        and lowest cost properties available in a given city. However,
                        conversion of industrial lands can sometimes compromise the
                        economic potential of surrounding industrial parcels. When such
                        conversions are proposed for industrial areas in Rancho
                        Cucamonga, the City will need to weigh the economic costs and
                        benefits of allowing these conversions. Factors to consider
                        include the possible job gain and loss, possible revenue
                        generation and other fiscal impacts to the City, and possible
                        compatibility issues with neighboring parcels (i.e., putting housing
                        next to manufacturing uses that generate significant 24-hour truck
                        traffic or emissions).

GOAL ED-5:        Provide better regional connectivity to benefit local residents and
                  workers.
             Policy ED-5.1:  Engage in regional transit planning efforts.
                 Discussion: Planned transit infrastructure such as Metrolink, Bus Rapid
                             Transit along Foothill Boulevard, and the Metro Gold Line Foothill
                             Extension are major regional assets. By participating in regional
                             planning efforts, the City can ensure that local residents have

                             range of options to get to Rancho Cucamonga. Local bus
                             connections and park-and-ride lots will also play a major role.

                             15, State Route 210, and the LA/Ontario International Airport.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga has benefited from its proximity to major
                             regional freeways, and will continue to capitalize on the access
                             and visibility provided by three major interstates. For example,
                             the Haven Avenue office corridor could benefit from better-
                             perceived linkages to Interstate 10 and State Route 210. Easy
                             interstate access is a major competitive advantage for many
                             office clusters in the Inland Empire, and improved wayfinding and
                             signage may help potential firms realize the benefits of a Haven
                             Avenue address.

      among all members of the community, which can lead to stronger community ties and
      an improved sense of connectedness. Community Services directly affect the Mind,
      Body, and Earth, the three pillars of the Healthy RC initiative and this General Plan.
      Achieving Our Vision
      The vision for Rancho Cucamonga includes the provision of excellent parks,
      recreation programs, and community facilities, and a vast network of recreational
      trails that connect residents to destinations throughout the City. These facilities,
      services, and programs all promote the physical and social well-being of residents.
      The City of Rancho Cucamonga’s vision for community services is reflected in the
      following Spirit of Rancho Cucamonga Guiding Principles:
      The Spirit of Family
              We continue to develop and maintain a system of high-quality, world-class
                 community parks and sports complexes that appeal to all ages and all
                 interests, from local and regional leagues to national events.
                We celebrate the family through community events such as the Founders
                 Day Parade, critically acclaimed performing arts programs, and promotion
                 of other family activities.
      The Spirit of Discovery and Knowledge
              We promote participation in the arts, offering a variety of entertainment and
                 education venues for enrichment, as well as providing opportunities for
                 people to gather with friends and neighbors.
                We promote diverse programs and high-quality facilities such as our City-
                 owned Libraries and our Community Centers.
      The Spirit of Innovation and Enterprise
              We emphasize development of a balanced, integrated, multi-modal
                 circulation system which includes sidewalks, bikeways, streets, equestrian
                 and hiking trails and mass transit. The system is efficient and safe, and
                 connects neighborhoods to jobs, shopping, services, and active and
                 passive open space.
      The Spirit of Community
              Through programs such as Healthy RC, we inspire a lifestyle that embraces
                 a Healthy Mind, Body and Earth. We support lifelong learning and
                 enrichment, active and healthy living, and environmental sustainability.
                 These values are reflected in our programs and facilities for our residents
                 and businesses. The high quality of services the City provides strengthens
                 community bonds and contributes to healthy lifestyles.
      The Spirit of Heritage
              Our outstanding views of the mountains, the varied natural topography of
                 the area, and the trails that allow us to access these open spaces are an
                 asset and must be preserved.
       
                                                                          Community Services

The Spirit of Tomorrow
       We are dedicated to a sustainable balance in land use patterns (residential,
          business, educational, agricultural, recreational, open space, and historic
          uses) and supporting transportation.
Parks and Special Use
Facilities
Parks and special use facilities include all of the parks and community/cultural
centers in Rancho Cucamonga. Parks support activities that range from purely
passive recreational uses to heavily programmed activities. Special use facilities
include multi-use centers such as the Victoria Gardens Cultural Center, Central Park,
and the Rancho Cucamonga Adult Sports Complex. The City offers diverse
recreational programs at each facility depending upon the size of the park and the
type of facility.
Active park spaces include sports fields, game courts, and playgrounds. Passive
parks generally consist of open space with walking paths, sitting and picnic areas,
and natural, undeveloped areas. Rancho Cucamonga’s parks frequently contain both
active and passive spaces, with park size, location, and primary function influencing
the level of improvements.
                                                                                        Children enjoying the
                                                                                        playground amenities at
                                                                                        Heritage Park.
Park and Special Use Facilities Classifications
Different parks are classified based on size and type. The classification system is as
follows:
         Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks are generally between five and
          10 acres in size, and are intended to serve the daily recreation needs of
          residents in the immediate vicinity of the park. Primary uses include passive
          and active open space, tot lots, picnic facilities, and practice fields.

                Community Parks. Community parks typically range between 20 and 40
                 acres in size, and are intended to provide a wide variety of recreation
                 amenities, including swimming pools, lighted athletic fields and courts,
                 recreation centers, skate facilities, and other wider-serving recreational and
                 cultural uses.
                Special Use Facilities. Special use facilities supplement the parkland
                 system by offering special recreation, social, and cultural facilities. The
                 largest existing special use facility is the Epicenter/Adult Sports Complex,
                 which contains adult softball, baseball, and soccer fields, as well as a minor
                 league baseball stadium. These facilities are intended to contain uses not
                 usually found in typical park sites.
      Established Facilities
      As of 2009, the City of Rancho Cucamonga has 347.6 acres of developed parkland
      and special use facilities (not including trails). There are a total of 25 neighborhood
      parks, three community parks, and eight special use facilities located throughout the
      City. In addition, regional multi-purpose and community trails account for
      approximately 294.6 acres of land. The City also owns or leases several sites
      intended for parks or special use facilities, as well as a number of private parks,
      which have not been developed yet. Those areas total approximately 120 acres.
      Since 1921, the Red Hill Country Club has managed a private 128-acre golf course
      and tennis center in the community. The 144-acre Empire Lakes Golf Course also
      provides an important amenity and recreation facility in Rancho Cucamonga.
      Although both golf courses are not included in the acreage calculation of parks, they
      do provide the community with valuable open space and a special recreational
      activity.

Central Park
Central Park is the crown jewel of the City’s parks and recreation system and will
grow in importance when completed. In 2005, the first phase of the park opened with
the James L. Brulte Senior Center and Goldy S. Lewis Community Center. This joint
facility provides flexible and spacious rooms for hosting various events and meetings.
The project also includes open and programmable outdoor park space. The two main
halls can be combined with the open courtyard area to accommodate a 1,000-person

                            Implementation of the Central Park Master Plan will be completed in phases.
                            School Facilities
                            The City’s parks and recreation system is supplemented by school facilities, which
                            are available on a limited basis for recreation activities and sports leagues. Twenty-
                            three elementary schools and eight junior high/middle schools offer use of athletic
                            fields, playgrounds, basketball courts, and other facilities during evenings and
                            weekends. Four high schools and Chaffey College also provide access to a wide
                            range of athletic facilities during non-school hours.
                            The locations of established and proposed schools are shown on Figure PF-2, in
                            Chapter 7: Public Facilities and Infrastructure. The City has joint-use agreements,
                            which stipulate facility use and access provisions, with each of the five separate
                            school districts serving Rancho Cucamonga residents. Usage is very close to
                            maximum capacity at the time of this update to the General Plan.
                            Various youth sports leagues have been assigned fields at particular schools for
                            games and practice. This has been necessary because there are not enough athletic
                            fields in the City to accommodate the large number of children participating in
                            organized sports. Although not a party to the use agreements between schools and
                            sports leagues, the City provides support to community organizations seeking joint-
                            use agreements and improvements to the school sites.

Proposed Park Facilities
One new community park, one new special use facility, and two new neighborhood
parks are planned. The new community park will be built along northern Milliken
Avenue near Los Osos High School. The new special use facility, Napa Soccer
Complex, is anticipated to be located in the southeastern portion of the City near
Etiwanda Avenue. This center is planned to help alleviate the limited sports fields
available for use by youth leagues. The two proposed neighborhood parks are meant
to provide recreational facilities in the southwestern portion of the City, with one park
being proposed along the Cucamonga Creek Channel south of Base Line Road, and
another park in the vicinity of Arrow Highway and Madrone Avenue.
There are also plans, as described above, to complete the additional phases of
Central Park and expand Etiwanda Creek Park. Both park expansions will add
significant acreage to the existing park system.
Parks Standards and Guidelines
Park standards determine how many parkland acres the City should develop based
on population levels, locations of parks, and existing parks. Park guidelines
determine the recommended facilities and amenities that are developed in parks. All
parks and park facilities in Rancho Cucamonga incorporated standards and
guidelines that were current at the time the facilities were built.
Park Standards
The City maintains a park standard of 5.0 acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents.
State law (known as the Quimby Act) enables the City to collect 3.0 acres of parkland
or in-lieu fees from new residential subdivisions for every 1,000 residents, and
accordingly, the City adopted a Local Park Ordinance to implement its park and
recreational land dedication requirements. However, in order to reach the standard of
5.0 acres per 1,000 residents, the City must pursue alternative funding sources for
the additional park acreage and/or park improvements that exceed the State
standard. Alternative funding sources include general fund revenues, developer
impact fees, State and Federal grants, user group contributions, and school district
joint-use contributions.
Other methods for supplementing the City’s park system include encouraging the
development of private open space and recreational amenities (beyond public park
requirements) within large residential projects. The City also seeks to improve access
and facilities at local school sites so schools can accommodate a greater demand for
certain activities such as sports leagues. School grounds and facilities are an
important part of the recreational system and can be applied, to a limited degree,
toward meeting the City’s park standard. The City will continue to pursue the joint-use
(or ultimate use) of utility district and County Flood Control District lands for both
parks and trails.
As of 2009, the City’s population was 179,2001 residents. Based on the park
standard of 5.0 acres for every 1,000 persons, the City required 896.0 acres of
parkland in 2009 to respond to the variety of sports facilities and activities pursued by
residents. With a total of 642.2 acres of parkland/trails/special use facilities in 2009,
the deficit of parkland is calculated to be 253.8 acres (Table CS-2: Park Standards).
The General Plan projects a population of approximately 200,400 residents at build-
out. This projection translates to an ultimate goal of 1,002 acres of

                           parkland/trails/special use facilities, based on the standard of 5.0 acres per 1,000
                           persons. When the proposed park acreage (160 acres) and trail acreage (36.5 acres)
                           discussed above is combined with existing parkland/trails/special use facilities
                           (642.2), the City’s total future inventory is approximately 838.7 acres. When
                           completed, this park and recreation system will not meet the goal of 5.0 acres of
                           parkland/trails/special use facilities per 1,000 persons.
                           It is important to note that this total does not account for existing and future private
                           open space and recreation facilities, existing golf courses, or existing and future joint-
                           use of facilities at school sites. The City’s policies and implementation actions
                           emphasize the need to aggressively pursue all means to expand and maximize
                           benefits of the parks and recreation system, particularly related to the facilities in high
                           demand.

Park Development Guidelines
For parks and special use facilities other than Central Park, the City has adopted
park development guidelines, as identified in Tables CS-3 through CS-5. These
tables contain the base level development guidelines for neighborhood parks,
community parks, and special use facilities.
Neighborhood Parks:
                   Purpose: Neighborhood parks are intended to provide for the daily
                   recreation needs of residents who live in the immediate vicinity of the park.
                   Primary uses can include passive recreation, open space, active play area,
                   picnic areas, and practice play fields.
                   Size: Usable size is between five and 10 acres. No neighborhood park shall
                   be less than three net acres in size.

Community Parks:
                   Purpose: Community parks are intended to provide community-wide
                   recreational facilities and a greater variety of recreation opportunities than a
                   neighborhood park. Community parks can provide a wide variety of uses
                   such as swimming pools, athletic fields, community/recreation centers,
                   cultural centers, picnic areas, and gardens. Community parks also serve
                   neighborhood park needs for the immediate neighborhood. A community
                   park usually services several neighborhoods.
                   Size: Community parks can be developed adjacent to or in joint-use with
                   junior high/middle schools or high schools. Community park size shall be a
                   minimum of 20 acres when the park site is adjacent to a high school or junior
                   high/middle school. Sports fields and hard court facilities at community parks
                   shall be lighted for evening use.

Recreation Study
The City continually assesses park needs through updates to its Recreation Study.
The 2010 Update provided a detailed inventory of the facilities at each of the existing
parks within the City (see Table CS-1: Existing Parks and Special Use Facilities).
The Recreation Study analyzes demand for specific recreation programs and
facilities over time, based on identified participation rates for certain activities. The
result is the establishment of facility needs standards, tailored to the actual recreation
demands of the community. For example, the standards established by the National
Recreation and Parks Association for baseball game fields and soccer fields is one
field per 5,000 residents and one field per 10,000 residents, respectively. Illustrative
of Rancho Cucamonga’s young and active residents, the derived demand for Rancho
Cucamonga is one baseball field per 3,500 residents and one soccer field per 3,400
residents. For build-out projections, recreation demands were adjusted to account for
anticipated growth and changes in demographics. Table CS-6: Recreation Facility
Needs Ratio for Rancho Cucamonga, identifies the type of recreation facilities
examined and projected facility needs at build-out of the community.

       The needs ratios in Table CS-6 will be used as a guide in preparing master plans for
       future park sites and upgrade plans for existing park sites. The Recreation Study also
       identifies planned neighborhood and community parks, based on the adopted
       standards and facility needs ratios described above. The planned parks shown on
       Figure CS-1 are generally located and dispersed throughout the community based on
       the adopted service ratios. Exact locations will be determined based on site
       availability over time.

       Hiking and Riding Trails
       Rancho Cucamonga’s climate and terrain create perfect conditions for moving about
       the City on foot or bicycle. The rural residential environment along the hillsides and
       proximity to wilderness areas allow for equestrian use. Trails within the hillside land
       preserves allow access into open space areas, where users can enjoy the natural
       environment. Urban trails – consisting primarily of sidewalks and paths within linear
       parks – increase connectivity by providing direct access to neighborhoods and
       destinations.
       The Hiking and Riding Trails Master Plan provides for a network of interconnecting
       off-road urban and wilderness trails. Hiking and riding trails are intended to connect
       the City’s residential and commercial activity centers, as does the system of on-street
       bicycle trails. Details on bike routes can be found in Chapter 3: Community Mobility.
       Hiking and riding trails are primarily for recreational purposes – horseback riding,
       hiking, jogging, running, and walking for pleasure. Such trails may also incorporate
       bicycling into their design (both for street bikes and mountain bikes) where feasible.
       The regional trails traversing the commercial and industrial areas of the City also
       provide a safe and convenient alternative for bicycling to work or to shopping centers.

The ultimate system of hiking and riding trails will provide over 100 miles of
recreational enjoyment throughout the developed community and open space areas.
                                                                                            Equestrian trail in Etiwanda.
Hiking and Riding Trails Master Plan
The system of regional and community trails is identified in the Hiking and Riding
Trails Master Plan (Figure CS-3) and includes both existing and proposed trails. Trail
location is based on the criteria of safety, function, aesthetics, trail linkage needs,
important land use connections, and the feasibility of land acquisition and/or
dedication. The Master Plan identifies necessary bridges and street undercrossings,
as well as trail heads to access the trail system at key locations throughout the City.
Trail heads function as staging points for hikers, bikers, and riders, and will be
equipped with facilities such as restrooms, drinking fountains, parking for cars and
trailers, watering troughs for horses, bike racks, benches, shade, and other trail
amenities.
Trail Classifications
The City utilizes three hiking and riding trail classifications. Each trail performs
different functions and has different development standards.
         Regional Multi-Purpose Trails. Regional multi-purpose trails serve as the
          backbone of the public trail system, covering long distances and connecting
          to regional parks, open space preserves, the San Bernardino National
          Forest, and other regional trails leading beyond Rancho Cucamonga.
          Regional multi-purpose trails primarily follow flood control channels and utility
          corridors. Joint-use agreements with the appropriate public and private
          agencies will allow public access. These multi-purpose trails provide for
          equestrian, pedestrian, and bicycle use concurrently. The right-of-way
          standard for regional multi-purpose trails is 30 feet minimum width.
         Community Trails. Community trails are intended to provide convenient off-
          road access to community facilities such as parks, schools, and shopping
          centers. Community trails function as collectors that link local feeder trails in
          subdivisions to the regional trail system. When completed, these trails will
          provide multiple trail route possibilities, from short jaunts to long loops
          throughout the community. Community trails follow streets, utility corridors,
          and easements. They are intended for equestrian and pedestrian use. The
          minimum right of way standard width is 20 feet for community trails.

                                     Local Feeder Trails. These trails are contained within residential
                                      subdivisions in the Equestrian/Rural Area. Local feeder trails are generally
                                      not mapped in the General Plan or Trails Implementation Plan, but are
                                      established as private easements at the time of subdivision review. The
                                      intent of local feeder trails is to provide access from the rear of every lot,
                                      wherever feasible, to a community or regional multi-purpose trail. Local
                                      feeder trails can also provide logical riding loops within subdivisions. The
                                      right-of-way standard for local feeder trails is 15 feet minimum width.
    Pedestrian paths and
bicycle trails are included
along the trail in the Terra
         Vista community.
                             Trails Implementation Plan
                             The Trails Implementation Plan includes detailed design standards for each trail type,
                             aspects of trail implementation, and administration of the trail system by the City. The
                             Implementation Section includes an inventory of trails, along with a priority list of
                             capital improvement projects related to existing and proposed trails.
                             Established Trails
                             As of 2009, Rancho Cucamonga has already completed an extensive network of
                             multi-use trails throughout the community. Neighborhoods in Alta Loma and Etiwanda
                             include a network of equestrian trails that traverse along private properties and public
                             roadways, providing connections to parks, hillsides, and other neighborhoods. Many
                             private trail easements along the rear of developed lots connect to community and
                             regional multi-purpose trails. The Victoria Park Lane Trail and the Terra Vista
                             Greenway provide pedestrian and bike connections between schools and parks
                             through the Victoria and Terra Vista neighborhoods.
                             Pacific Electric Trail
                             In 2007, the City opened the first segment of the 21-mile Pacific Electric Inland
                             Empire Trail. This regional multi-purpose trail follows the east-west route of the old
                             Pacific Electric Railroad. The trail serves as an alternative transportation/recreation
                             corridor shared by bicyclists, pedestrians, runners, and equestrians. The trail has two
                             pavement surfaces: the concrete trail is intended for pedestrians and bicyclists, while
                             the softer granite trail is intended for joggers and equestrians. The trail is lighted at
                             night for safety from end-to-end, and has drought-tolerant landscaping. There are
                             also trash receptacles, doggie bags at intersections, horse hitching posts, and
                             drinking fountains along the entire route. Three trail heads with parking are proposed:
                             one at Amethyst Street (already constructed) and the other two at Foothill Boulevard
                             (east of the new bridge) and Etiwanda Avenue by the Pacific Electric Railroad Depot.

When fully complete, the Pacific Electric Inland Empire Trail will connect the cities of
Claremont, Montclair, Upland, Rancho Cucamonga, Fontana, and Rialto. Rancho
Cucamonga, as the lead agency, partnered with the San Bernardino Association of
Governments and surrounding cities to develop a master plan for the 21-mile long
trail. The Pacific Electric Inland Empire Trail Master Plan is the basis for pursuing a
range of funding sources including Federal and State funds, grants, and private
donations to build the trail.
North Etiwanda Preserve Trail
In 2009, the North Etiwanda Preserve Trail was opened to the public. This
interpretive trail system is designed to provide over three miles of public trail access
through the Northern Etiwanda Preserve. The North Etiwanda Preserve is a
conservation area in the City’s Sphere of Influence that protects sensitive wildlife
species. This trail will allow hikers to explore the alluvial fan sage scrub habitat within
designated trails, and view interpretive signs providing information about the history
of the area and biological benefits of the North Etiwanda Preserve. The trail will
connect local points of interest including historic water delivery system and pumping
station remnants, early settlers ruins, a Native American cultural site, riparian
wetlands, and a fresh water cienega. The trail includes a trail head with a parking
area and additional amenities.
Planned Trails
The General Plan Update policies continue to support implementation of new trails
and improvements to established trails in accordance with the Hiking and Riding
Trails Master Plan (Figure CS-3: Hiking and Riding Trails Master Plan), and the Trails
Implementation Plan.
Regional multi-purpose trails are planned to provide connections along the Demens
Creek, Deer Creek, Cucamonga Creek, and Day Creek drainage channels. Other
regional multi-purpose trails are planned along the entire span of the Sphere of
Influence, connecting to the North Etiwanda Preserve Trail and the San Bernardino
National Forest. The Pacific Electric Trail will complete the east-west connection
through the center of the City. Proposed community trails in Alta Loma and Etiwanda

       will complete the trail network within these neighborhoods by filling in the gaps where
       many trails do not currently connect.
       Trail Dedications
       The dedication of trails by a developer may be eligible for credit towards parkland
       dedication requirements based on the trail-way acreage and modes of travel
       provided. This provision underscores the importance of trails as part of the City’s
       overall parks and recreation system. In order for trail-way acreage (average trail
       width times trail length) to be credited toward the park standard, the trail must
       accommodate at least one mode of travel (pedestrian, equestrian, or bicycle) and
       provide a minimum of 50 percent of the total trail width as landscaped area (which is
       in addition to the needed trail right-of-way). Trails that provide up to three modes of
       travel and fulfill the landscape requirement may receive up to 100 percent credit
       toward park dedication requirements, as shown on Figure CS-2: Trail Credit Graph.

       Equestrian/Rural Overlay District
       The Equestrian/Rural Overlay District, which allows the keeping of horses and other
       farm animals, supports the implementation of a comprehensive equestrian trails
       system within the northwest area of Rancho Cucamonga. All new development within
       this District is required to provide community and local trails for equestrian use in
       accordance with the Hiking and Riding Trails Master Plan. The intent is to establish a
       connected system of equestrian trails that provides access to local and regional
       recreation areas including the National Forest, equestrian facilities, regional parks,
       and City regional and community trails. Where lot sizes within the Equestrian/Rural
       Overlay District are insufficient for the keeping of horses, off-site public and private
       boarding facilities should be encouraged. Land dedication and/or in-lieu fees can be

       with respect to park and recreation facility locations, park site planning and facility
       design and development, operation, maintenance and redevelopment of facilities,
       fiscal policy recommendations regarding development priorities, grants, fees, and

       Department. The Park and Recreation Commission also advises the City Council on
       matters pertaining to provision of a quality recreational services and activities

Sam and Alfreda Maloof Foundation for Arts and Crafts and
Historic Residence
Sam Maloof, a furniture designer and woodworker, was described by the

craftsman" and People magazine hailed him as "The Hemingway of Hardwood."
Maloof's work is in the collections of several major American museums, including the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Central to
Maloof’s work and life is the sprawling hand-built residence and adjoining woodshop.
Nestled in a lemon grove in Alta Loma, the Maloof residence and woodshop is filled
with Maloof furniture and one of America’s outstanding arts and crafts collections.
The Sam and Alfreda Maloof Foundation, established in 1994, is committed to
creating a pre-eminent center that preserves Sam Maloof’s legacy and fosters the
arts and crafts movement. A principal responsibility of the Foundation is protection
and conservation of the art, furnishings, structures, and grounds entrusted to it. The
residence itself is one of the most treasured parts of the collection, reflecting the
living spirit of the arts and crafts movement throughout. The Foundation also makes
the Maloof Center available to the public, artists, and researchers and is developing a
variety of programs, including visiting craftsmen, workshops, and arts and crafts
exhibits. Mr. Maloof passed away in 2009, with his legacy and museum continuing.

                            Historical Museums: John Rains House and Chaffey-Garcia House
                            The John Rains House, a 1860s-era home, is the oldest burned-brick building in San
                            Bernardino County and one of the oldest in California. It was the original ranch house
                            for the 13,000-acre Rancho Cucamonga, which was an important stop for settlers
                            migrating to California through the desert. The Casa de Rancho Cucamonga
                            Historical Society was organized to assist in the restoration, maintenance, and
                            furnishing of the John Rains House, now a public museum, and on the National
                            Register, in keeping with its 1860 origin. They host a large community Christmas
                            Open House each year.
                            The Chaffey-Garcia House was built in 1874 by Joseph Garcia, a retired sea captain.
                            On Thanksgiving Day in 1881, Joseph Garcia sold the house to George Chaffey, the
                            founder of the Etiwanda community. The Etiwanda Historical Society has restored the
                            residence and has opened the facility for public tours and community events. They
                            host several large events throughout the year including the annual Mother’s Day Tea
                            and the Historical Street Faire held in conjunction with the City’s yearly celebration in
                            November.
                            Kaiser Steel-Fontana Museum
                            Kaiser Steel was founded by Henry J. Kaiser to provide steel plates for the Pacific
                            Coast shipbuilding industry. During World War II, the company built the largest steel
                            mill in Fontana so it would be safe from coastal attack. The steel mill was the largest
                            one west of the Mississippi River.
                            Imported steel from across the Pacific Rim captured market share in the 1960s and
                            1970s, and primary steelmaking ended in the 1980s. The steel mill subsequently
                            closed. The Auto Club Speedway, a racetrack that hosts NASCAR events and other
                            races, is now located on a portion of the former steel mill. The large smelting
                            furnaces of the mill were sold to China, and the rest remains a working steel mill
                            operated by California Steel Industries.
                            Former employees have opened the Kaiser Steel-Fontana Museum in a classroom at
                            a 1915-era schoolhouse in Rancho Cucamonga to pay tribute to the Kaiser Steel mill
                            and its impact to the Inland Empire. The museum, located on the northeast corner of
                            San Bernardino Road and Hellman Avenue, showcases artifacts and photographs
                            related to the steel mill.

       Older Adult Programs and Services
       Residents over the age of 50 represent a growing demographic nationwide and in
       Rancho Cucamonga. These residents are looking to become more active in City
       programs. The Community Services Department’s services and programs aim to
       meet the needs of residents over the age of 50, and focus not only on health and
       wellness, but also include social events, expressive arts, nutrition, fitness, and

       and medical care challenges can find support and referrals. Most programs, services,
       and classes are held at the James L. Brulte Senior Center. Senior Center staff
       coordinates recreational, self-enrichment, and educational programs. They also plan
       activities, trips, and special events throughout the year, as shown in Table CS-9.
       Senior Advisory Committee

       the Park and Recreation Commission and staff on matters pertaining to programs,
       projects, and issues that address the concerns and needs of older adults. The
       Committee consists of 20 members appointed by the City Council. The mission of the

Community Services: Volunteerism and
Fundraising
Volunteering keeps the mind active, combats social isolation, and provides a sense
of community and belonging. Volunteers are an integral part of Rancho Cucamonga’s
programs and services. Volunteers also reap benefits such as acquiring new skills,
meeting new people, gaining valuable work experience, making professional

       contacts, building self-confidence, and improving the quality of life in the community.
       Volunteers give the City the ability to strengthen existing programs and services as
       well as develop new ones. Volunteer opportunities include coaching, office support,
       staging events, and teaching classes. Volunteers of all ages log tens of thousands of
       hours each year.
       Rancho Cucamonga Community Foundation
       The City has established a Community Foundation to provide local businesses and
       community members with the opportunity to make tax-deductible donations. Money
       raised by the Foundation is used primarily to fund new or enhanced programs, with
       an emphasis on developing performing arts programs.
       The mission of the Community Foundation is to generously support arts programming
       at the Victoria Gardens Cultural Center and throughout and beyond the Rancho
       Cucamonga community by annually raising substantial funding and effectively
       managing resources.
       Healthy Lifestyles
       In the General Plan, a healthy community has been defined as including three
       distinct components: Healthy Minds, Bodies, and Earth. Implementation of these
       components is addressed through various Community Service programs.
       Healthy Minds
       A Healthy Mind is reflected in quality education, life-long learning, appreciation of
       heritage, culture, arts, social support, increased creativity, and a constant
       improvement of knowledge. Examples of ways in which the City promotes Healthy
       Minds include two library locations and support of the Lewis Family Playhouse at the
       Victoria Gardens Cultural Center.
       Healthy Bodies
       Goals, policies, and implementation actions that address the Healthy Bodies theme
       are those that are intended to improve physical health. Exercise programs and
       classes, healthy diets, nutrition classes, sports leagues, and recreational facilities are
       all elements that contribute to physically active lifestyles that support healthy bodies.
       Rancho Cucamonga currently promotes healthy bodies through its numerous sports
       leagues, fitness programs, various health-conscious classes, health education, senior
       nutrition workshops, recreational trails, and a large variety of recreational facilities.
       Through the Healthy RC Initiative, the City will continue to expand what is offered, as
       resources become available.
       Healthy Earth
       A Healthy Earth emphasizes the health of the environment and an understanding of
       the limitation of our resources. Goals, policies, and implementation actions that help
       the City conserve resources, promote clean air and water, and generally further City
       efforts to move toward sustainability all promote a Healthy Earth. The City has widely
       promoted energy efficiency and water conservation efforts such as using recycled
       water for public landscaping and introducing clean fuel vehicles into the City fleet.
       The City processed a Development Code Amendment to allow residents to use
        
                                                                           Community Services

artificial turf in lieu of lawns to help conserve water. The City also implemented a
Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance in 2009.
A key City goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with statewide
objectives. The primary strategy involves integrating land use and transportation
planning, particularly along major corridors. The City promotes Mixed Use
development that can take advantage of future bus rapid transit along Foothill
Boulevard. Anticipated bus rapid transit service along Haven Avenue can connect
office developments and residential neighborhoods with Chaffey Community College
and the LA/Ontario International Airport. Planning initiatives in the Community
Mobility Chapter will expand opportunities for walking and biking and thereby reduce
vehicle use and greenhouse gas emissions.
In addition, the City is pursuing sustainable development approaches with use of a
green building program aimed at energy conservation, renewable energy sources,
water efficiency, reducing CO2 emissions, improving indoor environmental quality,
and resource stewardship. Strategies and policies focused on sustainable practices
can be found in Chapter 6: Resource Conservation.
Health Issues
Decreases in physical activity as a result of increasingly sedentary lifestyles (sitting in
cars for hours, sitting at a desk all day, busy schedules with no time for the gym or
exercise) has contributed to a rise in health issues. Studies show that adults and
children within communities in San Bernardino County are less physically active than
others in California. Studies also show that the decrease in activity has resulted in a
trend of increasing rates of obesity, asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. Awareness
of health issues in Rancho Cucamonga led to the establishment of our Healthy RC
Initiative, in which our community can be a healthy place to live, work, and play.
The City is committed to reducing the negative health impacts from a lack of activity
by creating a diverse palette of programs under the Healthy RC banner, adjusting the
land use patterns, and enhancing the circulation system. This Plan provides
residents, visitors, and people who work in the City with options that will allow them to
walk more, eat healthier, and to get around the City without using an automobile. This
Plan will lead to a robust circulation system, more healthy dining options, and better
connectivity between land uses.
Providing Access to Healthy Food Options
The City of Rancho Cucamonga supports increasing access to healthy, locally grown
foods by invigorating the community’s interest in farmer’s markets, community and
school gardens, and home-grown foods. The City has been very aggressive in
developing strategic partnerships such as targeted grants from the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, the Northtown Partnership, and coordination with the San
Bernardino County Public Health Department. Ideas that are already in place, or are
supported by the City include:
         Community Gardens. Community gardens are any piece of public land that
          is gardened and tended by the community. Community gardens can be
          located in urban, suburban, or rural areas. Community gardens can be used
          by the community to grow vegetables for personal use or can be dedicated
          for "urban agriculture" where the items grown are used for a market.
          Community gardens have many benefits, including reducing food budgets for
          families, providing healthy foods options, and providing another form of
          recreation space to the community.

               School Gardens. School gardens are similar to community gardens, except
                these gardens are located on a school site. School gardens can grow healthy
                produce for children to eat, but more importantly, they can provide an
                educational experience for children to learn how to grow fruits and
                vegetables and learn about healthy eating habits. Several schools in the City
                are already participating in school gardens.
               Access to Better Prepared Food Options. Healthy RC partners with
                restaurants located within the City to offer healthy dining options. In addition,
                the City has been encouraging local convenience markets to broaden their
                selection to include a better selection of fresh fruits and vegetables.
               Access to Fresh Fruits and Vegetables: Farmers’ Markets. Farmers’
                markets provide a physical place for farmers and food artisans to directly sell
                their food to the public. Farmers’ markets can be permanent or temporary,
                and can occur in private buildings or public spaces. Farmers’ markets
                provide support for area farmers and businesses and provide an opportunity
                for the community to purchase fresh, locally grown foods. A “certified”
                farmers’ market indicates that the farmers are approved by the San
                Bernardino County Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures as a
                certified producer that has met fruit and vegetable quality standards.
               Edible Estates. An edible estate is a property where agriculture is integrated
                into private landscapes and property. Related to the age-old concept of a
                backyard garden, an edible estate distinguishes itself from the typical
                backyard garden by incorporating the front yard areas of a property for
                growing food.
       Healthy RC Programs
       The City of Rancho Cucamonga has long been dedicated to offering residents
       opportunities for improving their health and fitness. In addition to traditional sports
       programs, the City has implemented Healthy RC programs, consistent with the
       Healthy RC Initiative. Some of the examples of the Healthy RC programs include the
       following:
                 The Healthy RC Challenge. Uses online software to track and motivate
                  participants as they work towards a healthier lifestyle. The program
                  encourages participants to walk and run more, and create a more active
                  lifestyle.
                 Healthy RC Walking and Running Clubs. Promote healthy lifestyles,
                  motivate families to be active and collectively walk or run together.
                 Senior Healthy Habits. Challenges seniors to make the commitment to
                  improve their health by participating in healthy programs at the James L.
                  Brulte Senior Center. Senior Healthy Habits encourages older adults to
                  participate in multiple health-related programs.

Community Services Issues
Key issues relative to park facilities, recreational programs and services, and hiking
and riding trails are:
      Parks and Special Use Facilities. With a growing population, the City must
       continually provide new park facilities and maintain existing park facilities to
       adequately meet the needs of a growing community. As of 2009, the City had
       not yet met the goal of 5.0 acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents.
      Sports Fields. Organized sports programs have created a demand for more
       baseball/softball and soccer fields. Many neighborhood parks provide space
       for organized sports, but typically have insufficient parking spaces to meet the
       demand. This has caused issues with surrounding residential neighborhoods
       due to parking spillovers during events.
      Regional Trails. Many designated north and south regional trails have not
       been developed or opened for public access. Many of these trails follow creek
       drainage channels where permission from other agencies is required through
       an agreement, and funding sources need to be pursued to construct trails.
       Many of the regional trails that provide access into the National Forest are also
       not completed.
      Community and Local Feeder Trails in the Equestrian/Rural Areas. Many
       of the planned trails in Alta Loma and Etiwanda are incomplete. Gaps in the
       trail system require hikers and riders to connect to completed trails by using
       streets or crossing private property. Completing and connecting unfinished or
       incomplete trails may be a priority; however, limited funding may make
       completion of these trails a challenge.
      Trail Access. There are several community trails identified on the Hiking and
       Riding Trails Master Plan that include sections where the general public has
       traversed private property for a number of years to gain access to another
       public trail. Some residents have expressed concern about hikers trespassing
       on private property to gain access into the National Forest and other public
       areas. The General Plan recognizes that such “informal” trails exist and
       requires that developers take such informal trails into consideration in the
       layout of a proposed project. The final location of trails within a project should
       be based on a number of factors, including the conditions of the site, the
       development concept, circulation plan, and the desired connections to off-site
       trails. Some of these informal trails are not mapped and/or are not part of the
       Hiking and Riding Trails Master Plan.
      Community Services. The City historically has provided high levels of
       recreation, community, youth and family, and older adult services that meet
       changing community needs. Maintaining and improving this level of service
       may be challenging given limited funding resources and demographic
       changes.
      Older Adult Services. Rancho Cucamonga, like the rest of the country, can
       anticipate an increase in the number of older adult residents as the “Baby
       Boomer” generation ages. There will be an increasing demand for social
       services; however, “Baby Boomers” are expected to remain active throughout
       all life stages, and consequently, more older adults should be available to take

                                      of all social service programs.
                                     Access to Health Care Facilities. Although most health care is privatized,
                                      the provision of health care facilities within the City is crucial to keeping the
                                      community healthy. Rancho Cucamonga is home to many small and private
                                      medical facilities. The Rancho San Antonio Medical Plaza is a specially
                                      designed 70,000-square-foot outpatient center supported by the San Antonio
                                      Hospital system. The facility offers urgent care, diagnostic and therapeutic
                                      services, and educational programs, as well as physician offices. The Rancho
                                      Specialty Hospital is a specialty 55-bed facility specifically intended for long-
                                      term acute care.
                                      No major medical campuses or facilities are located in Rancho Cucamonga.
                                      The closest major hospital is San Antonio Community Hospital located in
                                      Upland. Additionally, there are no free San Bernardino County health clinics in
                                      the City. The nearest County clinics, which offer limited healthcare services,
                                      are located in the neighboring cities of Ontario and Fontana.
Community Services Goals and Policies
The following goals and policies are aimed at providing guidance and policy direction regarding Community
Services in Rancho Cucamonga. Community Services in the City are a high priority and contribute to creating a
high quality of life. The goals and policies allow for the continued expansion, improvement, and maintenance of
community facilities and services so that future Rancho Cucamonga residents can enjoy what many residents
value today.
GOAL CS-1:             Provide attractive, high-quality community services facilities that
                       adequately meet the community’s need.
                 Policy CS-1.1:     Provide adequate park and recreational facilities that meet
                                    the City standard of 5.0 acres of parkland (including trails
                                    and special facilities) for every 1,000 persons.
                      Discussion:   Rancho Cucamonga has set a high standard of providing 5.0
                                    acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents. The National Park
                                    and Recreation Association recommends cities attain a park ratio
                                    of 3.0 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. With the City’s
                                    extensive park system, diverse special use facilities, and
                                    comprehensive trails, the City is committed to providing adequate
                                    community service facilities accessible to all residents in Rancho
                                    Cucamonga. However, with the population increasing in the City,
                                    Rancho Cucamonga City leaders will have to continually work to
                                    acquire and develop parks and community services facilities to
                                    meet this high standard.
                Policy CS-1.2:      Develop parks that contribute to active and healthy
                                    lifestyles, and allow for a balanced commitment to both
                                    organized        recreation    activities   and     passive     park
                                    environments.

                 Discussion: This General Plan focuses on pursuing the Healthy RC strategies
                             of improving the Mind, Body, and Earth for the Rancho
                             Cucamonga community. This policy establishes the importance
                             of recreational and physical activities, as well as passive and
                             leisurely park environments to contribute positively to the Mind
                             and Body.
            Policy CS-1.3:   Continue to develop Central Park as envisioned in the
                             Central Park Master Plan.
                 Discussion: As of 2009, a portion of Central Park has been built that includes
                             the James L. Brulte Senior Center and the Goldy S. Lewis
                             Community Center as well as outdoor areas. The Central Park
                             Master Plan, prepared by a broad-based citizen task force and
                             subsequently approved by the Park and Recreation Commission
                             and the City Council, provides guidance on the remaining
                             unfinished portions of the park. Future Central Park development
                             should reflect what was envisioned in the Central Park Master
                             Plan.
            Policy CS-1.4:   Pursue developing an outdoor special use facility that
                             includes a multi-field sports complex.
                 Discussion: The Community Services Department is pursuing the
                             development of a regional sports center. The sports center would
                             help alleviate overcrowding in some neighborhood parks that
                             serve many non-profit youth sports organizations and provide
                             opportunities for regional and State-wide tournaments.
            Policy CS-1.5:   Continue to require new development to provide needed
                             park facilities through the various measures and tools
                             available to the City (e.g., in-lieu fees and/or land
                             dedication).
                 Discussion: This policy is intended to provide for turnkey parks that may be
                             part of large-scale residential development projects. At the
                             discretion of the Community Services Director and the City
                             Engineer, some of the improvements and facilities may be
                             phased to correspond with the phasing of neighborhoods. The
                             developer and Community Services and Engineering
                             Departments will coordinate on park planning and design.
                             Funding for capital improvement costs largely comes from park
                             in-lieu (Quimby Act) fees and special grants. To attain the
                             planned park and recreation system, the City will need to
                             evaluate and pursue alternative sources of funds, including
                             developer impact fees, concessions, sale or lease of surplus
                             land, grants, Redevelopment Agency funding, Certificates of
                             Participation, bonds, user group contributions, and others.
            Policy CS-1.6:   Pursue and expand joint use of public lands that are
                             available and suitable for recreational purposes, including
                             school district properties and flood control district, water
                             district, and other utility properties.

           Discussion: The City has identified a number of proposed park sites within
                       flood control areas or utility corridors in the community. The City
                       and utility providers can design these sites for joint use, or these
                       sites may ultimately be purchased when deemed as surplus land
                       by the utility district. This approach is particularly valuable in
                       developed areas of the City where parkland is deficient and
                       suitable vacant land is unavailable.
                       Schools represent an important opportunity for the City to
                       supplement the park and recreation system and meet existing
                       and future demands, particularly for game fields. The City should
                       consult with the school districts to help coordinate and support
                       joint use agreements between individual schools and sports
                       leagues.
       Policy CS-1.7:  Encourage public safety and compatibility with adjacent
                       uses through park location and design, including the
                       location of buildings, lighting, parking, public transit,
                       emergency access, and pedestrian/bicycle access.
           Discussion: The City prepares individual park master plans as new parks are
                       dedicated or acquired and developed. This process involves
                       close coordination with City staff and the developer in the proper
                       siting of a park and identification of park facilities. The objective is
                       to ensure that parks and their operations are “good neighbors” to
                       surrounding uses. The Recreation Needs and System
                       Recommendations Study has generally located future park sites
                       based on service areas to cover the community, which will be
                       used as one of the elements for locating future park sites. Issues
                       related to land use compatibility, housing orientation to a park
                       site, vehicular and pedestrian access, parking, the location of
                       various facilities, and lighting are addressed in a park master
                       plan. In addition, the parks planning effort addresses public
                       safety, police patrol, emergency access, and the needs of special
                       population groups and cultural interests.
       Policy CS-1.8:  Continue to build, renovate, and maintain parks in a manner
                       that is environmentally sustainable.
           Discussion: Pursuing methods to conserve energy and water resources and
                       using fertilizers that are non-toxic can help cut City costs, and are
                       also beneficial for the environment. These efforts are indicative of
                       the Healthy RC concepts that are inherent throughout the
                       General Plan.
       Policy CS-1.9:  Develop intermediate sized (10-12 acre) parks with lighted
                       athletic fields and appropriate parking to accommodate
                       community sports programs.
           Discussion: The demand for organized sports has grown and will continue to
                       grow into the future. Providing adequate and appropriate facilities
                       is important.

GOAL CS-2:        Provide high-quality Community Services programs and services
                  that provide opportunities for recreational, physical, and
                  educational activities for residents of all ages.
            Policy CS-2.1:   Integrate Healthy RC activities, classes, and programs with
                             recreational services that contribute to the health, fitness,
                             and minds of participants.
                 Discussion: Healthy RC is an important component of this General Plan
                             Update. Many of the Community Services programs and services
                             contribute significantly to Healthy RC, by benefiting minds and
                             bodies. Sports and recreational classes (e.g., sports classes and
                             leagues) allow for physical activities, which are related to a
                             Healthy Body. Education-related classes contribute to a Healthy
                             Mind.
            Policy CS-2.2:   Provide high-quality Community Services programs that are
                             flexible and responsive to the community’s changing needs.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga enjoys a high rate of residents participating
                             annually in City recreation programs. Active sports programs
                             continue to be the most popular. These include youth, teen, and
                             adult sports classes and leagues, as well as swimming and
                             fitness programs. The recreation programs and facilities are well
                             managed, and staff responds to community needs through a
                             variety of proactive methods.
            Policy CS-2.3:   Plan and conduct community special events that bring
                             residents together to create an enhanced quality of life and
                             promote economic development.
                 Discussion: This policy is aimed at continuing to promote and develop special
                             events that enrich the lives, celebrate and honor diversity, and
                             bring all residents together in Rancho Cucamonga. These events
                             can also attract residents from neighboring cities.
            Policy CS-2.4:   Continue to consult with non-profit sports organizations and
                             recreational groups to support their offering of diverse
                             recreational programs that complement and supplement
                             those of the City.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga’s numerous non-profit sports organizations
                             support organized sports leagues throughout the City. With a
                             high demand for sports fields, it is important to work with these
                             non-profit organizations and the school districts to ensure that
                             there is appropriate field space for all leagues and there are no
                             impacts to surrounding residential neighborhoods.
            Policy CS-2.5:   Continue to make community facilities and park amenities
                             available for rental by community residents, non-profit
                             groups, and businesses to meet their recreational and
                             business needs.

              Discussion: Community access to the City’s facilities and park amenities is
                          important to Rancho Cucamonga. One aspect of this policy is to
                          ensure that every individual, private business, and non-profit
                          group has equal access to utilize the City’s facilities.
         Policy CS-2.6:   Continue broad-based public outreach activities that inform
                          residents of all available Community Services programs and
                          services, and obtain input from the community regarding
                          program and service needs.
              Discussion: The Grapevine newsletter and City’s website, among other
                          sources, are important resources that inform the public about the
                          Community Services Department’s available programs and
                          classes.
GOAL CS-3:    Provide comprehensive and multi-faceted cultural arts programs
              and services that provide entertainment and educational
              opportunities to the Inland Valley region.
         Policy CS-3.1:   Continue to provide and enhance a variety of performing
                          arts productions at the Lewis Family Playhouse for all ages
                          and interests.
              Discussion: The Lewis Family Playhouse is the centerpiece for providing
                          cultural arts activities and programs in Rancho Cucamonga. The
                          City will work to continue and expand these services, and find
                          methods to market and generate community interest.
         Policy CS-3.2:   Produce performing and visual arts activities that will
                          stimulate the mind and intellectual thinking of community
                          members.
              Discussion: The visual and performing arts curriculum is integral to the overall
                          development of the mind. Whether it is performing art or visual
                          art, these performances and artworks can stimulate imagination,
                          provoke critical thinking, and elevate the human spirit for
                          residents of all ages, from school children to older adults.
         Policy CS-3.3:   Actively engage community members in arts activities, and
                          utilize the arts to provide educational and cultural awareness
                          opportunities to the community.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga is proud of offering diverse programs and
                          opportunities for community members. In addition to sports, a
                          balance of activities that nurture those that are creatively or
                          artistically inclined is important.
         Policy CS-3.4:   Provide opportunities for local artists to create and display
                          their work.
 
                                                                                       Community Services

                 Discussion: This policy helps cultivate local art talent by providing local artists
                             with venues and events for the visual arts. This policy advocates
                             providing a forum and outlet for artwork/artists that are inspired
                             by community art programs.
           Policy CS-3.5:    Support arts activities, programs, events, and facilities for
                             patrons to enjoy shared experiences and create a more
                             cohesive community, but also to enhance the economic
                             vitality of the City.
                 Discussion: Regionally attractive venues and large events draw people from
                             all over the Inland Empire and allow for sharing experiences that
                             help start conversations and discussions among those who
                             participate. Conversations and discussions can lead to
                             friendships and enhanced social interaction within the
                             community.
GOAL CS-4:        Provide integrated human services programs and activities for
                  community members.
            Policy CS-4.1:   Continue the effective operation of the RC Family Resource
                             Center, which offers human services referrals and activities
                             to families and individuals.
                 Discussion: The RC Family Resource Center provides valuable services for
                             those residents who are in need of social assistance. This policy
                             encourages and promotes the maintenance of these services.
            Policy CS-4.2:   Monitor and research the ever-changing human service
                             needs of the community, and develop action plans to
                             address those needs through partnerships with service
                             agencies.
                 Discussion: Continual growth of the City and changing population
                             demographics will require ever-changing human service
                             programming needs. Services that are responsive to specific
                             needs are necessary to ensure a healthy community.
           Policy CS-4.3:    Identify innovative funding and development opportunities
                             to support and sustain a responsive human services
                             network.
                 Discussion: Without financial resources, providing the expected level of
                             services is impossible. We must be creative in the way we seek
                             funds to expand the resource pool.
           Policy CS-4.4:    Encourage resident input and utilize demographic data,
                             partnerships, volunteers, and existing resources to meet
                             human service needs.

              Discussion: With resources limited, it is important to anticipate potential
                          needs early on to secure funding and resources. Utilizing
                          demographic information will allow for better choices and to
                          maximize resources.
         Policy CS-4.5:   Provide door-to-door transportation options for older adults
                          and residents with mobility challenges.
              Discussion: Many residents are unable to take advantage of community
                          services programs due to limited mobility. Whether this is
                          because of age or other issues, it is important to engage these
                          citizens and allow them to benefit from the opportunities
                          provided. The City shall continue to develop methods of providing
                          transportation with the “Silver Fox” program and other means.
GOAL CS-5:    Engage community individuals, organizations, and businesses in
              the on-going support of all Community Services programs and
              activities through fundraising, volunteerism, and partnerships.
         Policy CS-5.1:   Continue to offer and potentially expand volunteer and
                          fundraising opportunities.
              Discussion: Volunteering allows residents of all ages, particularly teenagers
                          and older adults to gain and share wonderful knowledge and
                          experience through the community services the City provides. At
                          the same time, volunteering benefits the City by providing low-
                          cost employee support that allows the City to expand its range of
                          services.
         Policy CS-5.2:   Continue and expand the development of community
                          partnerships to offer services to meet residents’ needs.
              Discussion: Involving the community (individuals, organizations, and
                          businesses) helps supplement programs and services offered by
                          the City.
         Policy CS-5.3:   Develop and implement Community Services programs and
                          activities that meet the needs of specialized populations
                          through the development of community partnerships.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga has provided special needs advisory groups
                          for population groups such as teens and older adults, “to have a
                          say” in the types of programs and services they want and need.
                          These focus groups should target members from non-profit
                          organizations, residents, and service providers. Input from these
                          groups shall provide guidance and direction in providing
                          community services programs and activities targeted toward any
                          special needs population.
         Policy CS-5.4:   Provide support for volunteer groups that conduct special
                          activities open to the entire community.

                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga has always taken pride in the high level of
                             participation by volunteer organizations to supplement services
                             and programs provided by the City. A well-coordinated plan to
                             partner with such organizations greatly enhances the ability to
                             deliver the necessary services.
           Policy CS-5.5:    Utilize nonprofit agencies to help recruit volunteers and
                             promote volunteer services.
                 Discussion: In partnership with nonprofit agencies, the City shall develop
                             outreach programs and networking opportunities so that
                             residents interested in volunteerism can find the appropriate
                             opportunity.
           Policy CS-5.6:    Continue to support and expand on the successful
                             fundraising of the Rancho Cucamonga Community
                             Foundation.
                 Discussion: The Rancho Cucamonga Community Foundation has been a
                             fruitful one for the City and should be expanded if possible. This
                             process has enhanced the capacity of the City to take advantage
                             of valuable corporate programs.
GOAL CS-6:        Provide a safe, comprehensive network of interconnecting off-
                  road trails with amenities that connect neighborhoods, parks,
                  schools, open space, employment areas, retail services, other
                  activity areas, and areas outside the City.
            Policy CS-6.1:   Provide a comprehensive, interconnected off-road trail
                             system that provides alternative mobility choices throughout
                             the entire City and increases connectivity.
                Discussion:  The implementation of a well-designed, interconnected system of
                             riding, bicycling, walking, and hiking trails throughout the
                             community continues to be a priority for residents. The desire to
                             have safe off-road access to local and regional parks, recreation
                             facilities, habitat preserves, national forest lands, and residential
                             and commercial areas is a priority. The desire to see the trail
                             system create a “country and rural atmosphere” through the
                             integration and design of a natural open space setting is
                             important. The Trails Implementation Plan is consistent with and
                             carries out the intent and vision of the General Plan with respect
                             to trails.
            Policy CS-6.2:   Connect trails in Rancho Cucamonga to trails in the San
                             Bernardino National Forest and other hillside open space
                             areas. These trails shall include trailheads with vehicle
                             parking and other amenities.

            Discussion:  The Citywide trail system incorporates planned public hiking and
                         riding trails, in addition to the many private trail easements within
                         the equestrian areas. The proposed backbone of the Citywide
                         trail system are regional trails that act as “long distance
                         connectors” to parks, scenic canyons, and other open spaces
                         surrounding Rancho Cucamonga. To create this backbone of
                         regional trails, trails in Rancho Cucamonga must connect to trails
                         in the San Bernardino National Forest, such as the 2.3-mile-long
                         Cucamonga Canyon trail.
       Policy CS-6.3:    Continue to incorporate, where feasible, regional and
                         community trails along utility corridors and drainage
                         channels.
            Discussion:  The network of utility corridors and drainage channels within
                         Rancho Cucamonga provide off-road north to south and east to
                         west trail opportunities citywide.
       Policy CS-6.4:    Continue to maintain and pursue the development of
                         planned trails and facilities for equestrian use within the
                         Equestrian/Rural Area designation.
             Discussion: The majority of north Alta Loma and Etiwanda, including the
                         Sphere of Influence area, is designated as an Equestrian/Rural
                         Area in the General Plan, Trails Implementation Plan, and
                         Development Code. The Area is characterized by larger single-
                         family lots intended for the keeping of horses and other animals.
                         Hiking and riding trails within this area should provide for
                         equestrian use where feasible, in accordance with the design
                         standards contained in the Trails Implementation Plan. In
                         particular, the City will require that residential lots within the
                         Equestrian/Rural Area include Local Feeder Trails at the rear of
                         lots, wherever feasible. Inclusion of equestrian trails outside the
                         Rural/Equestrian area may be necessary to allow for appropriate
                         trail connections.
       Policy CS-6.5:    Improve existing trails by removing barriers, applying
                         sustainability concepts, improving safety and function, and
                         providing access to adjacent trails.
             Discussion: When Rancho Cucamonga was incorporated, the City inherited
                         equestrian trails that were developed without consistent design
                         standards or proper connections between trail segments. The
                         Trails Implementation Plan includes a detailed listing of
                         recommended improvements to these older trails. The capital
                         improvement projects related to existing trails are reviewed as
                         part of the preparation of the City’s overall 5-Year Capital
                         Improvement Plan. Ensuring the maximum use and benefit of the
                         existing trail system is a long-range objective.
       Policy CS-6.6:    Require new development to provide access to adjacent
                         trails and provide appropriate trail amenities (e.g., benches,
                         drinking fountains, hitching posts, bike stands, and other
                         amenities) for all new projects located adjacent to regional
                         or community trails.
 
                                                                                       Community Services

                  Discussion: It is the City’s desire to enable trail users to stop at convenient
                              locations to either rest or exit from the trail and move into
                              commercial areas to shop, eat, or conduct business. The City’s
                              intent is to encourage commercial projects to provide trail
                              amenities on their site that would attract and accommodate trail
                              users. The City will continue to monitor access points from
                              unauthorized closures.
            Policy CS-6.7:    Continue to credit publicly accessible trail-way acreage
                              towards meeting parkland dedication standards.
                 Discussion:  Implementation of the planned Hiking and Riding Trails System is
                              a priority for the community. The City has therefore established
                              criteria for allowing development of a trail to be credited towards
                              a project’s parkland dedication requirements, subject to the
                              approval of the City Council.
GOAL CS-7:        Encourage healthy lifestyles for all Rancho Cucamonga residents.
            Policy CS-7.1:    Consider all opportunities to encourage community gardens
                              and similar community gathering places.
                 Discussion:  Community gardens can encourage social interaction and
                              bonding amongst those that share the gardens, can help produce
                              healthy “home-grown” foods, and can help in reducing a family’s
                              food budget. Community gardens can also provide a recreational
                              opportunity for those community members who enjoy gardening.
            Policy CS-7.2:    Provide all Rancho Cucamonga residents with convenient
                              access to healthy, locally grown fresh foods.
                 Discussion:  Through Development Code land-use amendments and
                              community partnerships, the City can encourage improved
                              access and availability to healthy food in the community.
            Policy CS-7.3:    Support the managed growth of complementary medical
                              facilities.
                 Discussion:  While there are no major medical facilities in Rancho
                              Cucamonga, the nearby San Antonio Community Hospital is
                              close enough to fulfill this need and serve a regional market.
                              Rancho Cucamonga would benefit from supporting the growth of
                              smaller, complementary medical facilities such as clinics, medical
                              offices, and medical laboratories to help provide more routine
                              medical services within the community.
            Policy CS-7.4:    Support the San Bernardino County Health System, and
                              local hospitals and clinics, in their efforts to offer a broad
                              array of healthcare services for Rancho Cucamonga.

              Discussion: The community has the support of many health care providers,
                          private and public, that respond to community care and health
                          needs. Although there are no San Bernardino County free clinics
                          or a major hospital within City boundaries, partnerships and
                          support of healthcare services will enhance health care services
                          in the community.
         Policy CS-7.5:   Provide public education regarding practices that promote
                          good health.
              Discussion: Public education and proactive prevention are the most effective
                          ways of deterring serious health problems. This policy will help
                          the City with awareness of health issues and will serve to instill
                          healthy practices in the daily lives of residents.
GOAL CS-8:    Continue to provide programs, activities, and services for older
              adults at the James L. Brulte Senior Center at Central Park.
         Policy CS-8.1:   Continue organizing and funding City-sponsored programs,
                          activities, and services for older adults at the James L.
                          Brulte Senior Center.
              Discussion: As the local population ages, it is vital that older adults have the
                          opportunity for good mental and physical health. The City takes
                          great pride in its state-of-the-art Senior Center, which has
                          become the community hub for all activities focusing on older
                          adults.
         Policy CS-8.2:   Continue reaching out to inform older adults in the
                          community of programs, activities, and services offered at
                          the James L. Brulte Senior Center.
              Discussion: The Senior Center provides a wide range of programs meeting
                          the needs of a diverse population. However, the system only
                          works when there are adequate levels of participation. It is
                          imperative to constantly reach out to older adults and inform them
                          of the many programs available to them.
         Policy CS-8.3:   Consult with older adults in the community to develop
                          programs, activities, and services that are responsive to
                          their needs and wants.
              Discussion: The needs of older adults is changing and evolving. The best way
                          to deliver the appropriate services is by engaging potential users
                          in the development of programs, activities, and services and
                          continuing the Senior Advisory Committee.

Introduction
In real estate, it is said that location is everything. Rancho Cucamonga residents are    Chapter 6:
proud of their City’s favorable location and setting, and its diverse environment. The    Resource Conservation
City features views of picturesque snow-topped mountain peaks, foothill canyons
flowing with creeks and streams, open spaces with natural habitat blanketing the          This Chapter consists of the
foothills, and a few vineyards and citrus groves that serve as a reminder of the          following sections:
agricultural heritage of the region.                                                        Open Space Resources
Contained within this environment are valuable natural resources. For example,              Mineral Resources

                                                                                            Agricultural & Cultural
and alluvial fans from the mouths of the canyons have supplied mineral resources.
                                                                                              Resources

      Achieving Our Vision
      The vision for Rancho Cucamonga includes the preservation and conservation of
      natural resources that comprise the local environment. These natural resources
      include open spaces, water resources, energy, and wildlife. The City of Rancho
      Cucamonga’s vision for resource conservation is reflected in the following Spirit of
      Rancho Cucamonga Guiding Principles:
      The Spirit of Community
          Through programs such as Healthy RC, we inspire a lifestyle that embraces a
             Healthy Mind, Body and Earth. We support lifelong learning and enrichment,
             active and healthy living, and environmental sustainability. These values are
             reflected in our programs and facilities for our residents and businesses. The
             high quality of services the City provides strengthens community bonds and
             contributes to healthy lifestyles.
      The Spirit of Heritage
          We promote the use of citrus and vineyard plantings to remind us of our
             agricultural past.
            Our outstanding views of the mountains, the varied natural topography of the
             area, and the trails that allow us to access these open spaces are an asset
             and must be preserved.
      The Spirit of Leadership
          We have a strong dedication to community planning. The quality of our built
             environment is by design. Our government leads by example. We are
             committed to achieving higher standards for community development,
             architecture, and landscaping. Our streetscapes reflect the high-quality
             development that we demand while embracing the concept of water
             conservation and ease of maintenance.
            We promote sustainable neighborhood and building design.
      The Spirit of Tomorrow
          Rancho Cucamonga will lead the way to a healthy environment. We are
             committed to environmental sustainability, which means meeting the needs of
             the present while conserving the ability of future generations to do the same.
            We are dedicated to a sustainable balance in land use patterns (residential,
             business, educational, agricultural, recreational, open space, and historic
             uses) and supporting transportation.
            We are proactive in the design and use of lands within our Sphere of
             Influence, being vigilant in maintaining open space wherever possible.

Open Space Resources
Open space is defined as any parcel or area of land that is essentially unimproved
and devoted to uses such as natural resource preservation, managed production of
resources, outdoor recreation, and public health and safety. Open spaces can be
found throughout the City. Natural open spaces are primarily located in the hillsides
and Sphere of Influence areas of the City, while urban open spaces, such as
developed parks and open plazas can be found in the built areas of the City.
Preservation of open space benefits environmental sustainability and promotes the
Healthy RC Initiative. Open space allows the recharge of groundwater basins, which
provide a clean source of water for everyday use to the Rancho Cucamonga
community. Open space provides plentiful opportunities for recreational activities
such as hiking and bird watching as well as areas of scientific and educational value.
Preservation of open space serves to protect views and retain a connection to our
environmental and cultural history. Open space also provides protection from natural
hazards such as flooding and wildland fires. And finally, open space is not just limited
to the hillsides; within the urban area, open space provides softening and contrast to
the built environment, active and passive recreational opportunities, view corridors,
and general enhancement of the overall visual quality of the City.
Established Open Space Areas
Approximately 31 percent, or 8,224 acres, of the Planning Area is devoted to open
space, including parks, undeveloped parcels, conservation areas, and flood
control/utility corridors, as shown in Figure RC-1: Open Space and Conservation
Plan. Hillside Residential and Very Low-density Residential areas (two dwelling units
or less per acre) also contribute to the rural character within the northern portion of
the City and Sphere of Influence area (see Chapter 2, Figure LU-1: Land Use Plan).
Open space in Rancho Cucamonga provides the following benefits:
          Open Space: Preservation of Natural Resources. In an effort to protect
           wildlife and biological resources within Rancho Cucamonga, conservation
           areas have been established in Rancho Cucamonga’s Planning Area.
           These conservation areas are intended to protect the alluvial fan sage
           scrub habitat and the wildlife it supports by preserving open space land in
           its natural state. See the Wildlife Resources section (page RC-26) in this
           Chapter for more information regarding conservation areas and protection
           of wildlife resources.
          Open Space: Managed Protection of Natural Resources. Open space
           areas and expansive spreading grounds allow the recharge of groundwater
           basins, which are a critical resource for the Cucamonga Valley Water
           District. These areas need to be protected because the Cucamonga Valley
           Water District obtains a large portion of its water supply from the
           groundwater basins. Rancho Cucamonga’s Sphere of Influence also has
           limited aggregate resources (sand and gravel), which are found in alluvial
           fans at the opening of canyons. These are important resources to the
           construction industry from which Rancho Cucamonga and the region have
           greatly benefited. However, this resource must be properly managed so
           that we can protect important habitat areas, allow for appropriate
           redevelopment, and avoid future land use conflicts. See the Mineral
           Resources section (page RC-8) in this Chapter for more information.

              Open Space: Outdoor Recreation. Rancho Cucamonga has developed
               hundreds of acres of parks and recreational areas in the City. These range
               from large community parks that offer sports activities and extensive, passive
               open space areas to smaller neighborhood parks that offer neighborhood-
               scale amenities. These diverse outdoor recreational opportunities are an
               important component of Rancho Cucamonga’s quality of life. See Chapter 5:
               Community Services for more information regarding parks and special use
               facilities.
               The North Etiwanda Preserve, which functions as a conservation area for the
               protection of wildlife habitat, also serves as an outdoor recreation area that
               allows for hiking, bird watching, and enjoyment of the natural outdoors.
               Residents can explore the natural environment while learning about
               important natural resources that need to be preserved and protected on the
               County Regional Trail.
              Open Space: Public Health and Safety. Rancho Cucamonga is susceptible
               to many natural hazards, including wildland fires, earthquakes, mudslides,
               and flooding. Physical conditions in Rancho Cucamonga such as earthquake
               fault zones, landslide areas, and steeply sloped hillsides present additional
               danger to the general community. Open space can help mitigate this danger
               by prohibiting development within hazard areas. Although the need to allow
               property owners viable use of their lands may prevent total prohibition of
               development in areas with known hazards, attention to and mitigation of
               these hazards will be required to protect residents’ health and safety. See
               Chapter 8: Public Health and Safety for more information regarding natural
               hazards.
      Open Space in Urban Areas
      Open space within the urban areas of Rancho Cucamonga serves many purposes.
      Parks are the most evident forms of urban open space, but public plazas, parkways,
      tree-lined streets, and school fields also contribute to urban open space. All of these
      assets add to the quality of life for Rancho Cucamonga neighborhoods and
      commercial areas. Additionally, open space in urban areas can remedy certain
      environmental issues. For example, open spaces can mitigate stormwater and urban
      runoff, with permeable surfaces that allow for precipitation to nourish landscaping.
      Open space and vegetation can also help absorb air pollution, reduce the “urban
      heat island” effect, and create urban habitats for regional fauna. The reinvigoration of
      natural ecosystems through the use of open spaces can provide economic,
      environmental, and social benefits to Rancho Cucamonga residents.
      Open space is also a critical ingredient in the success of private development of all
      types: residential, office, commercial, and industrial. Victoria Gardens is a good
      example: its large outdoor urban plazas are places where many community events
      can be held, and where residents can congregate and socialize. Moreover, several
      commercial and residential developments include small vineyard plots as a
      landscaping amenity that is both aesthetic and functional. These spaces become a
      public asset everyone can enjoy, though privately owned and maintained.

Open Space Plan
The General Plan seeks to ensure that quality open spaces are an integral part of
new development. Rancho Cucamonga already has a reputation for conveying a
sense of openness through rigorous development standards, streetscape treatment,
and design specifications. This Chapter builds on those efforts and expands those
commitments that have led to that cherished reputation.
Rancho Cucamonga recognizes that open space land is a limited and valuable
resource that must be preserved wherever possible. Quality open space provides
many benefits including recreation, scenic beauty, protection of natural resources,
and the continued availability of land for groundwater recharge. One of the primary
challenges the City faces is how to preserve and enhance an open space system
that does not solely consist of the unusable spaces left over from development. Strict
adherence to the City’s design standards must be observed.
The General Plan intends to conserve important remnants of the City’s agricultural
heritage, as well as preserve significant visual resources, sensitive habitats, lands
important for water resources, and recreational spaces. In addition, open space
planning must recognize other environmentally sensitive lands, such as those subject
to natural hazards. For these reasons, the General Plan includes policies and
implementing actions that address potential conflicts between urban and non-
urbanized uses. The aim of these policies and actions is to seek long-term protection
of areas containing sensitive habitat and other environmental constraints. The Open
Space and Conservation Plan presented in Figure RC-1 represents the synthesis of
these issues into an overall mapped scheme.
The importance of open space and the conservation of resources is directly reflected
in the Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic Resources Chapter. The
Plan includes numerous land use policies that reinforce the desire to preserve and
carefully manage the open space and conservation resources that the City is
committed to support.

      Mineral Resources
      The Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) mandates the
      classification of valuable lands that are subject to urban expansion or other
      irreversible actions in order to protect mineral resources in the State. SMARA also
      allows the State to designate lands containing mineral deposits of regional or
      statewide significance. The California Geological Survey (CGS) has identified a
      number of areas as significant aggregate resources throughout the City and Sphere
      of Influence.
      Sand and gravel are necessary ingredients for urban construction, and it is
      advantageous for builders to have a local source for these materials. However, the
      extraction of aggregate, like most surface mining, impacts the surrounding
      environment and can adversely impact adjacent planned land uses, as well as
      sensitive habitat areas. Consequently, land uses in proximity to planned resource
      extraction areas must be carefully considered to minimize potential conflicts.
      Mineral Resource Areas
      There are four coalescing alluvial fans in or near the City, comprising a significant
      local sand and gravel resource. From west to east these alluvial fans are known as
      the San Antonio, Cucamonga, Deer Creek, and Day Creek fans. To organize the
      classification of aggregate resources, the State utilizes the concept of “sectors” to
      identify those areas that meet eligibility guidelines for designation as having regional
      or statewide significance. Five sectors (C-1, C-2, D-1, D-1, and D-16) are located in
      the Claremont-Upland Production-Consumption Region. Two Sectors (A-4 and A-7)
      are located in the San Bernardino Production-Consumption Region (see Figure RC-2
      and Table RC-1).
      The CGS has calculated that the Claremont-Upland Production-Consumption Region
      will require 240 million tons of construction aggregate to fulfill local building demands
      through the year 2056. As of 2007, remaining resources in the Region total
      approximately 451 million tons. Remaining reserves, including property owned or
      leased for which permission for extraction has been granted, total approximately 121
      million tons.1 The San Bernardino Production-Consumption Region will require 1.1
      billion tons of construction aggregate to fulfill local building demands through the year
      2057. As of 2008, remaining resources in the Region total approximately six billion
      tons, of which 287 million tons have been permitted to be extracted.2
      Approximately 2,422 acres of potential aggregate resources are located within the
      Planning Area.

       The majority of this acreage is planned for Open Space, Conservation, Flood
       Control/Utility Corridor, or Hillside Residential, which represents a very low-density of
       development. As of 2009, approximately 437 acres of the sectors in the Planning
       Area have been developed; residences have been built, as well as a high school.
       Consequently, land use conflicts between residential uses and possible aggregate
       extraction is likely to occur in the City, particularly as residential use increases. To
       minimize conflicts with planned land use and sensitive habitat areas, the City will
       need to work with the County of San Bernardino to coordinate review of any potential
       aggregate operation in the Sphere of Influence.
       The Sphere of Influence currently contains a rock crushing plant located within the
       Day Creek area, which is the only active aggregate operation in the Planning Area.
       The area located within the County Flood Control District property is not subject to
       current or future mining operations. The long-term objective is to develop the area in
       a sensitive manner adhering to the City’s development and public safety standards.
       Mineral Resources Strategy
       The State has implemented a program whereby areas designated as mineral deposit
       zones of regional and statewide significance are to be conserved where possible.
       However, land within those State-designated areas can be used for mining or other
       land uses at the discretion of local governments. Further, cities and counties are
       responsible for establishing policies and programs for the management of land uses
       in and around designated mineral deposit zones. The Surface Mining and
       Reclamation Act does require that local jurisdictions submit written justification to the
       CGS for the termination of the State’s designation of a significant aggregate resource
       area.
       Aggregate deposits available for recovery within the Rancho Cucamonga Planning
       Area may be limited due to conflicts between urban development, access, and the
       nature of typical surface mining operations.
       The City has determined that urban uses shall have a priority over aggregate
       recovery in areas not already disturbed by such activities. Development will be
       subject to the City’s development standards and public safety objectives. The City will
       also seek the removal of areas planned for urban use from SMARA maps. Mineral
       resource areas may offer some intrinsic open space value but are not scenic when
       under active operation, and typically result in substantial landform alteration. State
       regulations do, however, require that all operators have an approved plan for the
       reclamation of mineral resource production areas once the resources are exhausted.
       While it is important to conserve mineral resource areas that have been determined
       to be of regional significance, the City will be sensitive to the potential impacts and
       conflicts that may result from such conservation in some areas of the City and
       Sphere of Influence.

Agricultural and Cultural
Resources
Agricultural Heritage
Like many Southern California communities, Rancho Cucamonga has a rich
agricultural past. Founders of the Etiwanda Colony, the Chaffey Brothers, engineered
transport of water from the mountain canyons through irrigation tunnels. Good
climate and an abundant water supply allowed early pioneers to develop successful
agricultural lands. The area’s characteristic rocky soils were particularly good for the
agricultural crops, which included citrus, olives, peaches and grapes. Evidence of the
City’s agricultural industry can still be found within the Alta Loma, Cucamonga, and
Etiwanda areas of the City through remnant vineyards, citrus groves, olive groves,
and support structures. Citrus and olive groves have been retained through creative
planning where new residences are built within the grove, and trees are retained in
accordance with the terms of the City’s development approvals.
Over 30 years ago, the City recognized that agricultural lands were being lost as a
result of development pressures, and the loss was changing the community
character. In 1983, the City prepared the Etiwanda Specific Plan, which exemplifies a
balanced approach to preserving the City’s agricultural heritage and protecting the
rural character of the area while allowing for new, compatible development.
Although the entire City was once an agricultural area, few large areas remain in
active production today. The goal of land use planning for the future is to provide an
adequate supply of appropriately designated and suitably located land that will
accommodate anticipated urban growth. The continuation of agricultural activities in
proximity to planned residential uses can result in conflicts and incompatibilities that
are not easily managed.
In an effort to revive agricultural production of vineyards on a much smaller scale,
private local vintners have developed a unique approach in planting new vineyards
on private properties. These vineyards are usually in front of commercial or office
businesses, or in the common landscaped areas of new residential development.
Although their acreage is small, the vineyards provide attractive landscaping for new
developments, and most importantly, provide a reminder to the community of its
successful past when fields of grapes dominated the landscape. Secondarily, the
vineyards may provide some viable production of grape yields for local vintners.
                                                                                      Small grape vineyard on

       Agricultural Resources
       The California Department of Conservation prepares and maintains a system that
       maps and monitors the status of agricultural land resources throughout the State.
       This program is known as the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program.
       Information is updated on a two-year cycle. Based on the most recent information
       available from the Department of Conservation (2008), approximately 209 acres of
       undeveloped land within the Planning Area are designated as agricultural lands of
       some level of significance. This does not mean that these areas are or have been in
       agricultural production, but that they contain quality soils for agricultural production.
       Areas located within the City and Sphere of Influence that are identified as Important
       Farmland by the Department of Conservation are summarized in Table RC-2. This
       table also identifies the General Plan land uses proposed for these areas. Farmland
       designations are defined by the State as follows:
              Prime Farmland. Land with the best combination of physical and soil features
               for the production of agricultural crops.
              Farmland of Statewide Importance. Land with a good combination of
               physical and soil features for the production of agricultural crops.
              Unique Farmland. Land of lesser quality soils used for the production of the
               State’s leading agricultural cash crops.
              Farmland of Local Importance. Lands that include areas of soils meeting all
               the characteristics of Prime, Statewide, or Unique, but which are not irrigated.
               This category also includes lands not covered by the above categories that are
               considered of high economic importance to the community.
       Concentrations of Important Farmland are sparsely located in the southern and
       eastern parts of the City. The southern portion of the City is, however, primarily
       characterized by industrial, residential, and commercial land uses. Important
       Farmland in eastern Rancho Cucamonga is concentrated in Etiwanda; these
       farmland areas were designated by the Department of Conservation due to their local
       historical importance. However, most of the Etiwanda area is planned for
       development, and is not intended to be retained as farmland. The western portion of
       the City has little or no designated Important Farmland. The northern portion of the
       Planning Area, within the Sphere of Influence, has been designated as grazing land
       and is planned for Open Space, Conservation, and Low-Density Residential use.

Cultural Resources
Based on a records search conducted for the City by the San Bernardino County
Museum, previous geologic mapping of the Planning Area indicates that soils and
geologic formations within the Planning Area have a low potential to contain
significant paleontological resources. The City will continue to screen development
proposals in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental
Quality Act, and will require the research of any site that may be determined to have
potential resources. Should any resources be discovered, the City will take
appropriate measures in accordance with existing laws to ensure the proper handling
and preservation of artifacts.
Having recently undergone the rapid population growth characteristic of many cities
in the Inland Empire, Rancho Cucamonga has lost much of the agricultural land that
once characterized the area. This expansion has also led to the loss of historic
resources. As it is a goal of the General Plan to determine the best path for future
growth, it is appropriate to consider how the City’s historic resources, including non-
architectural resources such as historic landscapes, will be preserved as urban
growth and change continue. The goals and policies related to this issue are
discussed in detail in the Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic
Resources Chapter (Chapter 2).
Water Resources
The story of water delivery to the Rancho Cucamonga area started during the
founding of the Etiwanda Colony by the Chaffey Brothers. The brothers were the first
in Southern California to develop hydroelectric current for lighting, the first to
successfully operate a mutual water district (the Etiwanda Water Company in 1882),
and the first to lay underground pipes for water distribution and agricultural irrigation.
Today, water is still collected from the same canyon sources that the Chaffey
Brothers used. As Rancho Cucamonga grows, however, additional water will be
needed to meet demand. Affected by growth within the State and by global warming,
the availability of a plentiful supply of water is in doubt. Unless water efficiency
initiatives are undertaken, Rancho Cucamonga could face stunted economic
development in the future due to insufficient water supply.
This section examines Rancho Cucamonga’s water supply and the challenges that
face future planning efforts, opportunities for water conservation, and the importance
of water quality.
Water Supply
The Cucamonga Valley Water District (CVWD) is the sole water provider for Rancho
Cucamonga. The District’s service area encompasses the entire City of Rancho
Cucamonga, the City’s Sphere of Influence and, in addition, portions of Fontana,
Ontario, and Upland.
The majority of CVWD’s water comes from two sources: imported water from the               Water infrastructure is
Metropolitan Water District (MWD) and groundwater from the Chino and Cucamonga             discussed further in
Basins. Other sources include local surface and sub-surface water flows and                Chapter 7: Public Facilities
recycled water. As of 2007, 5 percent of the District’s supply came from local canyon      and Infrastructure under the
surface runoff water, 35 percent from groundwater, and 60 percent from imported            Infrastructure section.

       water purchases. In 2030, only 3 percent will come from surface runoff water and 27
       percent will come from imported water purchases; groundwater sources will increase
       to 42 percent, and an additional 20 percent will come from recycled water sources.
       An additional 8 percent will come from water conservation measures. Recycled water
       is expected to contribute significantly to CVWD’s future water supply. Table RC-3
       identifies the acre-feet per year for each of the water supply sources over a 20-year
       period.
       Imported Water
       The CVWD has access to imported water through the Metropolitan Water District
       (MWD). MWD’s water supply comes from two sources: State Water Project water
       from Silverwood Lake, and Colorado River water from Lake Matthews. The amount of
       water that can be utilized by the CVWD is not limited by contract. However, the
       hydraulic capacity of the MWD delivery system restricts the amount of imported water
       that can be obtained by CVWD. This water is treated at CVWD’s Lloyd W. Michael
       Water Treatment Plant. The treated water flows into storage reservoirs and then into
       the distribution system.

       Groundwater
       The Cucamonga and Chino Basins provide groundwater to the CVWD. Both basins
       are currently replenished by natural precipitation and through a number of spreading
       grounds and percolation basins. The Chino Basin has been the District’s predominant
       groundwater source, and is expected to provide 85 percent of the total groundwater
       pumped by the CVWD and 67 percent of the total water supply in 2010.

The Chino Basin is separated from the Cucamonga Basin by the Red Hill Fault,
which underlies the southern portion of the District’s service area. In 1975,
groundwater rights were established through the Chino Basin judgment. Based on
this judgment, the District’s maximum annual groundwater pumping right is limited to
approximately 3,620 acre-feet per year, which amounts to six percent of the basin’s
estimated safe yield of approximately 54,835 acre-feet per year. The District’s
maximum annual groundwater volume is the amount that it can extract each year
without replenishment obligation.
A majority of the Cucamonga Basin underlies the northern portion of the District’s
service area. Groundwater pumped from the Cucamonga Basin is limited by a 1958
Superior Court judgment to approximately 15,470 acre-feet per year. The sustainable
yield of the Cucamonga Basin is estimated to be approximately 19,100 acre-feet per
year. The groundwater the District pumps from the Cucamonga and Chino Basins is
then pumped through a system of wells, disinfected, and ultimately moved directly
into enclosed reservoirs. Upon demand, the water either flows by gravity or is
pumped from the reservoirs into the distribution system.
Open space allows the recharging of groundwater basins and assists with stormwater
management. Locally, the Cucamonga Spreading Grounds, Day Creek Spreading
Grounds, Etiwanda Spreading Grounds, and the San Sevaine Spreading Grounds
allow rainwater and snow runoff to recharge the Cucamonga and Chino Basins.
Sustainable management of the groundwater supply includes protection of these
spreading grounds to maintain a balance between groundwater recharge and
withdrawal. Given the declining water supply from surface runoff and imported
supplies, the spreading grounds will become even more important in the future as the
CVWD looks to groundwater basins as a large source for its water supply.
Local Canyon Runoff
Four local canyon watersheds in the San Gabriel Mountains north of the City supply
water through runoff (surface and subsurface flows) to the CVWD: Cucamonga
Canyon, Deer Canyon, Day Canyon, and the East Etiwanda Canyon Watersheds.
Two smaller watershed areas, Demens and Hermosa, are located just south of
Cucamonga and Deer Canyon, but are not included in CVWD’s analysis of
developable water due to their limited water supply. Water supply from local
watersheds fluctuates annually based on weather conditions. CVWD has acquired
surface and subsurface water rights in each of the watersheds. See Figure RC-3:
Water Resources, for the location and size of the four major watersheds.
The San Sevaine Canyon watershed area has also been identified in Figure RC-3.
The San Sevaine Canyon watershed area serves the San Sevaine Spreading
Grounds and Basin, which replenishes groundwater in the Chino Basin. While CVWD
has secured water rights to the Chino Basin, the District does not have water rights to
local canyon runoff in the San Sevaine Canyon watershed.
All of the watersheds are part of the larger Santa Ana River Watershed. Water from
these sources is treated at the District’s Arthur H. Bridge or Royer Nesbit Water
Treatment Plants. After treatment, the water is stored in enclosed reservoirs ready for
distribution to consumers.
Recycled Water
Recycled water has become an important resource for Rancho Cucamonga and will
become increasingly important as other sources of water become less reliable and
more costly. Recycled water is former wastewater that has been treated to remove
solids and certain impurities, and is available for non-potable water uses.

                            The Inland Empire Utilities Agency provides disinfected tertiary-treated recycled
                            water from its treatment plant in Chino to the cities of Chino, Chino Hills, Ontario,
                            Fontana, Montclair, Upland, and Rancho Cucamonga. Recycled water uses include,
                            but are not limited to, landscaping irrigation (schools, parks, medians, and golf
                            courses), industrial processes, groundwater recharge, fire suppression, dust control,
                            cooling towers and toilet flushing. CVWD has been implementing capital
                            improvement projects to increase the supply of recycled water for use in the City.
                            Integrating recycled water into the overall water supply will help avoid future water
                            shortages. Use of recycled water is a viable and long-term sustainable strategy to
                            become less reliant on imported water sources. In the coming years, the use of
                            recycled water could supplement the drinking water supply in order to provide a total
                            water supply that meets the needs of over 10,000 homes in the CVWD service area.
                            By 2030, recycled water will provide at least 20 percent of the CVWD’s total water
                            supply.

                            In early 2009, California was struggling through its third consecutive year of drought
        Efficient landscape and the Governor declared a State Emergency. This has been a reminder that it is

                            crucial that Rancho Cucamonga carefully plan for its water resources, and provide an
      section of Chapter 2: adequate and sustainable water supply to serve the needs of its water users. To
      Managing Land Use,    meet this goal, reduced water consumption through aggressive implementation of

       Historic Resources.
                            Water conservation represents a cost-effective and environmentally sound way to
                            reduce current and future water demand and energy usage. Homeowners and
                            business owners can take many actions to reduce water use, such as using water-
                            conserving fixtures and appliances, fixing leaks, planting drought-tolerant
                            landscaping, and avoiding unnecessary water use.
                            In an effort to reduce the amount of water that must be obtained from regional and
                            local sources, CVWD has initiated aggressive efforts to conserve water by all Rancho
                            Cucamonga customers. Water conservation is an integral part of sustainably
                            ensuring the long-term reliability of the water supply. Water conservation is
                            anticipated to account for an additional eight percent of the total water supply over
                            the next 20 years. That number could increase significantly if all consumers
                            implement water conservation strategies.
                            The City, in cooperation with CVWD, is educating water consumers on the
                            importance of water conservation in order to extend available water supplies.
                            Additional benefits of water conservation include a reduction in energy consumption,
                            compensation for system deficiencies, and reduction in wastewater flows, with
                            associated reduction of impacts on planned population growth. The CVWD’s water
                            conservation program includes encouraging customers to landscape with native
                            California species and other drought-tolerant plants. Prominent among City practices
                            to conserve water is its Water Efficiency Program for public and private landscaped
                            areas.

permeable surfaces that allow water to percolate into the water table for natural
groundwater recharge. As development occurs, permeable surface area and
groundwater recharge decreases. This also contributes to increased volumes and
velocities of surface runoff, which also affect water quality. In addition, urbanization
introduces a host of potential contaminants that can be carried into the water supply.
Control of urban runoff is an important preventive measure to avoid contamination of
both surface and groundwater supplies. Compliance with National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements can help to improve the quality
of runoff, thereby maintaining water quality and diminishing the need for extra
treatment of runoff at the treatment plants prior to its release downstream. For more
information regarding stormwater quality, see Chapter 7: Public Facilities and
Infrastructure. Other solutions could include landscaped and/or vegetated swales and
parking lot drainages, which would protect existing riparian surfaces and wetlands,
and permeable surfaces, where appropriate.

                            Residents of Rancho Cucamonga enjoy a quality of life that is in large part made
                            possible by the consumption of energy resources. In this respect, the City is no
                            different from similar communities. The direct and indirect consumption of energy
                            pervades all aspects of daily life. To maintain and enhance that quality of life, City

                            Land Use and Transportation
                            Rancho Cucamonga understands that reductions in automobile usage and vehicle
                            miles traveled (VMT) will lower energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
                            (GHG) as well as provide public health benefits, and that substantial VMT reductions
                            are necessary to achieve environmental sustainability. As a result, Rancho

                            Renewable Energy Resources
                            Renewable energy sources capture energy from natural processes such as sunlight,
                            wind, flowing water, biological processes, and geothermal heat flows. Nuclear power
                            and the use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are not considered
                            renewable energy sources.
                            Renewable energy resources may be used directly or used to create other, more
                            convenient forms of energy. Examples of direct use include passive solar design and
                            geothermal or ground source heat pumps for heating and cooling. Examples of
                            indirect use are electricity generation through photovoltaic cells (solar panels) and
                            wind turbines, or the production of fuels such as ethanol from biomass.

Utilizing the Sun
Rancho Cucamonga is fortunate to have plentiful sunshine throughout the year and
an abundance of residential, office, and industrial and warehouse buildings with
extensive roof surfaces on which solar panels can be mounted. Several industrial
buildings already have roof-mounted solar panels. Although solar panels may require
substantial initial investments, large rebates and tax incentives are available, and the
use of such technologies can provide substantial long-term financial benefits.
Southern California Edison (SCE) has recently launched the nation’s largest solar
panel installation project to place 250 megawatts (MW) of photovoltaic systems on 65
million square feet of Southern California commercial and industrial building roofs–
enough power to serve approximately 162,000 homes. SCE is focused on installing
solar panels on buildings located in the Inland Empire, including Rancho
Cucamonga.
In addition to solar panels, new and existing development can incorporate other
technologies and design techniques to take advantage of the sun’s energy to reduce
reliance on nonrenewable energy resources. For example, the use of passive solar
design and solar domestic hot water and pool heating systems can reduce the
demand for electricity. Deciduous trees planted at strategic locations to provide
summer shade can reduce cooling costs. In the winter, when leaves have dropped,
sunlight provides natural heat that then helps reduce heating costs. New
developments can orient buildings and windows to minimize or maximize solar
exposure for natural lighting and passive heating and cooling. These methods are
simple examples of how passive solar design integrates a combination of building
features to reduce or even eliminate the need for mechanical cooling and heating,
and artificial daytime lighting.

Utilizing the Wind
Modern wind turbines capture the wind to generate electricity. Wind turbines are one
of the fastest growing and most cost-effective renewable energy sources, and are
producing power across the United States. The vast majority of this power is
produced from large-scale wind farms. Unfortunately, there is insufficient harvestable
wind in most areas of Rancho Cucamonga, with the possible exception of the
canyons, to support the cost effective use of small or large scale wind farming.

       Green Buildings
       Green (sustainable) building is a design approach and philosophy that focuses on
       minimizing a building’s negative impacts on both the environment and building
       occupants. Green strategies can be incorporated into the entire life cycle of a
       building; these strategies are highly consistent with the Healthy RC Initiative that
       promotes a Healthy Mind, Body, and Earth.
       Green buildings provide many tangible benefits including improved worker
       productivity, recruitment and retention, minimized energy and water costs,
       construction and operations waste minimization, and pollution prevention. This
       integrated, interdisciplinary approach to design and construction promotes
       investments in energy- and resource-efficient materials, technology, and the use of
       low emitting and recycled content materials, and is characterized by the following:
             Healthy buildings and sustainable building design aim to create buildings that
              are not harmful to their occupants or to the larger environment and help
              improve employee productivity. An important emphasis is on indoor
              environmental quality, especially indoor air quality.
             Low-impact materials are used, such as non-toxic, sustainably produced,
              and recycled building and construction materials that require little energy to
              process.
             Quality and durability are valued, leading to longer-lasting and better-
              functioning products that will have to be replaced less frequently, reducing the
              impacts of producing replacements.
             Design for re-use and recycling involves planning for products, processes,
              and systems that take into consideration, and are designed for, performance in
              a commercial “afterlife.”
             Design impact measures minimize environmental footprints and encourage
              the use of life cycle assessment when making design and purchasing
              decisions.
             Renewability recommends that materials should come from nearby (local or
              regional), sustainably managed renewable sources that can be composted
              when their usefulness has been exhausted.
       Green Building Strategy
       In 1978, California established the Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and
       Nonresidential Buildings (Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations) in
       response to a legislative mandate to reduce California's energy consumption. These
       standards, which apply to all new construction in California, are updated periodically
       to allow consideration and possible incorporation of new energy efficiency
       technologies and methods. The latest update was released in 2008, with additional
       standards to be released in 2010. All standards in Title 24, Part 6 must be followed
       as part of the City’s building permit process.

LEED®
The LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating
Systems™ is an internationally recognized green building certification system,
providing third-party verification that a building was designed and built using
strategies aimed at improving performance across all the sustainability metrics that
matter most: energy savings, water efficiency, CO2 emissions reduction, improved
indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources.
Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), LEED provides building
owners and operators with a framework for identifying and implementing practical
and measurable green building design, construction, operations, and maintenance
solutions. LEED projects typically exceed the standards set forth in Title 24 or
anything else in the Building Code. LEED uses a rating system that classifies the
level of green building design by using a checklist based on a point accrual system.
The more points that are accrued, the higher the rating applied to a building. LEED-
certified buildings are designed to:
        Lower operating costs and increase asset value
        Reduce waste sent to landfills

California Green Builder (CGB) and Build-It-Green (BIG)
The California Green Builder (CGB) program created by the Building Industry
Institute encourages voluntary partnerships between builders and local governments
to build cost-effective, green homes that benefit homebuyers and the community.
This program features homes that annually save thousands of kilowatts of energy,
thousands of gallons of water, and acres of trees. This process allows for
documentable recordation, which is important for local officials who must record
greenhouse gas emissions and water conservation efforts. California Green Builder
homebuyers benefit from lower energy costs while their home creates less impact on
the environment.
The Build-It-Green (BIG) program is a membership supported non-profit organization
formed in 2003. Its mission is to promote healthy, energy- and resource-efficient
homes in California. The organization provides a comprehensive package of local
government support, professional training, collaboration forums, consumer education,
and green product marketing to a range of stakeholders.
City Process: LEED Certified Equivalent, CGB, and BIG
In an effort to balance the costs and benefits of the LEED system, Rancho
Cucamonga is proposing to implement a choice of the California Green Builder
(CGB) or Build-It-Green (BIG) program for single-family homes or multi-unit homes
(three stories or less), and a LEED Certified Equivalent system for all other

       development, provided the minimum requirements are met. This system would be
       similar to the LEED system, however, building certification would be handled by
       appropriately trained City staff rather than a third-party reviewer. City staff would
       implement a LEED Certified Equivalent System designed specifically for the City,
       reflecting its specific needs and priorities. An equivalent certification checklist would
       be implemented as well. This type of certification process would provide flexibility and
       allow City staff to modify details of the LEED program or the CGB and BIG process,
       and promote greener buildings as the ultimate outcome.
       All projects subject to the LEED Certified Equivalent system would need to comply
       with LEED credits that reflect Rancho Cucamonga’s values and priorities, including
       the Healthy RC Initiative; and that encourage alternate forms of transportation, water
       efficiency, and construction and demolition waste recycling.
       The standards will not apply until the system is created and adopted by the City
       Council. These standards would be subject to change as the system is refined and
       modified to meet the needs of the building community in Rancho Cucamonga.
       Wildlife Resources
       Wildlife resources include all of the plants and wildlife species located in natural
       areas, particularly in the hillsides and open space areas. Most importantly, wildlife
       depends heavily on available habitat for survival, protection from prey, shelter, and
       water and food sources. With continued urban development in Rancho Cucamonga,
       it is important to plan for wildlife resources and provide adequate habitat areas for
       their long-term existence.
       Wildlife Species
       With the City’s proximity to the San Bernardino National Forest and vast mountainous
       wilderness area, a wide variety of wildlife inhabits the foothills and canyons,
       particularly within the Sphere of Influence area. Bats, bears, foxes, bobcats, skunks,
       coyotes, rabbits, mountain lions, deer, songbirds, birds of prey, lizards, amphibians,
       reptiles, snakes, and small rodents are very common. Further south, animal
       communities are those typically more tolerant of human presence. These species
       include various birds, reptiles, rabbits, and small rodents.
       Several different species of raptors, or birds of prey, including the Golden Eagle and
       burrowing owl, can be found in the northern area of the City. Burrowing owls often
       reside in or forage over the vacant fields in northern portions of the City and within
       the Sphere of Influence. Many of these fields are abandoned farmlands that are
       reverting to natural vegetation and subsequently colonized by rodent species. Often
       they are also bordered by eucalyptus windrows that provide perching and nesting
       sites for raptors. Golden Eagles nest in trees in the upper canyons in the San
       Bernardino National Forest and usually hunt for small mammals within the alluvial fan
       areas.
       Sensitive species or any species of plant or animal experiencing general or localized
       population decline, potentially occurring in the City include, but are not limited to, the
       California Gnatcatcher, San Bernardino Kangaroo Rat, Delhi Sands Flower-loving
       Fly, Golden Eagle, Western Willow Flycatcher, Mountain Yellow-legged Frog, and
       Los Angeles Pocket Mouse.

Sensitive Wildlife Habitat Areas
Within the Sphere of Influence, there are several sensitive habitat areas that support
wildlife. Two significant habitat areas are along the base of the San Gabriel
Mountains and in the canyons within the alluvial fans and canyon riparian areas.
Alluvial Fans
An alluvial fan is a fan-shaped deposit formed where a fast flowing stream flattens,
slows, and spreads; it is typically found where a canyon exits onto a flatter plain.
There are several alluvial fans located at the mouth of the San Antonio, Cucamonga,
Deer, Day, East Etiwanda, and San Sevaine Canyons. Alluvial fans are subject to
flooding and can pose more danger than the upstream canyons that feed them. At
the base of most of these canyons, a flood control basin has been built to limit the
extent of floodwaters on downstream properties. Alluvial fans also allow for
specialized habitat that is conducive to the periodic flooding and shifting of loose
sandy sediments carried by creeks and floodwaters.
Etiwanda Fan
The Etiwanda Fan is located at the base of the Day Creek and East Etiwanda
Canyons, with a large portion located in the North Etiwanda Preserve (see
description below). Habitats on the Etiwanda Fan are composed of Oak Woodland,
Chaparral, Coastal Sage Scrub, Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub, White Alder/Willow
Riparian, Sycamore/Oak Riparian, and non-native grassland. The Etiwanda Fan is
home to a number of endangered, threatened, and sensitive species that include, but
are not limited to, the Coastal California Gnatcatcher, Southwestern Willow
Flycatcher, Least Bell’s Vireo, San Bernardino Kangaroo Rat, Bell’s Sage Sparrow,
Rufous-crowned Sparrow, San Diego Horned Lizard, Los Angeles Pocket Mouse,
Plummer’s Lily, and Mariposa Lily.
The Etiwanda Fan also contains significant historical and cultural resources related to
the local area history. The land within and adjacent to the North Etiwanda Preserve
has important historic and contemporary religious significance to the Gabrielino-
Shoshoni Nation.
Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub
Within the Sphere of Influence, most of the undeveloped areas support Alluvial Fan
Sage Scrub (AFSS). AFSS thrives in a distinctive and rare natural habitat that occurs
in washes and on gently slopping alluvial fans at the base of the San Gabriel
Mountains. AFSS is primarily restricted to floodplain habitats containing riverine
cobbles, boulders, and sand. These areas apparently flood only occasionally (every 5
to 10 years) and therefore, many upland species become established in the
streamside habitat. The occasional flooding and sediment reworking, however, is the
driving force that maintains this vegetation type.
AFSS is a subtype of the more widely known Coastal Sage Scrub and is sometimes
referred to as Riversidean sage scrub. Canyons with AFSS often support small-
stature riparian woodland species such as California sycamore, cottonwood, coast
live oak, and mulefat, which are considered to be riparian habitat communities of
biological value.
AFSS habitat communities have been severely altered by flood control activities,
including the construction of debris basins at the mouth of the canyon to control the
water flow. The debris basins prevent the periodic flooding that is necessary to
maintain the habitat, which leads to the gradual conversion of this unique community

       type. The State of California considers AFSS to be a very threatened and rare natural
       community.
       Riparian and Wetland Areas
       The greatest diversity of life forms occurs in the area’s canyons, including
       Cucamonga, Deer Creek, Day Creek, East Etiwanda, Henderson, San Sevaine, and
       Morse Canyons. These canyons are excellent examples of the diversity of the
       streamside or riparian woodland habitat areas that support wildlife. The dense stands
       of large oak, sycamore, and toyon trees and native ferns are a demonstration of the
       natural biological significance of the streamside woodlands. These areas are of great
       importance as habitats for birds and mammals.
       A peat bog, created by a fresh water spring, has been identified in the North
       Etiwanda Preserve. Peat bogs are a type of wetlands with poor drainage that
       accumulates acidic peat, a deposit of dead plant material. Peat bogs are fed by
       rainwater and the soil builds up its own water table and acidity. There are many
       animals and plants that thrive within a bog habitat. The peat bog is an exceedingly
       rare type of habitat. It is believed that an extensive plant record left by pollens dating
       back between one and three million years has been preserved within the peat bog. In
       1988, the peat bog was declared a Point of Historic Interest by the Rancho
       Cucamonga City Council.
       Wildlife Protection Efforts
       Urbanization is the greatest threat to the remaining sensitive habitat areas.
       Expanding residential development, sand and gravel mining, and the construction of
       debris basins and flood control channels have greatly impacted areas of chaparral
       and Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub. Although nearly all of the area within City limits is either
       developed or previously disturbed by agricultural activities, areas within the Sphere of
       Influence are still relatively undisturbed and are still covered with native vegetation.
       Over the past 10 years, residential development has been extending into the foothills
       and threatening the long-term viability of sensitive habitat areas. The City has made
       coordinated efforts with other agencies to protect hundreds of acres in the Sphere
       and the City from encroaching development through a variety of tools including
       development agreements and land mitigation banking.
       Conservation Areas
       The protection and conservation of the Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub (AFSS) plant
       community within the Planning Area is one of the top environmental priorities. The
       long-term conservation of prime AFSS area has already begun through the
       establishment of five conservation areas that were created as mitigation banks for
       private and public works projects (see Figure RC-4).
             North Etiwanda Preserve. In 1998, the County of San Bernardino created a
              760-acre conservation area in response to impacts to AFSS from the Foothill
              Freeway (SR-210) project. The Preserve and surrounding lands also contain
              significant amounts of other rare and threatened habitats that include
              Sycamore Alluvial Woodland, California Walnut Woodland, and Fresh Water
              Marsh.
             Day Creek Preserve. A 200-acre conservation area was set aside through a
              conservation easement to the San Bernardino County Flood Control District as
              mitigation for impacts from sand and gravel operations.

      San Sevaine Preserve. This 137-acre conservation area was established by
       San Bernardino County as mitigation for floodwater diversion structures and
       debris basins.
      U.S. Forest Service Conservation Area. This 880-acre conservation area is
       located adjacent to the western edge of the North Etiwanda Preserve and
       includes land purchased by the Metropolitan Water District along Day Canyon
       and Day Creek as mitigation for the MWD’s Inland Feeder Project. The land
       has been transferred to the U.S. Forest Service and is a part of the San
       Bernardino National Forest. The majority of this conservation area extends
       beyond the City’s Sphere of Influence, into unincorporated territory.
      Existing Conservation Area. This approximately 35-acre conservation area
       is located within City limits but adjacent to the Sphere of Influence. The area
       was purchased as mitigation for a housing development and set aside through
       a conservation easement to the San Bernardino County Flood Control District.
These five preserves are in close proximity to each other and within a much larger
California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Study Area. Combined, this
becomes one of the largest AFSS habitats in Southern California.
                                                                                       The North Etiwanda
                                                                                       Preserve was established
                                                                                       as a habitat preservation
                                                                                       area.
A California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) study recommended that several
parcels in addition to the established preserves be conserved within the Etiwanda-
Day Creek Canyon Drainage System. A goal of this General Plan Update is the long-
term continuity of the AFSS habitat and the preservation of the five areas illustrated
on Figure RC-4: Sensitive Biological Resources. In addition, several other areas of
suitable AFSS are proposed for conservation as mitigation for development as
described below. Together, these conservation areas, in combination with the
county's established preserves, provide a large, contiguous conservation area of
approximately 3,400 acres.
The General Plan incorporates the proposed conservation areas on Figure RC-4, as
part of the City's commitment to the creation of a large, contiguous AFSS
conservation area. On the Land Use Plan (Chapter 2, Figure LU-1), the conservation
areas are designated as various open space categories including Open Space, Flood
Control, and Hillside Residential, based on current ownership patterns. The City will
need to work with San Bernardino County to acquire these lands in fee or through
conservation easements to the extent possible.

       Acquired land can then be integrated into the existing preserve system currently
       managed by San Bernardino County's Special Districts Department (or other
       appropriate entity). As an alternative, acquired land could be dedicated to a
       “mitigation land bank.” For example, development within the City or its Sphere of
       Influence would enable the purchase of land within the land bank area as mitigation
       for impacts from loss of habitat.
       Conservation areas are inherently valuable to wildlife, and imperative for supporting
       ecosystems. They are also important for educational and scientific purposes,
       particularly if they are retained in their natural state. Chaffey College biology classes
       have conducted extensive investigation of the AFSS area and regularly use it as an
       outdoor classroom.
       Protection of Sensitive Species
       As mentioned above, several sensitive species potentially occur in Rancho
       Cucamonga. The Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly (DSF) is an insect restricted to the
       semi-arid sand dunes (Delhi soils) in Southern California’s San Bernardino and
       Riverside counties. The DSF was placed on the Federal Endangered Species list in
       1993 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Within the region there are few remaining
       parcels of land containing Delhi soils which could provide suitable habitat for this
       species. Areas identified to have potential DSF habitats are located primarily in the
       southern portion of the City. Much of that area has been developed and recent
       surveys associated with new development have not identified any DSF habitat within
       the City boundaries or in the Sphere of Influence.
       A large portion of the Sphere of Influence has been proposed for a Critical Habitat
       designation for the California Gnatcatcher, a small bird. Surveys have identified
       breeding pairs of the species within the area. Both San Bernardino County and the
       City must proceed carefully with any development plans for the area due to the
       presence of this species within the AFSS plant community and the proposed Critical
       Habitat designation. Care must be taken to coordinate all new projects with CDFG to
       avoid impacts to the species or to develop mitigation measures where impacts
       cannot be avoided.

The San Bernardino Kangaroo Rat (SBKR) habitat historically occurs within the flood
plains at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains and may occur within the Sphere of
Influence. The SBKR is listed as endangered by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service.
The City will work closely with the San Bernardino County Flood Control District, the
County Museum, and other resource agencies to avoid impacts on this species from
development within the Sphere, and to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures
are provided.

Resource Conservation Issues
Key issues relative to resource conservation are:
         Loss of Open Space Areas. The City must preserve and protect, to the
          extent possible, open space areas that are devoted to the preservation of
          natural resources, managed production of resources, outdoor recreation,
          and/or open space buffer areas for public health and safety. Premature and
          unnecessary conversion of open space land to urban uses can fragment
          vital open spaces, increase infrastructure and capital improvement costs,
          and potentially expose residential uses to natural hazards.
         Cultural Resources. Although not readily apparent, the record of the
          ancient past is embodied in archaeological and paleontological resources
          that may lie hidden in the landform and beneath the surface of the ground.
          Rancho Cucamonga has become highly aware of these treasures as land is
          graded to accommodate new development and infrastructure. The City
          must take care to properly handle, document, and preserve these resources
          for the scientific and educational enrichment that they offer.
         Stable and Adequate Water Supply. Water is a precious and limited
          resource that is essential for a Healthy City. It is important to provide a
          stable and adequate water supply as the community continues to grow. The
          City and the Cucamonga Valley Water District must be vigilant in protecting
          and conserving water supplies through all feasible means. The Cucamonga
          Valley Water District obtains nearly 60 percent of its water supply from the

           Metropolitan Water District. This means the City does not have adequate
           water supplies within its own borders and must rely upon a cooperative
           agreement with other agencies. It is important to protect water resources by
           ensuring adequate groundwater recharge basins and spreading grounds as
           the shift toward a greater demand for groundwater supply increases.
          Water Quality. Household hazardous materials (motor oil, pesticides,
           solvents, paint, and other similar hazards) should not be disposed of by
           pouring them down the drain or into the street gutters. When improperly
           disposed, these materials pass through the local sewage treatment plants,
           which are not designed to treat these types of materials, and are released
           into area rivers and streams. Rancho Cucamonga must protect the quality
           of the water supply and resources, both for the sake of the local water
           supply as well as for downstream neighbors who are affected by Rancho
           Cucamonga’s actions. Achieving these important objectives will require
           cooperation and coordination with other agencies and the integration of
           water quality measures.
          Energy Consumption. A core value for the City is the need for long-term
           economic strength and fiscal soundness. This can be accomplished in part
           by the effective management of energy resources, either directly or
           indirectly. As energy demand grows and nonrenewable energy resources
           become more limited with reliance on imported resources becoming
           increasingly problematic, more aggressive conservation measures and the
           increased use of innovative new technologies will become a necessity.
          Aggregate Mining Impacts. With mineral resources available on land
           within the City’s Sphere of Influence, it is important to balance the need for
           local sources of regionally significant mineral resources against
           development of the land with uses that are more compatible with
           encroaching urbanization. The City recognizes the importance of the
           mineral resources in Rancho Cucamonga, and that once development
           occurs, these resources are no longer accessible. The City further
           recognizes its responsibilities to balance the value of these resources, and
           to consider their regional and statewide importance during the review and
           consideration of a proposed project that might impact extraction of those
           resources.
           The mining of aggregate resources is only active within the City’s Sphere of
           Influence. Once production ends, it will be important to provide mitigation
           for the reclamation of previously mined areas and limit the impacts to
           adjacent residential neighborhoods and other sensitive land uses.
          North Etiwanda Preserve. The North Etiwanda Preserve, located in the
           City’s Sphere of Influence, was intended to protect the sensitive habitat and
           wildlife species in the area. Since the Preserve was first created in 1998,
           issues such as uncontrolled pedestrian access, illegal dumping, sensitive
           plant removal, and off-road vehicles have plagued the area. These activities
           are very destructive to the natural environment located in the Preserve. San
           Bernardino County, which manages the preserve, anticipates that these
           issues will diminish as the preserve opened for public access on delineated
           trails in 2009.
          Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub. Alluvial fan sage scrub is a unique habitat that
           depends on the occasional flooding and shifting of sediments from canyon
           waters. However, to protect downstream development, flood control
           facilities have been built to control the flow of waters and prevent flooding.
        
                                                                  Resource Conservation

         These facilities have also controlled the water this habitat depends on. It will
         be important for the City and San Bernardino County, to balance the need
         for development versus alluvial fan sage scrub habitat protection.
         The majority of the land area within the City boundary is already developed
         or previously disturbed, either by past agricultural activities or by urban
         development. Other areas within the City boundaries have been designated
         or envisioned for future development. As a consequence, lands within the
         Planning Area that function effectively as habitat are limited. Achieving
         resource conservation will require concerted effort and commitment from
         not only the City but also other responsible agencies, including County,
         State, and Federal agencies.
Resource Conservation Goals and
Policies
The following goals and policies are aimed at providing guidance and policy direction regarding Resource
Conservation in Rancho Cucamonga. Resource Conservation in the City is a high priority and contributes to
maintaining, protecting, and preserving valuable natural resources.
GOAL RC-1:           Encourage stewardship of natural open space areas,
                     environmentally sensitive lands, and agricultural resources.
                Policy RC-1.1:    Preserve sensitive land resources that have significant
                                  native vegetation and/or habitat value.
                    Discussion:   The preservation of sensitive land resources has many benefits
                                  for the community. Native vegetation provides habitat for animals,
                                  offers a level of fire protection, serves to enhance water quality,
                                  and has aesthetic beauty. These areas are limited and once
                                  disturbed they will be lost to future generations.
               Policy RC-1.2:     Develop measures to preserve and enhance important views
                                  along north-south roadways, open space corridors, and at
                                  other key locations where there are significant views of
                                  scenic resources.
                    Discussion:   Major scenic resources include the San Gabriel and San
                                  Bernardino Mountains and foothills, vistas of the City from hillside
                                  areas, and other views of special vegetation and permanent open
                                  space features. Site planning measures in conjunction with the
                                  designation of significant views can enhance the visual
                                  environment.
               Policy RC-1.3:     Protect visually prominent natural landforms and other
                                  sensitive land resources of citywide significance through
                                  measures such as design standards, hillside grading
                                  controls, and suitable land use designations as documented
                                  in the Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic
                                  Resources Chapter of this General Plan.

           Discussion: Land use designations and community design measures must
                       carefully consider the impacts of future planned development on
                       environmentally sensitive lands, with an eye towards supporting
                       sound management and conservation of the City’s land
                       resources.
                       The Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic
                       Resources Chapter of the General Plan provides a carefully
                       considered range of land types and intensities/densities designed
                       to address these concerns, among others. The Community
                       Design section addresses hillside grading and development
                       planning. The City has also adopted a Hillside Development
                       Ordinance that contains detailed measures designed to minimize
                       potentially adverse effects due to landform alteration in high slope
                       areas. In addition, the Community Design section contains
                       policies to promote the protection of important scenic resources.
                       Finally, the Open Space Plan in this Chapter integrates all of the
                       sensitive land resources whose protection the City considers to
                       be important to the quality of life of its residents.
       Policy RC-1.4:  Evaluate the conservation of economically viable agriculture
                       on lands that are designated by the State as important
                       farmland.
           Discussion: While the agricultural heritage is an important influence on the
                       development patterns in Rancho Cucamonga (and the historic
                       communities of Alta Loma, Cucamonga, and Etiwanda), the long-
                       term viability of continued agricultural uses in most areas is
                       questionable due to a host of factors. Remaining lands that have
                       been determined by the State Department of Conservation to
                       qualify as important farmland are under increasing pressure from
                       urbanization. In addition, the Land Use Plan (see Chapter 2:
                       Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic
                       Resources, Figure LU-1) has determined that some areas
                       designated by the State as important farmland should be utilized
                       for other purposes to meet the demands of a growing population.
                       In order to determine the appropriate balance between these
                       competing priorities, the City should further investigate these
                       issues and formulate a strategy that will best reflect the long-term
                       interests of the community as a whole. Where it is determined
                       that long-term agricultural use is in conflict with community goals,
                       the City will seek the removal of any designated farmlands from
                       the State Department of Conservation mapping program. The
                       City shall look at ways to preserve agricultural lands through the
                       use of conservation easements.

GOAL RC-2:        Provide adequate, reliable, and sustainable water supplies to the
                  community.
             Policy RC-2.1:  In consultation with the Cucamonga Valley Water District
                             and other agencies, designate appropriate land use patterns
                             and take other suitable actions to protect major areas within
                             the Planning Area that are critical to replenishment of
                             groundwater supplies and local surface waters.
                 Discussion: By 2030, the Cucamonga Valley Water District (CVWD)
                             anticipates that as much as 45 percent of the water supply will
                             come from groundwater and surface water sources in Rancho
                             Cucamonga. Many areas that allow groundwater recharge are
                             located within existing drainages under the jurisdiction of the San
                             Bernardino County Flood Control District. Much of the land within
                             the Sphere of Influence also contributes to groundwater recharge.
                             The General Plan promotes the expansion of habitat preserves in
                             the Sphere of Influence and also designates a majority of the
                             Sphere area for Open Space, Conservation, or Hillside
                             Residential use. The City, in consultation with the CVWD, will
                             continue to explore and pursue other viable measures to ensure
                             that groundwater resources will not be diminished by planned
                             land uses.
            Policy RC-2.2:   Continue to consult with the Cucamonga Valley Water
                             District and support programs that protect water quality,
                             conserve water usage, and promote re-use of water in
                             accordance with State guidelines.
                 Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga is increasingly aware of the fact that water is
                             a limited resource. In recent years, the CVWD has made efforts
                             to increase the efficiency with which existing water supplies are
                             used through water conservation efforts and water recycling. By
                             2030, water recycling and water conservation are expected to
                             provide a total of 20 percent of the area’s water supply.
            Policy RC-2.3:   Explore sustainable methods to increase water production
                             and distribution capabilities to meet future City demand.
                 Discussion: With water as a limited resource, there is a need to find ways to
                             increase water production through conservation and re-use. The
                             CVWD has aggressively moved toward recycling water for non-
                             potable uses. Re-use of water is a well-established way to limit
                             the need for more imported water and also meet future water
                             demands of a growing City.
            Policy RC-2.4:   Promote the protection of natural stream courses from
                             erosion and from polluted urban runoff.

            Discussion: The interface between the urban edge and natural stream
                        courses remaining in the Planning Area must be carefully
                        considered in the design of new development and
                        redevelopment, as well as in the continued maintenance of
                        existing developed areas. The National Pollutant Discharge
                        Elimination System (NPDES) permits for development and
                        existing developed areas include requirements to effectively
                        address and control runoff that can result in damage to the
                        natural environment. The implementation of Stormwater Best
                        Management Practices (BMPs) that mimic the predevelopment
                        site hydrology by using site design techniques that store,
                        infiltrate, evaporate, and detain runoff should be considered for
                        implementation when feasible. When stormwater BMPs are not
                        feasible, equally effective, State required control measures
                        should be implemented. The City will review individual
                        development proposals and evaluate their potential effects.
       Policy RC-2.5:   Advocate for the regular evaluation of the entire water
                        supply and distribution system to ensure its continued
                        adequacy, reliability, and safety.
            Discussion: In consultation with CVWD, the City shall periodically evaluate
                        the water supply chain, the distribution system, and land use
                        policies in order to support a constant, adequate supply of water.
       Policy RC-2.6:   Where it is consistent with public safety priorities, take
                        actions to retain natural drainage courses within the
                        Planning Area.
            Discussion: Drainage courses and adjacent open areas can provide a visual
                        link to the surrounding environment and potentially also enhance
                        habitat value through the use of natural landscaping techniques.
                        In some instances, it may also be appropriate to consider the
                        potential for joint recreational use, particularly in the case of trails
                        development. The City shall consult with the County Flood
                        Control District and the Army Corps of Engineers to explore
                        opportunities to enhance the open space and recreational value
                        of remaining natural drainages as well as flood control channels,
                        consistent with public safety priorities.
       Policy RC-2.7:   Protect the watershed by achieving mandates imposed by
                        regulations.
            Discussion  The watershed that supplies the area’s local water is primarily
                        located in the upper canyons of the San Gabriel Mountains,
                        including Cucamonga, Deer, Day, East Etiwanda, and San
                        Sevaine Canyons. It will be important to work with agencies and
                        jurisdictions that have authority over these areas to protect and
                        preserve the drainage courses and watershed areas. Rancho
                        Cucamonga will also provide appropriate measures to protect
                        and preserve the watershed areas that are within the boundaries
                        of the City.

GOAL RC-3:        Support the use of water that is both efficiently consumed and
                  recycled to minimize waste and maximize supplies.
             Policy RC-3.1:  Require the use of cost-effective methods to conserve water
                             in new developments, and promote appropriate water
                             conservation and efficiency measures for existing
                             businesses and residences.
                 Discussion: There are many measures that can be applied to new and current
                             development to reduce water consumption. They include, but are
                             not limited to: placing mulch around trees and plants to slow
                             evaporation of water; planting low-water use plants and shrubs;
                             installing smart irrigation equipment that can detect weather
                             conditions and adjust the watering schedule as needed; and
                             installing water-saving plumbing fixtures such as low-flow
                             showerheads, low-flush toilets, aerators, flow restrictors, and high
                             efficiency clothes washers.
                             Changing individual habits can also make a difference in the
                             conservation of water. These behavioral measures include, but
                             are not limited to: watering the lawn only when needed or
                             installing a satellite irrigation management system; shutting off
                             water during shaving or brushing of teeth; taking shorter showers;
                             catching unused water from the shower and kitchen faucet for
                             cleaning or to water plants around the house; using a pool cover
                             to slow evaporation; adjusting sprinkler systems during the colder
                             months to water less frequently; turning sprinklers off when it is
                             raining; periodically checking for leaks in pipes, hoses and
                             faucets; and using a broom instead of a hose when cleaning the
                             driveway or sidewalk.
            Policy RC-3.2:   Encourage the conversion of water-intensive turf/landscape
                             areas to landscaping that uses climate-appropriate plants,
                             efficient irrigation systems, and water efficient site
                             maintenance.
                 Discussion: To conserve water resources and control maintenance costs, the
                             City’s current Water Efficiency Ordinance discourages extensive
                             use of non-native vegetation that requires excessive watering. In
                             particular, the Water Efficiency Ordinance specifies the use of
                             drought tolerant and fire resistant vegetation with an emphasis on
                             native species. The City updated its Water Efficiency Ordinance
                             based on the State Department of Water Resources model
                             ordinance, which allows for artificial turf.
            Policy RC-3.3:   Support efforts to expand the recycled water distribution
                             system and actively promote the widespread use of recycled
                             water in Rancho Cucamonga.
                 Discussion: Water recycling is an efficient method to re-use water. The
                             Cucamonga Valley Water District anticipates that 20 percent of its
                             water supply in 2030 will come from recycled water sources.
                             Recycled water will become an important water supply in the
                             future, specifically for landscaped irrigation, industrial water use,
                             and other appropriate water uses.

              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga will continue to be a model for using best
                          practices in applying water conservation methods. The City is
                          committed to leading by example and to conserving water within
                          each City department. Existing City efficiency programs have
                          resulted in water savings, especially in street medians where the
                          City uses weather-based irrigation.
GOAL RC-4:    Encourage the use of energy resources that are efficiently
              expended and obtained from diverse and sustainable sources, in
              an effort to minimize greenhouse gas and other air emissions.
         Policy RC-4.1:   Pursue efforts to reduce energy consumption through
                          appropriate energy conservation and efficiency measures
                          throughout all segments of the community.
              Discussion: Not only does consumption of imported nonrenewable energy
                          resources result in significant pollutant emissions to the
                          environment, it also represents a net outflow of dollars from the
                          community and decreases the economic autonomy of the City.
                          Rancho Cucamonga will commit to greater energy efficiency by
                          selectively replacing imported, nonrenewable energy resources
                          with domestic renewable sources such as solar and wind,
                          recycled municipal solid waste, and green waste as these
                          strategies become economically practical.
         Policy RC-4.2:   Promote the use of renewable energy and alternative energy
                          technology, and support efforts to develop small-scale,
                          distributed       energy      generation     (e.g., solar,    wind,
                          cogeneration, and biomass) to reduce the amount of
                          electricity drawn from the regional power grid and reduce
                          the use of natural gas, while providing Rancho Cucamonga
                          with a greater degree of energy and economic self-
                          sufficiency.
              Discussion: The transition away from the reliance on imported, nonrenewable
                          energy resources will not be easy. City government will continue
                          its tradition of leading by example and provide models for action
                          to the private sector. It will also publicize options for energy
                          efficiency and renewable energy resources. In particular, the City
                          will use energy efficiency and renewable energy resources as
                          criteria for approving capital and operational expenditures. The
                          City will also participate in innovative and experimental renewable
                          energy resource programs (e.g., conversion to an electric or
                          hybrid vehicle fleet), provided such participation does not directly
                          or indirectly result in a decline of services to residents or an
                          increase in their tax burden.
         Policy RC-4.3:   Encourage the use of solar energy systems in homes and
                          commercial businesses.

                 Discussion: There are many opportunities to take advantage of the City’s
                             location and environment with more aggressive adoption of solar
                             energy systems. To encourage implementation of such
                             technologies, the City will integrate an explicit evaluation of the
                             particular energy consumption characteristics of a project into the
                             review and approval process of development applications for
                             commercial complexes, including shopping centers, industrial
                             projects, and offices.
                             In addition, the City will promote cogeneration and the use of
                             waste process heat for domestic space and water heating
                             purposes. The City will also promote recovery and recycling
                             programs and establish design criteria for active and passive
                             solar applications.
            Policy RC-4.4:   Reduce        operational     energy      requirements
                             sustainable and complementary land use and circulation
                                                                                           through
                             planning. Support implementation of State mandates
                             regarding energy consumption and greenhouse gas
                             reduction, including AB32 and SB375.
                 Discussion: Operational energy requirements, especially for transportation,
                             can be significantly impacted by land use and circulation patterns.
                             The City will, therefore, promote land use and circulation patterns
                             that result in multi-purpose automobile trips and that facilitate the
                             use of local and regional transit. In addition, the City will advance
                             land use patterns that provide employment and housing
                             opportunities for City residents in a manner that allows for
                             practical options for mobility other than by automobile.
            Policy RC-4.5:   Support the development of private sources of sustainable
                             and environmentally friendly energy supplies, provided
                             these are consistent with City aesthetic and public safety
                             goals.
                 Discussion: In cooperation with regional efforts such as the Green Valley
                             Initiative, continue to make the recruitment and retention of
                             “green” industries a priority. Maximize opportunities for site
                             renewable energy technologies throughout the community by
                             encouraging the use of solar, wind, and other energy sources.
GOAL RC-5: Encourage the use of energy conservation strategies in City
                  projects and operations to maximize energy efficiency and serve
                  as a role model to the community and the region.
             Policy RC-5.1:  The City should serve as a role model by adopting
                             recognizable standards and incorporating the use of
                             sustainable strategies for new and existing public buildings
                             that maximize occupant health and productivity, minimize
                             operating costs, and provide good environmental
                             stewardship.

              Discussion: Utilizing available energy resources in the most efficient manner
                          possible, while supporting the development of new and
                          renewable energy sources, provides a long-term benefit to every
                          member of the Rancho Cucamonga community. The City will
                          serve as a role model in energy conservation and related issues.
         Policy RC-5.2:   Investigate the feasibility of using solar (photovoltaic) lights
                          for City operated parking lots instead of conventional street
                          and pedestrian lights that are powered by electricity in an
                          effort to conserve energy.
              Discussion: As the cost of solar (photovoltaic) lighting becomes cost-effective
                          in comparison to other technologies, the City has an opportunity
                          to retrofit the existing system and to see potential long-term
                          benefits and savings.
         Policy RC-5.3:   Explore and consider the costs and benefits of alternative
                          fuel vehicles including hybrid, electric, natural gas, and
                          hydrogen powered vehicles when purchasing new City
                          vehicles.
              Discussion: The City of Rancho Cucamonga has made a commitment to
                          reduce vehicular emissions associated with City operations. The
                          City has established goals for their fleet in procuring vehicles,
                          including providing gas-efficient vehicles (or other similar
                          technology to reduce vehicle emissions) when replacing vehicles.
GOAL RC-6:    Encourage and support green buildings in Rancho Cucamonga.
         Policy RC-6.1:   Add energy efficiency standards in the Rancho Cucamonga
                          Municipal Code based on green building principles, to
                          reduce energy consumption (particularly for heating,
                          cooling, and lighting) in new construction.
              Discussion: New advances in energy conservation technology have made
                          alternative energy resources increasingly viable for homes and
                          businesses. Development standards have the potential to
                          increase the alternative energy infrastructure in new and rebuilt
                          developments. The City of Rancho Cucamonga will review and
                          amend, if necessary, the Municipal Code for the purposes of
                          increasing energy efficiency and promoting sustainable
                          development.
         Policy RC-6.2:   Encourage green practices for new and existing buildings
                          throughout the community.

                 Discussion: The market has accepted – and many times required – the
                             development of green buildings. Many cities have typically
                             mandated green buildings for their own projects, and later for
                             private development over a minimum threshold. Benefits include
                             buildings that are sustainable and healthier for their occupants,
                             as well as reductions in energy costs and greenhouse gas
                             emissions.
                             Longer-lasting and better-functioning building products will have
                             to be replaced less frequently, reducing the impacts of producing
                             replacements. All products should be designed for re-use and
                             recycling so that the City can minimize the environmental
                             footprint. The City should use life cycle assessments when
                             making design and purchasing decisions.
            Policy RC-6.3:   Promote energy-efficient design features, including but not
                             limited to, appropriate site orientation, use of light-colored
                             roofing and building materials, and use of deciduous trees
                             and wind-break trees to reduce fuel consumption for heating
                             and cooling beyond the minimum requirements of Title 24
                             State Energy Codes.
                 Discussion: Sustainable building design aims to create buildings that are not
                             harmful to their occupants or to the larger environment, and help
                             improve employee productivity. An important emphasis is on
                             indoor environmental quality, especially indoor air quality. For
                             example, low-impact materials such as non-toxic, sustainably
                             produced, and recycled building and construction materials
                             require little energy to process.
                             New and existing development can incorporate other techniques
                             to take advantage of the sun’s energy (e.g., passive solar design
                             and solar domestic hot water and pool heating systems) to
                             reduce their reliance on nonrenewable energy resources. For
                             example, deciduous trees can be planted at strategic locations to
                             provide summer shade, thereby reducing cooling costs. In the
                             winter, when the leaves have dropped, the sunlight can provide
                             natural warmth that reduces heating costs. New development can
                             orient buildings and windows to minimize or maximize solar
                             exposure for natural lighting and passive heating and cooling.
            Policy RC-6.4:   Promote green practices and the use of energy saving
                             designs and devices for new and existing buildings
                             throughout the community. Consult with energy providers
                             such as Southern California Edison, Southern California
                             Gas, the Rancho Cucamonga Municipal Utility, and others to
                             establish and coordinate energy efficiency programs that
                             promote energy efficient design in all projects and assist
                             residential, commercial, and industrial users.

              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga is fortunate to have plentiful sunshine
                          throughout the year and an abundance of residential, office,
                          industrial and warehouse buildings with extensive roof surfaces
                          on which solar panels can be mounted. Several industrial
                          buildings already have roof-mounted solar panels. Although solar
                          panels may require substantial initial investments, rebates and
                          tax incentives are available, and solar panels can provide
                          substantial long-term financial benefits.
                          Southern California Edison recently launched the nation’s largest
                          solar panel installation project to place 250 megawatts (MW) of
                          photovoltaic systems on 65 million square feet of Southern
                          California commercial and industrial building roofs – enough
                          power to serve approximately 162,000 homes.
GOAL RC-7:    Protect aggregate mining resources that are sustainably mined
              and managed, and that minimize impacts to surrounding areas.
         Policy RC-7.1:   Consider the community value and benefit of designated
                          regionally significant aggregate resources prior to approving
                          any such designated lands for other types of development.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga recognizes the value of regionally significant
                          aggregate resource areas designated within the Planning Area.
                          At the same time, the existence of aggregate resources should
                          not preclude development for other purposes, provided that such
                          development is consistent with the General Plan. State
                          regulations do not preclude development where a local
                          jurisdiction has established plans and policies that designate
                          other higher priority uses within the community. The Land Use
                          Plan (Figure LU-1 in Chapter 2) and Open Space Plan (Figure
                          RC-1 in this Chapter) are based upon the consideration of such
                          issues and reflect a land use pattern that recognizes both the
                          regional value of existing aggregate resources in the Planning
                          Area and balances the projected needs for such resources
                          against other community priorities.
         Policy RC-7.2:   Minimize direct and indirect negative impacts of mineral
                          extraction activity on sensitive and adjacent land uses.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga maintains up-to-date and relevant
                          information on resources and regulatory requirements in order to
                          formulate appropriate strategies to address the proper placement
                          of aggregate operations within the Rancho Cucamonga Planning
                          Area. This documentation must also consider potential conflicts
                          with both existing and proposed land uses, and community
                          priorities identified in the Spirit of Rancho Cucamonga General
                          Plan Guiding Principles.
         Policy RC-7.3:   Ensure effective restoration of expended mining sites in a
                          manner that is aesthetically attractive.
 
                                                                                  Resource Conservation

                 Discussion: Where identified aggregate resource areas are in proximity to any
                             residential land uses, the City must protect the integrity and
                             quality of life enjoyed by existing residences and businesses. In
                             addition, the proper reclamation of expended operations is of
                             concern in terms of protecting the visual environment. Special
                             development standards, such as setbacks and screening/
                             buffering measures should be formulated to minimize potential
                             land use conflicts while permitting extraction of valuable mineral
                             resources in areas determined suitable for such operations.
            Policy RC-7.4:   Where the City has determined that urban use is a priority
                             over the preservation of potential sites for aggregate
                             recovery, the City will consider seeking the removal of such
                             areas from Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA)
                             maps.
                 Discussion: In order to facilitate development within the Planning Area in a
                             manner that is consistent with priorities set forth in this General
                             Plan, areas presently designated for urban use but shown by the
                             State as potential aggregate resources should be carefully
                             evaluated. In areas where significant conflicts could be
                             anticipated to occur with either existing or planned use, the City
                             will petition the State for removal of affected lands from SMARA
                             maps.
            Policy RC-7.5:   In areas that the State of California has designated as
                             regionally significant aggregate resources, the City will
                             require property titles to include notice of the presence of
                             such resources, in accordance with SMARA.
                 Discussion: Property owners may not be fully aware of the potential
                             aggregate resources present on their property. The recordation of
                             a notice of the presence of aggregate resources will be required
                             with all property titles within designated sectors in order to assist
                             in the conservation of appropriately located areas within Rancho
                             Cucamonga.
GOAL RC-8:        Protect wildlife habitats that support various plants, mammals,
                  and other wildlife species.
             Policy RC-8.1:  Preserve the integrity of riparian habitat areas, creek
                             corridors, Riversidian Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub, bogs, and
                             sensitive wildlife habitat that supports biological resources.
                 Discussion: In cooperation with other agencies, Rancho Cucamonga will
                             pursue actions that provide appropriate long-term protection of
                             areas within the City’s Sphere of Influence that contain sensitive
                             habitat, and that are considered of unique value in enhancing the
                             quality of the local environment. These agencies may include, but
                             are not limited to, the County of San Bernardino, the County
                             Flood Control District, the State Department of Fish and Game,
                             the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Department of
                             Fish and Wildlife. Development within the City boundaries will be
                             subject to development regulations and standards.

       Policy RC-8.2:   Consult with San Bernardino County and other agencies to
                        support the preservation of streamside woodland areas
                        along the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, including
                        the North Etiwanda Preserve.
            Discussion: The canyons in Rancho Cucamonga’s Sphere of Influence
                        contain the only native trees of the area. Without appropriate
                        protection and assistance from San Bernardino County they may
                        be irreversibly lost. Development proposed in these riparian, or
                        water-related communities, should be allowed only after a site
                        specific investigation is conducted to: 1) define the extent and
                        fragility of the riparian community; 2) determine wetland permit
                        requirements; and 3) propose measures to mitigate any impacts
                        on the resources stemming from land disturbance or other site
                        development. Preservation of mature native woodland trees,
                        prevention of soil erosion, and maintenance of open space are
                        primary concerns. Clustered single-family residential units should
                        be encouraged to avoid destruction of the woodland associations.
                        Roads or buildings should be set back from the riparian corridor
                        to avoid damage to the woodland associations.
       Policy RC-8.3:   Utilize innovative measures that will allow the expansion of
                        sensitive biological preserve areas (e.g., North Etiwanda
                        Preserve, Day Creek Preserve, and San Sevaine Preserve)
                        and other important habitat areas.
            Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga is actively working with the County of San
                        Bernardino, California Department of Fish and Game, and U.S.
                        Fish and Wildlife Service to protect sensitive biological resources
                        in the City’s Planning Area through the creation of a system of
                        preserves and open space along the foothills of the San Gabriel
                        Mountains.
                        The City will continue to work cooperatively with San Bernardino
                        County for the implementation and management of a mitigation
                        land bank as part of the acquisition process for the Alluvial Fan
                        Sage Scrub (AFSS) Preserve. The land bank will be used to
                        offset the impacts of future development while focusing
                        preservation efforts in the critical AFSS habitat areas.
       Policy RC-8.4:   Acquire and/or protect open space areas that provide
                        strategic wildlife corridors and vital connectivity between
                        habitat areas.
            Discussion: Scientists with the San Bernardino County Museum are
                        continually gathering data on all sensitive habitats and sensitive
                        plant and animal species in the county. In cooperation with the
                        City of Rancho Cucamonga, the California Department of Fish
                        and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and San Bernardino
                        Association of Governments, San Bernardino County has already
                        created a system of preserves in the City’s Sphere of Influence
                        that will become the basis for protecting the rapidly disappearing
                        AFSS habitat located along the foothills of the San Gabriel
                        Mountains.

            Policy RC-8.5:   Continue to manage and care for all trees located on City
                             property or within City rights-of-way. Provide information to
                             the public on correct tree pruning practices. Encourage
                             residents to properly care for and preserve large and
                             beautiful trees on their private property.
                 Discussion: A healthy urban forest provides many benefits, including wildlife
                             habitat, shade, enhanced air quality, and aesthetics. Proper
                             maintenance of the urban forest will maximize the investment
                             while reducing risks due to storms or disease.
            Policy RC-8.6:   Consult with the Fire District, San Bernardino County, and
                             State agencies to develop plans that protect open space
                             from fire hazards.
                 Discussion: Over the years, the City has learned a great deal on how
                             landscape design can minimize the risk from fire hazards. The
                             Fire District has been proactive in defining standards and
                             implementing those standards throughout the City.
            Policy RC-8.7:   Support protection of natural habitat areas for ecological,
                             educational, and other scientific study purposes.
                 Discussion: Natural areas that can be used for educational or other scientific
                             purposes are particularly important, and high priority should be
                             given to retaining these areas in their natural state. An example
                             of such a natural area is the AFSS habitat within the City’s
                             Sphere of Influence. Chaffey College biology classes have
                             conducted extensive investigation of the AFSS area and regularly
                             use it as an outdoor classroom. This area is recognized by the
                             California Department of Fish and Game as the North Etiwanda
                             Preserve. It is one of the largest remaining AFSS habitats and is
                             home to a number of rare and sensitive plant and animal species.

      Achieving Our Vision
      The vision for Rancho Cucamonga includes the provision of high-quality public
      facilities, support for educational opportunities and life-long learning pursuits, and
      maintenance and expansion of public infrastructure to meet the planned growth of
      the City. The City of Rancho Cucamonga’s vision for public facilities and
      infrastructure is reflected in the following Spirit of Rancho Cucamonga Guiding
      Principles:
      The Spirit of Family
               Our economic development priorities are to support individuals and families
                  by providing high-quality services and facilities.
      The Spirit of Discovery and Knowledge
               Rancho Cucamonga is a community committed to lifelong learning that
                  promotes educational opportunities for people of all ages.
                 Rancho Cucamonga’s schools and colleges are a valuable asset. The
                  quality of our schools draws people to our City. Partnerships among
                  schools, the City, businesses, as well as service, non-profit and faith-based
                  organizations are a model for all California cities.
                 We promote participation in the arts, offering a variety of entertainment and
                  education venues for enrichment, as well as providing opportunities for
                  people to gather with friends and neighbors.
                 We promote diverse programs and high-quality facilities such as our City-
                  owned Libraries and our Community Centers.
      The Spirit of Community
               Through programs such as Healthy RC, we inspire a lifestyle that embraces
                  a Healthy Mind, Body and Earth. We support lifelong learning and
                  enrichment, active and healthy living, and environmental sustainability.
                  These values are reflected in our programs and facilities for our residents
                  and businesses. The high quality of services the City provides strengthens
                  community bonds and contributes to healthy lifestyles.
      The Spirit of Leadership
                We have a strong dedication to community planning. The quality of our
                   built environment is by design. Our government leads by example. We are
                   committed to achieving higher standards for community development,
                   architecture, and landscaping. Our streetscapes reflect the high-quality
                   development that we demand while embracing the concept of water
                   conservation and ease of maintenance.
      The Spirit of Tomorrow
               We are dedicated to a sustainable balance in land use patterns (residential,
                  business, educational, agricultural, recreational, open space, and historic
                  uses) and supporting transportation.
                 We recognize there is an interdependent relationship between an educated
                  citizenry, economic development, and a thriving community.

Public Facilities
Public facilities include the Civic Center, Community and Senior Centers, and
Libraries. These facilities are the community’s gathering places, where people can go
to participate in local government, attend community events, obtain information, and
learn about resources in the community. Each of the City’s different Community
Centers provides a different focus to meet the needs of the area and populations
served. Certain facilities, such as the two Community Centers located in Central
Park, provide indoor spaces that are flexible and able to accommodate many uses,
including fitness and athletic activities, child care, information and referral for human
services, space for nonprofit groups, nutrition services, special event rentals, and
classrooms. The City invests in itself through development of public facilities and the
services it can offer to the community.
City Government Facilities
The City of Rancho Cucamonga manages a comprehensive range of community
facilities to meet the varied needs of residents and businesses. One Senior Center,
several youth centers, and multi-purpose Community Centers offer educational and
recreational activities and services for all ages. Chapter 5: Community Services
provides greater detail regarding parks and special use facilities operated by the City.
Other public safety facilities, such as fire stations and police stations, are discussed
further in Chapter 8: Public Health and Safety.
Table PF-1: Community Facilities and Figure PF-1: Public Facilities, identify the
categories of public facilities located in Rancho Cucamonga: schools and parks,
public safety facilities, City facilities, and San Bernardino County facilities. City
government facilities include:
         Civic Center. Rancho Cucamonga’s Civic Center consists of City Hall, which
          houses the Council Chambers as well as the City’s various departments,
          including the Rancho Cucamonga Fire Protection District. The Public Safety
          Facility building is home to the Rancho Cucamonga Police Department. The
          Civic Center also includes the San Bernardino County/Foothill Communities
          Law and Justice Center.
         Rancho Cucamonga Corporate Yard. The City’s Corporate Yard is
          comprised of two facilities. The first facility houses the administrative offices
          for the Public Works Department for the maintenance of the City’s fleet of
          vehicles and equipment. The second facility is a 15,000-square-foot
          warehouse. The compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling station at the

Schools and Educational
Facilities
The City values and promotes education and life-long learning. Education provides
the foundation for the development of healthy minds, prepares young students for a
successful future, and enriches the lives of older students. For these reasons,
Rancho Cucamonga strongly promotes quality learning opportunities in all of the
City’s public and private schools, local community college, and continuing education
centers. Although schools are not the direct responsibility of the City, the General
Plan supports cooperation between the City and the school districts to further
improve schools serving the Rancho Cucamonga community.
Schools
Four elementary school districts and one high school district serve residents of
Rancho Cucamonga, as indicated in Table PF-2: Schools Serving Rancho
Cucamonga and Figure PF-2: Schools and School Districts. Table PF-3: School
District Student Capacity, identifies school capacity for each school district.
Rancho Cucamonga is located entirely within the Chaffey Joint Union High School
District, which provides all secondary public education. The district operates four high
schools: Alta Loma on the west, Rancho Cucamonga in the central area, Etiwanda
on the east, and Los Osos in the north central portion of the City.
Primary-level public education services are provided by four elementary and junior
high/middle school districts: Alta Loma serving the northwest portion, Central serving
the west central portion, Cucamonga serving the south portion, and Etiwanda serving
the eastern portion of the City. The unincorporated Sphere of Influence to the north is
served by the Alta Loma and Etiwanda districts.
Each school district has different school planning programs, site development
schedules, and policies regarding joint-use of school facilities. Consequently, the City
faces the challenges represented by these differences when coordinating City
activities and the use of school facilities.
The City also has many religious institutions on large properties that have K-12
schools now and possibly in the future.

                            Library Services
                            Libraries promote creativity, knowledge, and learning throughout people’s lives, all of
                            which contribute to healthier minds. Libraries provide a place where people can study
                            and research school projects, read current issues of newspapers and magazines, or
                            simply relax and pick up a good book. Libraries can also be places for personal
                            reinvention by offering resources on jobs, careers, and hobbies.
                            Rancho Cucamonga Public Library
                            Rancho Cucamonga’s Library was established in 1994 when the City took over
                            operation of the local library from the San Bernardino County Library System. In
                            addition to the circulation and processing of library materials, the City’s Library
                            Services Department is responsible for children’s services, programs, and special
                            events; adult information services; and adult and family literacy services. The Library
                            Services Department is overseen by a five-member Board of Trustees. Additional
                            support comes from the Library Foundation Board that provides fundraising support.
                            The Rancho Cucamonga Public Library has two library facilities, and is consistently
                            one of the busiest library systems in California.
                            Started in 1994, the Rancho Cucamonga Library Board of Trustees serves as a
                            volunteer advisory group to the City Council and Library staff. This five member
                            group meets once a month and assists Library staff with developing Library goals,
                            determining needs for Library services and programs, and being an advocate for
                            Library services in the community.
  The Paul A. Biane Library
opened alongside the Lewis
Family Playhouse within the
  Victoria Gardens Cultural
            Center in 2006.
                            Archibald Library
                            The Archibald Library was the first municipal library in Rancho Cucamonga, opening
                            in 1994. Originally intended to be an “interim” main library, the Archibald Library was
                            created from a converted office building and was designed to accommodate 65,000
                            volumes. The same facility has been renovated since its inception and still serves the
                            community. The Archibald Library now contains over 120,000 volumes and other

materials, performing at nearly double the capacity for which it was originally
intended. The renovation has allowed for an enhanced technology center.
Paul A. Biane Library
The Paul A. Biane Library, located as part of the Victoria Gardens Cultural Center,
opened in 2006. The opening of this second facility has nearly doubled the capacity
of the Rancho Cucamonga Public Library system. The Paul A. Biane Library is home
to a book and media collection of approximately 100,000 items and features
amenities such as a 21-seat technology center, a story room complete with fiber optic
ceiling lights, a traditional reading room with a fireplace, a homework center, and the
Local History Room (which displays historic artifacts and where recording of digital
stories of the City’s history takes place).
Library Programs and Services
The Rancho Cucamonga Public Library offers programs and services for people of all
ages, including a bookmobile, technology classes, storytime for children, programs
for teens, book clubs, literacy programs, and special programs that all help develop
healthy minds.
         Bookmobile. Rancho Cucamonga’s Bookmobile aids in the distribution of
          books by visiting schools around the City and providing a bus full of children-
          oriented and educational books that students can check out.
         Adult Literacy. The Adult Literacy Program provides free adult literacy
          services to the local community. Adults may participate as students or as
          volunteer tutors.
         Back to Basics. Back to Basics is an after-school tutoring program. The
          program targets elementary school-aged children 7 to 12 years old who are
          reading below their grade level and want to improve their reading and writing
          skills.
         Virtual Library. The Library’s website or “Virtual Library” allows residents to
          access certain library services from the internet 24 hours a day. The Virtual
          Library allows the community to apply for a library card, download audio
          books, conduct research using library databases, or check availability of
          library materials.
         Technology Classes and Public Computers. The Library offers all library
          patrons the use of public computers for free. Both Libraries also offer
          computer classes that cover a variety of computer-related topics and basic
          computer skills. In addition, both the Archibald and Biane Libraries offer the
          use of free Wi-Fi for personal computers.
         Other Programs for Children and Teens. Both Libraries offer storytime
          sessions with a wide range of stories that appeal to children ranging in age
          from babies and toddlers, to children up to 11 years old. Through the
          Library’s Teen Scene program, a variety of teen activities such as reading
          clubs and teen social gatherings are offered. The Library also accepts
          volunteers for its Teen Action Group, which serves an advisory role, making
          suggestions for library services and helping plan teen programs.

       Animal Care and Services
       Pet owners in Rancho Cucamonga enjoy many pet-friendly benefits, including many
       places to walk and exercise including a dedicated dog park, parks and open space
       areas to relax in, and animal services programs that care for their animal
       companions. Pets enrich families and communities with their companionship and
       loyalty, and pets have been shown to have positive impacts on people’s physical and
       mental health. To address and encourage these positive affects, the City looks to
       support programs that respond to the needs of pet owners and their animal
       companions.
       In 1993, the City of Rancho Cucamonga constructed the current Animal Center at
       11780 Arrow Highway (sharing the parking lot with the Epicenter) and contracted with
       San Bernardino County to administer the Center. In 2005, citizens expressed a
       strong interest in a more progressive animal services program focused on building a
       community in which every adoptable pet finds a home. The City Council created the
       Department of Animal Care and Services and took over administration on May 1,
       2006. The Department has increased community involvement with strong volunteer
       and fundraising programs and promoted spaying, neutering, community outreach,
       and education.
       The Rancho Cucamonga Animal Care and Adoption Center is managed by the
       Animal Care and Services Department and provides the community with services
       specific to animals. The Department’s goal is to build a community in which every
       adoptable pet finds a home. The Department also provides public health and safety
       programs oriented toward animal care and community service. Some of the services
       provided include homeless animal adoptions; services for lost animals, medical care
       and foster care for sick, injured, or young animals; low-cost vaccination clinics; spay
       and neuter services; licensing; microchipping; and public awareness and education
       programs on animal care.
       The Animal Care and Services Department includes field services staff, veterinarians,
       animal handlers and caretakers, program coordinators, and support staff. The
       Department typically assists over 6,000 animals a year. In addition to the services
       mentioned above, the Department also provides strong support for community and
       volunteer programs, field services, behavior training, and education and outreach.
       Department staff is committed to working with animals to socialize them and to
       encourage better behavior, calm frightened animals, and improve overall adoptability.
       The Adoption Center provides proactive socialization programs, as well as education
       tips for adopters to help pets succeed in fitting into their new homes. The Center also
       provides medical services.
       Community Programs and Volunteering
       The City is committed to providing and encouraging community and volunteer
       programs. The Adoption Center has more than 200 volunteers who actively help
       keep pets loved, exercised, socialized, trained, and active while seeking new homes.
       They also participate in special events to help raise donations such as the “Bark in
       the Park” nights during baseball games at the Epicenter. Volunteers and fundraising
       are the primary ways to enable foster care, and are essential to outreach events, dog
       walking, fundraisers, and many other services.

Field Services
The Field Services Officers are on call seven days a week, 24 hours a day to
respond to animal law enforcement and rescue concerns in the City. The services
they provide include capturing vicious or dangerous animals and rescuing stray, sick,
injured, or abandoned animals. They also investigate cases of animal cruelty or
neglect; pick up confined, stray, or deceased animals; and respond to common
complaints such as excessive barking, and leash and licensing violations.
Education and Outreach
A major emphasis of the Animal Care and Services Department is related to
education and public outreach. The Department has a multimedia website that
actively engages the public and provides information on animal care, the services
provided by the Department, and the ability to view stray and adoptable animals. The
Department also takes educational materials and adoptable pets to events and
locations in the area to increase knowledge and awareness of proper pet care and
showcase adoptable pets.
In addition to focusing on pets, the Department reaches out to increase public
awareness regarding wild animals. Development in the foothills can impact natural
open space, displacing animals that are involuntarily forced to live closer to urban
development. The Department looks to minimize wildlife accidents on roads and
deter raccoons, opossums, skunks, mice and rats, mountain lions, birds, and coyotes
from urban areas. Department programs emphasize education over extermination.
Infrastructure
Rancho Cucamonga requires a sophisticated system of public facilities and
infrastructure to keep the City running. Water distribution and wastewater facilities
are necessary for the daily needs of residential and non-residential uses. Integrated
waste management and flood control facilities help ensure the health and safety of
the community. The City depends upon state-of-the-art telecommunications
infrastructure for fast and efficient methods of obtaining and transmitting information
and data. Maintaining and adding new infrastructure systems are costly but vital to
the long-term health and prosperity of the community. The City of Rancho
Cucamonga is committed to providing the most affordable options for ensuring a
high-quality infrastructure system.
Water Facilities
Water services in Rancho Cucamonga are provided by the Cucamonga Valley Water
District (CVWD), a special district created as a separate entity from the City, and with
the sole purpose of providing high-quality, safe, and reliable water services. In
addition to Rancho Cucamonga, the CVWD serves portions of the cities of Upland,
Ontario, and Fontana, and some unincorporated areas of San Bernardino County. In
total, CVWD has approximately 49,600 water connections and serves a population of
approximately 186,000 within a 47 square-mile area. This section describes the
infrastructure that treats, stores, and distributes the water. The Resource
Conservation Chapter (Chapter 6) describes the water supply sources utilized by
CVWD.

                             Water Storage and Distribution
                             As of 2006, CVWD maintained 23 groundwater wells, of which 13 were in service
                             with a maximum production capacity of 20,490 gallons per minute (or an annual
                             production equivalent of 33,076 acre-feet).1
                             CVWD’s water distribution system is comprised of 690 miles of distribution mains, 22
                             pump stations, and 39 pressure-reducing valve stations. The CVWD has 34 water
                             storage facilities that vary in size from 13 to 16 million gallons, with a combined
                             design storage capacity of 89.6 million gallons. Seven storage facilities are located in
                             the higher elevations above 2,267 feet.
                             The CVWD continues to refine and improve its water system maintenance and
                             operation procedures to ensure reliability. Its maintenance practices help reduce
                             water loss from leaks in the distribution system, which contributes to the amount of
                             available potable water in the City.

                             waters and groundwater, CVWD has developed three water treatment facilities so
                             that water quality meets all Federal and State requirements:
                                        Arthur H. Bridge Treatment Plant
                                        Royer Nesbit Treatment Plant
                                        Lloyd W. Michael Treatment Plant
                             Water that is imported from the Metropolitan Water District is treated at the Lloyd W.
                             Michael Water Treatment Plant. The treated water flows into storage reservoirs and
                             then into the distribution system. Groundwater and surface water is treated at the
                             Arthur H. Bridge and Royer Nesbit Water Treatment Plants. After treatment, the
                             water is stored in enclosed reservoirs ready for distribution to consumers.

Water Quality
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), California Department of
Health Services, and California Public Utilities Commission are the agencies
responsible for establishing drinking water quality standards. To ensure that drinking
water is safe for consumption, the EPA sets Federal regulations that limit the
amounts of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems.
Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at
least small amounts of some contaminants. As water travels over the surface of the
land or through the layers in the ground, naturally occurring minerals and, in some
cases, radioactive materials dissolve, and water can pick up substances resulting
from the presence of animal or human activity. The presence of contaminants does
not necessarily mean water may be a health risk. Contaminants that may be present
in source water include:
         Nitrate, viruses, and coliform bacteria, which may come from sewage
          treatment plants, over fertilization, septic systems, agricultural livestock
          operations, and wildlife
         Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally
          occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic
          wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining, and farming
         Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such
          as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses
         Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic
          chemicals, which are byproducts of industrial processes and petroleum
          production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff,
          and septic systems
         Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring, or can be the
          result of oil and gas production and mining activities
Since 1991, California water utilities, including CVWD, have mailed an annual Water
Quality Report to customers. Potable water provided by CVWD to Rancho
Cucamonga has consistently met Federal and State standards.
Wastewater
Wastewater is any water that drains from showers, sinks, and toilets in buildings.
Other sources of wastewater include laundry facilities and industrial and
manufacturing operations. Wastewater conveyance is handled by the City and
CVWD, and wastewater is processed by CVWD and the Inland Empire Utilities
Agency (IEUA). CVWD oversees the facilities and infrastructure that transport
wastewater to treatment plants operated by the IEUA. At IEUA treatment plants,
wastewater is subject to tertiary-level water treatment, an advanced process that
produces effluent suitable for re-use.
The IEUA operates the wastewater Regional Plant No. 4 located at the intersection of
6th Street and Etiwanda Avenue in Rancho Cucamonga. This wastewater plant has
been in operation since 1997 and treats an annual flow of seven million gallons per
day, with an ultimate build-out capacity of 28 million gallons per day.
Recycled Water
CVWD and IEUA have been working to increase the supply of recycled water through
the Regional Water Recycling Project. Recycled water is former wastewater that has
been treated to remove solids and certain impurities, and is available for non-potable

                             uses. CVWD has been upgrading infrastructure to further distribute recycled water
                             throughout its service area. Recycled water is a new source of water for CVWD and
                             is a sustainable method of efficiently re-using water.
                             In addition to receiving recycled water from IEUA, CVWD will also be providing
                             recycled water to users. CVWD is considering constructing two wastewater recycling
                             facilities. These state-of-the-art facilities would treat wastewater to strict Federal and
                             State standards so it can be used for irrigation and other beneficial purposes.
                             Working with IEUA and by constructing two wastewater recycling facilities, CVWD’s
                             goal is to produce and distribute up to 21,600 acre-feet of recycled water each year
                             by 2030. This would free enough drinkable water to supply the annual needs of over
                             10,000 homes within the CVWD service area. For more information regarding
                             recycled water, see Chapter 6: Resource Conservation.
                             Storm Drainage and Flood Control
                             Rancho Cucamonga’s storm drainage and flood control system provides both
                             regional and local drainage, and provides debris basins and spreading grounds
                             designed to reduce mud flows. The City, through its Engineering and Public Works
                             Departments, is responsible for the localized facilities. The Streets and Storm Drain
                             Maintenance group of the City’s Public Works Department maintains 104 miles of
                             storm drains and an additional 2,200 drainage structures throughout the City. The
                             San Bernardino County Flood Control District is responsible for the regional facilities.
                             Together, the City and the San Bernardino County Flood Control District coordinate
                             the preparation of drainage plans and review development projects using design
                             criteria established by the County Flood Control District.
                             The City has prepared two drainage plans for the east and west portions of the
                             community. The purpose of the drainage plans is to establish a means to collect
                             revenue from development to offset the cost of constructing the system.

           Avenue extending to the easterly City limits, north of 4th Street.
The City’s drainage plans provide a drainage system consisting of regional mainline,
secondary regional, and master plan facilities that will adequately convey a 100-year
storm event based upon certain drainage criteria. The plans provide for the
establishment of a drainage system hierarchy as shown in Table PF-4.

       Stormwater Quality
       The Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant to
       navigable waters from a point source unless the discharge is authorized by a
       National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. NPDES permit
       requirements were established in 1987 with the passage of the Water Quality Act.
       The NPDES permit program controls water pollution by regulating point sources that
       discharge pollutants into the so-called waters of the United States.
       In Rancho Cucamonga, NPDES permits are issued by the California Regional Water
       Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region (RWQCB) as part of its Stormwater
       Program. The Santa Ana Region issues permits to three counties — Orange,
       Riverside, and San Bernardino — and all incorporated cities within those counties.
       Rancho Cucamonga’s Environmental Programs Section of the Engineering
       Department leads educational efforts that encourage protection of natural resources
       and prevention of stormwater pollution. These educational efforts are implemented
       through school presentations, community outreach, and site and business
       inspections.
       The Environmental Programs Section is also responsible for the administration of the
       City's Integrated Waste Management and Household Hazardous Waste programs,
       which follow guidelines that have been set forth in Assembly Bill 939, as well as the
       San Bernardino County Stormwater NPDES permit rules as prescribed by the Santa
       Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board.
       Integrated Waste Management
       Integrated Waste Management contributes to Healthy RC goals by focusing on
       reducing materials that enter the landfill through encouraging waste reduction, re-
       use, recycling, and composting. Minimizing the volume of trash that enters landfills
       conserves resources and protects the environment from the negative impacts
       associated with waste disposal. As landfill space diminishes, waste reduction, re-use,
       recycling, and composting become even more necessary to reduce demand on
       nonrenewable resources. Using recycled products also lowers energy consumption,
       as manufacturing new products from recycled materials often uses significantly less
       energy than manufacturing from raw materials. Reducing the amount of waste going
       to landfills also helps curb global warming, as waste in landfills decomposes
       anaerobically and produces methane, which has approximately 23 times more
       greenhouse gas effects than CO2.
       In addition to using disposed material for recycling, organic solid waste such as food
       scraps, fallen leaves, grass clippings, and plant and tree trimmings can be used for
       compost. Construction and building demolition debris produces large quantities of
       solid waste, much of which can be recycled or processed for re-use. One of the basic
       principles of “Green Building,” which is discussed in Chapter 8: Resource
       Conservation, is to use recycled and re-used materials in new construction.
       Solid waste collection and transport are handled by contracted private firms that haul
       collected materials to several regional landfills and materials recycling facilities. For
       household waste disposal, Rancho Cucamonga contracts with a private hauling firm
       that utilizes a three container system for recycling and waste disposal. The blue bin
       allows for recyclable materials including paper, cartons, metal cans and trays, glass
       bottles and jars, and plastic container items. The green bin allows for green waste
       such as grass clippings, brush, prunings, leaves, tree trimmings, twigs, weeds, and

other green waste. The black bin allows for materials that are not recyclable or
compostable.
The City also implements various programs with local businesses and public
agencies to increase recycling efforts. See Table PF-5: Recycling Programs for
additional recycling programs. Chapter 8: Public Health and Safety includes
discussion on hazardous disposal facilities.

Rancho Cucamonga utilizes
   a three-container system
 for disposal and recycling.
                             In order to reduce the amount of solid waste generated in California, the California
                             Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) was created in 1989 to oversee the
                             reporting of solid waste disposal by cities and counties. The CIWMB required that the
                             amount of solid waste sent to landfills be reduced by 50 percent by the year 2000,
                             per Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939). Rancho Cucamonga implemented a series of
                             programs for recycling materials that significantly decreased the amount of waste the
                             City sent to landfills. In 2000, Rancho Cucamonga was diverting 35 percent of its
                             waste from landfills. By 2006, Rancho Cucamonga diverted 57 percent of its waste
                             from landfills through recycling and re-use.
                             In 2008, the California State Senate passed Senate Bill 1016 (SB 1016) that builds
                             upon AB 939. Instead of looking at diversion rates for cities and counties, the new
                             law requires jurisdictions to report waste generation factors based on disposal
                             weight, as reported by disposal facilities, and reported population and employment
                             data. Table PF-6: Disposal Rates identifies target and disposal rates for 2007 and
                             2008. The City of Rancho Cucamonga has achieved and exceeded the target
                             numbers identified by CIWMB in SB 1016 and continues to improve existing
                             programs, as well as develop and implement new programs to minimize waste
                             generation and increase recycling.

Communications
Residents, businesses, and institutions in Rancho Cucamonga rely on
communications infrastructure systems — telephone lines, fiber optic cables, and the
airwaves — that allow them to stay connected to friends and family and run their
operations efficiently.
Telecommunications
Telecommunications is the transmission of communication over a long distance.
Telecommunications consists of technologies such as fiber optics, electric wave
transmission lines, and wireless transmissions, with the methods of transmission
evolving rapidly as science and technology advance. These technologies have been
incorporated into daily life, and businesses find it critical to use new
telecommunications technologies and devices to remain successful and competitive.
Residents expect good access and service for entertainment, education, and social
purposes.
Because telecommunications service providers are private enterprises, the City’s role
is focused on quality service and equal access to telecommunication technologies for
all local users, and on helping businesses attain competitive advantages through
state-of-the-art telecommunication systems. The City supports the use of continually
evolving telecommunications technology to help improve local businesses and
improve the quality of life for residents.
RCTV-3
RCTV-3, the government access cable television channel managed by the City of
Rancho Cucamonga, provides Rancho Cucamonga area viewers with informational
messages concerning programs and events sponsored or co-sponsored by the City,
local school districts, and other local government agencies. In addition to these
community messages, RCTV-3 broadcasts the Rancho Cucamonga City Council
meetings. RCTV-3 also provides public educational video programming regarding
various safety, environmental, recreational, and government-related issues.
Public Facilities and
Infrastructure Issues
Key issues relative to public facilities and infrastructure include:
         Well-designed Public Facilities. Multi-functional public facilities provide
          programmable space that can adapt to meet the diverse program and
          service needs of an evolving population. Multi-functional facilities provide a
          more efficient use of space than specialized facilities. As the number of
          different programs offered by the City outpaces the construction of new
          facilities, multi-functioning facilities will be even more important.
         Library Facilities and Services Expansion. Libraries serve as an
          educational resource, a place for personal enrichment, and a place for
          engagement and entertainment. The increasing popularity of the City’s
          Libraries has resulted in a few issues. First, library facilities have suffered
 
Public Facilities and Infrastructure                                                       
R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N                                   PF‐25

        
        
           from limited space, impacting the amount of materials that can be put in
           circulation. Additionally, there is a growing demand for diverse programs
           and materials, and more on-line and technology services are being
           requested by library patrons.
          Animal Services. Caring for domestic animals and pets is a major
           responsibility and commitment for residents. Spaying and neutering,
           vaccinations, licensing, and animal care education are just some of the
           important services for maintaining healthy pets. It is also important to
           understand about coexisting with local area wildlife.
          Coordination with Local School Districts. Rancho Cucamonga is served
           by multiple school districts and faces challenges in coordinating with all the
           districts. Each district has developed different standards for school planning
           programs, site development schedules, and policies regarding joint use of
           school facilities. The City will have to continue coordinating independently
           with each individual school district for programs, services, or developments.
          Accommodate New School Sites. As the City continues to grow, the City
           must consider the accommodation of additional school sites to meet the
           needs of the community. Although school capacity issues are largely the
           responsibility of the various school districts, the location of any new schools
           must be coordinated and planned jointly by the City and the school district
           involved. Planning considerations such as appropriate surrounding land
           uses, the physical location of any new schools, and the potential to develop
           joint use facilities must be coordinated.
          Maintenance and Expansion of Storm Drain Facilities. Storm drain and
           other flood control facilities must be maintained, and as new development
           occurs, the system must be developed further to serve our needs. Future
           development can decrease the amount of permeable ground area that can
           absorb water, which in turn can increase stormwater runoff volumes that
           must be controlled. Continual monitoring of both local and regional water
           facilities by a concerted effort of the City’s Engineering and Public Works
           Departments and the San Bernardino County Flood Control District will be
           needed.
           Certain areas within the Industrial Specific Plan planning area (located in
           the southern portion of the City) may require additional detention facilities
           on a case-by-case basis to provide 100-year flood protection for the
           structures on these properties. These detention facilities are important in
           that they prevent flooding in the case of a major storm.
          Waste Management. Excessive product waste, building and construction
           waste, and landscaping materials can enter landfills when many of these
           materials can be reused, recycled, and composted. Local landfills are
           slowly being filled to capacity. It will become costlier to transport waste to
           disposals sites farther away.
          Communications. Technology is continually changing. Rancho
           Cucamonga is committed to providing the state-of-the-art technology
           wherever and whenever feasible. The City is also focused on maintaining
           affordability and equal access to all users, including individuals, businesses,
           educational institutions, and government functions.

Public Facilities and Infrastructure Goals
and Policies
The following goals and policies are aimed at providing guidance and policy direction for public facilities and
infrastructure in Rancho Cucamonga. These goals and policies ensure that public facilities and infrastructure will
continually be expanded, improved, and maintained.
GOAL PF-1:           Provide state-of-the-art public and community facilities that
                     support existing programs, accommodate future needs, and are
                     accessible to all members of the community.
                 Policy PF-1.1:    Continue to implement high-quality standards for new public
                                   facilities and improvements to existing buildings.
                     Discussion:   Rancho Cucamonga enjoys quality public facilities due to a
                                   community heritage of insisting upon quality projects. The results
                                   are evident throughout the community, and the expectation for
                                   high-quality facilities is reflected in the community values. High-
                                   quality facilities have contributed significantly to the attractiveness
                                   of Rancho Cucamonga as a place in which investment in property
                                   is a wise decision. While initial costs are greater for superior
                                   quality, long-term value is well worth the investment.
                                   The City shall explore various ways to measure and manage the
                                   impacts of incorporating innovative sustainability features within
                                   new construction and the retrofit of older structures. The City’s
                                   program will focus on identifying minimum standards based on
                                   Green Building programs. Project review will remain in house
                                   with City staff.
                 Policy PF-1.2:    Promote community facilities as focal points for gatherings,
                                   events, and celebrations.
                     Discussion:   Community facilities act as the hub of activity in the community.
                                   Within these facilities, many services and programs important to
                                   the community are provided. In addition, many of the facilities are
                                   physically located in areas that are highly trafficked. In
                                   combination, these facilities become key natural focal points in
                                   the community and should be maintained as such.
                 Policy PF-1.3:    Locate new community facilities in neighborhoods and
                                   centers where they will serve populations with the greatest
                                   needs.

           Discussion: Community facilities are intended to provide programs and
                       services to the community and serve the greatest purpose when
                       located in areas that have the greatest needs. Locating
                       community facilities where populations are underserved and have
                       great needs serves two functions: it creates equal access to
                       community programs and services throughout the community,
                       and it helps provide local focal points.
       Policy PF-1.4:  Maintain public facilities and optimize their usefulness
                       during their lifespan.
           Discussion: The maintenance, rehabilitation, and renovation of facilities
                       extends their life and usefulness. Inevitably, technologies in
                       facilities will become outdated and buildings and furnishings
                       suffer from the wear and tear of use. Continual maintenance and
                       renovations are needed to ensure quality facility operations and
                       keep technologies useful and current. Existing City facilities will
                       potentially be retrofitted in the future as funding becomes
                       available and sustainable features will be added to meet LEED
                       standards or equivalent.
       Policy PF-1.5:  Continue to incorporate low-maintenance features into
                       public facilities consistent with the City’s sustainability plan.
           Discussion: In support of creating more sustainable public facilities and
                       improvements, the City’s facilities should continue to incorporate
                       low-maintenance features. This does not mean lower quality. Low
                       maintenance means the use of building materials and landscape
                       features that are well adapted to the climate and have long useful
                       life cycles. Examples include use of plentiful river rock that has
                       been a hallmark of the region for decades and plantings that
                       follow water efficient landscaping principles.
       Policy PF-1.6:  Maintain multi-functional, flexible, and complementary space
                       at community facilities.
           Discussion: Existing City facilities contain spaces that are flexible,
                       complement each other, and can function as business meeting
                       rooms, celebration halls, community event spaces, and
                       classrooms. Facilities need to retain these qualities to adapt to a
                       wider array of events, remain flexible for any City or private
                       programmable needs, and to ensure that a variety of programs,
                       services, and events can be hosted at any time.
       Policy PF-1.7:  Maximize public facility use by sharing with nonprofit
                       organizations,       school      districts,    and      community
                       organizations. Look for opportunities to create joint-use
                       community space at facilities owned by private
                       organizations such as faith-based groups and service clubs.
           Discussion: Existing meeting halls, spaces, and other facilities owned or
                       operated by community organizations and school districts are
                       abundant in Rancho Cucamonga. Supplementing City facilities by
                       pursuing partnerships and joint use agreements to utilize or share
                       these spaces provides the City with a larger service area and can
                       extend public outreach throughout the City.
                                                                                                           
                                                                      Public Facilities and Infrastructure

GOAL PF-2:           Improve access for all Rancho Cucamonga residents to high-
                     quality educational opportunities that satisfy each individual’s
                     needs, desires, and potential.
                 Policy PF-2.1:    Consult with local school districts to enhance the
                                   development of joint-use agreements, allowing for optimum
                                   use of school facilities, to provide broad community benefits
                                   such as public safety and education.
                     Discussion:   Rancho Cucamonga has been actively involved with the school
                                   districts serving the community in establishing agreements for
                                   joint facility use. The agreements vary in the degree to which
                                   mutually beneficial arrangements have been achieved. This effort
                                   needs to be sustained and expanded to achieve even greater
                                   optimization of school facilities to service the entire community.
                                   This effort may need to include even more creative sharing of
                                   responsibilities and costs, such as custodial and maintenance
                                   services, security, and supplementary facility construction to
                                   leverage existing school facilities. It may also be beneficial to
                                   seek establishment of new coordinating mechanisms, such as the
                                   formation of a joint City/Districts planning and design committee,
                                   creation of model contracts or memoranda of understanding, and
                                   documentation of program use where that has been particularly
                                   successful. To the extent that this effort could involve several
                                   districts and the City concurrently, there may be an opportunity to
                                   think much more broadly about shared facility opportunities,
                                   benefits, and equitable means of sharing costs.
                Policy PF-2.2:     Consider the needs of the school districts that serve Rancho
                                   Cucamonga in future planning and development activities.
                     Discussion:   The City has historically indicated in the General Plan the location
                                   of existing school sites, and has carefully considered the land use
                                   impacts of planning policy and development in those general
                                   areas. In the past, the City has coordinated the location of City
                                   parks adjacent to future school sites, where feasible. This
                                   collaborative approach is the foundation for all other cooperative
                                   arrangements involving City and school district facilities. This
                                   approach continues to be reflected in the General Plan.
                Policy PF-2.3:     Partner with local public and private schools and Chaffey
                                   Community College to maintain effective educational
                                   programs for residents of all ages.
                     Discussion:   The City understands that quality education helps strengthen the
                                   community by providing a more skilled workforce and citizens
                                   with greater awareness and understanding. Providing effective
                                   education programs, such as after-school tutoring, reading
                                   programs, etc., should be the responsibility of both the City and
                                   the educational institutions involved. Partnering with local public
                                   and private schools and Chaffey Community College can serve to
                                   identify populations that need educational programs the most and
                                   expand the amount of students that benefit from such programs.

         Policy PF-2.4:   Consult with school districts to explore grant funding
                          opportunities for joint City and school district partnerships
                          and programs.
              Discussion: Partnering with school districts is a cost-effective method of
                          sharing knowledge and resources for both the City and school
                          districts, improving and expanding educational opportunities and
                          funding that benefits all students in the City.
GOAL PF-3:    Provide high-quality library resources to meet the educational,
              cultural, civic, and business needs of all residents.
          Policy PF-3.1:  Continue to provide high-quality library services to the
                          community, including supporting the Archibald Library and
                          Paul A. Biane Library.
              Discussion: The quality of library services in the City can be considered very
                          high; however, the City has identified some issues that need to
                          be resolved to maintain the very high quality of service. The
                          space limitation of existing facilities is a hindrance to expanding
                          the Libraries collection of materials. In order to expand the
                          materials available to the community, a long-term building
                          program is necessary. The City has devised a plan consisting of
                          short-, intermediate-, and long-term strategies to sustain quality
                          library services to the community. The City intends to expand
                          current levels of service by expanding document collections,
                          improving storage capacity, providing expanded hours of
                          operation, providing continuous on-line access, and diversifying
                          outlet (physical access) locations.
         Policy PF-3.2:   Continue to improve the local Libraries system, complete
                          with community facilities that provide knowledgeable,
                          service-oriented staff and offer access to information, books,
                          and other materials in a variety of formats, including
                          emerging technologies. Consider future options for
                          providing library services that are flexible, and will maximize
                          library services while keeping costs affordable.
              Discussion: The City has devised creative strategies that must be undertaken
                          to improve the high quality of library services provided. The City
                          strategy involves a three-tiered approach, each of which seeks to
                          continue the cost effectiveness of library services under ever-
                          changing circumstances. Short-term strategies focus on
                          achieving maximum service with existing facilities and seeking a
                          variety of non-conventional outlets for library materials to
                          supplement the libraries and the bookmobile now in use.
                          Intermediate strategies focus on possibly adding library facilities
                          in the most underserved areas of the City and continually
                          expanding use of technology. Long-term strategies encompass a
                          new and expandable main library, expanding the eastern branch,
                          and continued use of technology to diversify access modes.
         Policy PF-3.3:   Continue to foster pride in the Library as a place for the
                          entire community.
                                                                                                               
                                                                          Public Facilities and Infrastructure 
PF‐30                                   R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

                     Discussion:   The strategy for sustaining quality services is focused on
                                   preserving community pride, not only in terms of superior access
                                   to reading and research materials, but also in terms of creativity
                                   in providing those services.
                Policy PF-3.4:     Lead by example by successfully considering the full “life-
                                   cycle” cost for new public library facilities and
                                   improvements to existing library facilities.
                     Discussion:   Considering the full life-cycle costs of new public library facilities
                                   and improvements can provide economic and environmental
                                   benefits to the City. Designing new facilities to utilize natural
                                   processes such as lighting, heating, and cooling can help reduce
                                   the use of energy needed to operate library facilities as well as
                                   reduce operating costs. Actualizing a successful building model
                                   for developing facilities that reduces life-cycle costs can provide a
                                   template for other public facilities as well as private development
                                   to follow.
                Policy PF-3.5:     Assist and support life-long learning for adults through
                                   computer training programs and comprehensive library
                                   collections.
                     Discussion:   Technical skills such as computer skills and access to
                                   comprehensive materials are beneficial to adults for numerous
                                   reasons. Learning new computer skills can help improve job
                                   prospects for adults entering the work force or changing careers,
                                   and it can help improve job skills of those adults currently
                                   employed. Life-long learning also helps exercise and expand the
                                   mind for those adults seeking to satisfy personal enrichment
                                   goals.
                Policy PF-3.6:     Encourage non-exclusive, cross-generational cultural
                                   activities and resources that are accessible to people of all
                                   ages and backgrounds.
                     Discussion:   Inclusivity is a strong theme in the City. Activities and resources
                                   provided in the City need to appeal and be accessible to
                                   everyone. This means the City will encourage a wide array of
                                   programs, activities, and resources that can be utilized by anyone
                                   of any age, race, sex, fitness and health level, and are accessible
                                   to everyone regardless of where they live in the community.
GOAL PF-4:           Provide animal care and services, including facilitation of
                     adoptions, promotion of animal health and safety, and animal
                     awareness education.
                 Policy PF-4.1:    Provide and enhance services and programs that promote
                                   the health and safety of domestic animals.

            Discussion: Services and programs that promote the health and safety of
                        animals also indirectly benefit the community at large. The Animal
                        Care and Adoption Center facility provides services such as
                        administering preventative vaccinations. Vaccinations against
                        rabies not only protects animals, but rabies can be easily
                        transferred to humans and can pose a serious health risk. Lost
                        and found services help collect stray animals that roam the
                        streets and provide a central location for reuniting owners with
                        their lost pets. Behavioral services help train and heal aggressive
                        or feral animals that may pose a public risk or nuisance.
       Policy PF-4.2:   Provide and enhance programs dedicated to protecting the
                        well-being of companion animals and ensuring a humane
                        standard of care.
            Discussion: Just as a human would, animal companions can physically feel
                        pain and stress associated with cruel acts or uncomfortable living
                        circumstances. Programs and services that promote humane
                        treatment of animals include the RC Pets Academy, which offers
                        public information and resources about proper care of animals.
       Policy PF-4.3:   Continue to maintain and improve the Animal Care and
                        Adoption Center facility.
            Discussion: The Animal Care and Adoption Center facility is the main hub for
                        the numerous animal services and programs that are provided in
                        the City. The facility serves as an adoption center for those
                        wanting to own an animal, a lost/found center for owners who
                        have lost their pets, and as an emergency medical services
                        center for animals in need. The facility also hosts many programs
                        and services such as spaying and neutering, animal rehabilitation
                        and training, animal licensing, and field services.
       Policy PF-4.4:   Coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to promote
                        the health and welfare of animals.
            Discussion: The coordination of services and resources provided by the City
                        and other agencies and jurisdictions can help join similar efforts
                        to produce greater results. The City will continue to support and
                        participate in events and campaigns such as the low cost
                        spay/neuter clinic program that was held in partnership with
                        Upland and Base Line Veterinary Hospitals, and the Northtown
                        Housing Development Corporation.
       Policy PF-4.5:   Continue to host and participate in special events,
                        promotions, and fairs to increase awareness of adoptions
                        and raise funds for animal care and services.
                                                                                                             
                                                                        Public Facilities and Infrastructure 
PF‐32                                 R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

                     Discussion:   Special events and fundraising have been critical to providing the
                                   resources needed to maintain the numerous animal programs
                                   and services provided by the City. The City is aware that events
                                   are a great tool for reaching out to the community and like-
                                   minded animal groups for support, as well as providing a fun and
                                   entertaining event for everyone to enjoy. Events that the City will
                                   continue to host and participate in include: “Bark in the Park,”
                                   where pets can attend a baseball event at the Epicenter; Rancho
                                   Raves for Rescues, where animal rescue groups showcase their
                                   organizations; Home for the Holidays and PetSmart National Pet
                                   Adoption campaigns, for animal placement; and “Ruff Ride,” a
                                   fundraising event.
                Policy PF-4.6:     Increase public awareness and knowledge of proper pet
                                   care, the importance of spaying and neutering, and
                                   coexisting with local area wildlife.
                     Discussion:   Awareness of pet issues and a supportive community will help
                                   the Animal Care and Services Department with its mission of
                                   saving animals’ lives, bringing people and pets together, and
                                   ensuring public health and safety. To increase public awareness
                                   the City believes it is important to build a community relationship.
                                   Past and continual efforts to increase public awareness have
                                   included service and educational campaigns and events that
                                   have brought resources, staff, and volunteers out of the Animal
                                   Center and into the community.
                                   Although wildlife in Rancho Cucamonga neighborhoods may
                                   initially seem to be a concern, most wild animals are not
                                   dangerous to humans. The Animal Care and Services
                                   Department assists residents in balancing wildlife “care” and
                                   “control.” The Department provides information and facts to
                                   residents about coexisting peacefully with local wildlife.
GOAL PF-5:           Ensure provision of water infrastructure to support future growth
                     needs and existing development.
                Policy PF-5.1:     Support programs of the CVWD that make every practical
                                   effort to minimize leaks in the water and recycled water
                                   distribution systems, through regular monitoring and
                                   maintenance.
                     Discussion:   Maintaining water storage and the distribution system is very
                                   important when providing reliable water service. Continual
                                   maintenance and long-term improvements will reduce
                                   unnecessary disruptions in the supply of water.
                Policy PF-5.2:     Support the efforts of the CVWD and San Bernardino County
                                   agencies to provide and expand water treatment facilities to
                                   treat local water sources from canyon surface waters and
                                   groundwater.
                     Discussion:   With the Cucamonga Valley Water District focusing on the
                                   expansion of local water supplies, it is important that they provide
                                   adequate water treatment facilities that will treat the necessary
                                   increase in water.

GOAL PF-6:     Provide adequate and reliable wastewater collection and
               treatment facilities to meet current and future needs.
           Policy PF-6.1:  Continue to ensure an adequate treatment and collection
                           system capacity for Rancho Cucamonga’s wastewater that is
                           conveyed to the Inland Empire Utilities Agency water
                           reclamation facilities, while protecting water quality and
                           public health and minimizing adverse impacts to the
                           environment.
               Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga’s wastewater system is currently operating
                           at sound levels. Periodic analysis by the CVWD and other
                           responsible agencies is needed to ensure that operating levels
                           remain the same. As development occurs, the City must work
                           with the appropriate agencies to conduct analysis and expand
                           accordingly to ensure the entire system remains adequate.
         Policy PF-6.2:    Consult with the Inland Empire Utilities Agency and the
                           Cucamonga Valley Water District to ensure that the
                           treatment facility has sufficient capacity to meet future
                           wastewater treatment needs.
               Discussion: Provision of wastewater treatment facilities includes consideration
                           of both treatment plants and sewer lines. The City has worked
                           closely with the responsible agencies to ensure that development
                           conditions properly support expansion of these facilities and that
                           management responsibility will continue to be provided as further
                           growth occurs. Over time, the burden on wastewater facilities
                           may be diminished to a limited degree by such techniques as
                           water conservation programs and increased use of reclaimed
                           water. The City intends to remain a leader in these techniques
                           where they are practical as part of the commitment to responsible
                           waste management practices. This is particularly critical, given
                           the significance of waste management practices on the huge
                           Santa Ana River watershed that constitutes an important natural
                           system serving the community and much of the greater
                           metropolitan region.
GOAL PF-7:     Minimize the volume of solid waste that enters regional landfills
               and encourage recycling.
           Policy PF-7.1:  Continue to adopt programs and practices that minimize the
                           amount of materials entering the waste stream. Encourage
                           recycling and composting in all sectors of the community,
                           including recycling of construction and demolition materials,
                           in order to divert items from entering landfills.

                     Discussion:   The City has conducted aggressive waste reduction programs to
                                   comply with provisions of State law. These programs ensure that
                                   the City does its part to minimize the amount of materials that
                                   enter the waste stream. In addition, the City supports educational
                                   efforts that encourage preventative practices such as recycling,
                                   re-using, and composting in both the private and public sectors.
                Policy PF-7.2:     Consult with public agencies and private contractors to
                                   ensure adequate refuse collection and disposal facilities are
                                   available.
                     Discussion:   The City’s refuse and disposal needs are jointly handled by a
                                   concerted effort of public agencies and private contractors.
                                   Periodic and productive consultations with these groups are
                                   needed to ensure that proper collection and disposal facilities will
                                   be available to the City for the immediate and long-term future.
                Policy PF-7.3:     Embrace the sustainability principle that recognizes and
                                   takes advantage of the life cycle of goods and materials.
                     Discussion:   Understanding the environmental impacts of the life-cycle (how a
                                   product is made, used, and disposed of) of goods and materials
                                   is important to making more sustainable choices. City purchasing
                                   and operating habits can be altered to choose those goods and
                                   materials that are environmentally sustainable, yet cost-effective.
                                   Incorporating sustainable materials can be immediately
                                   implemented in City operations as a simple strategy to improve
                                   the environment. City use of sustainable goods and materials can
                                   be used as an example to educate the community on making
                                   better choices at home or in their workplace.
                Policy PF-7.4:     Serve as a role model to businesses and institutions
                                   regarding practices and procedures that minimize the
                                   generation of solid waste.
                     Discussion:   The City already implements waste reducing measures such as
                                   the use of electronic documents and processing, reducing the
                                   need for paper use. Implementation measures developed and
                                   used by the City can serve as a best practice model and real
                                   world example of what private sector businesses can accomplish.
                Policy PF-7.5:     Continue to educate the community regarding the benefits of
                                   solid waste diversion, recycling and composting, and
                                   maintain programs that make it easy for all people in Rancho
                                   Cucamonga to work toward and achieve City waste
                                   reduction objectives.
                     Discussion:   Recycling can reduce the pollutants emitted from the generation
                                   of new materials. The City will continue to promote local recycling
                                   of waste and use of recycled materials by implementing
                                   provisions of AB 939 and SB 1016 and adopting incentives,
                                   regulations, and procedures to specify local recycling
                                   requirements.

              Discussion: Technology continually changes and Rancho Cucamonga
                          supports accommodating any new technologies that are
                          developed. The City recognizes that certain new technologies
                          make life easier, assist in business development, and are useful
                          for educational purposes. The City is committed to providing
                          state-of-the-art technology wherever and whenever feasible.

Introduction
Rancho Cucamonga has long emphasized a proactive approach to public health and
                                                                                        Chapter 8:

      Rancho Cucamonga is located at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. This
      proximity creates the potential for natural hazards. Faults located at the base of the
      foothills create the potential for seismic and geologic hazards. Open spaces along
      the foothills can lead to wildland fires, endangering residential properties that abut
      the wildland/urban interface. Canyon creeks and streams can lead to flooding
      hazards during rain storms, while mountain canyons and passes can stir up high
      winds. Industrial properties in the City, as well as in the region, often need to
      transport hazardous materials through Rancho Cucamonga on its freeways and rail
      lines, creating the potential for accidental releases. These are some of the hazards
      the City has faced for many years and is well prepared to manage them through the
      coordinated efforts of its dedicated emergency services entities. This Chapter
      encapsulates the policy direction that enhances the level of protection from natural
      and human-made hazards.
      Achieving Our Vision
      The vision for Rancho Cucamonga is based on a commitment to provide a safe living
      environment for families, businesses, and visitors and placing a high priority on
      planning for potential natural and human-caused hazards. The high level of public
      safety the City provides contributes to the quality of life and sense of community in
      Rancho Cucamonga. The City is a regional leader in environmental sustainability
      efforts and initiatives to reduce carbon production, thereby guarding against climate
      change and the associated local public safety impacts. The City of Rancho
      Cucamonga’s vision for public health and safety is reflected in the following Spirit of

        We are dedicated to a sustainable balance in land use patterns (residential,
         business, educational, agricultural, recreational, open space, and historic
         uses) and supporting transportation.
        We continue to provide a stable City government which respects the
         decisions of the past while being committed to long-range planning initiatives
         and the positive impacts of future development.
Fire and Emergency Services
The Rancho Cucamonga Fire Protection District (RCFPD) serves the combined 50-
square-mile Rancho Cucamonga City and Sphere of Influence area. RCFPD is
responsible for providing community protection by managing numerous programs for
the efficient delivery of fire protection and emergency medical services, as well as
other diverse emergency management and response programs. Personnel are
dedicated to the preservation of life and property in service to the people of Rancho
Cucamonga. In addition to highly skilled firefighters protecting commercial and
industrial structures and homes, the RCFPD has identified specialized skills and
trained many of its members and has equipment to deal with different types of
emergencies. These include:
        Wildland Fire Protection: Firefighters specialize in mitigating fires in the
         Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) areas.
        Emergency Medical Services (EMS): Firefighters trained as Paramedics
         and Emergency Medical Technicians are responsible for providing rapid
         response and assessment of life in threatening situations that result from
         injury or illness.
        Technical Rescue: The Technical Rescue team is a specialized team that is
         trained in confined space rescue, trench rescue, building collapse and
         shoring, swift water rescue, high angle rope rescue, and large animal rescue.
        Hazardous Material: The Hazardous Materials team is a specialized team
         that is trained and certified to take corrective action to prevent or contain the
         spread of hazardous materials from spills, explosion, or fire.
RCFPD is also responsible for enforcing and implementing various community-based
programs to ensure compliance with established fire standards. In addition, a
community based Fire Safe Council has been established to focus on public
education related to the threat of fires in the Wildland Urban Interface (discussed
below). Currently, RCFPD operates six fire stations in the City; two additional fire
stations are proposed, with one currently under construction, as per the
recommendations of the 2005 Strategic Plan.
Wildland Urban Interface Fires
Located along the northern parts of the City is the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI),
which poses an ongoing threat to the community. During the summer season, dry
vegetation, little seasonal rain, and Santa Ana wind conditions can combine to
increase the likelihood of fires in the San Bernardino National Forest, potentially
threatening residential development near the San Gabriel Mountains. New
construction within WUI areas is required to comply with California Building Code
Chapter 7A, including requirements for fire retardant or ignition resistant construction

      materials at roofs, eaves, vents, exterior walls, exterior windows, doors, and decks.
      California Government Code Section 51182 also requires buildings within these
      areas to provide defensible space. Members of the Wildland Fire Protection Team
      work closely with the City’s Emergency Management Program to develop evacuation
      and travel routes in the event of a wildland fire.

      The threat of fire to hillside developments at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains is
      of real concern to Rancho Cucamonga residents living in the foothills. In 2003, the
      Grand Prix Fire burned through the entire WUI area of Rancho Cucamonga over a
      three-day period. Fifteen homes, three of which were in the City and twelve in the
      Sphere of Influence, were destroyed and more were damaged. Thousands of homes
      were threatened and evacuated. Figure PS-1 illustrates the fire hazard severity zones
      and fire protection responsibility areas identified by the California Department of
      Forestry and Fire Prevention (CAL Fire).
      As part of a comprehensive plan to protect Rancho Cucamonga from the threats of
      wildland fires, the RCFPD has established recommendations for fire prevention,
      public education, strategic locations of new fire stations, reduction and modification of
      vegetation, ensurance of adequate water supply, and strict access provisions related
      to new development. These standards are referred to in more detail in the Local
      Hazards Mitigation Plan.
      Urban Structural Fires
      In addition to fires in the WUI, fires also occur within the City’s urban areas. However,
      the threat of urban structural fire conflagration not associated with the WUI is
      relatively low in Rancho Cucamonga. Rancho Cucamonga requires that all new non-
      residential buildings over 5,000 square feet provide built-in fire sprinklers. In addition,
      all multi-family residential unit structures are built with key fire protection features
      including fire sprinklers.

Structural fires occur most frequently in single and multi-family unit dwellings. As the
community grows, new mid-rise and high-rise development will pose additional
challenges for the RCFPD. There is also a commercial and industrial fire risk present,
primarily in older construction, where modern fire protection equipment and systems
have not been installed. To mitigate hazards associated with urban structural fires,
applicable uniform building and fire codes must be continually enforced through a
proactive inspection program.
Emergency Medical Services
RCFPD provides rapid response and assessment of life threatening situations
resulting from injury and illness. The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) program
consists of certified paramedics who provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) services
to treat a variety of illnesses and injuries. Paramedics are responsible for patient
assessment, contact with local hospitals, and advanced treatment.
The RCFPD has been a leader in adopting protocols and technology that enhances
patient care. This includes its 12-lead EKG program, which helps paramedics detect
and treat life threatening heart irregularities in conjunction with San Antonio
Community Hospital.
Most of the medical emergencies in Rancho Cucamonga occur in homes and
businesses. However, the City also experiences traffic accidents, mass casualty
incidents on the freeways, and industrial accidents. Emergency medical services
would also be needed in the event of a Metrolink commuter train accident in the City
or should individuals become injured on hiking trails, along creeks, or within flood
control channels.
Emergency Management
The Emergency Management Program is administered throughout all City
departments and the community by the RCFPD. The program includes all four
phases of effective emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response,
and recovery, incorporated in an all-hazards planning cycle. The cornerstone of the
program is the comprehensive City of Rancho Cucamonga Emergency Operations
Plan. Updated regularly, this document details the City’s responsibility before, during,
and after emergencies. The program also maintains compliance with the federally
mandated National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the State Standardized
Emergency Management System (SEMS) through regular Incident Command
System training and disaster preparedness exercises for employees and the
community.
In addition, the program serves as the liaison for the City’s disaster volunteers, which
include the Auxiliary Communications Service (ACS), responsible for redundant
emergency communication, the Alta Loma Emergency Response Team (ALERT),
responsible for large animal rescue, and the Citizen Corps Program, which contains
the Citizen Emergency Response Team (CERT), providing emergency preparedness
information and disaster training for use by individuals in their own neighborhoods in
times of emergency. The private sector and the business community are also integral
parts of an effective emergency management program. As such, strong relationships
are maintained with the Chamber of Commerce as well as Community Organizations
Active in Disaster (COAD), a coalition of non-profit agencies committed to disaster
response and recovery.
In order to adequately coordinate response activities, the program maintains a fully
dedicated and operationally ready Emergency Operations Center (EOC), which

      serves as a Multi-Agency Coordination System and facilitates immediate
      communication with the San Bernardino County Office of Emergency Services. This
      allows for the full activation of regional, State, and Federal government as necessary.
      Hazardous Materials Threat
      Hazardous materials and chemicals are used daily by industry, businesses, and
      residents. Some hazardous material sources include seemingly innocuous
      businesses such as service stations, medical labs, dry-cleaners, and photo
      processing centers. Others are large firms that may generate large quantities of
      hazardous waste, such as chemical manufacturers, electroplating companies, or
      petroleum distilleries. In addition, commonly used household products such as paints,
      cleaners, oils, batteries, and pesticides contain potentially hazardous ingredients.
      Accidental spills or leaks, illegal dumping of hazardous waste, illegal storage, or a
      transportation accident could release hazardous materials in the community.
      Both the Federal government and the State of California require all businesses that
      store hazardous materials in excess of specified quantities to report their chemical
      inventories in a Hazardous Materials Management Plan. Businesses are also
      required to report releases of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and land, as well as
      off-site transfers of waste to another location. Facilities that store hazardous
      materials are required to report on pollution prevention activities and chemical
      recycling. All of these businesses operate under stringent regulations governing the
      storage, use, manufacturing, and handling of hazardous materials.
      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains and publishes a
      database that lists properties that handle or produce hazardous materials. The EPA
      defines a small quantity waste generator as one that produces between 100 and
      1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month. Small businesses like dry cleaners,
      auto repair shops, hospitals, and metal plating shops usually are defined as
      generators of small quantities of hazardous waste. As of 2009, approximately 130
      small quantity generators operated in Rancho Cucamonga. The EPA defines a large
      quantity generator as a business that produces over 1,000 kilograms of hazardous
      waste per month. Large quantity generators include large manufacturing facilities and
      businesses like chemical manufacturers. As of 2009, 20 large quantity generators
      were located in Rancho Cucamonga. In addition, Rancho Cucamonga has nine
      registered transporters of hazardous waste.
      The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
      (CERCLA), which is also referred to as the Superfund Act, is a Federal law designed
      to protect the environment from risks created from previous chemical disposal
      practices. The EPA designates Superfund sites as neglected or abandoned sites with
      hazardous waste that could possibly threaten local ecosystems and/or the
      community. The EPA assigns “archive” status to sites where no immediate or long-
      term risks to human health are posed. In 2009, the EPA listed one
      CERCLA/Superfund site in Rancho Cucamonga.
      Hazardous Materials Management
      RCFPD is the first responder for any hazardous material emergencies in the
      community, and has a dedicated Hazardous Materials Team at Day Creek Station
      173 (north of Base Line Road). This specialized team is trained in both biological and
      chemical hazardous materials emergency response. Hazardous materials
      emergencies are most likely to occur on local highways and in the industrial area of
      the City.

PS‐8                     R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

RCFPD also coordinates hazardous materials and emergency preparedness
planning and appropriate response efforts with other City departments and outside
agencies. Rancho Cucamonga participates in a county-wide interagency coalition to
better utilize the expertise and equipment that exists within all participating Fire
Districts. The City also adopted a Standardized Emergency Management System
(SEMS) Multi-Hazard Functional Plan to respond to chemical emergencies.
The City of Rancho Cucamonga provides a permanent drop-off facility for household
hazardous waste (HHW) at a San Bernardino County facility within the community.
Both RCFPD and City staff members are trained in hazardous waste handling and
emergency response procedures.
Crime Prevention
Public safety is of the utmost importance in Rancho Cucamonga. Accordingly, the
City adds equipment and personnel to enhance and meet increased police service
needs as the population and businesses grow. In addition, the City continues to seek
out programs that educate the public on crime trends, awareness, prevention, and
safety. In addition to Rancho Cucamonga’s law enforcement professionals working to
reduce crime in Rancho Cucamonga, the City has strong volunteer policing programs
in place, reflective of residents’ dedication to the community.
Police Services
Rancho Cucamonga contracts with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department
(SBCSD) for police services. SBCSD provides a full range of specialty and support
services that would not be available in small municipal police departments, including:
Homicide Investigations, Helicopter Patrol, Narcotics Investigations, Special
Enforcement Team (SWAT), Media Relations, Crime Lab Services, Bomb and Arson
Teams, among others. Given the large territory covered by the Sheriff’s Department,
Rancho Cucamonga also benefits from a regional approach to crime fighting and
public safety. The challenge facing the SBCSD is to work with each contract city in
defining the unique service delivery needs of a community and then providing
services consistent with those needs and expectations.
                                                                                       There is a Police Substation

       The SBCSD operates the Police Department and provides response services,
       criminal investigation services, traffic enforcement, and preventive patrol with the
       main police facility located at the City’s Civic Center. There is also a sub-station
       located within the Victoria Gardens Shopping Center and one satellite office located
       at Vineyard Avenue and Base Line Road. The City intends to design and construct a
       new public safety facility in the northeast part of the City (known as the North End
       Station, to be located at Milliken Avenue and Grizzly Drive). The new public safety
       facility will offer the same services as the main station. The Police Department also
       maintains a motor home that can be utilized as either a command post or a
       temporary station if needed.

       Long-range planning is the key to maintaining the level of public safety Rancho
       Cucamonga currently experiences. The long-term goals of the Rancho Cucamonga
       Police Department include:
                Maintaining the current high level of services being provided, despite
                 population and territorial growth
                Continual review and evaluation of the San Bernardino County police
                 services contract to ensure a constant high level of service as the City’s
                 needs change
                Planning for and implementing changes in levels of staffing and equipment to
                 maintain high levels of services for future growth
       Reinforcing that commitment is the network of neighborhood watch groups who work
       together on pro-active measures to deter crime. In addition, Rancho Cucamonga has
       a Solution Oriented Policing Unit that works with other City agencies and residents to
       develop practical, innovative, and permanent solutions to reducing crime. This unit
       includes a gang detail, a crime prevention unit, a bicycle enforcement team, school
       resource officers, and an “Every 15 Minutes” Youth Anti-Drunk Driving Program. The
       Police Department also benefits from extensive volunteer programs including a
       Sheriff’s Reserve Team, Citizen’s Patrol Program, and Citizen’s Equestrian Unit. The
       Equestrian Unit patrols over 150 miles of hiking and riding trails in the area.
       Volunteers donate thousands of hours of time to support the crime prevention
       services of the Police Department.
       The Rancho Cucamonga Police Department also works in cooperation with the law
       enforcement agencies of neighboring cities and jurisdictions, as well as State and
       Federal agencies. There is a Mutual Aid Plan in place, which sets up contingency
       plans for assistance and cooperation in the event of a large-scale disaster or
       emergency.

Crime Prevention Through Environmental
Design
Rancho Cucamonga values effective crime prevention and strives to find creative
ways to make residents and businesses safe. Crime Prevention Through
Environmental Design (CPTED) is a planning tool that focuses on the proper design
and use of the built environment to deter and prevent crime. Strategies include
design techniques that encourage “eyes on the street” building orientation and design
features that deter criminal activity and positively influence human behavior and the
perception of safety.
Rancho Cucamonga’s CPTED is a multi-disciplinary approach that includes many
City departments and agencies (including Planning, Police, Business Licensing,
Code Enforcement, and others) and members of the community to work together to
reduce crime. The expertise provided by these groups helps the City fix underlying
problems instead of focusing on isolated solutions to individual incidents.
The five basic principles of CPTED provide the foundation for the crime prevention
strategies related to physical design. These principles make it clear that CPTED is
oriented almost exclusively toward crimes of opportunity: crimes committed by
perpetrators who are unknown to the potential victim. While not all crimes are of this
type, they constitute the vast majority and account for the greatest sense of fear by
law-abiding citizens. The principles include:
        Engagement. Involve community members as participants in the crime
         prevention network through Neighborhood Watch, Citizen Patrol, Equestrian
         Patrol, reserve officers, and other programs in conjunction with the Police
         Department and other law enforcement agencies. This is critical to
         preventing crime. To deter crime, make sure the community is aware of
         potential criminal activity, is geared to observing and reporting crime, and is
         educated on crime prevention techniques. The goal is to have plenty of “eyes
         on the street.”
        Natural Surveillance. It is important to organize physical features, activities,
         and people in such a way as to maximize visibility so that crimes of
         opportunity can more readily be witnessed. The prospect of being seen
         deters criminal activity.
        Natural Access Control. The judicial placement and design of entrances,
         exits, driveways, signs, fencing, landscaping, and lighting physically guides
         people coming to and going from a space. This is particularly valuable in
         making escape appear more difficult for criminals after they have committed
         a crime.
        Territorial Reinforcement. The use of physical attributes that express
         ownership, such as fences, pavement treatments, art, signs, and landscaping
         help distinguish those who belong in an area from those who may not and
         aids in the quick identification of unusual behavior.
        Management and Maintenance. The continued use of a space for its
         intended purpose, which serves as an additional expression of ownership
         and territoriality, reinforces the identity of places and spaces that are safe;
         simply making an area less desirable for potential criminals.

       Seismic and Geologic Hazards
       The Southern California landscape clearly reveals the earth forces that shaped the
       region and that we live with daily. The mountain ranges are expressions of the
       Earth’s surface moving, which continues to push the San Gabriel Mountains upward
       at a rate of up to two centimeters per year. As a result of location, Rancho
       Cucamonga needs to plan for potential earthquakes, secondary seismic effects, and
       geologic conditions.
       Seismic Hazards
       While many natural and man-made hazards have the potential to impact the City, the
       event with the greatest potential for loss of life, property, and economic damage is an
       earthquake. The hazards associated with an earthquake in Rancho Cucamonga
       include ground shaking, fault rupture, landslides, and foundation failures caused by
       liquefaction or settlement. Earthquakes can also trigger many secondary effects such
       as landslides and rock falls, urban fires, building collapse, water tank or dam failures,
       disruption of essential facilities and systems (water, sewer, gas, electricity,
       transportation, and communications), and hazardous materials releases.
       Although it is not possible to prevent earthquakes from occurring, their destructive
       effects can be minimized. Through the implementation of comprehensive hazard
       mitigation programs, including the identification and mapping of hazards, prudent
       planning, emergency exercises, enforcement of building codes, and expedient
       retrofitting and rehabilitation of weak structures, the City can significantly reduce the
       scope of damage caused by an earthquake.
       The Reservoir Hazard Study for the Cucamonga Valley Water District (CVWD)
       evaluated the performance of CVWD’s tanks under seismic loads from earthquakes
       on the nearby Cucamonga and Red Hill faults. Should a large earthquake occur on
       either of these faults, the study indicates than none of CVWD’s water tanks will
       survive undamaged. Most (14) will suffer only broken pipe connections, 10 will
       probably suffer tears or seam breaks, and 2 will likely collapse. These findings are
       significant in their impact on fire flow and emergency storage following an
       earthquake.
       Ground Shaking
       Ground shaking is the general term that refers to all aspects of movement of the
       Earth’s surface resulting from a seismic event. Ground shaking is normally the major
       cause of damage in earthquakes, and the amount of damage generally correlates to
       the magnitude of the earthquake and proximity to the event’s epicenter.
       The City of Rancho Cucamonga is located near two of California’s most active faults,
       the San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults. These faults are thought to have the
       highest probability of generating a large earthquake in the near future (up to 7.3 and
       6.7 magnitude, respectively). Figure PS-2 illustrates the locations of faults.
       While activity on the San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults is considered more likely, a
       major earthquake (7.0 magnitude) on the Cucamonga Fault, located in the northern
       Sphere of Influence, is assumed to be the worst-case earthquake scenario for the
       City. Ground displacements of up to 9 feet could occur along the fault, intense
       ground shaking could last more than 30 seconds, and losses could be extensive.

located. The Etiwanda Avenue Fault Scarp (potential for 6.5 magnitude earthquake)
is considered capable of ground shaking at an intensity that presents unacceptable
risks to proposed structures. The other two segments, not yet detected, could induce
further damage.
Fault Surface Rupture
In 1972, the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was enacted to mitigate the
hazard of fault rupture by prohibiting the construction of buildings along all active fault
lines. The Act dictates that jurisdictions withhold development permits for sites within
an Earthquake Fault Zone until geologic investigations demonstrate that the sites are
not threatened by surface displacements from future faulting.
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones have been designated for the Cucamonga
Fault and a portion of the Red Hill Fault, referred to as the “Etiwanda Avenue Fault
Scarp.” Since adoption of these zones, two potential changes have been identified.
The first is to include recently discovered splays of the Cucamonga Fault in the
northwestern portion of the City within the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone. The
second is the adoption of another Earthquake Fault Zone for a portion of the Red Hill
Fault near the western boundary of the City. It is conjectured that the Red Hill Fault
may extend to meet the Etiwanda Avenue Fault Scarp, however evidence is
inconclusive. As such, the City continues to designate a Potential Zone for this area,
where special geologic investigations will be required for all essential and critical
facilities. Critical facilities include fire stations, schools, hospitals, dams and flood
control structures, bridges, communication centers, and other facilities that are
needed during an emergency or would pose unacceptable safety risks to the
community if severely damaged. Figure PS-2: Fault Hazards Map illustrates the
existing and proposed Alquist-Priolo Zones in Rancho Cucamonga.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a geologic process that causes various types of ground failure.
Liquefaction typically occurs when loose, saturated sediment of primarily sandy
composition is subject to strong ground shaking. When liquefaction occurs, the
sediments involved experience a total or substantial loss of shear strength and
behave like a liquid substance. California’s Seismic Hazards Mapping Act provides
for statewide mapping of seismic hazards. Not all areas of California have been
mapped yet; as of 2009, no information was available for Rancho Cucamonga as
mapping is still being conducted.
However, a review of high groundwater areas in the City can provide some indication
for areas of concern regarding liquefaction. In Rancho Cucamonga, three small areas
of concern have been identified. These areas are located in the western portion of
the City, where groundwater is within fifty feet of the surface, which meets the
condition for liquefaction to occur (Figure PS-3: Geotechnical Hazards). However,
regional mapping indicates that much of the sediment in these areas may be too
dense to liquefy. Projects proposed in these potential liquefaction zones should
address the potential for liquefaction to occur, and mitigate as needed.
Landslides
Landslides can result from earthquake-related ground shaking or failure of steep
slopes due to water saturation or unstable soil conditions. Landslides can overrun
structures, people, or property. They can sever utility lines and block roads, thereby

       hindering rescue operations following an earthquake. California law requires
       identification of landslide zones in which the stability of hill slopes must be evaluated.
       Figure PS-3: Geotechnical Hazards, as referenced above, outlines the areas of the
       City that are susceptible to seismically induced landslides.
       Settlement
       The potential for seismic settlement to occur is based on the intensity and duration of
       ground shaking and the relative density of the subsurface soils. Most of the City is
       susceptible to some degree of seismic settlement, as the alluvial fans underlying
       much of the City are of low density. However, as past earthquakes have shown,
       seismic settlement is primarily damaging in areas subject to differential settlement.
       Although differential settlement generally occurs slowly enough that its effects are not
       dangerous to building inhabitants, it can cause significant building damage over time.
       In the City, differential settlement is most likely to occur at the base of the San
       Gabriel Mountains, and especially where loose or uncontrolled (non-engineered) fill is
       used.
       Geologic Hazards
       The San Gabriel Mountains are among the fastest rising and fastest disintegrating
       mountain ranges in the world. Due to Rancho Cucamonga’s proximity to the
       mountain range, these rapid changes make the City susceptible to geologic hazards
       including debris flows and falling rocks due to erosion of the steep slopes,
       concentration of precipitation from storms, and rapid stream flow from mountain
       streams, leading to increased potential for land subsidence in certain soil conditions.
       The areas most at risk from hazards associated with debris flow and falling rocks are
       located along the base of the San Gabriel Mountains in the northern portion of the
       Sphere of Influence area.
       As with seismic hazards, the Municipal Code contains the baseline minimum
       standards to guard against unsafe development in geologically hazardous areas.
       These standards are further supported through zoning regulations, hillside
       development standards, and the policies and implementing actions contained in this
       General Plan.
       Slope Stability
       The potential for slope failure is dependent on many factors and their
       interrelationships. Some of the most important factors include slope height, slope
       steepness, and shear strength and orientation of weak layers in the underlying
       geologic units. Ultimately, prolonged rainfall, erosion and undercutting by streams,
       man-made alterations to the slope, or seismic shaking can cause a slope to fail.
       Debris flows, like rock falls, occur rapidly and without warning, causing boulders,
       cobbles, and sand to fall within the drainages of the eastern San Gabriel Mountains.
       These drainage areas include Cucamonga Creek, Demens Canyon, Deer Canyon,
       Day Canyon, and East Etiwanda Creek. Debris flows and flooding hazards
       associated with the San Gabriel Mountains are controlled by the San Bernardino
       County Flood Control District, which maintains numerous debris basins and flood
       control facilities in the City and Sphere area. County and City officials work together
       through the project review process to ensure that new development is properly
       protected from debris flows and flooding. Figure PS-4: Slopes illustrates the slope
       steepness and mitigation guidelines proposed in the City.

To reduce future debris flow and slope instability, maintenance of existing debris
basins and flood control facilities is required, as well as environmental preservation of
the eastern San Gabriel Mountains. Additionally, a Hillside Development Regulations
Ordinance was designed and adopted to help achieve these goals.
Subsidence
Ground subsidence is the gradual settling or sinking of the ground with little or no
horizontal movement. This condition is usually associated with the extraction of oil,
gas, or groundwater from below the ground surface, or the organic decomposition of
peat deposits, with a resultant loss in volume. The thick alluvial deposits underlying
most of the City would be susceptible to subsidence should rapid groundwater
withdrawal occur. Damage to structures as a result of regional subsidence may be
greatest at the valley margins adjacent to the San Gabriel Mountains and possibly
the Red Hill Fault. A regional approach to groundwater conservation and recharge is
required in these areas.
Flood Hazards and Inundation
Rancho Cucamonga, due to its location at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains,
has a history of flooding. Many of the streets in the northern portion of the City have
been known to flood. Comprehensive storm drain improvements and flood control
projects have reduced the threat of floods somewhat, but not entirely. An unusually
large storm and flash flooding can create flooding hazards within the City.
The largest flood in recent memory occurred in 1969, and many residents were
unprepared for a flood of this size. A damaged flood levee structure in the
Cucamonga Spreading Grounds failed, causing the Cucamonga Creek to breach its
channel and resulted in $68 million in damages. Another major flood occurred in
1977; damages were especially severe on Vineyard Avenue and Hellman Avenue.
The most recent large-scale flood occurred in 1983. Alta Loma High School on Base
Line Road was damaged with more than 30 of its classrooms flooded. Flood waters
damaged asphalt streets in the City causing wash-outs, cave-ins, and flooded
homes.
Flood Hazard Areas
The unpredictable range in seasonal rainfall that is typical of Southern California,
coupled with the location near the San Gabriel Mountains, makes Rancho
Cucamonga vulnerable to flooding during the winter storm season. To prepare and
mitigate hazards from flooding, Rancho Cucamonga participates in the National
Flood Insurance Program. Flood Insurance Rate Maps, or FIRMs, are prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to identify potential flood
zones. Figure PS-5: Flood Hazard Zones, identifies the “Special Flood Hazard Areas”
for Rancho Cucamonga, as recorded by FEMA. The Flood Hazard map shows
locations of essential public facilities.
Flood hazards related to storm events are generally described in terms of a 100- or
500-year flood. These are floods that, respectively, have a 1.0 percent and 0.2
percent chance of occurring every year. Rancho Cucamonga has adopted flood
protection standards requiring minimum building elevation, flood proofing, and
anchoring of buildings in areas that are identified as prone to flooding. The precise
limits of the flood plain areas and the flood zone designations can be viewed on the
FIRM maps in the City’s Engineering Department.

       Drainage Plans and Facilities
       The City maintains a Master Drainage Plan to provide a drainage system that will
       adequately convey a 100-year storm event. In addition to storm drains and flood
       control channels, the system includes debris basins and spreading grounds to reduce
       mud flows. The drainage system in Rancho Cucamonga has been substantially
       improved in recent decades and contains an integrated approach that provides for
       regional and local drainage flows. The completion of the Hillside Storm Drain, Deer
       Creek Channel, Demens Channel, and Day Creek Debris Basins has reduced the
       extent of potential flooding within the City. Recent improvements, including the Upper
       and Lower Hermosa Storm Drain projects, the Archibald Storm Drain project and the
       Etiwanda/San Sevaine Flood Control project, have further reduced flooding potential
       in the City.
       The San Bernardino County Flood Control District is responsible for the regional
       facilities and the City of Rancho Cucamonga is responsible for the localized facilities.
       Both agencies coordinate in the preparation of drainage plans as well as individual
       project review based on design criteria established by the San Bernardino County
       Flood Control District.
       The City of Rancho Cucamonga has prepared specific drainage plans for the east
       and west portions of the City. The drainage plans detail the funding required through
       collection of revenue from new development for construction of the systems. The
       plans approximate the flood control needs of a fully developed drainage area.
       A substantial portion of the City is not covered by the two City drainage plans
       identified above. Instead, the drainage system for the area is covered by a number of
       adopted Specific Plan or Community Plan facilities. Developers within the County of
       San Bernardino Flood Control District are responsible for completing the necessary
       drainage facilities not covered by City drainage plans.
       Two areas within the City are known to be deficient in their level of drainage
       improvements. The first area consists of those portions of the City that are not yet
       developed and, therefore, have no flood control improvements. Future development
       of these areas will decrease the amount of permeable ground area that can absorb
       water, thereby contributing to an increase in the amount of stormwater runoff that
       must be controlled. Therefore, as development continues, new flood control facilities
       will be required.
       In addition, certain areas within the Industrial Specific Plan areas may require
       additional detention facilities. The drainage facilities for the industrial property
       generally located north and south of the Metrolink tracks between Haven Avenue and
       Rochester Avenue were designed and constructed using San Bernardino County
       Flood Control criteria in effect during the early 1980s. New development within this
       area may require the addition of detention facilities on a case-by-case basis to
       provide 100-year flood protection for the structures on these properties.

Dam Inundation
Dam or catch basin failure could occur as a result of an earthquake, erosion, design
flaw, or water overflow during storms, causing inundation in certain parts of the City.
California law requires dam owners to provide the Governor's Office of Emergency
Services with an inundation map showing the extent of damage to life and property
that would occur given a complete and sudden dam failure at full capacity. The
inundation areas for the water retention facilities that could affect Rancho
Cucamonga are shown in Figure PS-6.1
There are four debris and water catch basins located within the City, and a small
portion of southwestern Rancho Cucamonga could be affected by a breach of the
San Antonio Dam in Upland. The dam is a flood control and water conservation
project constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The closest acute care hospital, San Antonio Community Hospital in Upland, is
located in the inundation path of the San Antonio Dam, which was damaged by the
relatively minor 1990 Upland earthquake, and is considered vulnerable to a
Cucamonga or San Andreas Fault earthquake.
Even if earthquake damage at the dam does not result in failure, damage to the dam
may lead to evacuation of the potential inundation areas, including San Antonio
Community Hospital. Therefore, disaster planning must consider alternative acute
care facilities for casualties.
Inundation studies based on failures of CVWD’s water tanks indicate that four of the
projected reservoir failures will impact land that is currently vacant, three are
expected to inundate one or two structures, and one reservoir site may inundate as
many as 15 residences. The City is required by State law to have in place emergency
procedures for the evacuation and control of populated areas within the limits of
inundation below the dams. In addition, real estate disclosure upon sale or transfer of
property in the inundation area is required.
Hazards and Development Suitability
A key consideration in relation to the three natural hazards discussed above
(Seismic, Geologic, and Flooding/Inundation) is how these hazards impact the
suitability of development. Table PS-3: Suitability of Development in
Seismic/Geologic Hazard Areas indicates the general specifications for critical
structures and structures for human occupancy in relation to potentially hazardous
conditions.

                             Wind Hazards
                             The City of Rancho Cucamonga has a history of extensive windstorms, often related
                             to Santa Ana winds. The Santa Ana winds are strong, extremely dry offshore winds
                             that characteristically sweep through the area in late fall and early winter. High winds
                             can also result from thunderstorm inflow and outflow or high and low pressure
                             systems moving through the region. High winds have speeds reaching at least 50
                             miles per hour, and can exceed 100 miles per hour. Wind events constitute one of
                             the most frequent major hazards in the City. Not only do windstorms happen
                             frequently; they can be costly in terms of property damage and can cause injury to
                             people.
                             The winds affecting Rancho Cucamonga can damage structures, uproot trees, and
                             create dust storms in the southern part of the City where the soil type is susceptible
                             to wind erosion. Additionally, as the southern part of the City has shifted from

                             not well maintained, the debris that accumulates around the trees is a fire hazard and
                             a nuisance.

While the strategies for minimizing this aspect of wind hazards are aimed primarily at
the remaining windrows, these strategies apply to an increasing degree to any large
trees that are part of the urban landscape. This is particularly true where inadequate
planting and maintenance techniques have been practiced.
Aviation Hazards and Airport
Compatibility Planning
LA/Ontario International Airport is a commercial jet service airport located in the City
of Ontario. The airport is owned and operated by Los Angeles World Airports
(LAWA). In 2008, over six million passengers departed from and arrived at the airport
on over 124,000 commercial and general aviation flights. In addition, over 480,000
tons of freight moved through the airport.
The northern runway is located approximately one mile from Rancho Cucamonga’s
southern boundary. The airport’s runway safety zones extend from both ends of the
runways in the City of Ontario, but no aircraft safety zones affect Rancho
Cucamonga. Departing planes primarily fly over Ontario and Montclair, and most
commercial jet arrival flights cross Fontana and Ontario. Smaller private planes fly
over southern Rancho Cucamonga as they take off and land, avoiding the jet aircraft
flight patterns.
Section 21675(a) of the California Public Utilities Code requires that airport land use
compatibility plans (ALUCPs) be based upon long-range Airport Master Plans
adopted by the airport owner/proprietor or, if such a plan does not exist for a
particular airport, an Airport Layout Plan may be used with the approval of the
California Division of Aeronautics. Compatibility plans must also reflect the
anticipated growth of the airport with a minimum 20-year horizon. Compatibility plans
address aircraft noise, safety, airspace protection, and overflight notification based on
existing and future airport operations and can place restrictions on building heights,
types of land uses, and density of uses within the Airport Influence Area.
As of 2010, a master plan for LA/Ontario International Airport had not been prepared;
however, master planning efforts initiated by LAWA in 2002 were suspended in late
2008 due to the national economic slowdown and decline in aircraft operations. In
2008, the City of Ontario initiated an update to the Airport Land Use Compatibility
Plan (ALUCP) for LA/Ontario International Airport utilizing information from LAWA’s
master planning efforts. The City of Rancho Cucamonga and other neighboring
jurisdictions that may be affected by operations at the airport participated and
contributed towards development of the ALUCP.
Since LAWA discontinued master plan efforts for LA/Ontario International Airport, the
City of Ontario submitted and received approval by the State Division of Aeronautics
for a Composite Airport Layout Plan showing existing and proposed runway
configurations for compatibility planning purposes. LAWA’s 2008 master planning
efforts for LA/Ontario International Airport proposed a reconfiguration of the runway
system, shifting both runways south and east of their present positions. LAWA
regarded this reconfiguration necessary to enable the runway system to
accommodate SCAG’s 2008 Regional Transportation Plan growth projections of 33.4
million annual air passengers and 3.2 million annual tons of cargo by 2030. Prior to

       must first complete the LA/Ontario International Airport Master Plan and required
       environmental review.
       In the mid-1990s, California law was amended to streamline new development within
       Airport Influence Areas and allow cities and agencies to conduct their own airport
       consistency reviews through the Alternative Process, in lieu of an Airport Land Use
       Commission. In 1996, the County of San Bernardino elected to adopt the Alternative
       Process and delegate the responsibility for preparing an Airport Land Use
       Compatibility Plan, making airport consistency determinations for new development,
       and mediating land use disputes to local jurisdictions. Subsequently, in 1996 the City
       of Ontario adopted by resolution the Alternative Process and accepted the
       responsibility for compatibility planning around LA/Ontario International Airport, at a
       time when impacts did not extend outside the City of Ontario. Since then, on-going
       growth of the airport, future growth projections, and updated State compatibility
       planning standards have extended airport influence areas outside the City of Ontario.
       These factors have required the Alternative Process to be amended and include
       neighboring jurisdictions into the compatibility planning process.
       The amended Alternative Process will allow the City of Rancho Cucamonga to
       conduct its own consistency reviews for new development within LA/Ontario
       International Airport’s Influence Areas. The Alternative Process establishes a
       Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) with membership from each affected
       jurisdiction. The TAC is intended to provide a coordinated approach to compatibility
       planning       around      LA/Ontario      International     Airport    and     include
       key stakeholders in the planning process. The TAC will also provide technical
       information, issue consistency findings, and be ambassadors to compatibility
       planning matters. Where possible inconsistencies arise between land use projects
       within the Airport Influence Area and the ALUCP, a mediation board will settle
       disputes.
       Rancho Cucamonga has participated in the TAC process and ALUCP planning
       efforts. The City anticipates working with the TAC and member jurisdictions regarding
       future airport planning decisions that directly affect Rancho Cucamonga. The City
       recognizes the importance of the LA/Ontario International Airport and the economic
       benefits it provides to the entire region. However, the City wants to balance the
       growth of the airport with impacts associated with the airport on properties in Rancho
       Cucamonga. The City also looks to balance the need of protecting airport and aircraft
       operations with restrictions on land uses in Rancho Cucamonga that would affect the
       economic value of properties.
       Airspace Protection
       The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides regulations regarding protecting
       airspace around airports. The FAA is concerned about the consequences that certain
       land uses, buildings, and associated activities can have on the airport and aircraft
       operations. Under Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), the FAA
       requires notice of proposed construction in excess of certain heights that may affect
       the safety of aircraft operations. FAR Part 77, Subpart B, requires that the FAA be
       notified of any proposed construction or alteration having a height greater than an
       imaginary surface extending 100 feet outward and one foot upward (slope of 100 to
       1) for a distance of 20,000 feet from nearest point of any runway. Beyond the FAA
       Height Notification Area boundary, any object taller than 200 feet requires FAA
       notification.

       Cucamonga. The authority of the FAA in these matters extends only as far as issuing

a notice of hazard to air navigation. The FAA has no authority over local land use;
limiting the height of structures falls upon the local jurisdiction. However, the
responsibility of the results of FAA review should be taken into account by a
jurisdiction prior to approving a project. The airspace protection component of the
ALUCP will be based on Part 77.
FAR Part 77, Subpart C (Obstruction Surfaces) establishes standards for determining
obstructions to air navigation. Further procedures and notification boundaries will be
developed through the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan or developed specifically
by Rancho Cucamonga to be integral to its development review process.
Overflight Notification
Overflight notification is meant to inform potential buyers or tenants regarding the
presence of LA/Ontario International Airport and potential impacts on property,
particularly residential property. Consistent with the ALUCP, the City is committed to
requiring notification to prospective buyers and tenants within the airport influence
area of the impacts of aircraft overflight. Notification can be accomplished through an
avigation easement dedication, recorded overflight notification (recorded deed), or
real estate disclosure. Further procedures and notification boundaries will be
developed through the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan or developed specifically
by Rancho Cucamonga to be integral to its development review process.
Air Quality, Atmosphere, and
Climate
Each day, individuals inhale approximately 3,400 gallons of air. When we breathe in
air, we also take in the contaminants that result from daily activities such as driving
cars, burning fossil fuels, and manufacturing chemicals. Although air quality in
Southern California has improved since the 1960s, even with the region’s substantial
economic expansion and population growth, further improvements are needed. The
Southern California region still has some of the most polluted air in the nation.
In addition to human health concerns with regard to air quality, the daily activities are
significant sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, which are
the leading causes of global climate change. Global climate change, or global
warming, is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth since the mid-
twentieth century. As the global temperature increases, other likely effects include
sea level rise, increases in the intensity of extreme weather events, species
extinctions, and changes in agricultural yields.
Air Quality
Rancho Cucamonga lies in the northwest portion of the South Coast Air Basin and is
at the foot of the mountain chain defined by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino
Mountains. These mountain ranges direct air circulation and dispersion patterns. The
combination of onshore wind patterns, mountain range barriers, and temperature
inversions can trap air within the community and prevent the vertical dispersal of air
pollutants.

                               Rancho Cucamonga is located within the South Coast Air Basin, a 6,000-square-mile
                               area that encompasses Los Angeles County and the non-desert portions of Orange,
                               Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. Through the U.S. Clean Air Act (1970) and
                               the California Clean Air Act (1988), both the State and Federal governments have
                               established health-based Ambient Air Quality Standards (AAQS) for a variety of air
                               pollutants. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), created in
                               1976, is the regional agency authorized to develop and enforce air pollution control
                               standards mandated by the Federal and State Clean Air Acts within the Basin.
                               Rancho Cucamonga has continued to work with the SCAQMD and in accordance
                               with the applicable Air Quality Management Plan to improve local and regional air
                               quality.

                               State air quality standards for ozone and State standards for particulate matter. At
                               the monitoring station nearest to Rancho Cucamonga, ozone levels have consistently
                               exceeded State and Federal standards. However, the number of days that ozone
                               levels have exceeded State and Federal standards has been consistently decreasing
                               each year. This can largely be attributed to State measures requiring newer vehicle
                               models to emit fewer emissions. Particulate levels have also exceeded the State
                               standards every year. Unlike ozone, suspended particulate levels have exceeded
                               State standards at a relatively consistent level over the last five years.
                               Sources of Air Pollution
                               Motor vehicles represent the major source of regional emissions throughout the
       A 2007 Supreme Court    Basin and within Rancho Cucamonga. Efforts to reduce emissions from this source
        ruling confirmed that
                               can result in significant improvements in air quality. In the past, national and regional

                               Sources of non-mobile air pollution include industrial/manufacturing uses, auto repair
                               businesses, dry cleaners, and other businesses that regularly use chemical solvents.
                               Common sources of fine particulate matter (PM10) include road dust, construction
                               activity, grading, and fires (including fireplaces). Air pollution is significantly worse

In response to these concerns, California enacted legislation in 2006 and 2008 that
requires jurisdictions to comprehensively address how long-range plans will begin to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve statewide air quality goals. AB
32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, established a comprehensive program
of regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve real, quantifiable, cost-effective
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The law aims to reduce carbon emissions
in California to 1990 levels by 2020.
SB 375, Redesigning Communities to Reduce Greenhouse Gases, passed into law
in 2008, is implementing legislation for AB 32. This legislation endeavors to control
greenhouse gas emissions by curbing sprawl (the unplanned, uncontrolled spread of
urban development). The legislation encourages compact development patterns that
reduce the need to drive, thereby reducing air pollution from car exhaust, conserving
water, and protecting habitat, among other benefits. To achieve these goals, this law
is designed to align regional land use, housing, and transportation plans with
greenhouse gas reduction targets.
Without a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, global changes affecting Rancho
Cucamonga in the future could include:
        More frequent heat waves
        More extreme weather events
        More frequent and increased severity droughts
        Increased potential for tropical insect-borne diseases
Rancho Cucamonga recognizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions to preserve a high quality of life and safety for generations to come. Many
actions undertaken by the City directly or indirectly improve air quality. These include
building residential units near the Metrolink station, pursuing Mixed Use
development, supporting transit use, development of bicycle routes and trails, and
supporting the use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in the City’s fleet and in the
community. Considering air quality issues in the decision-making process will ensure
that new development results in limited emission levels to the extent feasible. Rancho
Cucamonga also leads by example, with sustainable building and operation
processes for City government.
Transportation and energy production are among the leading activities associated
with greenhouse gas emissions. As such, it is important to understand how the long-
range planning decisions as well as daily activities can have implications on local air
quality. As SB 375 indicates, air quality issues are intricately related to policies in the
Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic Resources Chapter and the
Community Mobility Chapter of the General Plan that reduce use of and dependence
on automobiles. Implementation of sustainability policies throughout this General
Plan will help minimize the City’s contribution to global climate change.
Noise
Noise is commonly defined as intrusive or undesired sound. Excessive noise can be
disruptive, be it from the continuous thrum of trucks traveling along a busy roadway
or the whine of gasoline-powered leaf blowers on an otherwise quiet morning. Noise
may interfere with communication, work, rest, recreation, and sleep, and can impact
residents’ quality of life. In extreme cases, excessive noise may produce

       physiological or psychological damage. For all of these reasons, the City evaluates
       noise-generating sources and ambient noise conditions in land use planning and
       decision making.
       This section provides policy direction for minimizing noise impacts on the community
       and for coordinating with surrounding jurisdictions and other entities regarding noise
       control. By identifying noise-sensitive land uses and establishing compatibility
       guidelines for land use and noise, noise considerations will influence the general
       distribution, location, and intensity of future land use. The result is that effective land
       use planning and mitigation can alleviate the majority of noise problems.
       Noise Metrics
       Sound intensity is measured and expressed by decibels (dB), with an adjustment
       referred to as the A-weighted measure (dBA) to correct for the relative frequency
       response of the human ear. Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale,
       representing points on a sharply rising curve. For example, a noise level of 10
       decibels is 10 times more intense than one decibel, 20 decibels represents a noise
       100 times more intense, and 30 decibels reflects a noise condition 1,000 times more
       intense. A sound as soft as human breathing is about 10 times greater than a zero
       decibel level.
       The decibel system of measuring sound gives a rough connection between the
       physical intensity of sound and its perceived loudness to the human ear. A 10-decibel
       increase in sound level is perceived by the human ear as only doubling of the
       loudness of the sound. Ambient sounds in the urban environment generally range
       from 30 dBA (very quiet) to 100 dBA (very loud), as indicated in Table PS-4: Typical
       Sound Levels.
       Because people generally are more sensitive to noise intrusions during the evening
       and night hours, State law requires, for planning purposes, use of such metrics as the
       Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) or Day-Night Noise Level (Ldn). These
       metrics add an artificial decibel increment to quiet time noise levels in a 24-hour
       noise descriptor to account for increased sensitivity during late hours. The CNEL
       descriptor requires that an artificial increment of 5 dBA be added to the actual noise
       level for the hours from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and 10 dBA for the 10:00 p.m. to
       7:00 a.m. period. The Ldn descriptor uses the same methodology, except that no
       artificial increment is added to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Both
       descriptors yield roughly the same 24-hour level, with the CNEL being only slightly
       more restrictive (that is, higher).

Effects of Noise
At 60 dBA, noise can impair a person’s ability to understand what someone else is
saying, and sound levels over 40 to 45 dBA can disturb sleep. A person’s likelihood
of hearing loss strongly increases at prolonged exposure to sound levels over 85
dBA.
The level of background (ambient) noise is the key factor used to determine whether
a particular land use should locate in a particular location. In Rancho Cucamonga’s
neighborhoods, residents expect to experience ambient noise conditions that allow
them to conduct their day-to-day activities without interference from noise. Face-to-
face conversations at a distance of about five feet can be conducted with relative
ease where A-weighted noise levels are as high as 66 dBA. In conversations
involving groups of people, the level of background noise needs to be between 50
and 60 dBA to allow people to hear each other.
With regard to sleep disturbance and noise, sleep generally follows similar patterns in
people of all ages, from falling asleep, to deep sleep, to waking states, to in-between.
The time spent in each state varies, but sound can interfere with any sleep stage.
Although people can acclimate themselves to certain noises and sleep through them,
quieter night-time noise levels generally are more conducive to restful sleep patterns,
and as noted, residents expect their neighborhoods to be quiet at night.

       Because of the ways that different people perceive noise, in any given noise
       environment a variety of reactions can be expected, ranging from serious annoyance
       to no awareness. As a general observation, studies have shown that if a noise
       problem is allowed to occur, a greater reduction in the noise level (ranging from five
       dBA to 10 dBA) is often necessary to appease complaints than would have been
       necessary if the noise had instead been addressed at the design stage. For this
       reason, the preferred approach regarding noise control is to address it early in the
       development process.
       Noise Standards
       The State of California’s noise insulation standards are codified in the California
       Code of Regulations, Title 24, Building Standards Administrative Code, Part 2,
       California Building Code. These noise standards are applied to new construction for
       the purpose of providing suitable interior noise environments. The regulations specify
       that acoustical studies must be prepared when noise-sensitive structures, such as
       residential buildings, schools, or hospitals, are located near major transportation
       noise sources, and where such noise sources create an exterior noise level of
       60 dBA CNEL or higher. Acoustical studies that accompany building plans must
       demonstrate that structures have been designed to limit interior noise in habitable
       rooms to acceptable noise levels. For new residential buildings, schools, and
       hospitals, the acceptable interior noise limit for new construction is 45 dBA CNEL.
       City noise standards are included in the Development Code for each land use district.
       In addition, the City has adopted a Noise Abatement section of the Development
       Code (Section 17.02.120) that has special provisions for determining and addressing
       noise issues. Noise complaints are addressed on an individual basis.
       Figure PS-8: Noise Compatibility Matrix generally reflects guidelines promulgated by
       the California Office of Noise Control. This matrix provides the City with an integral
       tool to gauge the compatibility of land uses relative to existing and future noise levels.
       The Noise Compatibility Matrix allows for higher ambient noise levels for residential
       development within areas designated for higher density residential uses and Mixed
       Use. However, where Mixed Use is allowed in Rancho Cucamonga, and where
       residential neighborhoods directly interface with commercial development, such as
       along Foothill Boulevard, careful review of site design and operational characteristics
       of individual commercial uses will allow the City to address any site-specific noise
       concerns through design and operational conditions applied to individual projects.
       The Noise Environment
       Noise Conditions - 2009
       Noise surveys conducted in 2009 revealed that the ambient noise environment in
       Rancho Cucamonga largely is influenced by roadway noise (Figure PS-9: Existing
       Noise Contours - 2009). To a lesser degree, aircraft operations at LA/Ontario
       International Airport and trains contribute to noise conditions in the areas near these
       activities. Distinct truck, railroad, and aircraft noise are notable in the southern portion
       of the City.
       Two types of noise sources are considered in the community noise inventory:
       stationary sources and mobile sources. Stationary sources include industrial and
       construction activities (including truck loading), playgrounds, outdoor sports facilities,

                             heard in a residential neighborhood (power tools, barking dogs, etc.). Mobile noise
                             sources refer to cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, aircraft, and trains.
                             In Rancho Cucamonga, the key transportation corridors that contribute to ambient
                             noise levels are I-15, SR-210, and the Metrolink rail line. Areas adjacent to freeways
                             experience noise levels approximately 70 to 75 dBA CNEL. Sound walls along I-15
                             and SR-210 help alleviate some of the noise impacts from the freeways. Areas
                             adjacent to the Metrolink railroad can experience levels of noise up to 71 dBA when
                             trains are passing through. There are residential uses adjacent to the railroad
                             immediately west of Haven Avenue. Land uses east of Haven Avenue generally
                             consist of industrial uses, so train noise is not a major concern.
Vehicles traveling on Haven
 Avenue can generate noise
 levels up to 75 CNEL along
    the edge of the roadway.
                             Foothill Boulevard, Base Line Road, Haven Avenue, Milliken Avenue, Day Creek
                             Boulevard, 19th Street, Archibald Avenue, Arrow Highway, and Vineyard
                             Avenue/Carnelian Street are roadways in the City that carry significant vehicle
                             volumes. Measurements taken in residential neighborhoods near these roadways in
                             2009 indicated that noise levels typically range from 60 to 70 dBA CNEL. Local
                             traffic contributes considerably to noise levels throughout the City.

With regard to aircraft noise, the jet landing patterns at LA/Ontario International
Airport are oriented east-west. Occasional aircraft noise can be heard in southern
areas of Rancho Cucamonga. No noise contours over 60 dBA CNEL extend into
Rancho Cucamonga. Jurisdictions that experience the brunt of airplane departure
and arrival noise levels are Ontario, Fontana, and Montclair.
Future Noise Environment (2030)
The projected noise exposure contours for year 2030 are indicated in Figure PS-10:
Future Noise Contours - 2030. The future noise contours should be considered as a
guide to identifying potential land use/noise compatibility issues and will be used to
determine the requirement for project specific noise studies and mitigation. In
comparison to the 2009 noise contours presented in Figure PS-9, future noise levels
will increase, but not significantly. Noise level increases are projected to occur along
Haven Avenue, Milliken Avenue, and Foothill Boulevard due to increased traffic
volumes.
Public Health and Safety
Issues
Key issues relative to public health and safety are:
        Wildland Urban Interface Fires. Rancho Cucamonga’s location adjacent to
         the San Bernardino National Forest and San Gabriel Mountains puts it at
         high risk for Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) fires. This type of fire begins in
         the chaparral north of the City and can spread to structures in those areas
         and on the perimeter of the City.
        Emergency Medical Services. Rancho Cucamonga Fire Protection District
         (RCFPD) is the first responder to medical emergencies. EMS responses are
         the most common response made by RCFPD, and service demands have
         been steadily increasing. As the Rancho Cucamonga population ages, and
         new residents and employees locate here, the EMS program will continue to
         be impacted.
        Emergency Management. In the event of an emergency or natural disaster,
         it is important to have clear, up-to-date plans to expedite response. Public
         outreach and education regarding emergency preparedness is also crucial.
        Hazardous Materials. Releases of explosive, reactive, corrosive, toxic, and
         flammable materials can cause injury, life loss, and property damage and
         may necessitate evacuations. Emergency plans and trained personnel are
         necessary to adequately respond to hazardous materials emergencies.
        Crime Prevention. Rancho Cucamonga has set high standards for public
         safety and protection, and as a result is one of the safest cities of its size in
         the nation. To maintain these high levels of public safety, it will be important
         to continue to evaluate existing programs, meet response time goals, and
         support crime prevention through environmental design. In addition, involving
         the community in crime prevention programs is integral to the City’s public
         safety success.

          Seismic and Geologic Hazards. The presence of multiple faults within and
           near Rancho Cucamonga poses a seismic hazard to residents and
           businesses in the City.
          Flood Hazards and Inundation. Rancho Cucamonga is a tributary to flood
           waters emanating from the San Bernardino National Forest and other
           unincorporated areas north of the City. The proximity to these areas
           necessitates a regional approach to responding to stormwater flows, debris
           and mudflows, and potential inundation from dam or catch basin failure. In
           addition, an increase in potential flood hazards may arise from future
           development in the City. As development occurs over open spaces, new
           infrastructure, pavement, etc. will decrease the amount of exposed
           permeable ground area that can absorb water. With this reduction of
           permeable ground, an increase in the amount of stormwater runoff will follow
           that must be controlled.
          Wind Hazards. The strength of windstorms in Rancho Cucamonga can
           damage structures, uproot trees, and create dust storms. Furthermore, high
           winds create public safety issues affecting traffic conditions and school
           operations as well as an increasing demand on fire and police services and
           the City’s Emergency Operations Center.
          Airspace Protection. Operations at LA/Ontario International Airport can
           impact Rancho Cucamonga regarding safety and flight patterns. Potential
           development height restrictions and other development regulations could
           affect certain airport-influence zones in southern Rancho Cucamonga.
          Overflight Notification. LA/Ontario International Airport aircraft fly over
           Rancho Cucamonga. The City intends that prospective buyers and tenants
           within the airport area be notified to create awareness of the potential
           impacts of overflight.
          Air-Quality. Air pollutant levels in the community are frequently unhealthy,
           and Rancho Cucamonga must make an effort to reduce greenhouse gas
           emissions and curb global climate change. In addition, the complexity of air
           quality issues and the regional nature of the matter demands that the City
           work closely with other local and regional governments and agencies to
           ensure everyone does their part in improving air quality and curbing climate
           change.
          Noise Impacts. The most significant noise sources in Rancho Cucamonga –
           cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes – are beyond the City’s regulatory control.
           However, the City can use land use planning strategies to minimize the
           effects of transportation-related noise. Heavier industrial business activities,
           specifically those within the industrial areas, generate noise levels that
           generally are incompatible with residential uses. Land use policies
           emphasize separation of such uses, and local regulatory controls can be
           used to minimize conflicts.

Public Health and Safety Goals and
Policies
The following goals and policies are aimed at providing guidance and policy direction regarding public health and
safety in Rancho Cucamonga.
GOAL PS-1:          Plan, promote, and demonstrate a readiness to respond and
                    reduce threats to life and property through traditional and
                    innovative emergency services and programs.
               Policy PS-1.1:     Reduce the loss of life, property, and injuries incurred as a
                                  result of fires by offering and supporting comprehensive fire
                                  prevention, public education, and emergency response
                                  programs.
                   Discussion:    Fire hazards pose a threat to Rancho Cucamonga residents,
                                  especially in areas near the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). Fire
                                  prevention is effective when it includes public education and
                                  appropriate land use restrictions, as well as adequate facilities
                                  and personnel to mitigate fires when they occur. The Fire District
                                  is expected to continually develop effective prevention and
                                  response strategies to address this constant risk.
               Policy PS-1.2:     Strive to limit loss of life and property as a result of wildland
                                  fires through adequate wildland fire protection services,
                                  education and enforcement of defensible space and brush
                                  clearance requirements, and wildland fire evacuation and
                                  preparedness plans.
                   Discussion:    The dry vegetation north of the City is conducive to quick moving
                                  and high-heat fires that can spread rapidly and cause damage to
                                  structures and homes. Keeping brush and vegetation away from
                                  structures is critical to decreasing risks to these structures, and
                                  evacuation and preparedness plans are necessary to ensure that
                                  responses to wildland fires are coordinated and efficient.
                                  The Fire District shall routinely assess the current threat to life
                                  and property in the WUI. Needs for improvements in response
                                  capability will be identified.
                                  The City should also expand the existing education and warning
                                  system that can be activated following significant wildland fires on
                                  the hillsides above the City. Education efforts can include mailers
                                  to households in the affected areas, public meetings, and/or door-
                                  to-door education campaigns that inform the public of wildland
                                  fire safety tips and procedures.

       Policy PS-1.3:  Continue to provide high-quality patient care with cross-
                       trained firefighter/paramedics and emergency medical
                       technicians. Improve the level of patient care in the
                       community through the development and implementation of
                       innovative emergency medical service delivery strategies.
           Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga enjoys a high level of Emergency Medical
                       Services as provided by the RCFPD. However, the service
                       demands on the City’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
                       program have increased steadily over the years. The EMS
                       program will be further impacted by growth factors including
                       continued construction of new housing developments, additional
                       senior housing, assisted living and skilled nursing facilities,
                       accidents and collisions related to SR-210 and the I-15 freeways,
                       and visitors to the various recreational venues and expanding
                       retail centers.
       Policy PS-1.4:  Work with the Police Department to
                       investigation of fires associated with arson.
                                                                             expedite     the
           Discussion: Arson is a violent and dangerous crime against property and
                       people. Arson can be especially dangerous when applied to the
                       wildland areas near Rancho Cucamonga. Recent extremely
                       damaging fires, including the Old Fire (2003) in San Bernardino
                       and the Los Angeles County Station Fire (2009), were set by
                       arsonists. Rancho Cucamonga will expedite and cooperate with
                       all arson investigations to help bring arson culprits to justice.
       Policy PS-1.5:  Promote a high quality of life and safety for all residents with
                       community safety education campaigns and comprehensive
                       fire and injury prevention programs.
           Discussion: Public education programs are an important component of
                       emergency preparedness. The City will continue educating the
                       community regarding safety hazards and tips to protect residents
                       in case of emergencies.
       Policy PS-1.6:  Minimize life and property loss and injuries by maintaining a
                       comprehensive technical rescue program.
           Discussion: The RCFPD has a Technical Rescue team trained in performing
                       rescues in special and difficult circumstances. The Team is
                       trained in confined space rescue, trench rescue, building collapse
                       and shoring, swift water rescue, high angle rope rescue, and
                       large animal rescue. Most of the Team's calls require rope rescue
                       usually in the steep foothills of the District.
                       The Technical Rescue Team is certified as a Heavy Level
                       Rescue and was the first Heavy Level Team in San Bernardino
                       County. Additionally, the Technical Rescue Team is part of the
                       California State Office of Emergency Services System, which
                       allows for the Team to be activated throughout the State if
                       needed.
       Policy PS-1.7:  Foster a supportive relationship with businesses and
                       citizens regarding Fire inspections and Code Enforcement
                       programs.

                   Discussion: Proper building construction and built-in fire protection (including
                               sprinklers) significantly reduces the risk of damage and large-
                               scale urban structure fires. As such, it is imperative to enforce
                               codes and regulations through inspections and public education.
               Policy PS-1.8:  Improve the professional standards and operational
                               readiness of fire department personnel through modern
                               training techniques, professional development, and fitness
                               programs.
                   Discussion: Maintaining RCFPD services is critical to protecting the health
                               and welfare of the City and its residents. Rancho Cucamonga
                               must continue to be proactive in the training of personnel and the
                               use of the latest technologies and techniques to protect the
                               community from harm.
               Policy PS-1.9:  Require adequate water supply and fire flow throughout the
                               City to meet fire demand during times of peak domestic
                               water demand through a cooperative relationship with the
                               Cucamonga Valley Water District.
                   Discussion: There is currently an adequate water supply and flow to meet the
                               needs of Rancho Cucamonga. The City needs to maintain this
                               level to meet RCFPD demands in the event of an emergency and
                               to provide the highest level of service to the community. As the
                               City’s population increases, it will be particularly important to
                               extend and improve the water system commensurate with new
                               development. Preventative maintenance of water lines, hydrants,
                               and reservoirs must be continued.
              Policy PS-1.10:  Review and
                               improvements
                                                    determine needs for future system
                                                    when indicated by key performance
                               measures.
                   Discussion: The fundamental strategy of the RCFPD Strategic Plan is to
                               provide appropriate Fire Station location (distribution) and staffing
                               in order to effectively handle various emerging service demands
                               (concentration). It is crucial that a properly equipped and staffed
                               fire department resource arrive at the scene quickly to initiate
                               action in the event of an emergency. While statistics may indicate
                               more frequent demands in certain parts of the community, a
                               serious fire or life-threatening emergency can and does occur at
                               any place, any time, throughout the community. Therefore, it is a
                               goal that all areas of the community can be reached within the
                               timeframe established by the adopted service goals within the
                               Fire Strategic Plan. As the community continues to change and
                               develop, reviewing the Strategic Plan goals to ensure that
                               response time remains consistent is necessary.
               Policy PS-1.11: Coordinate, plan, and manage a comprehensive capital
                               improvements program for expansion and improvement of
                               fire and life safety services in response to the needs of a
                               growing community.
                   Discussion: The 2005 RCFPD Strategic Plan outlines a series of
                               recommendations to maintain high service levels. In order to
                               develop a plan to expand and improve the response system and
                               maintain high levels of service, a comprehensive capital
                               improvements program will be necessary.

GOAL PS-2: Strive to maintain the appropriate level of community
            preparedness for natural and human-caused disasters and threats.
         Policy PS-2.1:   Support an appropriate level of individual and community
                          preparedness.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga supports a strong, ongoing program of
                          emergency preparedness that includes comprehensive All-
                          Hazard Emergency Planning and Preparedness by the RCFPD.
                          Public education regarding what do to in the event of a disaster,
                          fire prevention, and steps to take during medical emergencies are
                          also important components of emergency preparedness.
         Policy PS-2.2:   Maintain the Emergency Operations Center to enhance
                          community safety.
              Discussion: The City’s new Emergency Operations Center (EOC) opened in
                          2005. A centralized and permanent location, the EOC provides a
                          place to concentrate response activity in the event of a disaster.
         Policy PS-2.3:   Identify public facilities and critical infrastructure to be
                          protected, and take action to prepare and respond effectively
                          to emergencies.
              Discussion: Parks and other community facilities can serve as sites for
                          emergency operations and shelters in the event of a disaster.
                          Future design and improvements of these facilities should
                          accommodate emergency functions. Critical infrastructure and
                          facilities, as identified in the Hazard Mitigation Plan, include the
                          City’s fire and police stations, schools, utilities, and local
                          government buildings. These facilities were deemed “critical” due
                          to their importance in the day-to-day operations of the City or for
                          their role in response to a disaster.
         Policy PS-2.4:   Regularly review and update emergency plans that are in
                          place in the event of emergencies and/or disasters.
              Discussion: The City’s Emergency Management Program, as managed by the
                          RCFPD, is responsible for maintaining and updating the City’s
                          emergency plans, including the Hazard Mitigation Plan and
                          Emergency Operations Plan. These documents should be
                          updated regularly, to be “living” documents that change with the
                          City’s needs as it continues to evolve and develop.
         Policy PS-2.5:   Develop plans
                          recovery.
                                                 for  short-term  and    long-term disaster
              Discussion: Well planned and executed post-disaster recovery can help
                          existing businesses survive, help residents stay in the
                          community, and restore normalcy quickly after a disaster. The
                          City has a responsibility to be prepared in advance to conduct
                          community recovery efforts as efficiently and wisely as possible.
                          The Multi-Hazard Disaster Plan does not address long-term
                          recovery. Future recovery plans should ensure that buildings are
                          rebuilt safely, and establish a process for rebuilding quickly.

              Policy PS-2.6:   Continue to coordinate automatic mutual aid agreements
                               with Federal, State, local agencies, and the private sector to
                               establish responsibility boundaries, joint response services,
                               and multi-alarm and station coverage capabilities.
                   Discussion: Mutual aid agreements with Federal, State, local agencies, and
                               the private sector will be critical in the event of a worst-case
                               earthquake scenario along the Cucamonga Fault. There is a
                               Mutual Aid Plan in place, which sets up contingency plans for
                               assistance and cooperation in the event of a large scale disaster
                               or emergency. The City will continually maintain such mutual-aid
                               agreements to ensure maximum assistance in the event of a
                               major emergency.
GOAL PS-3:          Protect City residents, businesses, and employees from the
                    potential hazards associated with the use, storage, transport, and
                    disposal of hazardous materials in and through Rancho
                    Cucamonga.
               Policy PS-3.1:  Continue to coordinate hazardous material planning and
                               appropriate response efforts with other City departments, as
                               well as local, County, and State agencies to further improve
                               readiness to mitigate local impacts resulting from hazardous
                               material-induced emergencies.
                   Discussion: The City takes part in a comprehensive effort with the State,
                               County, and other jurisdictions to identify and manage hazardous
                               materials and to respond to hazardous materials accidents.
                               Because hazardous materials may spread beyond jurisdictional
                               boundaries, it is important to maintain cooperative relationships
                               so that mitigation can quickly be implemented.
              Policy PS-3.2:   Identify and regulate businesses that handle hazardous
                               materials in Rancho Cucamonga.
                   Discussion: Both the Federal government and the State of California require
                               all businesses that handle more than a specified amount of
                               hazardous materials or extremely hazardous materials to submit
                               a business plan, report releases of toxic chemicals, and report
                               off-site transfers of waste to another location. The City is
                               committed to supporting and strengthening this effort through
                               local code enforcement actions, penalizing repeat violators of
                               regulations, and conducting annual fire inspections to confirm the
                               accuracy of information provided by businesses that handle
                               hazardous materials.
              Policy PS-3.3:   Educate residents and businesses about proper disposal
                               methods of household hazardous waste, and the availability
                               of less toxic materials that can be used in place of more
                               toxic household materials.

              Discussion: Most victims of chemical accidents are injured at home,
                          according to the Office of Federal Emergency Management
                          Assistance (FEMA). Most of these accidents result from
                          carelessness or lack of knowledge regarding household
                          hazardous and flammable materials. It is important for the City to
                          continue to provide additional information and resources to
                          encourage proper disposal and handling of hazardous materials
                          and also encourage the reduction of hazardous material use. A
                          permanent drop-off facility for household hazardous waste is
                          located at a San Bernardino County facility within the City and is
                          staffed by personnel who have been trained in procedures for
                          handling the waste.
GOAL PS-4:    Provide a high level of public safety services throughout Rancho
              Cucamonga.
         Policy PS-4.1:   Regularly evaluate Police Department programs and make
                          adjustments as needed to respond to the changing needs of
                          the community.
              Discussion: The Police Department provides a variety of services and
                          programs that go beyond responding to emergencies associated
                          with traffic accidents and crimes. The Solution Oriented Policing
                          (SOP) Unit employs a range of innovative law enforcement and
                          crime prevention programs. Volunteer and community based
                          policing programs are also important to maintain. The City
                          recognizes the value of each of these police programs, and
                          encourages continued success through regular evaluation of
                          these programs.
         Policy PS-4.2:   Maintain, and improve where feasible, police response times
                          to all calls for service and require that a minimum four-
                          minute response time is maintained for emergency calls.
              Discussion: Response times to emergency and non-emergency calls are
                          impacted by a number of factors including population growth,
                          traffic patterns, location and number of stations, and number of
                          officers on duty. The Police Department should continue to
                          conduct an annual response time analysis that determines if
                          response time problems are encountered and how adjustments in
                          services should be made to correct any deficiencies. This
                          analysis should also consider new and proposed development in
                          the City.
         Policy PS-4.3:   Continue to promote neighborhood watch programs for
                          residential areas aimed at empowering neighborhoods to
                          watch for and report any suspicious activity.
              Discussion: Neighborhood Watch programs have proven to be very effective
                          in creating both the reality and sense of security desired by
                          residents. Continued efforts by the Neighborhood Watch, along
                          with physical design strategies and strong police responsiveness,
                          ensure an ongoing low crime rate in the community.
         Policy PS-4.4:   Promote existing crime prevention programs for commercial
                          and industrial areas.

                   Discussion: Security from crime is a major concern in the business
                               community, in part because of the daily time periods during which
                               so many of the business entities are closed or have limited use.
                               Larger developments typically have either a dedicated or
                               contracted security service to augment police services. Smaller
                               developments may not and, in such cases, a cooperative
                               program similar to a residential neighborhood watch system could
                               be of value.
              Policy PS-4.5:   Encourage the continuation of volunteer public safety
                               forces, including a police reserve unit, citizen’s patrol,
                               equestrian patrol, and the Explorer Program.
                   Discussion: The City has a number of volunteer, community based policing
                               programs including the Law Enforcement Explorer Program,
                               Citizen’s Patrol, Bicycle Enforcement Team, Reserve Police
                               Officers, and Equestrian Citizen Patrol Programs. These
                               volunteer forces free up valuable police assets and serve to
                               strengthen the community by actively involving citizens in day-to-
                               day police activities.
              Policy PS-4.6:   Utilize the principles of Crime Prevention Through
                               Environmental Design (CPTED) during the review of
                               development projects.
                   Discussion: In order to incorporate safety and security into the design of the
                               built environment, the City’s design review process takes into
                               consideration CPTED principles. Projects are promoted that
                               reduce crime by providing maximum visibility for pedestrian
                               pathways, channeling movement and creating clear movement
                               patterns, providing territorial reinforcement, and supporting
                               continued maintenance of properties.
GOAL PS-5:          Minimize the potential damage to structures and loss of life that
                    may result from earthquakes and other seismic hazards.
               Policy PS-5.1:  Require geological and geotechnical investigations in areas
                               of potential seismic or geologic hazards as part of the
                               environmental and developmental review process for all
                               structures proposed for human occupancy.
                   Discussion: Figure PS-2: Fault Hazard Map, identifies the locations of the
                               existing and proposed expansion of Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
                               Fault Zones. Consistent with this exhibit, the City proposes to
                               include recently discovered splays of the Cucamonga fault in the
                               northwestern portion of the City within the Alquist-Priolo
                               Earthquake Fault Zone and adopt another Alquist-Priolo
                               Earthquake Fault Zone for the remainder of the Red Hill Fault.

                        In Rancho Cucamonga, the Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone
                        requirements are applied to all proposed structures for human
                        occupancy, whereas State law only requires that requirements
                        are applied to projects of four or more units. Within the
                        buried/uncertain segment of the Red Hill Fault, a Potential Zone
                        will be created where special geologic investigations will be
                        required for all essential and critical facilities to demonstrate the
                        site is not threatened by surface displacements from future
                        earthquakes. Critical facilities include fire stations, schools,
                        hospitals, dams and flood control structures, bridges,
                        communication centers and other facilities that are needed during
                        an emergency or would pose unacceptable safety risks to the
                        community if severely damaged.
       Policy PS-5.2:   Establish minimum setbacks for any structure proposed for
                        human occupancy within the Special Studies Zones
                        identified on the Fault Hazard Map, based on minimum
                        standards        established       under        State       law       and
                        recommendations of the project geologist and City Engineer.
            Discussion: Setbacks recommended for active faults in the City can never be
                        less than 50 feet on either side of the zone of deformation, and
                        should be based on the recommendations of the project geologist
                        and City Engineer. In the case of low angle faults, such as the
                        Cucamonga Fault, asymmetric setbacks are common because
                        the upper plate contains fractures and displacements at greater
                        distances from the main fault trace. Setbacks of 100 feet or more
                        may be necessary in certain areas. In the case of critical facilities,
                        setbacks from potentially active faults are required under State
                        law.
       Policy PS-5.3:   Promote the strengthening of planned utilities through the
                        Cucamonga Valley Water District’s Master Plan, the retrofit
                        and rehabilitation of existing weak structures and lifeline
                        utilities, and the relocation or strengthening of certain
                        critical facilities to increase public safety and minimize
                        potential damage from seismic and geologic hazards.
            Discussion: The aging of older, weaker structures increases the risk of
                        hazards resulting from earthquakes. As such, attention should be
                        directed to the existing public utilities and critical facilities that are
                        vulnerable in the event of a major earthquake in the City. This
                        includes certain water storage reservoirs in the community
                        operated by CVWD, San Antonio Community Hospital in Upland,
                        and possibly existing debris basins. The City Building Official
                        requires that critical structures within the City be designed to
                        remain functional following the maximum credible shaking of the
                        structure at the site.
       Policy PS-5.4:   Continue to encourage the retrofit of unreinforced masonry
                        buildings and identify other potentially hazardous buildings.
 
                                                                                       Public Health and Safety

                   Discussion: As required by State law, the City of Rancho Cucamonga has
                               adopted an ordinance aimed at retrofitting unreinforced masonry
                               buildings. Although retrofitted buildings may still incur severe
                               damage during an earthquake, the mitigation results in a
                               substantial reduction in the numbers of casualties by preventing
                               collapse of the building. State law also encourages the
                               identification and mitigation of seismic hazards associated with
                               other types of potentially hazardous buildings, including pre-1971
                               concrete tilt-ups, soft-stories, mobile homes, and pre-1952 single
                               family structures.
              Policy PS-5.5:   Continue to incorporate the most recent seismic safety
                               practices into City codes and project review processes.
                   Discussion: As a result of experience in recent earthquakes, as well as
                               extensive research under the National Earthquake Hazard
                               Reduction Program (NEHRP), seismic codes have been
                               significantly modified. Two significant changes are (1) a revision
                               of soil types and amplification factors, and (2) incorporation of
                               proximity of earthquake sources as a critical risk factor. Both
                               changes impact the City, as the Cucamonga Fault is within 6.2
                               miles of most of the City. The City is committed to implementing
                               improvements to building codes that will improve public safety
                               related to seismic and other hazards.
              Policy PS-5.6:   During the environmental and developmental review
                               process, promote alternative project designs that
                               incorporate low-intensity land uses in areas determined to
                               have significant seismic or geologic constraints.
                   Discussion: Much of the Cucamonga Fault Zone in the Sphere of Influence
                               area consists of open space, conservation lands and limited
                               hillside residential development. The newly discovered scarps in
                               the northwestern corner of the City impact very low-density
                               residential uses. These types of land use designations are
                               commonly acceptable for fault zones throughout California,
                               provided that careful, peer-reviewed fault studies are performed
                               in conjunction with proposed projects. These designations allow
                               for the positioning of greenbelts, trails, and roads along the active
                               fault segments, while still allowing productive use of the property.
              Policy PS-5.7:   Promote public awareness of seismic and geologic hazards
                               within the City by requiring property transfer notifications.
                   Discussion: The Cucamonga fault scarps control the geologic character of the
                               foothills. A significant number of forest service roads and
                               community trails follow along these scarps. The City also
                               supports improving the visibility of hazard declaration statements
                               on subdivision tract, parcel, and zoning maps; and requires
                               property owners to sign a notice confirming their awareness and
                               waiver of mitigated or unmitigated risk identified in engineering,
                               geologic, or geotechnical investigation reports. Agents and sellers
                               of real property that is located within an Earthquake Fault Zone
                               must disclose to any prospective purchaser that the property is
                               within an Earthquake Fault Zone pursuant to the requirements of
                               the Alquist-Priolo Act.

GOAL PS-6:    Minimize the potential damage to structures and loss of life that
              may result from geologic hazards.
         Policy PS-6.1:   Continue enforcement of the Hillside Development
                          Guidelines to allow for prudent development and
                          redevelopment of all properties located on slopes greater
                          than 10 percent, and continue to preserve as open space
                          properties located on slopes greater than 30 percent.
              Discussion: The most effective way to protect lives and property from debris
                          flows and slope instability is to continue to prohibit development
                          on property that exceeds 30 percent in slope, in accordance with
                          current ordinances. In addition, property having a natural slope
                          between 10 and 30 percent can be made unstable by
                          development and grading activities. Hillside development
                          guidelines enforce the existing grading standards and require
                          aesthetic treatments that both improve the appearance of the
                          hillsides and preserve the stability of the slopes. These measures
                          include returning slopes to their natural appearance, density
                          reduction, clustering of developments, and steepness after
                          grading. Environmental preservation of the eastern San Gabriel
                          Mountains is also required to reduce debris flow potential.
                          Development of the hillside terrain will only increase the potential
                          for debris flows to damage the City unless the situation is
                          carefully managed.
         Policy PS-6.2:   Support mitigation of existing development and private
                          development projects located on potentially unstable hillside
                          areas, especially slopes with recurring failures, where City
                          property or public right-of-way is threatened from slope
                          instability, or where considered appropriate and urgent by
                          the Engineering, Fire, or Police Departments.
              Discussion: Areas most susceptible to falling rocks are located below steep,
                          resistant outcrops of relatively cohesive materials that underlie
                          much of the northern Sphere of Influence. The hazard from falling
                          rocks in this area is considered high for hillside development, as
                          well as for development located adjacent to steep slopes. Areas
                          adjacent to stream and storm channel systems, where adjacent
                          properties may be affected by erosion and undercutting during
                          significant storm events, are also prone to slope instability.
                          Foundations adjacent to stream channels shall be setback from
                          erosion and undercutting hazards based on a determination of
                          the project soils engineer and the City Building Official. Much of
                          the City is vulnerable to debris flows and floods from the
                          streambeds draining from the San Gabriel Mountains. As a result,
                          extensive man-made controls have been constructed to reduce
                          the impact of these events on the City. Most often, the impact to
                          the City will be boulders and mud transported onto roadways.
                          Occasionally, catastrophic debris flow events occur. The greatest
                          San Gabriel Mountain debris flow events of the twentieth century
                          occurred in 1934, 1938, 1969 and 1977, but there is generally a
                          destructive event each decade.

              Policy PS-6.3:   Enact a geologic disaster recovery ordinance for use
                               following severe winter storms that cause extensive
                               landslide or erosion damage.
                   Discussion: To efficiently recover after a geologic disaster, plans must be in
                               place. The disaster recovery ordinance could identify authorities
                               and powers of different City officers, distribution of responsibility
                               and accountability, authorization of extraordinary procedures for
                               streamlining repair permit issuance and simplifying public notices,
                               interim joint powers, and contract procedures. The ordinance
                               should also address criteria for establishing building moratoria,
                               standards for expedited repair permit processing, criteria for
                               restoration of standard operating procedures, and organization
                               for planning and implementation of long-term reconstruction and
                               redevelopment programs.
GOAL PS-7:          Provide adequate and appropriately designed storm drainage and
                    flood control facilities to minimize the risk of flooding.
               Policy PS-7.1:  Continue to upgrade and expand the flood control system so
                               that the community is protected from flooding.
                   Discussion: The City currently collects flood control fees from developers to
                               upgrade the City’s drainage system. The fees are used to expand
                               the system, in accordance with the City’s Drainage Master Plan.
                               Developers may be reimbursed for previous contributions beyond
                               their project needs. Areas of the community that are deficient
                               should be prioritized for upgrade based upon the level of risk
                               posed to the public. In addition, the City will continue to utilize
                               other funding mechanisms, such as funds from the City’s
                               Redevelopment Agency, to construct needed flood control
                               improvements.
              Policy PS-7.2:   Continue to maintain and improve the City’s flood control
                               system and upstream tributary areas.
                   Discussion: The flood control facilities are part of an integrated system that
                               provides regional flood control improvements through the San
                               Bernardino County Flood Control District and localized
                               improvements through the City. Rancho Cucamonga will continue
                               to collect flood control fees for both the County and City to ensure
                               that individual development projects, and the City as a whole, are
                               adequately protected from flooding. In addition, the City will
                               continue to participate in the regional Zone 1 Advisory Committee
                               meetings to ensure that City concerns are addressed.
              Policy PS-7.3:   Provide input on the level of development intensity and
                               conservation practices within the City’s Sphere of Influence
                               area and the San Bernardino National Forest.

              Discussion: The flood control system is designed to accommodate a
                          particular level of runoff. Runoff is influenced by the use of the
                          land, including new development. The City is tributary to
                          stormwater runoff and its associated debris and mud flows from
                          the unincorporated area and San Bernardino National Forest to
                          the north. Changes in conservation practices that would increase
                          erosion or allow increased development would affect the City’s
                          flood control system. Reviewing proposed plans and programs
                          under the County of San Bernardino’s jurisdiction and the
                          National Forest Service jurisdiction will allow the City to
                          determine if proposed projects will significantly affect the ability to
                          provide adequate drainage protection.
         Policy PS-7.4:   Maintain structural and operational integrity of essential
                          public facilities in the event of a flooding hazard, and locate
                          new essential public facilities outside of flood hazard zones.
              Discussion: Essential public facilities such as hospitals, health care facilities,
                          emergency shelters, fire stations, emergency command centers,
                          and emergency communication facilities should be protected from
                          flood hazards and not be located in flood hazard zones.
                          Construction methods or other methods to minimize damage
                          during a flooding event should also be incorporated if facilities are
                          located in a flood hazard zone.
         Policy PS-7.5:   Continue cooperative working relationships among public
                          agencies with responsibility for flood control.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga Engineering and Public Works Departments,
                          which are responsible for the localized storm drain facilities,
                          continue to maintain a working relationship with the San
                          Bernardino County Flood Control District, which is responsible for
                          regional storm drain facilities.
         Policy PS-7.6:   Apply a minimum level of acceptable risk standard during
                          the project review phase for new development and
                          improvements to existing development in potential
                          inundation areas and require mitigation to the satisfaction of
                          the Engineering Department and other responsible agencies.
              Discussion: The City has been exposed to high peak water flows emerging
                          from the mountain streams of the San Gabriel Mountains.
                          Records from stream gauges at Cucamonga Creek and Day
                          Canyon from the late 1920s to early 1970s indicate that the all-
                          time peak flow occurred on January 25, 1969. Critical structures
                          are prohibited in potential inundation paths, and structures for
                          human occupancy require special studies.
GOAL PS-8:    Minimize the risks associated with wind hazards.
         Policy PS-8.1:   Notify all developers, particularly those of multi-story or
                          critical structures, of potential impacts resulting from Santa
                          Ana Winds, and require appropriate structural and design
                          treatment.

                   Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga addresses the problems associated with
                               high winds and gust conditions in a preventative manner
                               wherever possible. Building orientation and profiles, window
                               placement, landscape treatment and irrigation, and similar design
                               and engineering considerations can reduce the vulnerability of
                               buildings, their occupants, and their visitors to the impacts of high
                               winds. The City seeks to raise the level of consciousness
                               regarding this risk so that preventive measures can be taken.
              Policy PS-8.2:   Investigate the use of building materials that are effective in
                               withstanding the impacts of high winds and keep the
                               development community apprised of these findings.
                   Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga sets a high standard for design, including
                               building construction and materials. The City’s Building Code
                               design standards are more demanding than that of other cities in
                               the area, and the construction approved over the years is solidly
                               built, utilizing contemporary building materials and technology.
                               Rancho Cucamonga endeavors to be on the leading edge of
                               knowledge regarding new building technology or materials that
                               would make structures less vulnerable to wind damage.
              Policy PS-8.3:   Require agricultural operations and new construction to
                               comply with City provisions for preventing soil erosion and
                               excessive generation of dust where the property is
                               vulnerable to these conditions.
                   Discussion: In designated Soil Erosion Control Areas or other areas
                               determined by the City to be particularly vulnerable to the impacts
                               of high wind conditions, the dispersal of dust and debris must be
                               controlled. It is not only a disruption for other property owners
                               and citizens, it can also be a true hazard to people and property.
                               Through proper management of construction activities, randomly
                               wind-blown materials will be kept to a minimum. A particular
                               concern is the impact of blowing dust and debris on sensitive
                               uses, such as hospitals or convalescent homes, rehabilitation
                               hospitals, schools, and other places of public gathering. Grading
                               and construction inspection diligence is necessary to ensure that
                               dust control programs are being complied with.
              Policy PS-8.4:   Enforce contemporary dust control provisions in the City’s
                               Development Code.
                   Discussion: Current practice includes several methods for managing dust
                               control on parcels with soils that are particularly vulnerable to
                               dispersal by high winds. These methods may apply to project
                               sites smaller than those designated by the Agricultural
                               Commissioner. In those cases, City specifications will prevail and
                               a dust control plan will be part of the permit process. The City
                               endorses those methods and seeks to continually maintain
                               regulations that are at the leading edge in this area. Typical
                               techniques include, but are not limited to, pre-watering and
                               irrigation, maintaining vegetative cover on idle lands, and use of
                               soil stabilizers.
              Policy PS-8.5:   Enforce regulations that require the proper management of
                               windrows and other landscape elements to limit the damage
                               caused by falling branches or uprooted trees resulting from
                               high winds.

              Discussion: It is each landowner’s responsibility to manage the landscape
                          elements on his/her property, whether in the form of windrows or
                          random trees. Rancho Cucamonga is open to creative methods
                          for complying with this responsibility, including assigning
                          maintenance responsibilities to willing adjacent property owners
                          where that is the best way to ensure attention to wind susceptible
                          trees.
                          Property owners should explore options for windrows
                          replacement as well as preservation actions. Of particular value
                          may be the selective replacement of Eucalyptus trees with other
                          species that are not as vulnerable to wind induced damage that
                          would impact nearby structures or cause injury to people in the
                          vicinity.
GOAL PS-9:    Balance economic development and land use objectives in Rancho
              Cucamonga with the operational needs of LA/Ontario International
              Airport.
         Policy PS-9.1:   Participate in the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan and
                          Technical Advisory Committee for LA/Ontario International
                          Airport to protect Rancho Cucamonga interests regarding
                          land use and safety.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga will consult with the LA/Ontario International
                          Airport to minimize aircraft impacts on properties in the southern
                          area of the City, where appropriate.
         Policy PS-9.2:   Balance the need to protect LA/Ontario International Airport
                          aircraft from physical, visual, or electronic hazards without
                          minimizing use restrictions on Rancho Cucamonga
                          properties that would diminish full economic use of those
                          properties.
              Discussion: Rancho Cucamonga is committed to achieving consistency
                          between General Plan land use and related policies and the
                          LA/Ontario International Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan. The
                          City recognizes the importance of protecting aircraft from
                          potential development hazards that could hinder airport and
                          aircraft operations. However, the City also wants to ensure that
                          restrictions do not severely impact economic use of properties
                          within airport influence zones.
         Policy PS-9.3:   Create an appropriate strategy to address proposed
                          development where heights exceed FAR Part 77 standards.
              Discussion: FAR Part 77, Subpart B (Notification Surfaces) requires that the
                          FAA be notified of any proposed construction or alteration having
                          a height greater than an imaginary surface extending 100 feet
                          outward and one foot upward (slope of 100 to 1) for a distance of
                          20,000 feet from the nearest point of any runway. Beyond FAA
                          Height Notification Area boundary, any object taller than 200 feet
                          requires FAA notification. FAR Part 77, Subpart C (Obstruction
                          Surfaces) establishes standards for determining obstructions to
                          air navigation.

              Policy PS-9.4:   Create policies or procedures that provide flexibility
                               regarding how prospective buyers and tenants of properties
                               within the LA/Ontario International Airport Influence Area are
                               informed of potential aircraft overflight impacts.
                   Discussion: This policy provides options for informing prospective buyers and
                               tenants within the airport area of the impacts of airport overflight.
                               Notification can be accomplished through an avigation easement
                               dedication, recorded overflight notification (recorded deed), or
                               real estate disclosure. As these generally are the responsibility of
                               real estate agents or brokers, the City may consider including
                               appropriate conditions in entitlements and other City-issued
                               permits.
GOAL PS-10: Maintain good local air quality, and reduce the local contributions
                   of airborne pollutants to the air basin.
              Policy PS-10.1:  Pursue efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas
                               emissions by implementing effective energy conservation
                               and efficiency measures and promoting the use of
                               renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind, biomass, cogeneration,
                               and hydroelectric power).
                   Discussion: According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Smart
                               Communities Network, buildings account for 35 percent of
                               greenhouse gas emissions across the country. The most
                               emission-producing activities in buildings are related to heating
                               and cooling and electricity consumption. As such, developing
                               strategies to create and retrofit buildings to be more energy
                               efficient is one of the primary ways to combat global warming.
             Policy PS-10.2:   Integrate air quality planning with land use, economic
                               development, and transportation planning.
                   Discussion: Land use, transportation, and economic development decisions
                               each affect impacts to air quality. As such, all planning efforts
                               should consider air quality and utilize best practices to ensure air
                               pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are minimized.
             Policy PS-10.3:   Consider surrounding land uses when locating sensitive
                               receptors such as schools, hospitals, and residential uses
                               so they are not unreasonably exposed to uses that generate
                               pollutants considered detrimental to human health.
                   Discussion: Air pollution is significantly worse where air pollutants are
                               concentrated. As new sensitive land uses are located, project
                               reviews should consider the health impacts of existing energy-
                               intensive industrial areas, and avoid these areas if possible.
                               Young children, older adults, and persons with existing health
                               problems are susceptible to respiratory complications. These
                               segments of the population tend to be concentrated in schools
                               (particularly pre-schools and nursery schools), convalescent
                               homes, and hospitals. To prevent health impacts, these uses
                               should avoid locating in heavy industrial areas that emit air
                               pollution.

        Policy PS-10.4:   Require projects that generate potentially significant levels
                          of air pollutants to incorporate the best available air quality
                          mitigation into the project design, as appropriate.
              Discussion: In order to limit increases in air pollution, mitigation techniques
                          are required of certain pollution-generating uses. As technology
                          expands to better limit air pollution and greenhouse gas
                          emissions, projects should utilize new mitigation measures as
                          much as feasible.
        Policy PS-10.5:   Avoid placing sensitive land uses adjacent to heavy
                          industrial areas.
              Discussion: Pollutants from heavy industrial users create an unhealthful
                          situation for residents and other businesses. Heavy particulates
                          can travel beyond property lines. Being sensitive to adjacent uses
                          is the easiest way to prevent unnecessary health risks.
        Policy PS-10.6:   Implement the policies in the Resource Conservation
                          Chapter that are related to energy resources, energy
                          conservation, and green buildings.
              Discussion: The General Plan is based upon providing a Healthy Mind, Body,
                          and Earth. An aggressive effort is being made in this Plan and
                          those goals and policies are highlighted in this Chapter and the
                          Resource Conservation Chapter, among others.
GOAL PS-11:    Reduce the volume of pollutants generated by motorized vehicles.
          Policy PS-11.1: Implement the policies in the Community Mobility Chapter to
                          foster a healthy and sustainable community and promote
                          transportation choices other than the private automobile.
              Discussion: Motor vehicles represent the major source of air pollution
                          emissions within Rancho Cucamonga. Thus, efforts to reduce
                          emissions from this source can result in significant improvements
                          in air quality. Additional benefits of utilizing other modes of
                          transportation include potential cost savings and exercise,
                          contributing to a healthy lifestyle.
         Policy PS-11.2:  Minimize vehicle emissions by encouraging alternative land
                          use patterns that reduce the need for automobile trips.
              Discussion: Compact development patterns that reduce the need to drive by
                          locating housing near employment centers, shopping, and transit
                          will help reduce the need for automobile trips. These land use
                          polices encourage alternatives such as public transit, carpooling,
                          bicycling, and walking.
         Policy PS-11.3:  Support programs that increase ridesharing, reduce
                          pollutants generated by vehicle use, and meet the
                          transportation control measures recommended by SCAQMD
                          in the most recent Clean Air Plan.

PS‐62                                 R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

                   Discussion: Ridesharing is an effective way to quickly reduce the number of
                               vehicles commuting and contributing to local air pollution
                               emissions. The City will work with local businesses to promote
                               ridesharing programs, such as shuttle services, reserved carpool
                               parking, flexible work schedules, car-sharing, and other
                               measures. In addition, the City will work with regional agencies to
                               support reduced vehicle emissions in support of Clean Air Plans.
              Policy PS-11.4:  Support regional and local transportation and housing
                               programs that reduce vehicle emissions by decreasing
                               vehicle miles traveled (VMT).
                   Discussion: Vehicle trip reduction directly affects local air quality, traffic
                               congestion, noise, and energy consumption. Methods to reduce
                               vehicle trips involve the arrangement and density of land uses,
                               encouraging carpool programs, and offering other convenient
                               modes of travel. Site planning techniques include increasing
                               residential densities near activity centers or commercial centers,
                               providing convenient pedestrian and bicycle access to and within
                               commercial/office developments, promoting high-speed internet
                               access for home-office use, and various site planning techniques.
                               The City has also taken a more direct approach through the
                               adoption of a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance
                               that establishes regulations aimed at trip reduction to be
                               implemented by new development.
              Policy PS-11.5:  Consult with neighboring cities and jurisdictions and
                               regional agencies, including the Southern California
                               Association of Governments (SCAG) and the South Coast
                               Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), to reduce
                               vehicle emissions.
                   Discussion: Air pollution and global warming are issues that cross
                               jurisdictional and even national boundaries. As such, these
                               problems require continual regional cooperation. At the same
                               time, local-level leadership is also important to implement
                               programs and achieve solutions.
              Policy PS-11.6:  Pursue strategies and capital improvements that allow safe
                               routes for children to walk or bike to school to reduce the
                               need for automobile trips.
                   Discussion: Safe Routes to Schools is a national program that assists
                               communities in enabling and encouraging children to safely walk
                               and bike to school by providing funding to create safe routes
                               through infrastructure improvements. In 2008, Rancho
                               Cucamonga received funding to launch a pilot program to
                               educate children and their parents about the benefits of utilizing
                               the Pacific Electric Trail as a safe route for walking and bicycling
                               to school. The City will continue to pursue funding and strategies
                               to encourage safe walking and bicycling to school.

GOAL PS-12: Mitigate against climate change.
         Policy PS-12.1:  Consult with State agencies, SCAG, and the San Bernardino
                          Associated Governments (SANBAG) to implement AB32 and
                          SB375 by utilizing incentives to facilitate infill and transit-
                          oriented development.
              Discussion: State Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming Solutions
                          Act (California Health and Safety Code §38500) requires
                          California to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions levels to 1990
                          levels by 2020. State Senate Bill 375 (California Public
                          Resources Code §21155) requires the State to set regional
                          greenhouse gas reduction targets. Per SB 375, transportation
                          funding in California is contingent on meeting these targets.
                          To meet these targets, compact development patterns must be
                          achieved, including infill and transportation-oriented development
                          that encourages alternative forms of transportation. The City will
                          continue to consult with State and regional agencies to
                          participate and cooperate in the implementation of the law.
         Policy PS-12.2:  Encourage renewable energy installation, and facilitate
                          green technology and business and a reduction in
                          community-wide energy consumption.
              Discussion: Energy conservation conserves fossil fuels, helps avoid
                          blackouts, controls air pollution, and promotes sustainability. Both
                          energy-efficient design features and changing wasteful habits are
                          necessary to reduce energy consumption. In addition, renewable
                          energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass can reduce
                          reliance on fossil fuels. Consumption of imported nonrenewable
                          energy resources results in significant pollutant emissions to the
                          environment, and represents a net outflow of dollars from the
                          community and decreases the economic autonomy of the City.
                          Rancho Cucamonga, therefore, is committed to greater energy
                          efficiency by selectively replacing imported, nonrenewable
                          energy resources with domestic renewable energy sources such
                          as solar and wind energy, recycled municipal solid waste, and
                          green waste as these strategies become economically practical.
                          Green technology and businesses will have a central role in the
                          economy and in providing solutions to greenhouse gas emissions
                          in the upcoming decades.
        Policy PS-12.3:   Encourage development of transit-oriented and infill
                          development, and encourage a mix of uses that foster
                          walking and alternative transportation.
              Discussion: While the existing development pattern demands significant
                          automobile usage to get from one dominant use to another,
                          Rancho Cucamonga seeks to achieve a more balanced mix of
                          access choices as the City evolves. As such, the potential for
                          Mixed Use development is encouraged in key areas. To reduce
                          vehicle miles traveled, land use patterns must be compact and
                          coordinated with regional transportation options that make transit
                          convenient and efficient.
 
                                                                                   Public Health and Safety

             Policy PS-12.4:   Provide enhanced bicycling and walking infrastructure, and
                               support public transit, including public bus service, the
                               Metrolink, and the potential for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).
                   Discussion: Transportation sources use the most energy and emit the most
                               greenhouse gas emissions of any sector. A reduction of vehicle
                               miles traveled reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Reduced
                               vehicle miles can be accomplished through a number of methods
                               including increased bicycle, pedestrian, and transit use, and
                               locating employment opportunities and commercial goods and
                               services closer to housing. Providing convenient ways to use
                               alternative transportation encourages its use.
             Policy PS-12.5:   Provide green building incentives, assess green building
                               techniques as a formal stage of project review, and develop
                               a green building ordinance or program that addresses both
                               new and existing buildings. Adaptation strategies will also
                               include increased water efficiency in buildings.
                   Discussion: Sustainable (green) buildings use natural resources in more
                               efficient and ecological ways than traditional buildings.
                               Sustainable building practices include designing, constructing,
                               and operating buildings and landscapes to incorporate energy
                               efficiency, water conservation, waste minimization, pollution
                               prevention, resource-efficient materials, and high standards of
                               indoor environmental quality in all phases of a building's life.
                               These practices also contribute to healthy work environments. In
                               order to ensure sustainability is promoted in new buildings, the
                               City will develop a program to encourage or require green
                               building techniques.
             Policy PS-12.6:   Encourage efforts to reduce waste generation and re-use
                               and support increased recycling and composting
                               opportunities with a focus on large commercial and
                               industrial waste producers.
                   Discussion: Methane from landfills is a known greenhouse gas source.
                               Recycling reduces the amount of pollution emitted from
                               generation of new materials. Rancho Cucamonga will, therefore,
                               continue to promote waste reduction, local recycling of materials,
                               and use of recycled content materials by implementing the
                               provisions of AB 939 and adopting incentives, regulations, and
                               procedures to specify local requirements.
             Policy PS-12.7:   Support tree planting, planting more vegetation (including
                               native and drought-resistant planting), and preservation of
                               open space.
                   Discussion: As trees grow, they take carbon dioxide out of the air and
                               transform it into roots, leaves, bark, flowers, and wood. At the
                               same time, by providing shade and transpiring water, trees lower
                               air temperature and, therefore, cut energy use, which reduces the
                               production of carbon dioxide at power plants where fossil fuels
                               are burned. Vegetation, and especially native and drought-
                               tolerant planting, helps reduce the heat-island effect and lowers
                               temperatures so that less energy-intensive cooling is required.
                               The preservation of open space ensures that development
                               patterns remain compact and space is available for plants that
                               trap carbon dioxide.

        Policy PS-12.8:   Develop green procurement plans and ensure energy
                          savings in City operations and maintenance.
              Discussion: The City of Rancho Cucamonga has set a course towards
                          achieving environmental sustainability. In keeping with the
                          Healthy RC Initiative, City staff has proposed actions that focus
                          on policies and City operations initiatives that will facilitate the
                          integration of a Healthy Mind, Body, and Earth. Working with
                          other stakeholders, the City will set an example by exploring,
                          utilizing, and sharing best practices with the community. One
                          component of this is procuring products that conserve energy and
                          are healthy for users. The City will also ensure energy savings
                          through conservation by design and practice as well as utilizing
                          renewable energy sources.
        Policy PS-12.9:   Develop energy- or climate change-themed publications and
                          workshops, facilitating energy audits for residents, and
                          establishing partnerships to reduce greenhouse gas
                          emissions. Increase public awareness about climate change,
                          and encourage residents and businesses to become
                          involved in activities and lifestyle changes that help reduce
                          greenhouse gas emissions.
              Discussion: A primary component necessary to reduce greenhouse gas
                          emissions and curb climate change is raising public awareness
                          and providing information for both residents and businesses to
                          reduce their energy use. As greenhouse gas emissions are a
                          community and regional issue, cooperation and partnerships are
                          necessary to ensure that as many persons as possible contribute
                          in reduction programs.
GOAL PS-13: Minimize the impacts of excessive noise levels throughout the
              community, and adopt appropriate noise level requirements for all
              land uses.
         Policy PS-13.1:  Consider the compatibility of proposed land uses with the
                          noise environment when preparing or revising community
                          and/or specific plans and when reviewing development
                          proposals. The contour map depicting future noise levels
                          (Figure PS-10) should be used by the City as a guide to land
                          use/noise compatibility.
              Discussion: Land use compatibility with noise is an important consideration in
                          the planning and design process. Some land uses are more
                          sensitive to noise intrusion than others. Sensitive receptors, such
                          as residences, schools, health care facilities, and churches
                          should not be located in proximity to major noise sources.
        Policy PS-13.2:   Consider noise impacts as part of the development review
                          process,       particularly    the     location     of     parking,
                          ingress/egress/loading, and refuse collection areas relative
                          to surrounding residential development and other noise-
                          sensitive land uses.

                   Discussion: The City’s Planning Department uses the project review process
                               to identify potential noise issues and works with developers and
                               land owners to apply site planning and other strategies to reduce
                               noise impacts. By taking advantage of the natural shape and
                               contours of the site, it is often possible to arrange buildings and
                               other uses in a manner that can reduce and possibly eliminate
                               noise impacts.
             Policy PS-13.3:   Consider the use of noise barriers or walls to reduce noise
                               levels generated by ground transportation noise sources
                               and industrial sources.
                   Discussion: In cases where adverse noise levels are not adequately
                               addressed through proper site planning or building design layout,
                               sound walls or landscaped barriers may be considered. The
                               following guidelines are intended to ensure the effectiveness of a
                               noise barrier:
                                       A noise barrier must be massive enough to prevent
                                        significant noise transmission through it and high enough
                                        to shield the receiver from the noise source.
                                       The barrier must be carefully constructed so that there
                                        are no cracks or openings.
             Policy PS-13.4:   Require that acceptable noise levels are maintained near
                               residences, schools, health care facilities, religious
                               institutions, and other noise sensitive uses in accordance
                               with the Development Code and noise standards contained
                               in the General Plan.
                   Discussion: Noise issues should always be considered during the planning
                               process so that needed measures are incorporated in design and
                               location of land uses. Noise evaluations should be conducted
                               when a proposed project would result in sensitive land uses and
                               major noise generators within close proximity to each other, in
                               order to identify potential mitigation to address noise impacts.
             Policy PS-13.5:   Limit the hours of operation at noise generating sources that
                               are adjacent to noise-sensitive uses, wherever practical.
                   Discussion: When different uses operate on differing schedules, noise
                               disturbances can result. As more Mixed Use projects develop in
                               the City, care must be taken to ensure a healthy noise
                               environment for residents and a healthy business environment for
                               restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues. To ensure
                               compatibility of uses, business hours may need to be regulated.
             Policy PS-13.6:   Implement appropriate standard construction noise controls
                               for all construction projects.
                   Discussion: Construction activities and noise associated with public works
                               projects or private development occur throughout the City.
                               Construction activities are temporary; however, they must still
                               abide by noise control standards, including hours of operation.
             Policy PS-13.7:   Require all exterior noise sources (construction operations,
                               air compressors, pumps, fans, and leaf blowers) to use
                               available noise suppression devices and techniques to bring
                               exterior noise levels down to acceptable levels.

               Discussion: Sources of community noise are often associated with ordinary
                           daily activities such as property maintenance and construction.
                           Excessive noise from lawnmowers, leaf blowers, mechanical
                           equipment, power tools, and the like can generate complaints
                           when noise-generating activities occur in the evening or during
                           restful weekend hours. The City’s noise standards help maintain
                           optimal interior and exterior noise levels within residential areas.
         Policy PS-13.8:   Require that Mixed Use structures be designed to account
                           for noise from adjacent uses.
               Discussion: Land use policy encourages new housing development within
                           Mixed Use areas along Foothill Boulevard, near the Metrolink
                           Station, and near the I-15 and Victoria Gardens. The City
                           understands that a mix of uses is integral to creating an exciting
                           and walkable environment. At the same time, mixing uses can
                           also contribute to noise incompatibilities. As such, care should be
                           taken at the design stage to minimize noise intrusion for
                           residential uses.
         Policy PS-13.9:   Provide, as appropriate, funding to monitor noise levels and
                           investigate noise complaints.
               Discussion: Because land use patterns in Rancho Cucamonga are well
                           established, little opportunity exists to relocate noise-sensitive
                           uses to areas with lower ambient noise levels. In addition, as the
                           community continues to grow and evolve, new noise conflicts
                           could arise.
        Policy PS-13.10:   Provide education to the community at large about the
                           importance of maintaining a healthy noise environment, and
                           identify ways residents can assist in noise abatement
                           efforts.
               Discussion: Experiencing elevated noise can cause hearing impairment,
                           hypertension, annoyance, and sleep disturbance. It is important
                           to educate the community about the health effects of noise, and
                           measures they can take to reduce noise in their environment.
         Policy PS-13.11:  Continue to work with the surrounding communities to allow
                           for compliance with Rancho Cucamonga’s land use and
                           noise compatibility goals and objectives at the City’s
                           boundaries.
               Discussion: Noise is not limited to jurisdictional boundaries. In cases where
                           proposed projects are located near the City’s boundary and
                           include potential noise impacts, the City will communicate with
                           neighboring jurisdictions regarding potential noise mitigation
                           measures.
GOAL PS-14: Minimize the impacts of transportation-related noise.
          Policy PS-14.1:  Consult with Caltrans and other regional agencies to
                           minimize the impact of transportation-related noise,
                           including noise associated with freeways, major arterials,
                           and rail lines.

                   Discussion: Freeway and State highway noise issues may result from
                               residents expressing concern related to an existing noise source
                               or for new/expanded roadway projects. In such cases,
                               coordination with Caltrans is required to assess the level of
                               impact and identify the most effective mitigation strategies. The
                               City should continue participating in the Route 210 Joint Powers
                               Authority (JPA) quarterly meetings with surrounding cities to
                               address noise and other related issues with Caltrans.
             Policy PS-14.2:   Require development that is, or will be, affected by railroad
                               noise to include appropriate measures to minimize adverse
                               noise effects on residents and businesses.
                   Discussion: Railroad operation noise is notable in the southern portion of the
                               City along two railroad spurs. In addition to noise from movement
                               along the tracks, other sources of noise include warning signals
                               sounded at grade crossings. New development should
                               understand and address the noise environment through
                               appropriate mitigation measures.

Introduction
Purpose and Intent
The Housing Element is intended to provide residents of the community and local government
officials with a greater understanding of housing needs in Rancho Cucamonga, and to provide
guidance to the decision-making process in all matters related to housing. The document
analyzes existing and future-housing needs, develops a problem-solving strategy, and provides a
course of action towards achieving Rancho Cucamonga's housing goal.
Legislative Authority                                                                         Chapter 9:
                                                                                              Housing:
The State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and a satisfying
environment for every resident of the State as a goal of highest priority. Recognizing        Housing consists of the following
that local planning programs play a significant role in the pursuit of this goal, and to      sections:
assure that local planning effectively implements the Statewide housing policy, the
Legislature mandates that all cities and counties include a Housing Element as part of          Introduction
their adopted General Plan. California Government Code §65583 requires the
preparation of a Housing Element and specifies that its contents include a needs                Housing Needs Assessment
assessment, a statement of goals, objectives, and policies, a five-year schedule of
program actions, and an assessment of past programs.                                            Housing Constraints
Government Code §65588 previously established the fourth revision of the Housing
Element on June 30, 2006, however the California Department of Housing and                      Housing Resources
Community Development extended the revision date to July 1, 2008. The fifth revision
adoption deadline is June 30, 2014.                                                             Housing Plan
Organization of the Housing Element
State law recognizes that local governments play a vital role in the availability, adequacy, and
affordability of housing. In California, every jurisdiction is required to adopt a long range General
Plan to guide its physical development; this Housing Element is one of the seven mandated
elements of the General Plan. Housing Element law mandates that local governments
adequately plan to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of
the community. The law recognizes that in order for the private market to adequately address
housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory
systems that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain housing production.
This Housing Element covers the planning period from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2014. Previous
editions of the Housing Element were approved with the Rancho Cucamonga General Plan in
1981, and updated in 1984, 1991, 1994, and 2000.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
 
Housing Element 
R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N                                                             HE‐1

              An analysis of the demographic, household and housing characteristics, and related
               housing needs;
              A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints to meeting the
               City's identified housing needs;
              An evaluation of the residential sites, financial, and administrative resources available to
               address the City's housing goal;
              An evaluation of the accomplishments achieved under the adopted 2000 Housing
               Element; and
              The Housing Plan for addressing the City's identified housing needs, constraints and
               resources, including housing goals, policies, and programs.
      Rancho Cucamonga's Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on the
      following:
              Conservation of the existing affordable housing stock;
              Providing adequate housing sites to accommodate the future housing needs for all
               income segments of the community;
              Assisting in the provision of affordable housing;
              Removing government and other constraints to housing development; and
              Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities for all Rancho Cucamonga residents.
      Data Sources and Methods
      In preparing this Housing Element, various sources of data were consulted. These include:
              U.S. Census Bureau, 1990 and 2000 Census;
              U.S. Census Bureau, 2006 American Community Survey (ACS);
              California Department of Finance (DOF), Population and Housing data;
              The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) prepared by the U.S.
               Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Household income data by type
               of household (e.g., seniors, large families, etc);
              A variety of household needs information derived from Rancho Cucamonga's 2005-
               2009 Consolidated Plan and the City's Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice;
              Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) 2008-2014 Regional Housing
               Needs Assessment (RHNA) provided information on existing and projected housing
               needs;
              SCAG and San Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG), provided information
               on population and household projections;
              Information on Rancho Cucamonga's development standards are obtained from the
               City's Development Code; and
              Information on planned expenditures of the Rancho Cucamonga Redevelopment Agency
               was obtained from the 2005-2009 Implementation Plan.
      The 2006 American Community Survey (ACS) was conducted using a very small sample size
      with corresponding large margins of error, and data was extrapolated where appropriate.
      Therefore, when available and appropriate, the 2006 ACS data are presented as percentages and
      used for reference.
      General Plan Consistency
      California law requires that General Plans contain an integrated set of goals and policies that are
      internally consistent within each element and the General Plan as a whole. This Housing
      Element update was prepared as part of the comprehensive General Plan update. Residential
      land use policies and housing objectives were developed to implement the new General Plan.
      Goals, objectives, and policies throughout the General Plan are related to and consistent with the
      Housing Element. Several examples illustrate the interactive character of the General Plan as
      follows: the Land Use Element sets forth the amount and type of residential development
      permitted, thereby affecting housing opportunity in Rancho Cucamonga; the Circulation Element
                                                                                                             
                                                                                         Housing Element

contains policies to minimize roadway traffic in residential neighborhoods; the Community Design
Element contains policies directed at maintaining the existing housing stock and ensuring the
quality of new residential development; the Resource Conservation Element establishes policies
to minimize the impact of residential development on sensitive resources, such as hillside areas,
ecological habitat, and scenic viewsheds; and the Public Safety Element sets forth policies to
ensure the safety of the City's housing stock through mitigation of natural and man-made
hazards. Further, the General Plan is updated periodically which helps to ensure consistency
among the elements. The most recently completed technical update of the General Plan was
adopted by the City Council on November 17, 2001; in addition, a comprehensive update is in
process with adoption anticipated in May 2010.
Public Participation
Government Code §65583(c)(7) states that "The local government shall make a diligent effort to
achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of the
housing element, and the program shall describe this effort." This Housing Element was updated
in conjunction with a comprehensive update to the City of Rancho Cucamonga General Plan. An
extensive community outreach program was implemented as part of the General Plan update.
As part of the General Plan update, the City utilized a comprehensive approach to obtaining direct
public input into the General Plan process to ensure that multiple avenues were explored and
employed to gain substantive input from the community during the entire update process:
        Stakeholder interviews,
        The formation of a General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC),
        Community Workshops,
        A public opinion survey,
        Visioneering,
        Forty-five (45) presentations of the "Road Show"
        The creation of a General Plan Update website,
        Periodic newsletters and press releases, and
        A recent telephone survey.
General Plan "Visioneering"
A public outreach for development of the General Plan update included "Visioneering" conducted
as a public opinion survey. Residents were asked to complete a brief questionnaire about where
the respondent lived, what makes where they live unique, what are the two most important issues
currently facing the City, and what the respondent is pessimistic and optimistic about the City's
future. Approximately 700 responses were received over the course of the survey time period.
Responses directly related to housing include:
        The production of affordable housing,
        Overcrowding, growth, urban sprawl, and traffic,
        Availability of water for future development,
        Providing adequate schools and education, and
        Environmental sustainability.
These Visioneering comments were utilized in the formation of a Vision Statement, which along
with stakeholder interviews, were used by the GPAC in the formation and development of seven
Guiding Principles. The Guiding Principles define the vision of the future for the City, thereby
reinforcing the intent of the General Plan document. The Guiding Principles include: the Spirit of
Family, Spirit of Discovery and Knowledge, Spirit of Community, Spirit of Heritage, Spirit of
Leadership, Spirit of Innovation and Enterprise, and the Spirit of Tomorrow. The Guiding
Principles were then presented to the community through the General Plan "Road Show."
General Plan "Road Show"
The General Plan "Road Show" was used to present the Guiding Principles to 45 civic groups and
private organizations (e.g., churches, public service providers, civic groups, housing providers,

      developers) that regularly meet or are identified with the City of Rancho Cucamonga as
      stakeholder groups and groups representing the many facets, demographics, and interests of the
      public, all in a span of several weeks. The workshops were intentionally informal, interactive, and
      facilitated in such a way to encourage the participants to openly offer their thoughts and
      comments on the language of the Guiding Principles.
      These Road Show workshops were held throughout the day, and on weekends, and were
      conducted to engage the community in interactive discussions on the issues, concerns, and
      aspirations for the City. These meetings covered a large range of topics, including housing. The
      workshops were held at City Hall, throughout the community, and in adjoining communities, close
      to many of the City's low and moderate income residents. Overall, the City's efforts were
      successful and effective, as over 450 comments were received from groups ranging in size from 5
      to 10 persons up to approximately 150 people. The workshops have proven to be a highly
      interactive venue to receive the thoughts and comments of the public.
      Housing Subcommittee and Community Workshop
      Opportunities for input on housing issues and recommended strategies are critical to the
      development of appropriate and effective programs to address the City's housing needs. Rancho
      Cucamonga solicited public participation through meetings held with the Housing Subcommittee
      and through a community workshop designed to obtain public feedback and to elicit public
      participation in the preparation of the document. To achieve meaningful public participation,
      notices of public meetings, public workshops, and public hearings were published in the Inland
      Valley Daily Bulletin, a local paper of general circulation. In addition, notices were also posted in
      the City's Community and Neighborhood Centers, several situated in close proximity to the City's
      affordable housing complexes, as well as at City Hall. Notices were also sent to the local chapter
      of the Building Industry Association and the Rancho Cucamonga Chamber of Commerce.
      Public Hearings
      On April 9, 2008 a Public Hearing was conducted before the Rancho Cucamonga Planning
      Commission to review and comment on the draft Housing Element. Prior to the public hearing
      copies of the draft Housing Element were made available to the Chamber of Commerce, at both
      City Libraries, and at the Planning Department public counter.
      Housing Element Responses
      Throughout the public participation process, the following issues were raised:
               Healthy cities and sustainability; the public expressed a desire for a balance between
                residential and commercial uses to promote a healthy city.
               Neighborhood identification and infill development.
               The City's character is what makes the City special; new development should respect
                and complement this character.
               The City should respect its character while identifying opportunities for providing
                affordable housing.
               Affordable housing for single occupants, families, and seniors is needed.
               Affordable housing complexes should be located in close proximity to public
                transportation facilities and retail uses.
               Expand housing options such as mixed-use development, live/work units, single-story
                homes on small lots, and high-density affordable housing.
      The Housing Element responds to these comments by promoting mixed-use development and
      high-density development in targeted neighborhoods while enhancing quality and character in
      established neighborhoods.           The Housing Element emphasizes the preservation and
      improvement of existing housing as well as the provision of affordable housing in various
      neighborhoods.

Housing Needs Assessment
This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics of the City's population and
housing stock as a means of better understanding the nature and extent of unmet housing needs.
The Housing Needs Assessment is comprised of the following components: 1) Demographic
Profile, 2) Household Profile, 3) Special Housing Needs, 4) Housing Stock Characteristics,
5) Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion, and 6) the Regional Housing Needs Assessment. 
Demographic Profile
California Government Code §65583(a)(1) requires "[a]n analysis of population and employment
trends and documentation of projections and a quantification of the locality's existing and
projected housing needs for all income levels, including extremely low income households …."
This analysis is necessary as demographic changes, such as population growth or changes in
age, can affect the type and amount of housing that is needed in a community.
Population Characteristics
According to the Department of Finance (DOF), the City of Rancho Cucamonga had a population
of approximately 177,736 as of January 1, 2009. Although the City experienced a significant
amount of population growth during the last few years, the City's peak year of growth, both in
absolute numbers and as a percentage of the population increasing, was in 1988 when the
population increased by 12,183, an increase of 17.1 percent. Between 2000 and 2007 the City's
population increased an average of 6,369 persons per year, an average percentile increase of
4.3 percent. During the last growth cycle, the peak year of residential growth occurred in 2003
where the population increased by 9,265 persons, an increase of 6.7 percent over the prior year.
Additionally, in terms of absolute growth, 3 of the highest years of population increases occurred
during the last 6 years (i.e., 2003, 2004, and 2006). 
Slow growth periods in the 1980's and 1990's have similar average growth rate percentages,
roughly in the 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent rate of growth. These low growth rates are generally
attributable to high interest rates, the post-Proposition 13 shift of new infrastructure costs from
property taxes to impact fees, tight lending policies, a general uncertainty in the real estate
market, and an economic recession. High growth periods in the early 2000's are attributable to
growth in the City economic base, land speculation, easing of lending practices, and other
practices to increase home ownership. Rancho Cucamonga's recent population growth trends
are similar to those of most neighboring communities which experienced a high level of growth
since 1990.

Population and Age Distribution
Age characteristics are related to differences in the type of housing needed. The median age for
Rancho Cucamonga is rising, increasing from 26.6 in 1980, 29.7 in 1990, and 32.2 in 2000. The

      The following table further demonstrates a maturing population. This table shows that a
      significant proportion of the City population is relatively young, with the largest age cohort being
      age 25 to 34 in 1990 and increasing to 35 to 44 in 2000. Significantly, 39.7 percent of the City's
      population is under age 25 and 47.6 percent is aged 25 to 54.

School Enrollment
An educated population is an important characteristic to the City as over 33.6 percent of the year
2000 population was enrolled in school. As of year 2000, 86.0 percent of the population had
obtained a high school education and 23.3 percent had obtained a bachelor's degree or higher
education.

Educational Attainment
An individual's level of education is closely related to their ability to earn a living. The educational
attainment level of Rancho Cucamonga residents is high relative to the rest of San Bernardino
County and the State of California. As reflected in the age distribution and the school enrollment
tables, residents of Rancho Cucamonga will continue to represent a higher percentage of
educated persons, when compared to the County or the State.

      Race and Ethnicity
      Census 2000 provides a significant number of detailed demographic characteristics for Rancho
      Cucamonga. Historically, the City's population consisted predominantly of White residents,
      ranging from 78.9 percent in 1980, 68.6 percent in 1990, to 66.5 percent in 2000; in absolute
      terms, the City's minority population nearly quadrupled during the same time ranging from
      21.1 percent (11,657) in 1980, 31.4 percent (31,842) in 1990, to 33.5 percent (42,756) in 2000.
      The Census Bureau changed the enumeration of races with the 2000 Census. This change in the
      way races are counted significantly altered the ability to effectively evaluate racial trends between
      the 2000 and 1980 or 1990 Census. However, under the one race data provided below, White
      residents represent 66.5 percent of the City's total population. Those who identified themselves
      as White alone were 71 percent of the total population in 2000.

      Employment
      Employment plays a major role in addressing housing needs because it is highly correlated to
      income; those residents with higher incomes have more housing options, and conversely, those
      persons with lower income typically have limited housing options. Looking at the employment
      market in Rancho Cucamonga as well as major employers and the types of jobs Rancho
      Cucamonga residents have will provide important information relative to housing needs. This is
      because the local employment market affects demand for housing and this demand changes the
      housing market.
      The City of Rancho Cucamonga is located in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario Metropolitan
      Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan statistical areas are geographic entities defined by the U.S.
      Office of Management and Budget for use by Federal statistical agencies in collecting, tabulating,
      and publishing Federal statistics. The following statistics are applicable to the Riverside-San
      Bernardino-Ontario MSA.

The MSA is generally characterized by three decades of rapid growth. According to the Census,
the previously unincorporated area which became Rancho Cucamonga had a 1970 population of
16,043; Rancho Cucamonga incorporated in 1977. The June 1, 1978, DOF population estimate
was 44,600. By 1980, the population had increased to 55,250, 101,409 in 1990, and 127,743 in
2000. The January 1, 2009 DOF population estimate for Rancho Cucamonga was 177,736.
The region and the City's growth are directly correlated to residential and economic development
in Orange and Los Angeles Counties. As land costs increase in the City and sub-region,
homebuilders, developers, and employers continue to look at Rancho Cucamonga for less
expensive land than may be available in Orange, Los Angeles, or Riverside counties.
Based upon information from the City's Economic Profile, between 1991 to 2005, employment in
firms and agencies located in the City more than doubled, rising an average of 6.9 percent per
year and going from 24,670 to 63,004 jobs. Together, the manufacturing, distribution, and
construction sectors accounted for 31.0 percent of this growth, as the City's economic base
expanded. Retailing accounted for 21.7 percent, both because existing retailers reacted to the
larger economic base and because several new power centers opened along the City's major
arterial roads, including Victoria Gardens, a new regional mall. From 2003 to 2005, Rancho
Cucamonga's yearly job growth rates were an aggressive 7.7 percent, 8.0 percent and
6.6 percent, far exceeding those of the Inland Empire (3.3 percent, 5.3 percent, and 4.8 percent),
California's fastest growing region.
At the time of the 2000 Census, 61,950 residents, or 48.9 percent of the population was
employed. The following tables show the industries where these residents were employed and
the respective percentage of the labor force. The three largest employment sectors were
education, health and social services at 20.9 percent, retail trade at 13.2 percent, and
manufacturing at 12.9 percent. Correspondingly, the two highest occupation sectors are
management, professional and related occupations at 35.6 percent and sales and office
occupations at 30.5 percent.

       Employment Status
       The City has a sizeable labor force that increased by 27.8 percent (18,236) between 2000 and
       2006. During this time the unemployment rate increased from 3.7 percent to 4.0 percent, an
       increase of 1,226 unemployed persons. During the same period, the City achieved a marginal
       increase in the employment rate percentage of the population increasing from 65.7 percent to
       66.5 percent, yet in absolute terms this represents an increase in 16,723 persons. In 2009 these
       employment statistics would be extremely different as regional news sources published a
       14.2 percent unemployment rate for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSA.

Poverty Status
The 2000 Census identified that there were 1,574 families and 8,955 individuals below the
poverty level in 1999. Although this number is significant at 4.9 percent and 7.1 percent of the
population, respectively, by far the most significant criteria relates to female headed
householders. Although the figure does not represent a significant number of persons relative to
the overall population of the City, the figure is significant in that 24.2 percent of the families with a
female headed household, with no husband present, and with children under 5 years of age live
below the poverty level.

Household Profile
California Government Code §65583(a)(2) requires "an analysis and documentation of household
characteristics, including level of payment compared to ability to pay, housing characteristics,
including overcrowding, and housing stock conditions." Household characteristics play an
important role in defining community needs. Household type and size, income levels, and the
presence of special needs populations all affect the type of housing needed by residents. This
section details the various household characteristics affecting housing needs in Rancho
Cucamonga.
Household Type
A household can be defined as all persons living in a housing unit. Families are a subset of
households, and include persons living together related by blood, marriage, or adoption. A single
person living alone is also a household. Other households include unrelated people living in the

       same dwelling unit.        Group quarters, such as convalescent facilities are not considered
       households.
       Household type, income, and tenure can help to identify the special needs populations as well as
       other factors that affect the housing needs of the City. Rancho Cucamonga has a significant
       number of families with children, who typically look for larger dwellings. In contrast, single-person
       households tend to have smaller housing needs and look for smaller housing options (i.e.,
       condos, apartments, etc). While seniors may look for housing that is both affordable and easy to
       maintain.
       Rancho Cucamonga's household profile has seen some important changes with respect to
       household types. The City remains a predominantly family community with a 21.7 percent
       increase in family households. The majority of these households have children; however, there
       has been a significant increase in the number of family households with no children and other
       family households. As of 2008, the DOF estimated that Rancho Cucamonga has 54,036
       occupied households, representing a 32.2 percent increase since 2000, compared to a
       21.5 percent increase during the previous decade.

       According to the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) 3-Year Estimates, in 2007 the
       average household size was 3.23 for owner-occupied households and 2.51 for renter-occupied
       households.
       Household Income
       Household income is an important element affecting housing opportunities, as it is the primary
       factor determining the ability of households to balance housing costs with other basic necessities.
       The 2000 Census identified the median household income for Rancho Cucamonga at $60,931,
       increasing to $75,429 in 2006, which was significantly higher than the San Bernardino County
       median household income at $42,066 in 2000 and $52,941 in 2006. In 2009, for Federal
       assistance programs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) identified a
       median income of $64,500 for a family of four for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSA.

Definitions
For planning and funding purposes, the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) categorizes households into five income groups based on the County
Median Area Median Income (AMI). These five income categories include:
          Extremely Low Income – Up to 30 percent of the AMI.
          Very Low Income – 31 to 50 percent of the AMI.
          Low Income – 51 to 80 percent of the AMI.
          Moderate Income – 81 to 120 percent of the AMI.
          Above Moderate Income – Greater than 120 percent of the AMI.
When combined, the extremely low, very low, and low income households are often referred to as
lower income households.
Income by Household Type and Tenure
While housing choices, such as tenure (either owning or renting) and location are income
dependent, household size and type often affect the proportion of income that can be spent on
housing. Income data developed by HUD, based on the 2000 Census, is used to provide an
overview of income distribution by household type and tenure in Rancho Cucamonga. By looking
at the breakdown of household type by income group, the housing needs of special groups can
be identified. As shown in the following table, Small Family households made up the majority of
households in all income categories. Roughly half of all elderly households are in the extremely
low, very low, and low income categories.

       Housing Problems
       Typical housing problems include cost burden, overcrowding, and substandard housing. Many
       lower income households (e.g., extremely low, very low, and low income) cope with the housing
       cost issues either by assuming a cost burden, or by occupying a smaller than needed, or
       substandard housing unit. Specifically, based on HUD statistics, 73.8 percent of the City's
       extremely low income, 84.9 percent of the very low income, and 75.4 percent of the low income
       households were experiencing one or more housing problems (e.g., cost burden, overcrowding,
       and substandard housing) in 2000.
       In general, the City's housing stock is in good condition. According to the 1990 Census, 36,169
       units were available in 1990. A building spurt occurred from 1970-1979 when 31.1 percent, or
       11,296 units, were constructed. A larger spurt occurred during the five-year period from 1985-
       1989 when 33.7 percent, or 12,309 units, were added to the housing stock. The 1990's saw an
       increase of almost 4,800 units, and State estimates for the seven year period starting in 2000
       show an increase of over 12,000 units.
       Overcrowding
       Overcrowding is defined by HCD as a household with more than one person per room (excluding
       bathrooms, kitchen, etc). Severe overcrowding is defined as more than 1.5 persons per room.
       From 1990 to 2000, the incidents of overcrowding increased slightly; although the percentage
       difference was only 1.3 percent, in absolute terms, the total number increased by 741 households
       (a relative increase of 67.6 percent). Similarly, the incidents of severe overcrowding decreased in
       the overall percentage, but in absolute terms, increased by only 96 households (an increase of
       12.7 percent).
       Increased overcrowding appears to disproportionately affect renter households. Census figures
       estimate that 7.2 percent of the renter-occupied households and 3.3 percent of the owner-
       occupied households were living in overcrowded conditions. These conditions can be attributed
       to high housing costs relative to income, combined with inadequately sized housing units. And
       when considering severely overcrowded conditions, the differences are similar as 4.0 percent of
       renter-occupied households and 1.3 percent of owner-occupied households were considered to
       be living in severely overcrowded conditions.

Cost Burden/Overpayment
Employment, household income, and the availability of a wide range of housing types directly
relate to housing affordability. Within Rancho Cucamonga, most owners and renters can afford
their housing costs by the measure of affordability recognized by the Federal government.
Housing cost burden, also known as overpayment, is defined as a housing cost that exceeds
30 percent of a household's gross income. A severe cost burden is a housing cost that exceeds
50 percent of a household's gross income. Housing cost burden is particularly problematic for the
extremely low, very low, and low income households because a high housing cost typically leaves
little resources remaining for a household to cover other living expenses.
In renter-occupied households, 36.8 percent experience cost burden and 13.9 percent experience
severe cost burden. Among owner-occupied households, 32.5 percent experience cost burden
and 10.2 percent experience severe cost burden. Most notably, among all households
33.8 percent experience overpayment and 11.3 percent experience severe overpayment.
The following tables highlight the total percentage of renter and owner households overburdened
by housing costs. Overall, cost burden affects owner-occupied and renter-occupied households
similarly in the lower income groups (extremely low, very low, and low income). As market rents
are generally affordable to moderate income households, renters in this income group do not
appear to be as impacted by a cost burden.

       Substandard Units
       The general definition of a substandard unit is a unit that does not meet the Federal Housing
       Quality Standards of the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program and/or the City of Rancho
       Cucamonga's Development Code. While it is not possible to determine the number of units that
       meet such criteria, the number of units may be estimated by evaluating specific factors that
       indicate a unit is substandard. When the potential presence of lead-based paint is subtracted, the
       number of substandard units is estimated to be 569, or around 1.0 percent, of the City's housing
       stock.
       Specifically, the 2000 Census identified incidences of substandard factors, including incomplete
       plumbing, the lack of a complete kitchen and heating fuels, vacant and boarded-up homes, as
       well as the potential presence of lead-based paint.
       Of the total incidence of 2,315 substandard factors, 83 percent, or 1,922 factors, were considered
       suitable for rehabilitation. From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, more than 60 single-
       family units were demolished. Substandard conditions are also addressed through the CDBG
       Home Improvement Program.

Target Areas for Assistance
HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) requirements establish that 51 percent of the
persons benefiting from a program are of low and moderate income. When considering current
Census Tract Block Group data, only 2 of the City's 36 Block Groups have a low and moderate
income population that meet this minimum requirement. To address this requirement, HUD
allows cities to utilize the Upper Quartile Method whereby Block Groups are arranged in a
descending order, based on the percentage of low and moderate income residents within each
Block Group. Multiplying the total number of Block Groups by 25 percent results in one-quarter of
the total, or a Block Group quartile. The lowest percentage of low and moderate income
residents in the top 25 percent of all Block Groups establishes the threshold for the Upper
Quartile. Utilizing this method, those Upper Quartile Census Tract Block Groups with a
28.3 percent or greater concentration of low-income persons qualify as target areas.
Two target areas have historic community identities, Northtown (located south of Foothill
Boulevard between Haven Avenue and Archibald Avenue) and southwest Cucamonga (located
south of Foothill Boulevard west of Hellman Avenue). Portions of Alta Loma and the Rochester
Tract, which were previously qualified by a special census, do not qualify for assistance by the
Upper Quartile Method. Historically, City resources, including CDBG and Redevelopment funding
have been focused on Northtown and Southwest Cucamonga. Conservation and rehabilitation of
housing stock has been a priority in the target areas.
Special Housing Needs
California Government Code §65583(a)(7) requires "[a]n analysis of any special housing needs,
such as those of the elderly, persons with disabilities, large families, farmworkers, families with
female heads of households, and families and persons in need of emergency shelter."
State law recognizes that certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent and affordable
housing due to special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one's income,
family characteristics, or disability status. In Rancho Cucamonga, special needs populations
include the senior households, persons with disabilities, female headed households, large
households, the homeless, students, and farmworkers.
Senior Households
Senior households have special housing needs due to a variety of concerns, including: a limited
or fixed income, health care costs, transportation, disabilities, and access to housing. Rancho
Cucamonga experienced a 51.9 percent increase in senior residents from 1990 to 2000 (Table
HE-2). The ACS estimated that in 2007, 6.6 percent of Rancho Cucamonga residents were
senior households; increasing from 5.0 percent in 1990 and 6.0 percent in 2000. Further,
according to the 2000 Census, 7,788 persons 65 years of age and over reside in the City;
representing a significant needs group. A large proportion of elderly renter and owner households

       have incomes below 80 percent of the area median family income. Within the elderly population,
       73.4 percent of all elderly renters and 39.8 percent of all elderly homeowners are within the lower
       income categories (e.g., extremely low, very low, and low income). A cost burden greater than
       30 percent of their income is experienced by 65.7 percent of all elderly renters and 35.3 percent
       of all elderly homeowners (Table HE-15). Additionally, 36.9 percent of all elderly renters and
       17.4 percent of all elderly homeowners experienced a cost burden greater than 50 percent of their
       income (Table HE-16).
       Many senior citizens have reached their retirement years without adequate resources to meet
       their needs. For renters, the problem of living on fixed incomes in a housing market where costs
       increase faster than inflation can be difficult. Even those seniors who prepared well for their
       retirement may have had their savings depleted as the result of declining interest rates or a
       lengthy illness.
       Social service professionals who work with seniors stress that while the elderly do not mind living
       alone and often prefer it, they want to be part of a neighborhood where they feel an attachment, a
       sense of belonging, feel reasonably safe, and have easy access to basic services. However,
       housing costs and living expenses may increase and threaten their ability to continue to live in
       neighborhoods where they may have spent substantial parts of their lives.
       The special needs of seniors can be met through a range of services, including congregate care,
       rent subsidies, shared housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance. As demonstrated in the
       previous data, the elderly need assistance with rental housing, and local senior housing projects
       and Federal Section 8 rental assistance programs address the elderly rental need. Those seniors
       who own their own homes may have difficulty when non-housing expenses increase and their
       income does not. In such cases, home maintenance needs are often deferred. Elderly
       homeowners often need housing rehabilitation services; local repair and rehabilitation programs
       address the elderly homeowner need. In Rancho Cucamonga, the allocation of public resources
       to assist seniors with their housing needs is higher than for any other special needs group.
       Persons with Disabilities
       A disability is defined as a long lasting condition that impairs an individual's mobility, ability to
       work, or ability to care for themselves. There are three different types of disabilities that create
       varying housing needs. These include the physically disabled, the developmentally disabled, and
       the mentally disabled. Disabled persons have special housing needs because of their fixed
       income, shortage of affordable and accessible housing, and higher health costs associated with
       their disability. The 2000 Census identifies four different disability categories: 1) sensory, 2)
       physical, 3) mental, and 4) self-care. Persons with disabilities often require public assistance,
       including housing needs.
       According to the 2000 Census, a total of 17,292 persons (14.8 percent of the population 5 years
       and over) have a disability. This includes 3.8 percent (962 persons) of those aged 5 to 15,
       15.3 percent (12,919 persons) of those aged 16 to 64, and 44.1 percent (3,411 persons) of those
       aged 65 and older. In absolute terms, the 16 to 65 age group has the highest number of disabled
       persons, but in relative terms as a percentage of the population, the population age group of 65
       and older has the highest number of disabled persons with almost half of the population having at
       least one disability. Over two thirds of the adult disabled population is employed, with
       63.2 percent of those persons with at least one disability being employed.
       The City's disabled population needs a range of facilities and services. Facilities include physical
       access to buildings and transportation. The minimum requirement is set forth by Federal
       legislation. Specially equipped housing units are needed. Special equipment includes lifts,
       ramps, grab bars, extra-wide doorways, special kitchen equipment, and special bathroom design.
        Such equipment is generally privately provided on a case-by-case basis. Handicapped renters
       are permitted to install special equipment, but low-income disabled persons may need public
       assistance to achieve a livable dwelling unit. Specially equipped units may be included in senior
       housing designs.
       As indicated by the Census figures, many disabled persons work and live independently.
       According to social service professionals, housing assistance is often needed when disabled
                                                                                                              
                                                                                         Housing Element

individuals complete rehabilitation programs. For low-income disabled, assistance with the
installation of special equipment and availability of affordable housing are primary needs.
The range of services for the disabled includes full institutional care, transitional care, and
independent living. Transitional care may be provided by families or through group quarters. The
latter may include on-site professional or paraprofessional support. The State of California
Community Care Licensing Division identifies a variety of residential care facilities in Rancho
Cucamonga, these include: 4 Adult Day Care Facilities, 12 Adult Residential Facilities, 6 Group
Home Facilities, 14 Residential Care for the Elderly Facilities, and 2 Small Family Home Care
Facilities.
Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households typically have a special need for such services as childcare and health
care, among others. Female-headed households with children tend to have lower incomes, which
limits their housing options and access to supportive services. A mother with her own children
constitutes a female-headed household. According to the 2000 Census, 3,847 households
(9.3 percent of all households) are female-headed households and 4.1 percent of all households
are male-headed; thus, 13.4 percent of all households are single-parent households. In
comparison, the 1990 Census counted 9.2 percent for all single-parent households, of which
7.0 percent were female-headed.
In 2000, the mean income for female-headed households was $43,198. Female-headed
households have substantially less income than other household categories; in comparison, the
mean income for married-couple families was $86,060.
According to the 2000 Census, poverty level is based on the national average income and was at
or below $17,050 for a family of four. The incomes of 653 female-headed households,
representing 12.4 percent of the 5,279 female headed households with no husband present were
below the national poverty level. In comparison, the incomes of 691 married couple families,
representing 2.8 percent of the 24,753 married-couple families were below the national poverty
level.
In addition to housing assistance, it is reasonable to assume that all households that fall below
the poverty level are in need of social service assistance, including childcare and healthcare, and
that many also need assistance with education and job training. It is also reasonable to assume
that high proportions of poverty level households, particularly single-parent households, are at risk
of homelessness.
Large Households
Large households consist of five or more persons and are considered a special needs population
due to the limited availability of affordable and adequately sized housing. The lack of large units
is especially evident among rental units. Large households often live in overcrowded conditions,
due to both the lack of large enough units, and insufficient income to afford available units of an
adequate size.
Large households comprise a special needs group because of their need for larger units, which
often will command higher prices that are not affordable to many large households. In order to
save for other necessities such as transportation, medical, food, and clothing, it is not uncommon
for lower income large households to reside in smaller units, which results in overcrowding.
In 2000, there were 40,863 households in Rancho Cucamonga; of these, 6,861 were single
person households, 27,232 were 2 to 4 person households, and 6,770 were large households.
Large households comprised 16.6 percent of all households, of these large households,
12.5 percent, or 1,519 households are renter-occupied.

       Rancho Cucamonga addresses the affordable housing needs of large households by offering
       home ownership assistance and by encouraging the development of affordable housing units with
       two or more bedrooms. The City provides infill single-family homes with Northtown Housing
       Development Corporation (NHDC) and also provides Down Payment Assistance through the
       Redevelopment Agency (RDA) First Time Homebuyer Program. Additionally, the RDA provides
       financial assistance to non-profit and for-profit developers to construct affordable homes suitable
       for a variety of housing needs, including large households.
       Homeless
       An analysis of the City's homeless population can be challenging because of the transient nature
       of the population. People can be classified homeless because of a variety of circumstances
       including: 1) those persons who are chronically homeless resulting from alcohol or drug use, and
       2) those persons who are situationally homeless resulting from job loss, arguments with family or
       friends, incarceration, or violence (both family and domestic).
       In 2007 the Community Action Partnership of San Bernardino County completed a homeless
       census and survey to address the prevalence of homelessness in the County. The San
       Bernardino County Homeless Coalition is organized into five local coordinating groups; District 2
       encompasses the immediate regional area and includes Fontana, Rancho Cucamonga, and
       Upland. The survey identified a total of 7,331 homeless persons, an increase of 2,061 over the
       2003 survey (an increase of 41 percent). The survey identified 7,198 homeless persons within
       the five districts, 122 of those persons were located within Rancho Cucamonga, representing a
       53.1 percent decrease from 2003.
       The San Bernardino County Homeless Census and Survey results for District 2 counted a total of
       741 persons, 122 of which were located within Rancho Cucamonga. This total resulted from a
       count of 48 individuals, 14 people in families, and 60 people in cars/RV's/vans. The majority of
       the homeless persons were unsheltered; the sheltered count included only the 14 people in
       families.
       To address the City's homeless special needs population Rancho Cucamonga annually utilizes
       15 percent of their CDBG allocation to provide public and supportive services to prevent
       homelessness and/or aid those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. As required
       by Federal regulations, these funds are directed to those persons in need (as 51 percent of those
       served must be low and moderate income), especially those with special needs.
       Homeless supportive and prevention services funded through the City's CDBG program include:
               House of Ruth – Provides shelter (transitional housing), programs, education, and
                opportunities for safe, self-sufficient, healthy living for battered women and their children
                who are at-risk of homelessness.
               Foothill Family Shelter – Provides a 90-day transitional housing shelter for homeless
                families with children.
               Inland Valley Council of Churches (SOVA Program) – Provides a 5-day food supply for
                all members of a household.
               Inland Fair Housing and Mediation Board – Addresses fair housing mediation and
                landlord-tenant dispute resolution services, which helps prevent homelessness.
       Students
       Various institutions of higher learning are located within the City of Rancho Cucamonga, including

Chaffey College, University of La Verne, University of Redlands, and University of Phoenix. As of
the 2000 Census, a total of 10,693 Rancho Cucamonga residents were enrolled in college or
graduate school (Table HE-3), comprising 8.4 percent of the population. These students have
unique housing needs because they may have limited funds, be on a relatively tight budget, and
in need of short term housing. A lack of affordable housing impacts this special needs group,
which often leads to overcrowded living situations.
Because the City benefits from an educated population, an additional consideration is the
retention of recent college graduates. As young professionals begin their career they are often
unable to afford most apartment rental prices and the purchase price of a home, and would seek
housing opportunities in neighboring communities.
Farmworkers
According to the 2000 Census, there were 117 persons employed in farming, forestry, and fishing
occupations (Table HE-8), which is less than 0.2 percent of the 61,950 employed persons living in
the City. There is no information available to desegregate farmworkers from the category
"farming, fishing, and forestry." Based on the absence of agricultural production in the City, it is
assumed that there are very few such jobs. Citrus and vineyard agriculture was declining at the
time of the City's incorporation and there are currently no agricultural zones in the City. A few
orchards and vineyards remained in production during the transition years before urban buildup.
As a consequence of the small population and rapidly declining agricultural production, no
statistical need for housing has been identified for farmworkers.
Housing Stock Characteristics
Residential growth has fundamentally defined the housing character of Rancho Cucamonga and
is one of the more tangible measures of the quality of life found in each neighborhood. Rancho
Cucamonga contains a mixture of seven major residential neighborhoods, each distinguished by
its own history, housing type, lot patterns, and street configuration. These seven areas include
the original three communities that formed Rancho Cucamonga, i.e., Alta Loma, Cucamonga, and
Etiwanda, and those areas of infill and surrounding development consisting of Etiwanda North,
Terra Vista, Victoria, and Caryn.
Alta Loma
The Alta Loma area encompasses roughly one-third of Rancho Cucamonga and is bordered by
the City boundary to the north and west, Deer Creek to the east, and Base Line Road to the
south. This area is characterized by stable neighborhoods, established single-family homes
situated on larger one-half acre equestrian oriented lots in the northern portion and one-quarter
acre lots to the south. The neighborhood contains a variety of multi-family housing complexes
that are situated along the major boulevards in the southern portion.
Cucamonga
The Cucamonga area encompasses roughly one-third of Rancho Cucamonga and is bordered by
Base Line Road to the north, Deer Creek Channel to the east, and the City boundary to the west
and south. This area contains a stable mix of single-family and multi-family housing. This area
also contains the Red Hill area distinguished by hillside terrain, a non-traditional street layout, a
wide mix of lot sizes, and is anchored by the Red Hill Country Club.
Etiwanda
The Etiwanda area is located along the eastern portion of Rancho Cucamonga and is bordered by
the City boundary to the north and east, Day Creek Channel to the west, and Foothill Boulevard to
the south. The Etiwanda Specific Plan was developed to retain the rural character of the area
and equestrian orientated residential development. The area is characterized by stable
residential neighborhoods surrounded by Eucalyptus windrows reminiscent of the agricultural
heritage of the area. Residential uses include a mix of one acre, one-half acre, and one-quarter
acre residential lots, with the larger lots suitable for equestrian uses.

       Etiwanda North
       The Etiwanda North neighborhood is located to the north and west of the Etiwanda area. The
       neighborhood contains large single-family lots, similar to the Alta Loma area, but utilizes a non-
       traditional street layout.
       Terra Vista
       The Terra Vista neighborhood, generally located north of Foothill Boulevard, south of Base Line
       Road, between Haven Avenue and Rochester, is distinguished by curvilinear streets, small lot
       single-family homes, and quality multi-family housing. This neighborhood includes several parks,
       supportive commercial land uses, and the Rancho Cucamonga Central Park, a 103 acre park
       currently anchored by the James L. Brulte Senior Center and the Goldie S. Lewis Community
       Center.
       Victoria
       The Victoria neighborhood is located to the north and east of Terra Vista. The Victoria area is
       distinguished by stable residential developments, curvilinear streets, and small and mid-size
       single-family homes. The area includes several parks, supportive commercial land uses, and is
       anchored by Victoria Gardens.
       Caryn
       The Caryn area is located north of the 210 freeway, south of Banyan Street, between Milliken
       Avenue and Rochester Avenue. The Caryn neighborhood is a fully developed residential
       development community containing a variety of parks, curvilinear streets, and small to mid-sized
       single-family homes.
       The Housing Element will provide policy guidance to strengthen each neighborhood and guide
       residential development throughout the duration of the planning period.
       Housing Growth
       Between 1990 and 2000, Rancho Cucamonga's housing units grew by 5,947 housing units, an
       increase of 16.4 percent. According to the DOF, Rancho Cucamonga has a total of 55,716
       housing units as of January 1, 2009. This represents an increase of 13,582 housing units since
       2000, an overall increase of 32.2 percent, which is over double that of the growth rate
       experienced by the County. As Rancho Cucamonga matures, the amount of vacant residentially
       zoned land available for new development will lessen, which will allow for modest growth during
       the planning period.

       Housing Types and Tenure
       A diverse range of housing types helps to ensure that all houholds, regardless of income, age, or
       household size, will have the opportunity to find housing suitable to meet their housing needs. Of
       the City's nearly 56,000 housing units in 2009, 70.0 percent are single-family units and
       27.0 percent are multi-family units. Rancho Cucamonga also has 8 mobile home parks with
       1,380 mobile home units, which in 2009 make up just 2.5 percent of the housing stock.

Housing tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owned, rented, or is vacant. Tenure is an
important indicator of the housing climate of a community, reflecting the relative cost of housing
opportunities, and the ability of residents to afford housing. Tenure also influences residential
mobility, with owner-occupied units generally having lower turnover rates than rental housing.
Most residents of Rancho Cucamonga live in owner-occupied housing; the ratio of owner-
occupied to renter-occupied housing has remained constant at around 70.0 percent since 1990.

Vacancy Rate
A vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and is often a good
indicator of how efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are meeting the current housing
demand. A vacancy rate of 5.0 to 6.0 percent for rental housing and 1.0 to 2.0 percent for
ownership housing is generally considered healthy and suggests that there is a balance between
the demand and supply of housing. A lower vacancy rate may indicate that households are
having difficulty in finding housing that is affordable, leading to overcrowded conditions or a cost
burden for households paying more for housing than they can afford.
Between 1990 and 2000, the overall vacancy rate decreased from 7.5 percent to 3.0 percent.
The vacancy rate for buildings with five or more units was significantly higher than for other unit
types. The City believes that the Census overstated the 1990 vacancy rate by approximately
3.5 percent through field survey errors which resulted in the unexpected vacancy rate for 5+ units
at nearly 15 percent. Since 2000, DOF records have consistently shown a 3.02 percent vacancy
rate for the City.

       Housing Age and Condition
       Generally, housing older than 30 years of age will require minor repairs and modernization
       improvements. Housing units over 50 years of age are more likely to require major rehabilitation
       such as roofing, plumbing, HVAC, and electrical system repairs. After 70 years of age a unit is
       generally deemed to have exceeded its useful life.
       Approximately 29.4 percent of the 55,716 housing units in Rancho Cucamonga were built prior to
       1980, making the majority of these units at least 30 years old. The vast majority of these units
       were built during the 1970's, potentially requiring minor repairs. Units older than 50 years
       comprised about 4.2 percent of the housing stock; these units may require moderate to
       substantial repairs. Less than one-half of 1.0 percent of units are older than 70 years; therefore,
       few housing units in Rancho Cucamonga are likely to have exceeded their useful life. Historic
       preservation programs, Code Enforcement activity, and CDBG programs are aimed at
       maintaining older housing stock in residential areas.

       Housing Conditions Survey
       Housing age is only useful as a general indicator of the condition of housing within the City. It
       does not take into account any actions by the property owner to maintain and/or upgrade their
       property. As part of the Housing Element update, the City conducted a survey of residential lots
       in selected neighborhoods and found that 65.0 percent of homes were in relatively good
       condition, 18.0 percent required minor maintenance, 13.0 percent required moderate
       maintenance, 2.0 percent required substantial maintenance, and 2.0 percent were in dilapidated
       condition. Therefore, 35.0 percent of the City's single-family homes were reported to require at
       least some improvements.
       A focused building-by-building survey covering multi-family units was also conducted. Among the
       95 structures surveyed, 67.0 percent were ranked in relatively good condition, 21.0 percent
       required minor maintenance, 10.0 percent required moderate maintenance, and 2.0 percent
       required substantial maintenance/rehabilitation. Deferred maintenance was disproportionately
       concentrated in small complexes.
       During the past few years, the City has made progress in neighborhood improvements through its
       various residential rehabilitation programs (e.g., Home Improvement Program for income eligible
       single-family and mobile homeowners). In addition, infill developments have also eliminated

Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high compared to household income, housing cost burden and
overcrowding occur. This section summarizes the cost and affordability of housing to Rancho
Cucamonga residents.
Housing Sales Prices
Similar to most southland communities, the sale prices for housing in the San Bernardino valley
escalated between 2000 and 2005. Much of the appreciation in home value over the decade was
due to the rapid escalation in housing demand throughout the region, the availability of lower
interest loans that have stretched the purchasing power of residents, and the desirability of new
housing products on the market.
In 2000, the median home price in the City of Rancho Cucamonga was $182,200, based on the
2000 Census. In 2005, the median home price in Rancho Cucamonga increased to $460,000, a
21.1 percent increase from the 2004 median price of $380,000 and almost two and half times the
price in 2000. However, starting at the end of 2005, the implosion of the mortgage lending
industry led to price depreciation in most southland communities. Between 2005 and October
2007, the median home price in Rancho Cucamonga decreased 2.2 percent. While some
communities still experienced some price increases, the increases were far below those that
occurred between 2004 and 2005.

to single-family homes. Small condominiums and mobile homes are the most affordable
homeownership option in Rancho Cucamonga.

Housing Rents
Rents vary depending on unit type (single-family home, townhomes, apartment, etc.), the size and
condition of the unit, and nearby amenities. According to the 2005 ACS, 1.0 percent of units rent
for less than $500 in Rancho Cucamonga; these are most likely units subsidized by affordability

       Housing Affordability
       The real estate boom in southern California has created an unprecedented increase in housing
       prices throughout the region, including Rancho Cucamonga and the surrounding communities.
       Rancho Cucamonga considers housing affordability to be a critical issue; this is because of the
       inability of residents to afford and obtain decent housing can lead to overcrowded living
       conditions, an over extension of a households financial resources, the premature deterioration of
       housing due to a high number of occupants, and situations where young families and seniors
       cannot afford to live near other family members.
       Housing affordability can be determined by comparing housing prices and rents to the income
       levels of residents in the same community, or within a larger region such as the Riverside-San
       Bernardino-Ontario MSA. The Federal government has established an affordability threshold that
       measures whether or not a household can afford housing. Typically, a household should pay no
       more than 30 percent of their gross income for housing, although a slightly higher cost burden is
       allowed by the mortgage industry because of the tax advantages of homeownership.
       The following table compares the maximum housing price and rent that could be afforded by
       different income levels in Rancho Cucamonga. As discussed previously (Table HE-26), the
       average priced single-family home and condominium sell for $306,600 and $178,800,
       respectively. Since low and moderate income households could afford no more than $266,000 for
       a single-family home, any type of single-family dwelling and most condominiums would not be
       affordable at current sales prices.
       Apartments, single-family homes, and condominiums typically rent between $950 and $1,600 per
       month. Low and moderate income households can afford between $1,000 and $1,700 in rent per
       month, depending on the size of the unit and the number of bedrooms. Most existing apartments
       and home rentals are thus affordable to low and moderate income households.

Housing Preservation Needs
California Government Code §65583(a)(9)(A-D) requires "[a]n analysis of existing assisted
housing developments that are eligible to change from low-income housing uses during the next
10 years due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage payment, or expiration of restrictions
on use." The study must include units at-risk during the next two five-year Housing Element
update periods. The first five-year period extends from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2010 and the
second period extends from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015.
Inventory of Units At-Risk
The inventory of affordable housing projects within Rancho Cucamonga is listed in the following
table. This inventory includes all multiple-family units which are assisted under a variety of
Federal, State, and/or local programs, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) programs, State and local bond programs, RDA programs, and local
programs, including but not limited to: in-lieu fees, density bonus, or direct assistance. The
inventoried units are those eligible to change to market rate housing due to termination of subsidy
contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions.
The inventory was compiled by the Rancho Cucamonga Planning Department through
discussions with the Rancho Cucamonga RDA, the County of San Bernardino CDH, the
California Debt Limit Allocation Committee (CDLAC), the California Tax Credit Allocation
Committee (CTCAC), and a review of "Listing of Notices Received Pursuant to Government Code
§65863.10 and §65863.11" prepared by the California Housing Partnership Corporation.
Those units at-risk of converting to market rate prior to June 30, 2015, were assisted by County of
San Bernardino CDH with participation in the County's mortgage revenue bond program, State
bond financing, and HUD; affordable units were restricted for periods of 30 to 40 years. The
identified units were restricted through the property owner's participation with the County's bond
program, and did not include the City's participation. Those units not at-risk of conversion to
market rate after July 1, 2015 were restricted through regulatory agreements between owners and
the Rancho Cucamonga RDA, with funding by 20 percent Set-Aside funds and CTCAC financing.
  Affordable units assisted by the RDA were restricted for a period up to 99 years.
The level of assistance of these units is set to benefit low-income families earning 80 percent, or
less, of the area median income for the San Bernardino-Riverside-Ontario MSA.

       1. Heritage Park Apartments previously subsidized 48 units through the County Mortgage Revenue Bond program.
             This affordability covenant expired on January 1, 2005.
       2. The affordability covenant for Parkview Place and Mountain View Apartment terminated on 1/1/2007, Waterbrook
             Apartments on 1/1/2008, Sycamore Terrace on 1/1/2009, and Evergreen Apartments on 9/1/2010; however, the
             covenants will be enforced until the bonds securing them are sold.
       3. The RDA currently has affordability covenants in place on 86 single-family units through the RDA's First Time
             Homebuyer program and 48 single family units through the NHDC First-Time Homebuyer program. Combined with
             the total above results in 2,038 subsidized units.

Preserving or Replacing Units At-Risk
The following discussion examines the cost of preserving units at-risk and the cost of producing
new rental units comparable in size and rent levels as replacement for units which convert to
market rate. The discussion also includes a comparison of the costs of replacement and new
production.
Preservation Costs
The cost of preserving units includes purchase costs, any rehabilitation costs, and the costs of
on-going maintenance. The age, condition, and maintenance record of housing play a major role
in rehabilitation and maintenance costs. The subject units range in age from those that were
newly constructed to those that were 20 to 30 years old; all units are well maintained.
The accepted standard for major rehabilitation is 30 years or more. Based upon this standard,
and based upon the good condition of the projects, it is unlikely than any major rehabilitation
would be required in the next five years. Thus, rehabilitation costs for the projects are considered
negligible. Maintenance costs are likely to be low for all projects given their young age; therefore,
building income should cover maintenance costs.
Within the City there are a total of 1,906 subsidized multiple-family housing units. This includes
265 units at-risk of converting to market rate, and 1,641 units not at-risk of conversion.
Discussions with the County of San Bernardino CDH indicate that of those units at-risk of
conversion to market rate, the subsidy agreements maintaining the affordability on 186 of the 265
units at risk have expired, however the mortgage revenue bonds have not been paid off.
Although the subsidy agreements may have expired, the mortgage revenue bonds are still valid
and the County of San Bernardino CDH is maintaining the affordability of those units as long as
the bonds are valid. To maintain the affordability of those affected units, the property owner
would have to renew the mortgage revenue bonds, and pay the County administrative fee for
each bond.
Based upon a review of assessed values and comparable sales, the average per unit market
value of the existing units is estimated to be $77,000 per unit. During 1993-1994 the RDA
conserved 46 units at-risk with a loan of $3,750,000, or approximately $81,522 per conserved unit
and assisted the acquisition of 104 restricted, affordable units with a loan of $4,888,500, or
$47,000 per unit. Most recently, in 2005 the RDA assisted in the acquisition and conservation of
117 units with a loan of $9,000,000, or $76,923 per unit; however, total acquisition costs were
$17,556,034 or $150,051 per unit, supplemented by a private loan. Therefore, in actuality the
RDA has effectively provided roughly 50 percent of the funding for the conservation or acquisition
of restricted, affordable units at an estimated current average cost of $150,000 per unit. The
following table lists the estimated market value of units at-risk for each project with units at-risk
prior to 2015.

Replacement Costs
The cost of developing new housing depends upon a variety of factors including, but not limited
to, density, number of bedrooms, location, land costs, and type of construction. In general, land
costs in Southern California are quite high. Unit replacement cost provides a range of cost
estimates depending on unit size for multi-family rental housing. Based on the range shown, it

       would cost approximately $257,892 to construct one new multiple-family housing unit. As an
       example, in 2008 the RDA entered into a participation agreement for $27,600,000 for construction
       of the Rancho Workforce Housing multi-family housing complex at $166,265 per unit; however,
       total development costs for this project amount to $45,663,320, a cost of $275,080 per unit.
       For the identified 265 units at-risk, new construction would range between $68.4 million and $74.7
       million total cost to replace all the units at risk of conversion to market rate prior to 2015. The
       capital required varies from a State or Federal insured mortgage of 5 percent of project value to a
       conservative private lending requirement of 30 percent of project value. Therefore, in theory, a
       capital investment of between $4.03 million and $24.2 million would be required; at 100 percent
       funding up to $74.7 million would be required.

       Preservation vs. Replacement
       Preservation of units at-risk is more effective than new construction. The preservation of existing
       units is estimated to cost approximately $150,000 per unit as the construction of new residential
       units is estimated to be approximately $257,892 per unit. At these rates, 1.7 units could be
       preserved for the development of each new unit. Overall, the RDA has participated in the
       conservation of 670 affordable units, citywide.

       Other factors also make the preservation of units at-risk preferable to new development.
       Consistent with the General Plan, the existing units are scattered throughout market rate housing
       available in the community. Existing units have been accepted in the neighborhoods where they
       exist; City policy directs that affordable housing be dispersed throughout the City so affordable
       units are not concentrated in any one area. Because the 265 units at-risk are already integrated
       into the community, preservation is preferred over replacement.
       Available Resources
       Resources for preserving or replacing units at-risk include public and private agencies. Funding
       sources are the primary resource for conservation and are summarized below:
                Owner refinancing as allowed under terms of the County's bond program;
                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                     Housing Element 
HE‐30                                R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

        Owner refinancing under a City bond program;
        Sale to non-profit entities with the interest and ability to purchase and/or manage
         affordable housing units;
        Sale to public entities with the interest and ability to purchase and/or manage affordable
         housing units;
        RDA funding to purchase, or assist in purchase of existing units, or to develop
         replacement units; and
        RDA investment in projects that have affordable units in exchange for preservation of
         affordability restrictions.
County of San Bernardino Bond Program
On a case-by-case basis, the County of San Bernardino bond programs have structured their
regulatory agreement to permit refinancing with an extension of the term of affordability for the
conservation of affordable housing. Current low interest rates make refinancing a viable option;
where this option exists, it should be encouraged.
City Bond Program
When the City reached a population of 50,000 it exercised its option to directly receive State and
Federal grants, including CDBG funding. By becoming an "entitlement city," Rancho Cucamonga
became ineligible to participate in the County's multiple-family bond program for the development
of affordable housing. However, the City gained the right to institute a local bond-financing
program. Bond programs can be instituted on a project-by-project basis. This option is typically
used as a leveraging strategy in conjunction with private financing. It is contingent upon the
availability of State and Federal funds.
Private Non-Profit Agencies
Two non-profit agencies are working with the RDA to construct, purchase, and/or manage low
income housing units. Other nonprofit agencies are expected to express interest and work with
the City on affordable housing development.
National Community Renaissance (National CORE) (previously Southern California Housing
Development Corporation): This organization was incorporated in 1992 for the purpose of
acquiring, constructing, maintaining, and managing housing units for low-income households.
Their office is located at 9065 Haven Avenue, Suite 100, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730.
National CORE, with assistance from the RDA, acquired 6 apartment complexes with a total of
1,302 total units and 710 held as affordable. The complexes include: Sycamore Springs
Apartments (96 of 240 units), Mountainside Apartments (192 of 384 units), Monterey Village
Apartments (112 of 224 units), and Rancho Verde Village Apartments (144 of 288 units), Heritage
Pointe Senior Apartments (49 of 49 units), and Woodhaven Apartments (117 of 117 units). The
RDA has committed $1.8 million a year for 30 years to National CORE for the acquisition of
affordable housing. National CORE, with funding commitments from the RDA, is also working in
partnership with the NHDC.
Northtown Housing Development Corporation (NHDC): The RDA assisted members of the
Northtown neighborhood with the formation of a 501(c)(3) non-profit in 1993. The purpose of the
organization is to establish, maintain, and operate housing units for low-income households in the
Northtown Neighborhood of Rancho Cucamonga. Their office is located at 8599 Haven Avenue,
Suite 205, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730.
In 1994 the NHDC developed Villa del Norte, an 88-unit family apartment complex located at
9901 Feron Boulevard. In 2004 the NHDC developed the Olen Jones Senior Apartment
Community, a 96-unit low income senior apartment complex located at 7125 Amethyst Avenue.
In December 2007 the NHDC received entitlements for the San Sevaine Villas, a 225-unit
(100 percent affordable) multi-family housing complex located at the southwest corner of Foothill
Boulevard and East Avenue; these units are currently under construction.
Workforce Homebuilders: This organization incorporated in 2005, with the purpose of
establishing, maintaining, and operating housing units for lower-income households. Their office
is located at 8300 Utica Avenue, Suite 173, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730.

       In February 2008 Workforce Homebuilders, in a joint venture with National CORE, obtained
       entitlements for the Rancho Workforce Housing multi-family housing complex, a 166-unit
       (80 percent affordable), located at the northwest corner of Foothill Boulevard and Center Avenue;
       these units are currently under construction.
       LINC Housing: Since 1984, LINC Housing has had a hand in building more than 6,000 affordable
       homes throughout California. LINC provides housing for people underserved by the marketplace.
       Their office is located at 110 Pine Avenue, Suite 500, Long Beach, CA 90802. LINC worked with
       the City to acquire and rehabilitate the 228-unit Pepperwood Apartments located at 9055 Foothill
       Boulevard.
       Public Agencies
       Due both to the high cost of purchasing and developing housing and the limitations on use of
       funds, financing for preserving, replacing, and/or maintaining units at-risk will likely have to
       include multiple sources. The following funding sources have been identified for use in
       purchasing the units at-risk in Rancho Cucamonga. It should be noted that new funding sources
       will become available over time and that the following discussion does not represent an
       exhaustive inventory of funding sources.
       Rancho Cucamonga Redevelopment Agency (RDA): State law (Health and Safety Code
       §33334.2(a)) requires redevelopment agencies to set aside at least 20 percent of tax increment
       revenues for increasing and improving the community's supply of low and moderate income
       housing, unless certain findings are made to exempt a project from the requirement. The RDA is
       committed to participating in preservation and/or replacement of units at-risk.
       County of San Bernardino Department of Community Development and Housing (CDH): Because
       the City elected to become an "entitlement city," County sponsored bond funding is not available
       to development projects within the City.
       Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino (HACSB): The HACSB serves as the local
       Housing Authority and currently operates over 5,000 Section 8 housing units and has developed,
       or is in the process of developing, approximately 151 affordable units. HACSB currently owns 16
       single-family homes within the City and rents them to qualified households at affordable rents.
       State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD): HCD's Multifamily Housing
       Program (MHP) provides loans for the rehabilitation and new construction of affordable multi-
       family rental housing, and the preservation of existing subsidized housing that may otherwise
       convert to market rate.
       U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): Subject to annual appropriations,
       HUD provides financial incentives necessary for acquisition of Federally subsidized, at-risk
       projects by non-profit organizations, tenants, and local governments.
       HUD incentives include the following:
           Project-based Section 8 contracts, for example, providing subsidy for rents set at levels high
            enough to provide an 8 percent return to owners who retain the project.
           Grants to non-profit buyers that would fill any gap between fair market rent or local market
            rent (whichever is higher) and allowable rents.
           Mortgage insurance both for equity take-out loans and acquisition loans. Insured equity take-
            out loans are limited to 70 percent of equity, while acquisition loans are available at
            95 percent of equity.
       Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): Through the CDBG program, HUD provides
       grants and loans to local governments for funding a wide range of community development
       activities. CDBG resources are limited. Available funds are committed to neighborhood
       preservation and rehabilitation of existing single-family housing stock for low-income
       homeowners. The City's CDBG allocation for fiscal year 2009-2010 is $1,020,958. The City
       committed approximately 42.2 percent ($430,588) to existing owner-occupied rehabilitation
       programs. The remaining funds were programmed for capital improvements that benefit lower
       income persons, public services benefiting low- and moderate-income persons, and
       administrative costs. CDBG funds are not available, or directly applicable, at this time for the

conservation of units at-risk. 
Redevelopment Agency Funding
The Redevelopment Agency 20 percent set-aside fund is the primary funding resource for
conservation or replacement of units at risk of conversion to market rate. The 313 identified units
at-risk represent approximately 30 percent of the RDA's mandated affordable housing production
requirement. The RDA's affordable housing set-aside fund will total approximately $99.8 million
for the period July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2013. Most of these funds are committed to
acquisition and construction of new affordable units. On a case-by-case basis RDA funds will
continue to be used for conservation of units at-risk.
Quantified Objectives
The goal of the City is to conserve all restricted, affordable units at-risk of conversion to market
rate. Consistent with the City's goal, the objective of this study is the conservation of 265 total
units at-risk of converting to market rate. This includes 186 units between July 1, 2005, and June
30, 2010, and 79 units between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2015. Consistent with the Housing
Production Plan, the RDA assumes the primary responsibility for conservation of units at-risk.
Regional Housing Needs
Previous sections of this Housing Element discuss existing housing needs of residents, including
special housing needs. This section analyzes the need for housing production to accommodate
the projected growth of both population and housing within Rancho Cucamonga.
Regional Housing Needs Assessment
Every five years, California law requires cities to plan to accommodate population and
employment growth in their community through the implementation of responsive housing policies
and programs. To assist in that effort HCD provides each regional Council of Governments
(COGs) its share of the statewide housing need. In turn, all COGs, including the Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG), are required to determine the portion allocated to
each jurisdiction in their region; this allocation process is referred to as the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA). All local governments, including Rancho Cucamonga, are required
to set aside sufficient land, adopt programs, and provide funding (to the extent feasible), to
facilitate and encourage housing production commensurate with that housing need.
The RHNA established a total housing construction need for the City, which is comprised of three
factors, including the number of housing units needed to accommodate future population and
employment growth, an allowance for the replacement of any housing units demolished and
normal vacancy rates, and establishing a fair share allocation by different affordability levels.
Population and Employment Growth
In 2004, SCAG adopted their Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), which included a regional
growth forecast, which is utilized to plan for transportation improvements throughout the planning
area based on projected growth patterns. Rancho Cucamonga's housing need is based on
SCAG's regional growth forecast adopted in the RTP. The household growth component is
determined by calculating the expected population growth that will occur in Rancho Cucamonga
from 2006 to 2014 and factoring in the expected employment growth that will occur within the
region.
The majority of the population growth will occur as a result of housing development projects
occurring in the Etiwanda and Etiwanda North areas, as well as infill within existing residential
neighborhoods. Job growth is an important factor because it can place an additional demand for
new housing. SCAG projects that Rancho Cucamonga's job base will increase by approximately
34,000 jobs over the next 20 years.
Vacancy and Demolition
The RHNA goal for new construction within Rancho Cucamonga incorporates additional units to
accommodate two factors in the housing market: housing vacancy and housing demolition. This

       "fair share" allocation concept seeks to ensure that each jurisdiction accepts responsibility for
       housing needs, not only for its resident population, but also for the jurisdiction's projected share of
       regional housing growth across all income categories. Regional growth needs are defined as the
       number of units that would have to be added in each jurisdiction to accommodate the forecasted
       number of households, as well as the number of units that would have to be added to
       compensate for any anticipated housing demolition or changes in the vacancy rate to achieve an
       "ideal" vacancy rate for the City.
       The vacancy factor is important as the housing market needs to have a certain number of vacant
       units to allow for sufficient choices. This helps maintain rents and prices at adequate rates, as
       too low of a vacancy rate encourages spikes in prices, and also encourages property owners to
       maintain and repair their property, helping provide stability to housing prices.
       The RHNA goal also adjusts the construction need goal based on a need to replace units lost
       from residential use. This can include housing units lost through demolition, changes to other
       nonresidential land uses, loss through fire, or other natural causes. SCAG adjusts the City's
       housing production goals by a standard replacement factor which is based on the historical rate of
       units lost to demolition in each community.
       RHNA Fair Share
       The RHNA allocates to cities and counties within the SCAG region their "fair share" of the regions'
       projected housing need by household income group for the planning period. Rancho
       Cucamonga's construction need represents the total construction need to accommodate the
       expected increases in population and employment growth. For this Housing Element update,
       Rancho Cucamonga is allocated a RHNA of 1,282 housing units. The City must ensure the
       availability of residential sites at adequate densities and appropriate development standards to
       accommodate the housing units shown in the following table.

            50 percent of the very low income allocation. As shown in Table 13, extremely low income households constitute
            49.4 percent of the very low income group. Therefore, the City's RHNA of 317 very low income units can be split
            between 156 (49.4%) extremely low and 161 very low income units.

       Housing Constraints
       The issue of housing constraints refers to land use regulations, housing policies and programs,
       zoning designations, and other factors that may influence the price and availability of housing
       opportunities in Rancho Cucamonga. These housing constraints may increase the cost of
       housing, or may render residential construction economically infeasible for developers.
       Additionally, constraints to housing production significantly impact lower income households and
       those with special needs.

Governmental Constraints
California Government Code §65583(a)(5) requires "[a]n analysis of potential and actual
governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all
incomes levels, … including land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site
improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing and permit
procedures."
Land Use Policies
The General Plan Land Use element establishes the allowable land uses in Rancho Cucamonga;
these land use categories are then implemented through development standards contained in the
Development Code. Land use categories are provided to guide the development, intensity, or
density of allowable development, and the permitted uses of land. The General Plan sets forth
six primary residential land use categories and one mixed use residential-commercial land use
category.
The Development Code implements the General Plan by establishing specific criteria for land
development within each land use designation. These development criteria include, among
others, building set back, height, parking, and land uses for each land use designation.

       criteria, specific plan designations, development standards, and annexation potential. The City's
       land use controls establish conditions necessary to achieve the health, safety and general welfare
       of its residents, and provide for maintenance and development for housing available to all income
       levels.
       Residential Land Use Categories
       The General Plan Land Use element designates particular areas within the City for residential
       development. In identifying areas suitable for residential development the General Plan
       establishes six residential density categories and one mixed use residential-commercial land use
       category that are "intended to maximize public safety, achieve high quality site planning and
       design, retain significant natural resources, and ensure compatibility between uses." These
       residential densities permit both single-family and multiple-family housing development.

       Conventional Housing
       The City of Rancho Cucamonga allows conventional single- and multiple-family housing in a wide
       variety of residential zones. Single-family housing is permitted in four residential zones and
       provides a density range of 0.1 to 14 dwelling units per gross acre; the density range for single-
       family attached and multiple-family dwellings is 4 to 30 dwelling units per acre.
       The General Plan also allows residential development in two of its open space categories: Hillside
       Residential and Open Space. After environmental impacts are determined and mitigated, the
       Hillside Residential designation permits up to 2 dwelling units per acre. The Open Space
       designation identifies areas where land is to remain essentially open, but up to 1 dwelling unit per
       10 acres is permitted. The remaining open space category is designated as Flood Control/Utility
       corridor, and no residential development is permitted under this designation.
       Requirements for residential development are contained in the Development Code, two
       Community Plans (Terra Vista and Victoria), and two Specific Plans (Etiwanda and Etiwanda
       North). A third Community Plan (Caryn) was incorporated into the Development Code along with
       a commercial and industrial specific plan. Residential zoning categories and densities throughout
       are consistent with the City's General Plan. The basic development standards contained in these
       plans are generally consistent; however, they have been tailored to meet the specific needs
       identified within each of the community planning areas.
       Mixed-Use Housing
       Mixed use residential development is permitted within the Mixed Use District. A mixed use
       development means an area of development that contains both residential and commercial (i.e.,
       retail and office) land uses and is typically located along major boulevards (e.g., Foothill
       Boulevard and Haven Avenue). Mixed use developments are often utilized as a buffer between
       more intense and less intense land uses. A mixed use development can include multi-story
       buildings where the first floor is dedicated to commercial land uses and the upper stories contain
       residential uses; however, mixed use development can also include parcels where commercial
       developments are located along the major street and residential uses are located behind or
       adjacent to the commercial use.

Second Dwelling Units
Second dwelling units can provide an important source of affordable housing for persons and
families of low and moderate income. In 2003 Rancho Cucamonga adopted code requirements
relative to second dwelling units identifying that these units are permitted subject to certain design
and development standards. To assist in informing the public of these standards, the City
prepared a public information handout identifying the purpose, permitted zone, and applicable
development standards relative to the placement these units.
Rancho Cucamonga permits second units on lots zoned for single-family uses and all second
units must meet the general standards of the zoning district for the lot, including density, setback,
design, architectural style (i.e., materials, colors, roofing, scale, surface treatment, and
architectural details) of the primary residence, and must meet current building codes. A second
unit is approved ministerially as a by-right use provided the following criteria are met: the lot
contains an existing single-family residence, the unit may be constructed as an accessory building
or attached to the primary residence, and is not for sale but for rental purposes only or by use of
an immediate family member. A second unit may be established on lots that are a minimum of
10,000 square feet; the unit shall not exceed 640 square feet if the lot is less than 20,000 square
feet and 950 square feet if the lot is greater than 20,000 square feet. Additionally, the second unit
is limited to one story, shall have its own entrance separate from the primary residence, and shall
provide one enclosed parking space per bedroom, but not to exceed two enclosed spaces per
unit.
Since the adoption of these second unit provisions, the City has had several inquiries regarding
second units, but only 1 second unit has been built during the past three years.
Mobile Home Parks and Manufactured Housing
The City permits mobile home units in all residential districts, except the Very Low Residential
District, subject to the same property development standards and permitting process as a single-
family detached home. The Rancho Cucamonga Development Code broadly defines mobile
homes to include "a moveable or transportable vehicle, other than a motor vehicle, having no
permanent foundation other than jacks, piers, wheels, or skirting, designed as a permanent
structure intended for occupancy and designed for subsequent or repeated relocation." The
placement of a mobile home unit includes the following criteria: the unit must be placed on a
permanent foundation, the unit must be certified under the National Mobile Home Construction
and Safety Act of 1974, and the placement is subject to Design Review Committee review to
determine 1) the design of the unit is similar in character and appearance to other buildings in the
area and 2) all development standards (i.e., setback, height, lot coverage) of the base district
apply.
Mobile home parks are permitted in all residential districts subject to the approval of a Conditional
Use Permit, and the placement of those units must meet all development standards of the base
district. These standards will allow for the efficient use of the lot to accommodate the maximum
number of mobile home units while providing sufficient room for amenities such as open space
and utilities.
California Government Code §65852.3 generally states that a city shall allow the installation of
manufactured homes certified under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety
Standards Act of 1974 on all lots zoned for single-family residential dwellings. Essentially, a city
may not require an administrative permit, planning or development process, or other discretionary
requirement that is not imposed on a conventional single-family dwelling. Because the Rancho
Cucamonga Development Code does not define a manufactured home, but does define a mobile
home, manufactured housing could inadvertently be placed into the wrong category inconsistent
with State law. This creates the potential for confusion as to whether certain uses can or cannot
be permitted, whether design regulations can be required, and creates a constraint to the
provision of such housing. The Housing Plan specifies a program to define and distinguish
manufactured housing from mobile homes, set forth appropriate architectural guidelines, and
define the process for approving or disapproving the installation of manufactured housing.

       Residential Care Facilities
       California law states that disabled persons, children, and adults who require supervised care are
       entitled to live in normal residential settings and preempts cities from imposing many regulations
       on community care facilities. California Health and Safety Code §1500, Et seq., establishes that
       group homes serving six or fewer persons be: 1) treated the same as any other residential use, 2)
       allowed by right in all residential zones, and 3) be subject to the same development standards,
       fees, taxes, and permit procedures as those imposed on the same type of housing in the same
       zone.
       Rancho Cucamonga allows State-licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons
       by right in all residential zones. In compliance with State law, these facilities are treated like any
       other residential use in the same single-family or multiple-family residential zones. The City also
       permits residential care facilities serving seven or more residents in the Low Medium, Medium,
       Medium High, and High residential districts subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
       The Development Code provides a clear definition of residential care facility, but does not
       distinguish between a board and care home, sober living facility, or housing for homeless people,
       nor does it provide guidance regarding how to permit or regulate these facilities in a manner
       compatible with residential neighborhoods. As a result, some facilities could be unduly denied
       permission to locate in Rancho Cucamonga while others could be allowed by right, even in cases
       where the City actually has the authority to impose reasonable regulations.
       To eliminate confusion in the implementation of the Development Code, comply with the intent of
       fair housing laws, and ensure clarity in the permitting process, the Housing Element contains a
       new program to define residential care facilities consistent with State law and specify or affirm the
       permitting processes required for these uses under State law. This will ensure that licensed
       facilities are appropriately permitted in a manner consistent with the Government Code and fair
       housing law.
       The Housing Element could also specify an additional program for facilities not licensed or
       regulated by the State of California or those in which the City can exercise greater discretionary
       authority. These include board and care/rooming facilities, parolee homes, transitional housing,
       and other such uses. This type of program will clearly specify the zoning and permitting
       requirements for such uses and ensure that the City can exercise appropriate regulatory oversight
       within the parameters of fair housing law.
       Emergency Shelters
       Emergency shelters are the first step in a continuum of care and provide shelter to families and/or
       individuals on a limited short-term basis. The Development Code defines emergency shelters as
       "short-term accommodations on a first-come, first serve basis, with no guaranteed bed for a
       subsequent night."
       Senate Bill 2 (SB 2), codified at Government Code §65583, was enacted by the State Legislature
       in 2007 to address the States growing problem of homelessness. SB 2 requires local
       governments to identify one or more zoning categories that allow emergency shelters without a
       Conditional Use Permit or other discretionary permit. Cities may apply limited conditions to the
       approval of ministerial permits for emergency shelters, however, the identified zone must have
       sufficient capacity to accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity for at
       least one year-round shelter. Permit processing, development, and management standards for
       emergency shelters must be objective and facilitate the development of, or conversion to, such
       use. As previously discussed in the Housing Needs Assessment, Rancho Cucamonga has an
       estimated 122 homeless people, based on a homeless count conducted by the San Bernardino
       County Homeless Census and Survey. This count includes 48 individuals, 14 people in families,
       and 60 people in cars/RV's/vans; the sheltered count included only the 14 people in families.
       Rancho Cucamonga currently permits emergency shelters in various commercial (General
       Commercial District citywide) and industrial districts (General Industrial District, Subareas 1, 3, 4,
       and 5), subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit, but not within any residential districts;
       however, even with these provisions there are no emergency shelters located within the City. The
       City will amend the Development Code within one year of adoption of the Housing Element to
       specifically identify emergency shelters as a permitted use in the General Commercial (GC)
                                                                                                              
                                                                                          Housing Element

District, as well as establish procedures and development standards (i.e., maximum number of
beds, provisions for onsite management, length of stay, off-street parking based on demonstrated
need, proximity of other shelters, and security) to facilitate the creation of emergency shelters.
Properties in the GC District are generally located throughout the City and include locations at the
intersections of Base Line Road and Amethyst Avenue, Haven Avenue and Foothill Boulevard,
Arrow Route between Hermosa Avenue and Archibald Avenue, Grove Avenue between Arrow
Route and 9th Street, and Beech Avenue at the I-15 Freeway. The GC District does not permit
residential land uses, but does permit, either by right or subject to a Conditional Use Permit, a
wide variety of commercial, professional services (medical and dental), hospitals, and
transportation facilities. These uses are compatible with emergency shelter land uses and
provide necessary supportive services for the homeless population, particularly those with special
medical and health care needs.
The GC District is characterized by a mix of small (less than 1 acre), medium (1 to 5 acres), and
large (over 5 acres) sized parcels. The GC District contains 470 acres, 330 of which are
developed with a variety of commercial developments, and some properties are underutilized and
suitable for renovation/conversion to an emergency shelter. The GC District includes 140 acres
of vacant land on 96 parcels, with an average parcel size of 63,565 square feet (this includes 77
parcels under 1 acre, 12 parcels between 1 to 5 acres, and 7 parcels in excess of 5 acres). This
broad variety of parcel sizes and land use intensities provides excellent flexibility and therefore
numerous options to parties interested in operating emergency shelters. The City has an
identified unsheltered homeless population of 108 persons (122 total homeless minus 14
sheltered equals 108 unsheltered). The GC District has adequate capacity to accommodate this
homeless population either in one large shelter or several small shelters.
Transitional Housing
Transitional housing facilities are designed to accommodate homeless individuals and families for
a longer stay than in emergency shelters, as the residents stabilize their lives. California Health
and Safety Code §50675.2 defines "transitional housing" and "transitional housing development"
as buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program
requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to
another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no
less than six months. Residents of transitional housing are usually connected to supportive
services designed to assist the homeless in achieving greater economic independence and a
permanent and stable living situation. Transitional housing may take several forms, including
group quarters, single-family homes, and multi-family housing, and typically offers case
management and supportive services to help return people to independent living.
Currently, the Development Code defines transitional housing as uses that allow for an extended
stay (longer than an immediate need for housing) and provides support services for the occupants
(i.e., medical aid, employment, and housing counseling), but does not permit the establishment of
transitional housing uses within the City. The City will amend the Development Code to permit
transitional housing facilities serving six or fewer clients by right in all residential districts. The
Development Code will also be amended to differentiate transitional housing provided as group
quarters versus transitional housing provided as multi-family housing developments. Where
transitional housing facilities operate as group quarters assisting up to six residents, such uses
will be permitted as residential care facilities, and where transitional housing facilities operate as
multi-family housing developments, such uses will be permitted where multi-family housing is
permitted.
Supportive Housing
Supportive housing is affordable housing with onsite or offsite services that help a person or
family with multiple barriers to employment and housing stability. Supportive housing is a link
between housing providers and social services for the homeless, people with disabilities, and a
variety of other special needs populations. California Health and Safety Code §50675.14 defines
"supportive housing" as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target
population (i.e., persons with low incomes having one or more disabilities, including mental
illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible

       for services provided under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act), and that is
       linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the
       housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when
       possible, work in the community.
       Currently, the City's Development Code does not address supportive housing. Similar to
       transitional housing, supportive housing can take several forms, including group quarters, single-
       family homes, and multi-family housing complexes. The Development Code will be amended to
       permit supportive housing facilities serving six or fewer residents by right in all residential districts.
       The City will also amend the Development Code to differentiate supportive housing in the form of
       group quarters versus multi-family housing developments. Where supportive housing facilities
       operate as group quarters assisting up to six residents, such uses will be permitted as residential
       care facilities, and where supportive housing facilities operate as multi-family housing
       developments, such uses will be permitted where multi-family housing is permitted.
       Single-Room Occupancy
       Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) units provide affordable housing opportunities for certain
       segments of the community such as, seniors, students, and single workers and are intended for
       occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct from a studio apartment or efficiency unit, in
       that a studio apartment is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen and bathroom. To address
       this potential housing need the City will amend the Development Code to facilitate the provision of
       SRO units consistent with SB 2. SRO units will be conditionally permitted in the Medium (M)
       Residential District, Medium-High (MH) Residential District, High (H) Residential District, and
       Mixed-Use (MU) Districts as a use in conjunction with other multi-family housing or mixed use
       developments. Conditions of approval for SRO units will relate to the performance characteristics
       of a proposed facility, such as parking, security, management, availability of public transportation,
       and access to commercial land uses.
       Development Standards
       Performance Standard Criteria
       The Development Code, as well as any applicable specific plans, utilizes a performance standard
       of development through a use of density ranges. The density achieved is based on an analysis of
       environmental constraints and design criteria (i.e., setback, lot coverage, parking, and
       landscaping).
       Environmental Assessment
       An environmental assessment is required for each development project. The site-specific
       assessment is tiered from the Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) that was prepared for
       the 2000 update of the General Plan. (A new environmental assessment is being prepared for
       the 2010 update of the General Plan. Any new information that becomes available prior to
       certification of the new environmental assessment will be considered in the drafting of this
       Housing Element). For instance, the City's Hillside Development Regulations were enacted to
       address grading and design issues on parcels with slope issues. In most instances, these
       instruments clearly set the environmental constraints on the site, including the potential maximum
       density, and serve to expedite development. Where additional site-specific information is needed,
       special studies are requested.
       Design Criteria
       Design criteria are established under the Basic and Optional Development Standards. A
       subdivision designed to meet the City's Basic Development Standards will be permitted to
       develop at densities that are at the lower end of the density range appropriate to the zone, but
       within the limits of the Basic Development Standards. In order to qualify for the Optional
       Development Standards, a developer may provide such features as a larger percentage of open
       space, more than the minimum requirement for landscaping, and more than the minimum
       requirement for recreational facilities. Such projects will be allowed to develop at the higher end
       of the density range appropriate to the zone. Further, under the Optional Standards, many of the
       basic development requirements such as setbacks and lot coverage may be reduced to
       accommodate projects at higher densities.
                                                                                                                  
                                                                                            Housing Element

Specific Plan Designations
Standards for the Terra Vista and Victoria planned communities are more innovative than those
contained in the Development Code. For example, cluster development is automatically assumed
in the higher density categories, but in the planned communities it is also allowed in the Low-
Medium and Medium residential categories. Both plans were designed to allow flexibility in
trading densities among different areas within each plan without requiring a General Plan
Amendment, as long as the maximum density permitted by the plan is not exceeded. Both plans
permit each residential land use designation to be stepped up or down one category, except for
the Medium residential category that allows two steps up, to either the Medium-High or High
density range.
The Etiwanda Specific Plan (ESP) and Etiwanda North Specific Plan (ENSP) are designed to
reflect the unique community character within each of these planning areas. The ENSP primarily
serves as a pre-zone for the City's Sphere-of-Influence.
Rural character is a dominant feature of the historic Etiwanda community. Although low-density
housing is encouraged, zoning includes areas for all income levels. The rugged, natural open
character of the Etiwanda North area provides constraints to development. Safety hazards and
the high cost of extending infrastructure to the area make it most suitable for lower density single-
family housing. No multi-family housing is proposed for the Etiwanda North area.
Residential Development Standards
There have been no significant changes in residential standards since the 1983 adoption of the
Rancho Cucamonga Development Code; minor changes have brought the Development Code
into compliance with changes in State legislation. Prior to completion of the 1989 update of the
Housing Element, Hillside Development Regulations were adopted to codify long-standing hillside
development polices. The Basic Development Standards (Development Code Table 17.08.040-
B) and Optional Development Standards (Development Code Table 17.08.040-C) are provided in
the following tables.

Overall, development standards are based upon acceptable provisions and are not exceptional or
unusual and, in fact, are consistent with those of surrounding communities. The provisions
allowed under the Terra Vista and Victoria Community Plans are somewhat less demanding than
those contained in the Development Code and the ESP, but this reflects the unique community
character within each of these planning areas.
Building standards, such as parking and height requirements, generally do not provide a
constraint to development. Typically, building heights are permitted to increase as density
increases. Parking is based upon the unit type and number of bedrooms. Carports are permitted

       these development standards permits a wide variety of housing types, including single-family and
       multi-family, rental and ownership, and mobile homes. Application of these development
       standards to the remaining vacant land resources will continue to provide a broad range of
       housing alternatives consistent with the City's share of the Regional Housing Need.
       Terra Vista Community Plan Development Standards
       The Terra Vista Community Plan (TVCP) was originally approved by the City Council on
       February 16, 1983. Since its approval, the majority of the TVCP has been constructed with only a
       few sites remaining before build-out. Development standards are more flexible than typical
       Development Code standards in order to allow for a creative and cohesive design throughout the
       planned community for each land use density. No maximum lot coverage is required for
       development provided that setback and open space requirements are met. Based on the
       development criteria outlined below, the TVCP does not preclude the feasibility of achieving
       maximum densities, and when coupled with a Density Bonus Housing Agreement would exceed
       allowable TVCP densities for the development of affordable housing units.

       Victoria Community Plan Development Standards
       The Victoria Community Plan (VCP) was originally approved by the City Council on May 20, 1981.
       Since its approval, the majority of the VCP has been constructed with only a few sites remaining
       before build-out. Currently, only one site remains in the VCP that is zoned High Residential (24-
       30 units). The VCP provides for typical lot development, as well as innovative and cluster
       housing standards, which allows for more creativity and flexibility in achieving maximum density
       yields. The following is a summary and discussion of the specific design criteria and performance
       standards that affect density yields and affordable housing production, and based on these
       criteria, the VCP does not preclude the feasibility of achieving maximum densities.

Lot Standards
Minimum lot size requirements range from 30,000 to 40,000 square feet in large estate residential
areas, to 5,000 to 7,200 square feet for most single-family residential areas. The minimum lot
size required in higher density multi-family developments is 3 acres, however, existing legal
parcels less than 3 acres may only be developed at the minimum of the density range.
Residential Densities
Residential densities range from 0.1 to 2 units per acre for the Very Low Residential District, up to
24 to 30 units per acre for the High Residential District. The Terra Vista Community Plan permits
residential densities in the High Residential District up to 30 units to the acre.
Lot Coverage
Lot coverage (i.e., the area of a lot covered by the building footprint, plus roof overhang) is
permitted up to 25 percent in the Very Low Residential District (20 percent in the ESP). The Low
Residential District allows for a maximum of 40 percent lot coverage while the Medium to High
Residential Districts allow up 50 percent lot coverage, with no maximum lot coverage requirement
in the Victoria Community Plan or Terra Vista Community Plan.
Height Limits
The Very Low to Medium Residential Districts permit a building height up to 35 feet, while the
Medium High and High Residential Districts permit a building height up to 45 feet and 55 feet,
respectively. A limit of 65 feet applies to the High Residential District of the Terra Vista
Community Plan. Height restrictions are not considered a significant constraint to housing
development in Rancho Cucamonga.
Parking Standards
Parking standards are currently similar to those utilized in other cities and is based on a standard
requirement of 2 spaces within a garage for single-family detached units, and a sliding scale,
depending on the number of bedrooms per unit, for cluster development (condominium,
townhome, apartment, etc). Multi-family conventional parking standards are based on the
following:

       Source: Rancho Cucamonga Development Code.
       Under these standards, for studio, one and two bedroom units, one space is required to be in a
       garage or carport and in three and four bedroom units, two spaces are required to be in a garage
       or carport. Guest parking spaces are required at a ratio of one parking space for each four multi-
       family units.
       To mitigate the impact that parking requirements may have upon affordable housing projects, the
       City adopted Affordable Housing Incentive/Density Bonus Provisions (discussed below). Under
       these standards parking requirements do not hinder the availability and affordability of housing as
       the City permits a reduction of these on-site parking requirements, among other standards, in the
       development of affordable housing projects. The implementation of the Affordable Housing
       Incentives/Density Bonus Provisions permits the following reduction in parking requirements to
       accommodate development of affordable housing projects.

       Performance Standards and Design Criteria Analysis
       The following analysis demonstrates that the imposition of the City's Performance Standards is
       not an impediment to the development of residential units at the upper range of maximum
       allowable densities as part of the City's Optional Development Standards.
       Open Space
       Building setbacks and open space requirements are established to ensure that sufficient privacy
       and open space are provided to enhance and maintain the quality of life within residential
       neighborhoods. These requirements are necessary to mitigate traffic noise, provide privacy from
       neighbors, and other noise generating uses that may affect an individual's quality of life.
       The established open space requirements for multi-family housing include both common and
       private open space. Overall, the setbacks and open space requirements are considered typical
       for residential uses in western San Bernardino County.
       Recreation Area/Facility
       Recreational amenities in conjunction with common open space are required for development
       under the Medium to High residential densities. These amenities are required to provide for
       active recreation opportunities for development residents. The required amenities are as follows:
       1) Development consisting of 30 units or less shall provide three of the following recreational
            amenities:
            a. Large open lawn area, one of the dimensions shall be a minimum of 50 feet.
            b. Enclosed tot lot with multiple play equipment.
            c. Spa or pool.
            d. Barbecue facility equipped with grill, picnic benches, etc.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                              Housing Element

2) Development consisting of 31 units to 100 units shall provide another set of recreational
    amenities, or equivalent, as approved by the Planning Commission.
3) Development consisting of 101 units to 200 units shall provide five of the following
    recreational amenities, or equivalent, as approved by the Planning Commission:
    a. Large open lawn, one of the dimensions shall be a minimum of 100 feet.
    b. Multiple enclosed tot lots with multiple play equipment. The tot lots shall be conveniently
         located throughout the site. The number of tot lots and their location shall be subject to
         Planning Commission review and approval.
    c. Pool and spa.
    d. Community multi-purpose room equipped with kitchen, defined areas for games,
         exercises, etc.
    e. Barbecue facilities equipped with multiple grills, picnic benches, etc. The barbecue
         facilities shall be conveniently located throughout the site. The number of barbecue
         facilities and their locations shall be subject to Planning Commission review and
         approval.
    f. Court facilities (e.g., tennis, volleyball, basketball, etc.).
    g. Jogging/walking trails with exercise stations.
4) For each 100 units above the first 200 units, another set of recreational amenities, as
    described above, shall be provided.
5) Other recreational amenities not listed above may be considered subject to Planning
    Commission review and approval.
6) Related recreational activities may be grouped together and located at any one area of the
    common open space areas.
7) Dispersal of recreational facilities throughout the site shall be required for developments with
    multiple recreational facilities.
8) All recreation areas or facilities required by this section shall be maintained by private
    homeowners' associations, property owners, or private assessment districts.
For qualifying affordable housing projects, Rancho Cucamonga's Affordable Housing
Incentives/Density Bonus Provisions provide that the Planning Commission may approve
development incentives (i.e., a reduction in certain development standards such as reduced
building setbacks, reduced public/private open space, increased maximum lot coverage,
increased building height, etc), but only when provided as part of a Density Bonus Housing
Agreement. In general, the discretion given to the Planning Commission in approving "other"
recreational amenities demonstrates how zoning encourages flexibility and creativity in meeting
the City's development criteria. The City has found that the requirement for recreation
area/facilities does not preclude the ability to achieve maximum densities, particularly in relation
to the development of affordable housing, when combined with a Density Bonus Housing
Agreement.
Landscaping
Landscaping is required for both single-family and multi-family projects and is provided for
aesthetic as well as functional reasons. For multi-family projects, particularly in the Medium to
High Residential Districts, landscaping is provided as a percentage of the project site and
provides many essential functions for the community including: beauty, shading, wind protection,
screening, noise buffering, and air filtering. Within the Low Medium to High Residential Districts,
the City's landscape standards require a number of trees per gross acre; however these trees are
dispersed throughout the project in areas that include setback areas, in building to building
separation areas, around the project perimeter, throughout the parking lot, and around both
passive and active recreation areas. This requirement has no impact on achieving maximum
density as there are sufficient areas within a project to provide project landscaping. In addition,
the City's Affordable Housing Incentives/Density Bonus Provisions include incentives that could
allow a reduction in "other site or construction conditions applicable to a residential development",
which could include a reduction in project landscaping.

       Energy Conservation
       Energy conservation standards establish requirements for energy conservation features as part of
       multi-family development when utilizing the City's Optional Development Standards. The energy
       conservation standards require that new residential developments be provided with an alternative
       energy system to provide domestic hot water for all dwelling units and for heating any swimming
       pool or spas, and that solar energy shall be the primary energy system unless other alternative
       energy systems are demonstrated to be of equivalent capacity and efficiency. Additional
       requirements provide that all appliances and fixtures shall be energy conserving. Energy
       conservation standards are approved through Planning Commission review and do not impact the
       ability to achieve maximum density. Energy conservation standards may have short term costs
       associated with the installation of the alternative energy system; however, operation costs and per
       unit costs will be lower due to the energy savings associated with the operation of the equipment.
        Energy conservation standards requiring energy efficient appliances do not impact project
       density and will not impact project development costs. Operation costs to the tenants will be
       significantly lower with the use of energy efficient appliances.
       Amenities
       Amenities are provided to enhance the quality of life for multi-family developments and require
       that 1) each unit shall be provided with a minimum of 125 cubic feet of exterior lockable storage
       space and 2) that each unit shall be provided with a hook-up for a washing machine and cloths
       dryer. The purpose of the amenities requirement is essentially to improve the livability by
       improving the functionality of each residential unit. These amenities are approved through
       Planning Commission review, do not impact the ability to achieve maximum density, and have a
       negligible impact on housing development and costs.
       Annexation Potential
       The City's Sphere-of-Influence is located north of the City between the City limits and the National
       Forest Boundary in environmentally hazardous and sensitive areas. The resulting constraints
       limit the range of potential residential development. Annexations have added "Low" and "Very
       Low" single-family residential development areas to the City.
       The ENSP was adopted on April 1, 1992 as a pre-zone for future annexation. Land in the
       Sphere-of-Influence lacks urban infrastructure, and much of the area is expected to remain as
       open space. Developable areas have slopes in excess of 8 percent and are subject to the City's
       Hillside Development Regulations. Residential development in the sphere areas will be more
       expensive and at lower average density than residential development within the current City
       boundaries; this is because of expected lower densities due to slope constraints, costs to extend
       utilities and infrastructure, and the cost of land. Consequently, any future annexations are
       expected to provide sites for move-up rather than for affordable housing.

       The City has adopted the 2007 California Building Code (CBC), which is largely based on the
       International Building Code, to address building code requirements. Under State law, this code
       can be amended by local governments only for to geological, topographical, or climatological
       reasons. Adoption of the CBC incorporated the International Building Code, the California
       Mechanical Code incorporated the Uniform Mechanical Code, the California Plumbing Code
       incorporated the Uniform Plumbing Code, the California Electrical Code incorporated the National
       Electrical Code, and the California Fire Code incorporated the International Fire Code. These
       codes are considered to be the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
       welfare, and are not considered an unnecessary constraint to housing.
       Through the use of the State Historic Building Code (Health and Safety Code §18950, Et seq.)
       the City encourages the preservation of significant historic structures. The State Historic Building
       Code permits the use of original or archaic materials in reconstruction with the purpose of
       providing "alternative regulations and standards for the rehabilitation, preservation, restoration
       (including related reconstruction), or relocation of qualified historical buildings or structures." The
       City has also enacted a Mills Act ordinance to provide tax incentives for the preservation of
                                                                                                                
                                                                                            Housing Element

historic homes.
As discussed previously, the housing stock is in relatively good condition. For those structures
that do need repair, the City enforces those standards and regulations that ensure reasonable
and adequate life safety. The application of these standards allow for the exercise of judgment,
as permitted in the code, so that older buildings built under less demanding regulations are not
unduly penalized.
Code Enforcement
The Code Enforcement Division enforces the Municipal Code. Areas of concern include property
maintenance and aesthetics, land use and zoning compliance, parking control, animal regulation,
permits and development compliance, weed abatement, vector control, and graffiti removal. The
Code Enforcement Division primarily operates on a complaint response basis.
Once a violation is reported, a Code Enforcement Officer makes contact and issues notice
requesting correction of the violation. If progress toward compliance is not observed within a
specified amount of time, a multi-step process begins that involves additional notices. As a last
resort, a formal nuisance abatement process is followed, an Administrative Citation may be
issued, or criminal proceedings may be sought. The overall emphasis of the Code Enforcement
program is to ensure that progress toward correction of violations is achieved on a voluntary
basis. One focus of the Code Enforcement program has been toward ordinance improvement in
order to provide a strong foundation in law to back up requests for code compliance.
Overall community awareness is a goal of the Code Enforcement Division. Toward this goal
proactive programs are initiated. Neighborhood conservation programs focus on specific
neighborhoods, which though sound, are beginning to show signs of deterioration. Community
education, neighborhood cleanups, yard maintenance, and abandoned vehicle abatement are
emphasized during such programs. These neighborhoods are often low-income neighborhoods
eligible for CDBG funding for capital improvements, including street resurfacing, storm drains,
streetlights, and water and sewer upgrades.
Off-Site Improvements
New construction within the City triggers Ordinance 58, which requires as a condition of project
approval, the completion of all street frontage improvements. These improvements are primarily
street and storm drain improvements; although the undergrounding of utilities may also be
required. With undergrounding of utility lines there is an aesthetic benefit, but there is also a
public safety concern. This is because Rancho Cucamonga is subject to extremely high winds,
and hazardous conditions can be created when utility poles or utility lines break. Therefore, site
improvement requirements are the minimum necessary for public safety and cannot be viewed as
a constraint to development.
The requirements for on- and off-site improvements will vary depending on the location of the
project, the presence of existing improvements, as well as the size and nature of the proposed
development. In general, most residential areas in Rancho Cucamonga are fully served with
existing infrastructure improvements. The Development Code requires developers proposing to
construct any building, parking lot or developing area to provide for a number of improvements
within the public rights-of-way including: concrete curb and gutter, asphalt concrete street
pavement, sidewalks, street lights, and street trees. Typical residential development requires a
60-foot minimum public street right-of way, which includes a 36-foot street width measured from
curb to curb; private streets may have a reduced right-of-way, however the curb to curb
dimension remains consistent with public streets.
The City and other public agencies charge fees that may affect the price of housing. However,
the fees such as drainage, transportation, water, and sewer are necessary for public health and
safety, while other fees provide for public amenities, including park development and
beautification. Finally, processing fees reimburse the City for a portion of the cost of processing
development review applications. The RDA provides financial subsidies to affordable housing
developments in order to offset the impact of development fees.

       Fees and Other Exactions
       Planning Fees
       The City charges a range of development fees and exactions to recover the costs of providing
       services to new development. Fees are designed to ensure that developers pay a fair pro-rata
       fair share of the cost of providing infrastructure and to compensate the City for the cost of
       processing the application. These fees are not considered excessive and are comparable to
       surrounding communities. Application fees are established by a Fee Study, which analyzes a
       number of factors including processing time, number of people needed to review an application
       relative to the application received. This Fee Study is then used to determine the actual fees
       which are reviewed and adopted by City Council. The current Fee Study is tied to the Consumer
       Price Index (CPI) and application fees automatically increase each year based on the prior years
       CPI. The following table summarizes the Planning Department fee requirements for residential
       development applications.

       Building Permit Fees
       The following table itemizes fees charged for prototypical projects in Rancho Cucamonga. As
       previously mentioned, these fees are designed to ensure that developers pay a pro-rata fair share
       of the cost of providing infrastructure and to compensate the City for the cost of processing the
       application. For instance, Planning and Building fees (building inspection, plan review, and
       WQMP) recover the cost of processing applications, issuing building permits, building inspections,
       and providing services; local impact fees (drainage, transportation, beautification, and park
                                                                                                          
                                                                                       Housing Element

development) are charged for the construction of infrastructure to serve new housing; and
regional impact fees (schools, water, and wastewater) are charged by regional or government
entities to provide infrastructure and services for new development.
A new fee imposed on the development of single-family homes is the fee associated with the plan
check of a Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP). The WQMP plan check may be included
as part of a separate grading plan check or combined with the building plan check. The fee is
based on an hourly rate of $114.84 and may amount to several hours time depending on the level
of review. Fire Department plan check fees are incorporated into the Building and Safety Plan
Check fee and are not assessed separately.
Between 2000 and 2008, the fees for SFR and MFR building permits increased approximately 98
percent. This fee increase due to the fact that the City historically had fees lower than what it
actually cost the City to process a development application. Following an extensive Fee Study in
2001-2002, the City increased its application and permit fees. Planning and Building fees were
increased to fully recoup the cost of staff time to process a project, and increases in local and
regional impact fees were the result of increases in the cost to provide the identified service or to
develop public facilities to serve new development. Although some fees have increased
significantly, the Beautification fee applied to residential development has not increased. These
fees are based upon the cost the City to provide the identified services, are consistent with those
fees charged by neighboring jurisdictions in the western San Bernardino County region, and do
not impose an impediment to the supply or affordability of SFR and MFR housing. It is important
to note that over 52 percent of those identified fees are levied by the CVWD, not the City. CVWD
fees for each housing unit (both SFR & MFR) include the water meter, meter box, water capacity
fee, sewer capacity fee, and capital capacity fee (paid to the Inland Empire Utilities Agency
(IEUA)).
These fee increases also affect typical multi-family development as the building permit fee
calculations are the same for both single family and multifamily projects. As discussed above,
these fees are consistent with those of other cities in the western San Bernardino County region
and do not preclude or significantly impact the supply or affordability of housing. Based upon the
following table, fees charged for multi-family development average $24,872.61 per unit, which,
based on analysis of other cities in western San Bernardino County is less than or comparable to
the fees of other cities in the area. These fees do not preclude or significantly impact the supply
or affordability of housing.

       increased from approximately $173,000 in 1999 to approximately $545,000 in 2007; an increase
       of 215.0 percent. Assuming the median price reflects the price of a new home, in 2000, fees
       represented 10.5 percent of the total cost of a new home, and in 2007, these fees represented
       5.3 percent of the total price. This decrease in the percentage is primarily the result of a
       significant increase in the cost of a home, both new and resale, and although development fees
       have also increased significantly, the rate of increase was far below the rate of increase in home
       value during the same time period.
       The following table identifies the hypothetical fees that would be collected for the development of
       a new 1,265 square foot residence and a 16-unit multifamily development. These fees would be
       approximately $31,165.02 and $24,872.61 per unit respectively. This represents about 11.0
       percent of the total development cost for a single family unit and 9.6 percent for a multi-family

       Water and Sewer Service
       Water and sewer services are provided by Cucamonga Valley Water District (CVWD). Based
       upon CVWD's Water Master Plan current water supplies and delivery systems are adequate and
       present no constraints to housing development. Rancho Cucamonga accounts for approximately
       75 percent of CVWD's 47 square mile water service area, but about 90 percent of the customer
       service base. Total water deliveries (including residential, commercial, and agricultural) was
       47,435 Acre Feet/Year (AFY) in 2000, 55,320 AFY in 2005, and is projected to be 83,500 AFY in
       2030. Total water use (including water deliveries, sales to other agencies, and water loss) was
       50,717 AFY in 2000, 55,856 AFY in 2005, and is projected to be 86,000 AFY in 2030.
       Water usage increases are directly attributed to increases in residential and commercial growth
       during the planning period. Average day demand is approximately 50 million gallons per day
       (mgd) and is expected to increase to 76.8 mgd by 2030. CVWD's Master Plan addresses water
       supply and water delivery capability and provides a schedule for increasing capacity to keep pace
       with development.
       Water and sewer fees have increased 35.9 percent since 2000. New development is charged a
       facilities fee and connection charges, these fees reflect a need for increased capacity in CVWD's
       capital improvement requirements. The water service fee for single-family residential
       development is $4,783 per unit; this fee was $4,250 in 2000.
       Sewers are provided by CVWD, while the IEUA provides wastewater treatment facilities. Based
       upon CVWD's Master Plan, planned expansion, upgrade, and timely maintenance of the sewer
       system will provide adequate sewer service through the build-out period. For the typical dwelling
       unit, CVWD charges $2,700 in sewer connection fees. Where no sewer infrastructure exists and
       is required as a condition of development, the development is required to provide master planned
       facilities. Because of the availability of the CVWD sewer system, the sewer capacity is not a
       constraint on development.
       CVWD passes along the IEUA facilities fee of $4,450 per dwelling unit as a sewer system
       capacity fee. In 2000 this fee was $3,530, representing a 26 percent increase. The increase
       reflects the need for increased wastewater treatment capacity through build-out. Because of the
       availability of the IEUA wastewater treatment facilities, wastewater capacity is not a constraint on
       development.

School Facilities
Five school districts serve the City. As a result of the rapid growth prior to incorporation several
of the local school districts have faced severe overcrowding. The present concern among the
school districts continues to be the inability to finance construction of new school facilities in the
post-Proposition 13 years. Under AB 2926 (1989), the State requires written certification
regarding classroom availability prior to project approval. As an absolute policy, the City requires
that school facilities shall be provided for each residential development. The Development Code
states in part, "[t]he project includes school facilities or adequate school facilities exist which are
or will be capable of accommodating students generated by this project." AB 2926 also regulates
the collection of developer fees by the school districts under subdivision processing. When a
legislation action, such as a General Plan Amendment, Specific Plan, or Development Agreement
is requested, a condition may be added to require completed school facilities or provide in lieu
fees.
Although there has been a fee increase, State mandated fees produce insufficient revenue to buy
land and build new schools. The timing of collection virtually guarantees that students will need
classrooms before funds are available to build them. State authorized fee increases are not
indexed to inflation and lag the general inflation rate. Two elementary school districts, i.e.,
Cucamonga and Etiwanda, impose a per unit fee on new construction and one elementary school
district, i.e., Etiwanda, utilizes a variety of measures that include both Mello-Roos and Community
Facilities District bond financing for new schools.
In general, schools in the City are at capacity or are experiencing declining enrollment. In terms
of overall school capacity, a total of 6,920 new students have been added since 1999. Of the four
elementary school districts, only the Etiwanda School District reports being below capacity, but
only as a result of new school construction. Alta Loma School District has experienced a
declining enrollment for the past few years and does not have plans for additional schools.
Cucamonga School District has been experiencing declining enrollment. Central School District
reports that they are experiencing a district wide decline in enrollment and do not anticipate
adding any new facilities. As most of the vacant land available for residential  development is
located in the northeast section of the City, the Etiwanda School District has been and will
continue to be the school district most impacted by future residential development. The Chaffey
Joint Union High School District added Rancho Cucamonga High School in 1993 and Los Osos
High School in 2002. There are currently no plans for additional schools in the district as overall
enrollment within the district is projected to gradually decline.
Financing Options for Required Infrastructure
Generally, the cost to extend urban infrastructure and services continues to serve as a constraint
on development, including residential development. This is especially true in Rancho
Cucamonga, which incorporated post-Proposition 13 where the City's share of the property tax is
very low compared to surrounding cities. Other sources of funding for capital improvements and
operating and maintenance costs are extremely limited. Tax increment financing for areas within
the City's Redevelopment Area has provided some facilities, for example fire stations.
Mello-Roos Community Facilities District (CFD) financing is an alternative. Through the Mello-
Roos mechanism a property owner/developer can use bonded indebtedness to finance capital
improvements needed for development. The new homeowners will be obligated to repay the
bonds. One school district, i.e., Etiwanda, uses Mello-Roos bond financing in portions of their
district. The City has supported two developer initiated CFD's. CFD 88-1 provided for the
construction of a new fire station in the northeast area of the City. CFD 88-2 financed facilities to
remove flood hazards required to protect the public's safety prior to development of three
subdivisions located in the northeast area of the City.
Based on the previous experiences, the City expressed several concerns about Mello-Roos
financing. The total burden on any individual's property tax should not exceed 1.8 percent of
assessed value. There is a potential for perceived inequity when one property owner pays 1.0
percent of assessed value and another property owner is obligated to pay 1.8 percent as a result
of Mello-Roos obligations. As a result, the potential for an unintended increase in tax burden on
homeowners may occur when the market absorption schedule exceeds the absorption rate.

       The City has supported the use of Mello-Roos financing for more expensive, low-density
       residential development. The Mello-Roos districts for schools impact all new housing and
       therefore have a potential impact on development of new affordable housing. Mello-Roos
       Community Facilities bonding is a potential constraint on housing. In general, lack of funding for
       capital improvements will remain as a potential constraint on future development.
       Local Processing and Permit Procedures
       Development permits typically must undergo a variety of City approval processes depending upon
       the scope and scale of a residential project. This includes routine development and design
       review approvals. Each of these stages is critical to ensuring quality residential projects that are
       consistent with City design goals and standards. This section focuses on the development
       approval processes required for different residential projects in Rancho Cucamonga. A summary
       table indicating the applicable approval process and timeline based on development type is
       shown below.

       Development Review Process
       Rancho Cucamonga developed a standardized review process for each of the development
       permits noted above. In the typical development application, the applicant consults with planners
       at the public counter regarding development standards and design guidelines. The applicant then
       prepares a application submittal package consisting of site plans, grading plans, elevations, and
       floor plans; these plans are then submitted to the Planning Department as a formal development
       review application. Plans are then routed to different departments, i.e., Engineering, Building and
       Safety, Fire, and Police, for their review. The following week the application is scheduled for a
       Planning and Engineering staff meeting in which comments and issues are discussed by each
       reviewing department. The application is then determined to be either incomplete for further
       processing and a comment letter is sent outlining corrections and design issues, or is deemed
       complete. Following a completeness determination the application is scheduled for Committee
       review, i.e., the Grading, Technical, and Design Review Committees. Once these Committees
       have approved the application it is forwarded to the Planning Commission for final action and
       adoption of environmental determinations, as applicable. Legislative actions, such as General
       Plan or Development Code Amendments, also require City Council review and approval. The
       applicant then submits working drawings to the Building and Safety Department to begin the
       building plan check process, which allows for 15 days for a first check and 10 days for a second
       check. The City has published a handbook titled "The Development Review Process" which is
       available at the public counter for applicants to review and obtain guidance on the City's review
       process and procedures.
       The purpose of the development review process is to encourage development that is compatible
       and harmonious with neighborhoods; foster sound design principles resulting in creative and
       imaginative solutions; utilize quality building design that avoids monotony; promote and maintain
       the public health, safety, general welfare; and implement General Plan policies that encourage
       the preservation and enhancement of the unique character of the City.

The Planning Commission is responsible for the design review of new construction on vacant
property; structural additions, reconstruction, or new buildings which are equal to 50 percent of
the floor area of the existing on-site building(s), or have a minimum 10,000 square feet in size;
and projects involving a substantial change or intensification of land use.
The Development Code specifies that the design review applies to site plan configuration,
architectural design, circulation and parking, and landscaping. The Design Review Committee
reviews the application for conformance with City design guidelines and standards, and upon
approval, forwards the project to the Planning Commission for final review and action. Before a
design review approval is granted, the Planning Commission must meet the following findings:
1) That the proposed project is consistent with the General Plan;
2) That the proposed use is in accord with the objectives of the Development Code and the
     purposes of the district in which the site is located;
3) That the proposed use is in compliance with each of the applicable provisions of the
     Development Code; and
4) That the proposed use, together with the conditions applicable thereto, will not be detrimental
     to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in
     the vicinity.
The City has prepared and adopted Design Guidelines for both Commercial/Industrial and
Residential uses. These Design Guidelines are available at the public counter and online for
applicants to better understand the City's design criteria and the quality expected by the Planning
Commission.
Residential Development Review
Residential Development Review is required for the construction of more than two or more single-
family units, condominium, and apartment projects. Development and Design Review
applications are typically filed concurrently with tract or parcel map applications, as required. The
Planning Director has the authority to review and approve projects involving four or less single-
family units. Projects of five or more units, condominiums, or apartments must be reviewed by
the Design Review Committee and are forwarded to the Planning Commission for final action.
Applications are reviewed for consistency with applicable development standards of the base
district and the City's adopted design guidelines.
Hillside Design Review
Hillside Design Review is required for the construction of one or more units for property located
within the Hillside Overlay District. This district requires additional development criteria with the
intent of maintaining existing vegetation, slopes, and drainage patterns, and to limit the impact of
grading activities. The Planning Director has the authority to review and approve Hillside Design
Review applications provided the proposed project meets the following criteria:
1) Natural slopes which are 8 percent or greater but less than 15 percent on all or part of a
     subject site, or on less steep land which may be affected by areas of greater slope.
2) For fills or excavations equal to, or exceeding 3 feet, but less than 5 feet in vertical depth, at
     their deepest point measured from the natural ground surface.
3) For excavations or fills, or any combination thereof, equal to or exceeding 100 cubic yards,
     but less than 1,500 cubic yards.
4) Residential construction involving four or less dwelling units, such as custom homes,
     regardless of natural slope or the amount of fill or excavation.
Hillside Design Review projects that exceed these criteria require review and approval by the
Planning Commission.
Tract or Parcel Maps
Tract or parcel map applications are typically filed and processed concurrently with a
Development/Design Review or Hillside Design Review application. These applications are
evaluated based on the applicable development standards of the base zoning district, which
typically includes minimum lot size, lot width, lot depth, and frontage width. A tract or parcel map
processed concurrently with a Development Review application does not lengthen or increase the

       time period for staff to review the application.
       Variance
       Variance applications are filed concurrently with Development/Design Review, Hillside Design
       Review, and tract or parcel map applications and request a deviation from applicable
       development standards. The Planning Commission has the authority to review and approve
       Variance requests at a public hearing. The Planning Commission must make the following
       findings in order to approve the Variance request:
       1) That the strict and literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would
            result in practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives
            of the Development Code.
       2) That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the
            property involved or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other
            properties in the same zone.
       3) That the strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would
            deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other properties in the same
            zone.
       4) That the granting of a Variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with
            the limitations on other properties classified in the same zone.
       5) That the granting of the Variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare
            or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.
       General Plan Amendment – Development District Amendment
       For very large residential projects, the applicant may propose a General Plan Amendment or
       Development District Amendment, e.g., a zone change, particularly for housing units proposed on
       underutilized sites zoned for non-residential uses. In these cases, the timeframe for approval can
       be considerably longer. However, the City typically processes these applications concurrently
       with other discretionary applications in an effort to reduce approval timeframes.
       Building Plan Check and Permit Issuance
       Following the required appeal period for the approval of discretionary applications, applicants may
       submit for building plan check. The City makes a strong effort to review first plan checks within
       15 days, and within 10 days for subsequent plan check submittals. The City utilizes a computer-
       based permit tracking system that allows applicants to check the status of their plan check
       applications on-line and obtain corrections when they become available from each reviewing
       department.
       Regulatory Concessions
       The City utilizes a variety of planning tools to encourage and facilitate the development of
       affordable housing opportunities. These regulatory concessions are described below:
       Density Bonus
       The City's Affordable Housing Incentives/Density Bonus Provisions assist in the development of
       affordable housing opportunities in accordance with Government Code §65915-65918. These
       provisions allow a density bonus and other regulatory concessions to provide incentives for "the
       production of housing for very low income, lower income, moderate income, and senior
       households" to "facilitate the development of affordable housing" within the City. The provisions
       function by allowing a reduction in development standards in exchange for the development of
       affordable housing units. Based on the number of units provided and the percentage of those
       units designated for low, very low, and senior households, the applicant may request a density
       bonus and/or other regulatory concessions to facilitate the development. Regulatory concessions
       act as incentives, which can include reduced building setbacks, reduced open space, increased
       lot coverage, increased maximum building height, reduced on-site parking standards, reduced
       minimum building separation requirements, or other site or construction conditions applicable to
       residential development. However, the caveat regarding the density bonus is that the
       development incentive granted shall contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of providing
       the target units.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                         Housing Element

When implemented the Density Bonus Provisions allow for an increased project density when site
conditions would normally warrant a reduced project density. Depending on the number of units
held for low or very low income households, the applicant may request up to three incentives and
a density bonus. When properly implemented, a density bonus may increase the maximum
allowable residential density of a project by up to 35 percent.
Variance – Minor Exception
Variance and Minor Exception procedures allow for a modification to development standards
where unique property characteristics would create a hardship in complying with the Development
Code. The characteristics must be unique to the property, and in general, not shared by other
adjacent parcels. Minor Exception procedures allow the Planning Director to approve up to a 10
percent reduction in applicable development standards and a 25 percent reduction in parking.
Variance procedures allow the Planning Commission to approve a modification to established
development standards.

Market Constraints
California Government Code §65583(a)(6) requires an "analysis of the potential and actual
nongovernmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for
all income levels, including the availability of financing, the price of land, and the cost of
construction."
Economic Climate
Regional economic conditions provide the overall context for housing development and
availability. A strong period of regional economic growth followed by a significant drop in the
housing market characterizes most of the reporting period. An analysis of the relationship of the
economy to housing production indicates that a strong economic climate results in an increase in
housing production.
Beginning in 1996, new housing construction began to rise, not to the levels of the late 1980's, but
steadily increasing. Housing prices for existing homes raised dramatically, interest rates dropped,
thereby stimulating housing sales for new and existing homes. Housing construction remained
strong through early 2006, and was then followed by a steady decline due to the sub-prime loan
crisis, market saturation, high levels of foreclosure, and a severe economic recession.
The American economy began to rebound following the Dot-com crash in 2000-2001. Since
adoption of the 2000 Housing Element, the economy expanded and in the immediate region
provided an increase in service, manufacturing, and construction jobs. Locally, Rancho
Cucamonga's taxable retail sales continue to reach record levels in the City's history with 2004
generating $1.75 billion. This continues a string of record highs that goes back to the middle
1980's and includes those years (1991-1993) when Southern California was in a severe
recession. The 2004 growth was a record $335 million (23.7 percent). This surge came about
with the fourth quarter opening of Victoria Gardens, a local regional mall. The City's long term

       retail trade increase, in part, has been a result of the rising number of families in the City and their
       growing incomes, but also reflects the opening and expansion of various destination retail
       centers. In addition, Rancho Cucamonga has benefited from direct sales to consumers by
       several of the contractors, manufacturers and distributors that are located in the community.
       During the period from 2000-2004, Rancho Cucamonga's taxable sales nearly went from $1.16
       billion to $1.75 billion, a $585 million gain or 50.3 percent. Much of this gain represents a true
       increase in trade volume since prices rose only 12.9 percent in this period.
       Cost of Land
       In Rancho Cucamonga, residential land costs vary depending on the availability of land and the
       cost of grading and infrastructure (off-site improvements) associated with development of a
       proposed project. The price of land impacts the price of new homes and also residential resale
       price. The land speculation that occurred during the second half of the 1980's resulted in a
       significant inflationary trend on all home prices. The result was reduced housing affordability at all
       income levels. Along with the resurgence of the regional economy the dramatic growth in home
       sales has been accompanied by a surge to record high property values. The increase in property
       values corresponds directly to increases in the cost of obtaining new housing.
       The two biggest expenses in housing development are land costs and fees. Construction costs
       tend to correlate with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and thus remain somewhat consistent. So
       while construction costs have increased along with the CPI, the cost of land has escalated to the
       largest item associated with the cost of housing.
       During the 1980's land speculation was heated and peaked in 1989. Speculation led to many
       foreclosures in the City's Sphere of Influence as well as to foreclosures in the City. For example,
       land in the City with an approved tentative tract map that sold during the 1980's for $100,000 an
       acre, resold after foreclosure for $20,000 an acre in 1994. In the early 1990's the price of land
       declined dramatically. The raw land price has increased substantially since 1994 as a result of
       the economic resurgence from the 1990's recession. With the resurging economy, land prices
       slowly rose to the pre-speculation levels. According to local developers, raw land costs in the City
       and surrounding region have increased over 100 percent since the mid 1990's. As land has
       become scarcer, the price for land has also increased.
       During the past 12 to 18 months, the City has experienced a fairly significant drop in the price of
       raw land. Between the period from 2003 to 2008 land prices increased dramatically and have
       reduced a significant amount as the availability to finance residential construction projects has
       decreased. Thus it can be seen that land speculation can act as a non-governmental constraint
       on housing as speculation, availability of financing, and land scarcity can greatly impact the price
       of land.
       Cost of Construction
       Construction cost depends on the price of materials, quality of construction, and finish detail.
       Construction costs have more or less paralleled the CPI from 1989 to the present. In general, the
       CPI has increased an average of 5.71 percent between 2000 and 2007, with a high of 8.6 percent
       in 2006 and a low of 4.9 percent in 2002. This compares with an average annual CPI of
       3.02 percent between 1991 and 2000.
       Residential construction cost estimates established by the International Code Council in the Fall
       of 2007 indicate average costs of labor and materials between $86.73 and $126.78 for multi-
       family, depending on type of construction. Single family residential costs range between $94.99
       and $120.93 per square foot, depending on type of construction. Construction costs may vary
       based on the type of material uses, location of development, structural features present, and
       other factors.
       Prevailing wages may also be an additional constraint on construction costs. In California, all
       public works projects must pay prevailing wages to all workers employed on the project. A public
       works project is any residential or commercial project that is funded through public funds,
       including Federally funded or assisted residential projects controlled or carried out by an awarding
       body. The prevailing wage rate is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority
                                                                                                                
                                                                                            Housing Element

nearest labor market area.
Twice a year, prevailing wage rates are determined by the director of the California Department of
Industrial Relations (DIR). A prevailing wage ensures that the ability to get a public works
contract is not based on paying lower wage rates than a competitor, and requires that all bidders
use the same wage rates when bidding on a public works project. The DIR provides links to the
current prevailing wages for a journeyman craft or classification for each county in California.
Prevailing wages may constrain construction of affordable housing because they are often higher
than normal wages.
Housing Demand
Another factor influencing the housing market is demand. Conventional methodology links
demand directly to population increase. According to SCAG and the DOF, the regional
population increased steadily during the period. New residential units authorized by building
permits continued to grow through late 2005.
The strong economy, diversified job market, and stock market profits have helped to strengthen
the housing market of the region. Prior to 2006, the limited new housing coming to the market
was aggravating the upward pressure on home prices and rents, making it increasingly difficult to
afford homes in places relatively close to employment areas.
Up to 1990, the population increased as families moved to California to work in an expanding job
market. The situation changed dramatically in the early 1990's as families were leaving California
to seek jobs in other market, as well as to seek lifestyle changes. During this time population
increases was due primarily to natural increases (i.e., births exceeding deaths).
SCAG predicts that through 2020, the State is projected to have the fastest rate of population
growth. California's rapid growth will increase by approximately 40 percent as a result of both a
high rate of natural increase and a high rate of immigration. The average annual birth rate for
California is expected to be 20 births per 1,000 population, and the State is expected to attract
more than one-third of the country's immigrants.
Another factor in housing demand related to the economic downturn, is the likelihood that new
household formations are being delayed and many existing households were doubling-up
demonstrating a surprising elasticity in the housing market. There is also a corresponding
increase in overcrowding and in homeless families. However, in many instances there appears to
have been excess capacity in existing housing units sufficient to absorb extended families and
non-related housemates. Elasticity in the housing market serves as a non-governmental
constraint on housing production.
Availability of Financing
During the past few years, significant changes have occurred in the mortgage lending industry.
Home mortgage rates of the late 1990's and early 2000's were very low with 30-year fixed rates
as low as 5 percent. However, problems within the finance industry, the economic recession, and
changes in the Federal lending rate have gradually made mortgages more difficult to obtain. A
fixed rate 30-year non-jumbo loan for a new home currently carries interest rates of
5.125 percent. Lower initial rates are available with "creative" financing including Graduated
Payment Mortgages (GPM's), Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM's), Interest Only Mortgages, and
Buy-Down Mortgages. However, ARM's of a few years ago have exercised significant increases
that have drastically increased monthly mortgage payments, and thus jeopardizing homeowners
and creating a high percentage of residential foreclosures.
Therefore, lower income households will have difficulty qualifying for standard mortgages even if
home prices drop to reasonable levels. Financing for both construction and long-term mortgages
is generally available in Rancho Cucamonga subject to normal underwriting standards. However,
a more critical impediment to homeownership involves both the affordability of the housing stock
and the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment requirements. Typically, conventional
home loans will require 10 to 20 percent of the sale price as a down payment, which is the largest

       constraint to first-time homebuyers. The City's First-Time Homebuyer program, administered by
       the RDA, provides more favorable down payment and financing terms and provides a silent
       second loan up to a maximum of $80,000.
       Residential Foreclosures
       Between 2000 and 2005, the availability of lower interest rates, "creative" financing, and predatory
       lending practices (e.g., extremely aggressive marketing, hidden fees, and negative amortization),
       many Rancho Cucamonga households purchased homes that, ultimately, were beyond their
       financial means. Many homes were purchased under the false assumption that refinancing
       options to a lower interest rate would be available and that home prices would continue to rise at
       double-digit rates. Many households were (and still are) unprepared for the potential hikes in
       interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed rates, and a decline in sales prices beginning in 2006.
        Many homeowners are suddenly faced with significantly inflated mortgage payments, and
       mortgage loans that are larger than the value of the home (i.e., commonly referred to as being
       "upside down" or "underwater"), many homeowners had no option but to resort to foreclosing their
       homes.
       Between July 1, 2007 and September 30, 2008 there were a total of 49,973 properties taken all
       the way through the foreclosure process in the MSA (this includes 20,366 properties in San
       Bernardino County and 29,607 properties in Riverside County). As estimated by DOF, this
       represents 3.42 percent of all housing units for the MSA (2.97 percent in San Bernardino County
       and 3.83 percent in Riverside County). With the implosion of the mortgage lending market, many
       households are having difficulty obtaining new mortgage loans or refinancing, even for above
       moderate income households.
       In November 2009, there were 1,805 homes in Rancho Cucamonga in the foreclosure process
       (including 707 in pre-foreclosure, 860 in auction, and 238 bank owned) and range in price from
       $51,000 (a condominium) to over $1.8 million. The high price of some of these homes facing
       foreclosure indicates that the impact of foreclosure extends not only to lower and moderate
       income households, but also to households with higher incomes.
       Housing for Persons With Disabilities
       Housing options for persons with disabilities are often limited. To ensure adequate housing for
       persons with disabilities State law requires cities to analyze constraints to the development,
       maintenance, and improvement of housing for people with disabilities; demonstrate efforts to
       remove governmental constraints; and include programs to accommodate people with disabilities.
       Allowable Housing Types
       Rancho Cucamonga complies with applicable State law requirements and permits Residential
       Care Facilities, serving six or fewer persons, to be located in all residential districts; while large
       Residential Care Facilities, serving seven or more persons, are permitted in the Low Medium to
       High residential districts, subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit. There are no
       Development Code requirements establishing a maximum concentration of these facilities, nor
       are there separation requirements (other than those established by State law), nor parking, set
       back, or site planning requirements other than those that may be required of any typical single-
       family or multiple-family residence.
       The Development Code defines and clearly distinguishes between a Residential Care Facility,
       Convalescent Center, and Day Care Facilities. These uses are either permitted, or conditionally
       permitted, depending on the age of the person to be assisted, the level of assistance provided,
       the duration of assistance, and the number of persons assisted.
       The Rancho Cucamonga Development Code distinguishes transitional housing opportunities from
       other residential land uses, defines a family, but not a household, and does not distinguish
       between them. It does not regulate the number or relationships of occupants in a home, nor
       distinguish residential uses by the type of occupant or disability. In this manner, Rancho
       Cucamonga residents have the widest choice of where to live within the City regardless of their
       family size, disability, medical condition, or any other arbitrary grouping. However, the City will

need to add one new category of housing as a permitted use, this being single room occupancy
(SRO) housing.
Rehabilitation and New Construction
Rancho Cucamonga's housing stock is relatively young, as only roughly 29.4 percent of the
housing stock was built prior to 1980 and 57.3 percent was built prior to 1990. As such, a large
percentage of homes were built utilizing modern accessibility standards. However, in cases
where rehabilitation is necessary, the City can allow a property to install accessibility
improvements, such as, building a handicap ramp to allow for improved entrance to a single-
family home. The Development Code currently permits projections into yards where decks,
platforms, and landing places which do not exceed a height of 48 inches, which may project into a
required front or corner side yard up to a maximum distance of six feet, and may project into any
rear or side  yard up to the property line. However, this standard is not established as an
accessibility accommodation and does not allow for the installation of improvements where a
greater projection in to a required building setback may be necessary. The Housing Plan
proposes to amend the Development Code to define accessibility accommodation, and ensure
that local regulations comply with State law.
The City also makes Home Improvement Program funds, funded through the City's CDBG
program, available for income eligible homeowners for accessibility improvements.
Permitting Process/Reasonable Accommodations
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose
an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications
or exceptions) in their zoning and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be
necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
Reasonable modifications to structures, including both internal and external modifications, are
administratively approved by the Building Official and Planning Director, or their designee, and
only a building permit is required, no discretionary permitting process is involved, and there are no
established formal procedures for addressing accommodations.
As discussed previously, the Housing Plan will include a program establishing a procedure for
reasonable accommodations. The goal of the program will be to identify review procedures and
to provide reasonable accommodations to explicitly allow for changes to land use, building codes,
development code requirements (i.e., setback reductions and parking requirements), and
permitting processes to accommodate people with disabilities.
Housing Resources
Housing resources refer to the land, financial, and administrative resources that are available to
meet Rancho Cucamonga's housing needs to mitigate the housing constraints identified in earlier
sections of this Housing Element. This section provides an inventory, analysis, and assessment
of the City's resources to address its housing needs, including the City's share of the Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).
Projected Housing Needs
The RHNA is distributed by income category. The City of Rancho Cucamonga is allocated a
RHNA construction goal of 1,282 housing units for the 2006-2014 planning period. Of that total,
the RHNA is divided into four household income groups based upon guidelines established by the
State. Based upon these income thresholds and the current price of housing, this Housing
Element assumes that the construction of single-family homes and condominiums are affordable
to the above moderate income households. The housing units must accommodate the following
affordability guidelines:
        317 units of housing affordable to extremely low/very low income households,

                216 units of housing affordable to low income households,
                245 units of housing affordable to moderate income households, and
                504 units of housing affordable to above moderate income households.
       The RHNA allocation of 317 very low income units is inclusive of extremely low income units.
       Pursuant to State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income
       housing needs based on Census income distribution, or assume that 50 percent of the very low
       income households are extremely low income households. As demonstrated in the "Household
       Income Profile by Household Type" (Table HE-13), extremely low income households constitute
       49.4 percent of the very low income group. Therefore, the City's RHNA of 317 very low income
       units can be split between 156 extremely low income units (at 49.4 percent) and 161 very low
       income units. However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites to accommodate the RHNA,
       State law does not mandate the separate accounting for the extremely low income category.
       Credits Towards the RHNA
       State law allows local governments to obtain credits towards its RHNA housing goals by counting
       housing units constructed, building permits issued, and projects approved since January 1, 2006.
       Between January 2006 and October 2009, the City issued building permits or certificates of
       occupancy to 1,122 single-family homes and 1,327 multi-family units.

       Units Constructed
       According to City records, 2,449 units have been issued building permits since January 1, 2006.
       Of these units, 394 were held as affordable (194 very low income, 141 low income, and 59
       moderate income units) and 2,055 were market rate units available to above moderate income
       households. The 394 affordable units include:
       •    Villaggio on Route 66 – The City assisted Workforce Housing and National CORE in the
            development of a 166-unit workforce housing project, with 131 units held as affordable. This
            project is located on the north side of Foothill Boulevard between Center Avenue and
            Hermosa Avenue.

•    Rancho Verde East – The City assisted National CORE in the development of an additional
     40 units to this existing 117 unit apartment complex. One hundred percent of the units within
     this complex are held as affordable. This project is located on the east side of Grove Avenue,
     north of 8th Street.
Units Conserved
Multi-Family Affordable Housing
In August 2007, the RDA entered into an Extended Affordability Agreement with National CORE
for $42.5 million to extend the affordability covenants on low-income units. In exchange for
funding, National CORE increased the affordability restrictions on 25 units currently available to
households earning 80 percent of the AMI to households earning 60 percent of the AMI. These
units are located within the Rancho Verde Village, Mountainside, Monterey Village, and
Sycamore Springs apartment complexes.
In addition to the 25 units, National CORE agreed to increase the number of affordable units in
order conserve an additional 60 existing apartment units within the City. The 60 units are located
within the Monterey Village and Mountainside apartment complexes and will be made affordable
to low and very-low-income households and include 30 units available to households earning
60 percent of the AMI, 20 units available to households earning 45 percent of the AMI, and 10
units available to households earning 35 percent of the AMI; these 60 units were evenly
distributed between the two apartment communities. At the time of conservation these units were
market rate and were not available to very low- or low-income households. The units are
considered habitable and will be in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition upon occupancy. The
Affordability Agreements on these 60 units will run 99 years, to expire in 2106.
Remaining RHNA
Rancho Cucamonga has already achieved a significant portion of its RHNA with the construction
of both market rate and affordable housing units, and the conservation of existing market rate
units. Specifically, the RHNA identified a need of 778 lower income units and 504 above
moderate income units for the planning period. As of December 2009, the City had provided 454
lower income units (with 171 constructed, 223 under construction, and 60 conserved) and well in
excess of the 504 above moderate income housing units.
Based upon the construction and conservation of these units, Rancho Cucamonga has a
remaining RHNA housing need requirement of 324 housing units for the remainder of the
planning period. The City must ensure the availability of residential sites at adequate densities
and appropriate development standards to accommodate these remaining units.
Residential Sites Inventory
Government Code §65583(a)(3) and §65583.2 requires "an inventory of land suitable for
residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment, and
an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services for these sites". The
availability of vacant residential land is the primary resource needed to meet the City's affordable
housing needs.
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate that the vacant land inventory is sufficient and
adequate to accommodate that jurisdictions share of the regional housing need. Rancho
Cucamonga is committed to identifying sufficient and adequate sites at appropriate densities to
accommodate the City's remaining RHNA of 324 housing units. The Housing Element must
identify those sites within the City that can accommodate the remaining RHNA. Potential
development sites at adequate densities and appropriate development standards must be made
available to accommodate these remaining units. Pursuant to State law, the default density of 30
units per acre is considered an adequate density to facilitate and encourage the development of
lower income housing.

       Methodology
       The first step in identifying adequate sites is preparing an inventory of land suitable for residential
       development. Government Code §65583.2(a) provides that land suitable for residential
       development include 1) vacant sites zoned for residential use, 2) vacant sites zoned for non
       residential use that allows residential development, 3) residentially zoned sites that are capable of
       being developed at a higher density, and 4) sites zoned for nonresidential use that can be
       redeveloped for, and as necessary, rezoned for, residential use. The second and third steps
       determine capacity and suitability of the land for affordable housing. These steps are
       summarized below:
               Identification of Vacant Residential Land: The land inventory contains a listing of
                properties by unique identifier (a complete listing of vacant land is contained in Appendix
                B). Pursuant to State law requirements, this listing shows the size, general plan
                designation, and zoning of each property. The complete land inventory also includes a
                general description of any environmental or infrastructure constraints to the development
                of housing. Finally, a map shows the location of sites included in the inventory.
               Demonstrating Capacity: This analysis determines the capacity of sites identified in the
                inventory and their ability to accommodate affordable housing. To determine capacity
                the City can rely on minimum density requirements adopted through local regulations or,
                if minimum densities do not exist, the Housing Element must describe the methodology
                used to establish the number of units.
               Demonstrate Suitability of Zone: The analysis must demonstrate that the identified
                zone/densities encourage and facilitate the development of housing for lower income
                households. Examples include market demand and trends, financial feasibility, and
                information based on residential project experience. California Government Code
                §65583.2(c)(3)(b) establishes default density standards. If a city has adopted density
                standards that allow at least 30 dwelling units per acre, HCD is obligated to accept sites
                with those density standards as appropriate for accommodating housing affordable to
                lower income households.
       Identification of Vacant Residential Land
       As of January 1, 2010, approximately 879.89 acres of vacant, uncommitted residential land were
       available for development. This compares to approximately 1,747 acres that were available for

Vacant Land Capacity Analysis
Uncommitted vacant residentially zoned land will support an estimated 2,621 to 3,124 residential
units. Because the City uses a performance standard for all classifications of residential
development, few projects are built at 100 percent of the density range. The exceptions would be
for senior housing or other affordable housing projects that qualify for a density bonus consistent
with the City's Affordable Housing Incentives/Density Bonus requirements.

       state and of these 660 units have been issued building permits; resulting in 3,010 units in the
       processing stream count.
       Estimated Housing Units Available at Build-Out
       The total number of residential units at build-out is estimated to be between 62,059 and 62,562.
       This estimate is based on an analysis of existing units, units in the processing stream, and the
       Vacant Land Capacity Analysis. As of January 1, 2009 there were 55,716 total dwelling units in
       the City and there were another 3,010 units approved by the Planning Commission and awaiting
       construction. The Vacant Land Capacity Analysis indicates that existing zoning will support an
       additional 2,621 to 3,124 units.

       Estimated Population at Build-Out
       As vacant land decreases, the rate of building is expected to decrease so that build-out will likely
       occur between 2020 and 2030. Based on the City's General Plan, the number of housing units at
       build-out will range between 62,059 and 62,562. At the current household size of 3.222 persons
       this equals a population range between 199,954 and 201,574 persons.
       Applying a 3.02 percent vacancy factor would result in 60,184 to 60,672 occupied units. Applying
       the 3.222 persons per unit occupancy rate, the build-out population would then range between
       193,912 and 195,485 persons.
       Demonstrating Capacity
       With the exception of hillside areas, land suitable for affordable housing is generally available
       throughout the City, although because of land costs most of the uncommitted residential land in
       the Hillside Residential, Estate Residential, and Very Low Residential Districts will be unsuitable
       for affordable housing projects. Two of the City's planned communities, Terra Vista and Victoria,
       continue to supply vacant land suitable for a range of housing types. These two planned
       communities have made a commitment where, upon the first sale or rental, 15 percent of the total
       number of units would be affordable to low- and moderate-income families. Primarily due to
       market conditions, Terra Vista had exceeded the terms of its commitment to provide a maximum
       of 1,218 affordable units by 1990. These units are dispersed throughout the planned
       communities to avoid over concentrations of low- and moderate-income families in any one area.
       In general, multi-family units are more affordable than single-family units. Approximately 39.54
       acres of vacant land is available throughout the City in the multi-family density range of eight or
       more units per acres, Medium, Medium-High, and High residential districts; including 17.71 acres
       in the High Residential District and 21.83 acres in the Medium Residential District. Other land
       located throughout the City is available and suitable for the development of affordable housing
       within the Mixed Use District. Affordable units may be achieved through implementation of the
       City's Affordable Housing Incentive/Density Bonus Provisions, in conjunction with the City's
       Senior Housing Overlay District, and through the RDA's Implementation Plan.

The following analysis provides a parcel specific inventory of vacant residential sites suitable for
accommodating the remaining RHNA balance of 324 housing units. A more detailed analysis of
the City's vacant residential land has been conducted and is provided in Appendix B. This
analysis includes the Assessor's parcel number, site acreage, General Plan Designation and
Land Use District, existing land use and Community Plan location, developable density, and
realistic dwelling unit potential. Only those sites with the potential to address the RHNA balance
are included in the inventory.
The methodology used to determine the realistic development capacity of each of the sites listed
below was through a combination of factors specific to each site including land use designations
and the accompanying development standards, lot size, development trends and other land
constraints applicable to the specific site. As such, very few sites can achieve the maximum
densities allowable by their land use designations.

Terra Vista Community Plan
The Terra Vista area contains three vacant uncommitted parcels totaling 11.65 acres in the High
Residential District. These parcels are located in the area bounded by Church Street to the north,
Elm Avenue West to the west, Spruce Avenue to the east, and Town Center Drive to the south.
Land uses in the vicinity include residential uses to the north and commercial uses to the south,
east, and west. Because of their relative proximity to each other, these three parcels should be
developed as one cohesive project. The development potential of the three parcels could yield
313 dwelling units, developed at 27 dwelling units per acre under the City's Basic Development
Standards and 349 dwelling units, developed at 30 dwelling units per acre under the City's
Optional Development Standards. Development of those parcels utilizing the City's Affordable
Housing Incentives/Density Bonus Provisions could provide up to a 25 percent density bonus and
provide up to 436 dwelling units.

       could yield 163 dwelling units, developed at 27 dwelling units per acre under the City's Basic
       Development Standards and 181 dwelling units, developed at 30 dwelling units per acre under
       the City's Optional Development Standards. Development of those parcels utilizing the City's

       Demonstrating Suitability of Zone
       The RDA Implementation Plan identified a lack of sufficient affordable housing to meet the needs
       of the City's low- and moderate-income families and established a goal to increase, improve, and
       maintain the supply of affordable housing. Although the RDA has actively assisted with the

development and preservation of affordable housing, the ongoing need for additional housing
opportunities continues with the City's population growth. To meet this housing need the RDA
partnered with several non-profit housing corporations to provide a mixture of affordable
ownership and rental housing opportunities for income eligible households. As evidence of the
RDA's commitment to promote the availability and affordability of housing to meet the needs of
the community, the RDA has assisted with the production of over 2,400 affordable units.
The RDA continues to provide, improve, and maintain the City's supply of affordable/workforce
housing. This  is done by leveraging opportunities with local non-profits, county, State, and
Federal agencies, and exploring opportunities for the development of land-banked parcels. To
further increase the supply of affordable housing, the RDA will maintain contacts with apartment
complex owners to purchase additional affordability covenants or extend the term of affordability
for existing units. With the shortage of available land for residential development remaining in the
City due to the housing boom that occurred in 2000 to 2005, the Agency will also explore other
options to provide affordable family projects, including the purchase and rehabilitation of existing
homes or purchase of single vacant lots for in-fill development.
Examples of recently assisted affordable housing projects includes:
         Villaggio on Route 66 – The RDA assisted in the development of this 166-unit project,
          with 131 units held as affordable. The 10.5 acre 166-unit site developed at a density of
          15.75 dwelling units per acre. The RDA contributed $25.5 million towards the
          development of this $45.6 million dollar project.
         San Sevaine Villas – The RDA assisted in the development of this 225-unit project, with
          223 units held as affordable. The 12.87 acre 225-unit site developed at a density of
          17.25 dwelling units per acre. The RDA contributed $40.7 million towards the
          development of this $51 million dollar project.

The development of these affordable housing projects, and the regulatory concessions made,
demonstrate the City's practice of assisting in the development of affordable housing and the
suitability of available parcels. Considering the remaining RHNA balance, the availability of High
Residential District land, and the recent regulatory concessions, the 17.71 acres could be
developed at a density of 18.3 dwelling units per acre, similar to the density of recently approved
projects, thereby achieving the RHNA balance of 324 units.

       per acre. Other Mixed Use changes are also being considered, but at lower densities ranging
       from 14 to 27.75 dwelling units per acre. These four identified areas contain a total of 34.5 acres,
       which if developed at 30 units per acre could yield 1,035 dwelling units.
       The identified parcels are situated along Foothill Boulevard, and have access to commercial
       services, medical services, community facilities, and employment opportunities. Additionally,
       these parcels provide opportunities for pedestrian friendly development, with convenient access
       to transportation, both public and private. Additional discussions of these properties can be found
       in Chapter 2: Managing Land Use, Community Design, and Historic Resources section of the
       General Plan.

       Annexation Potential
       There are currently 6,054.48 acres of unincorporated territory within the City's Sphere-of-
       Influence. There is 1 application for the annexation of 690 acres currently being processed, along
       with the potential to annex 1,100 acres over the next 5-year planning period.
       The area is substantially vacant with a total of 21 existing units (4 in the City's Etiwanda North
       Specific Plan area and 17 in Section 14, the Snow Drop Road development area). Approximately
       558.41 acres are suitable for residential development under the City's General Plan Hillside
       Residential land use designation. Based on a density of 1.29 units per acre, this area could
       support approximately 720 new residential units; however, substantially more units could be
       allowed under the County's current development standards. Because of hillside characteristics
       and distance from existing development, infrastructure costs for the area are considered to be
       extremely high. Therefore, the area is not generally suitable for affordable housing, whether
       developed in the City or in the County.
       Financial Resources
       The ability of a City to provide affordable housing opportunities requires substantial public
       subsidies. The City of Rancho Cucamonga has access to a number of local, State, and Federal
       resources. The key funding sources are described below.
       Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside
       State law requires redevelopment agencies to set aside at least 20 percent of tax increment
       revenue for increasing and improving the community's supply of low- and moderate-income
       housing. Between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2013, approximately $99,834,227 will be generated
       by tax increment for affordable housing. However, the RDA tax increment has been pledged
       against several on-going projects, and therefore, there is currently little unobligated funding
       available.
       In July 1996, the RDA approved the sale of tax allocation bonds to provide permanent financing
       for two community based non-profit organizations National CORE and NHDC. On September 1,
       1996, Tax Allocation Bonds in the amount of $37.66 million were sold; proceeds of the bonds will
       be allocated in the following manner:
                                                                                                              
                                                                                         Housing Element 
HE‐70                              R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

        A pledge agreement through the year 2025 was signed with National CORE where $3.9
         million will be provided annually for debt services and project reserves. Beginning year in
         6 of the pledge agreement, if the provision of Redevelopment Law that allows for the
         acquisition of existing units with Housing Set-Aside funds has been extended beyond its
         current sunset, this $790,000 of the annual pledge will be deposited into a "Future
         Project Reserves" fund for use in acquiring additional apartment complexes within the
         Project Area. If a program is not developed, the funds will be available for any RDA
         housing program.
        A pledge agreement through the year 2025 was signed with NHDC where $1.5 million
         was paid to NHDC on June 30, 1996, and again on December 30, 1996. An additional
         $5 million in net bond proceeds were also paid to the NHDC. These bond proceeds will
         be used to complete a portion of the capital improvement plan for the Northtown
         neighborhood that includes continuing the development of infill housing on vacant lots,
         acquisition, and rehabilitation of existing absentee-owned housing. The annual pledge
         amount will be $1.4 million through the year 2025.
Community Development Block Grant
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds are provided by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and are based on a formula that considers census data,
extent of poverty, and age of the housing stock. Based upon these criteria, the CDBG program
allows local governments to utilize  Federal funds to alleviate poverty and blight. The CDBG
program provides funds for a wide range of community development activities, including the
acquisition and/or disposition of property, public facilities and improvements, relocation, housing
rehabilitation, homeownership assistance, and support to public services.
The City of Rancho Cucamonga receives approximately $1,000,000 annually. The City's CDBG
program provides funding for: 1) public improvements to lower income areas of the City, 2) the
Home Improvement Program, which provides loans up to $30,000 and grants up to $7,500 to
income eligible single-family and mobile home owners, 3) historic preservation, and 4) public
service groups, including fair housing services.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
Section 8 is rental assistance provided to a household which bridges the gap between 30 percent
of the household's gross monthly income and the fair market rent of a unit. Although this
longstanding, Federally funded program is not expected to increase in size or scope, it remains
an important affordable housing program by helping to balance a household's income and the
cost of housing. Within Rancho Cucamonga, Section 8 assistance is administered by the San
Bernardino County Housing Authority.
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) appropriated funds for the
redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes and residential properties. Grants under
HERA are considered CDBG funds and are implemented through the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program (NSP). NSP funding was determined by a formula that considered statewide factors
such as the number of loans that are: 1) in foreclosure, 2) subprime, 3) in default, and 4) 60 to 89
days delinquent, and then factored in local criteria such as 1) local foreclosure estimates, and
2) local vacancy rates. Based upon these criteria Rancho Cucamonga received a direct
allocation of $2,133,397 in NSP funds.
Rancho Cucamonga's NSP program provides two activities to address the high number of
foreclosed properties. This includes 1) an NSP Acquisition/Rehabilitation and Resale – First Time
Homebuyer Program where the City acquires foreclosed properties and resells them to eligible
families earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, and 2) an NSP Acquisition/Rehabilitation and
Reuse – Affordable Housing Program where the City acquires foreclosed properties and works
with local non-profit housing assistance groups to establish housing opportunities for families
earning less than 50 percent of the AMI.

       HOME Investment Partnerships Program
       The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), similar to CDBG, is a formula-based block
       grant program funded through HUD. HOME funds are provided to eligible state and local
       governments for the creation of affordable housing opportunities for low-income families. HOME
       funds must be spent only on housing, and are intended to provide incentives for the acquisition,
       construction, and rehabilitation of affordable rental and home ownership properties.
       Rancho Cucamonga participates in the HOME Consortium administered by the County of San
       Bernardino Department of Community Development and Housing; the current 3-year cooperation
       agreement runs until September 2011. Programs offered by the HOME Consortium include:
                HOME Homeownership Assistance Program (HAP): A silent trust deed program to assist
                 low-income persons to become homeowners.
                American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI): Provides downpayment assistance to
                 first-time home buyers.
                HOME Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) Program: Provides both a monthly rent
                 subsidy for very low-income special needs households and security deposit assistance to
                 households receiving a monthly rental subsidy.
                HOME Rental Property Acquisition and/or Rehabilitation Program: Provides a low
                 interest loan to acquire and/or rehabilitate existing rental property, which will then be
                 made available to qualifying tenants at affordable rents for a specified time.
                HOME Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) Program: Provides
                 funding for affordable housing which is developed, sponsored, or owned by non-profit
                 organizations certified as CHDO's.
                HOME Affordable Housing Development Loan (AHDL) Program: Provides gap financing
                 to qualified individuals and organizations for new construction, acquisition, and/or
                 rehabilitation of affordable housing.
       Administrative Resources
       The City of Rancho Cucamonga actively works with a number of nonprofit organizations to
       expand and preserve affordable housing in the City. The following nonprofit agencies are either
       actively providing or preserving affordable housing in the City or have expressed interest in
       working in San Bernardino County. These include:
                National CORE: National CORE, located in Rancho Cucamonga, is one of the largest
                 nonprofit affordable housing developers in Southern California.
                Northtown Housing Development Corporation: The purpose of the organization is to
                 establish, maintain, and operate housing units for low-income households in the
                 Northtown Neighborhood of Rancho Cucamonga.
                Workforce Homebuilders: Incorporated with the purpose of establishing, maintaining, and
                 operating housing units for lower-income households.
                LINC Housing: LINC Housing has built affordable homes throughout California and
                 provides housing for people underserved by the marketplace.
       Opportunities for Energy Conservation
       California Government Code §65583(a)(8) requires "[a]n analysis of opportunities for energy
       conservation with respect to residential development."
       Water Conservation
       In 1990, the City adopted a Xeriscape Ordinance and implemented guidelines as a means of
       improving water conservation efforts in multi-family residential, commercial, and industrial
       developments. The Development Code requires all developments to "design landscaping and
       irrigation to conserve water using the principals of Xeriscape." This is accomplished through the
       use of drought tolerant plant materials and low volume irrigation, such as drip and trickle irrigation
       systems.
       Single-family homes, except model homes, are exempt from these requirements, but the
                                                                                                              
                                                                                        Housing Element 
HE‐72                               R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

developer must provide educational materials about Xeriscape landscape techniques to potential
buyers. A reduction in water use and energy consumption should increasingly reflect positive
results through implementation of the Xeriscape Ordinance.
Building Code Title 24
The City's Building and Safety and Development Codes are in compliance with Title 24 of the
California Building Code. The California Energy Commission has established and adopted
energy improvement specifications for both single-family and multiple-family structures under four
stories. These specifications require both active and passive energy features for all residential
developments.
As of January 1, 1993, the requirement for 1.6-gallon flush toilets was added to previous Title 24
requirements, such as the installation of ceiling insulation. Rancho Cucamonga's Building and
Safety Department enforces State adopted Energy requirements for Climate Zone 10.
Alternative Energy
In addition to the State requirements, the City incorporated passive and active solar energy
requirements into the Development Code. Utilizing the City's optional development standards a
project may obtain a density increase at the higher end of the density range for energy
conservation design above the minimum requirement.
To qualify under the optional development standard the project must meet the following
requirements:
        New residential development shall be provided with an alternative energy system to
         provide domestic hot water for all dwelling units and for heating any swimming pool or
         spa. Solar energy shall be the primary energy system unless other alternative energy
         systems are demonstrated to be of equivalent capacity and efficiency.
        All appliances and fixtures shall be energy conserving (e.g., reduced consumption
         shower heads, water conserving toilets, etc.).
In addition, a solar access requirement is included. For example, the casting of shadows by
vegetation, structures, fixtures, or any other object shall be prohibited. The provisions encourage
the placement of residential structures to take advantage of shade and prevailing breezes. The
ideal orientation for most of the City places the long axis of the house just east of due south.
Solar energy is also a practical, cost efficient and environmentally sound way to heat and cool a
home. In Rancho Cucamonga, with its plentiful year-round sunshine, the potential uses of solar
energy are numerous. With proper building designs, this resource provides for cooling in the
summer and heating in the winter; it can also be utilized for heating domestic use, swimming
pools, and generating electricity.
The City supports the utilization of alternative energy sources as a means of providing for energy
efficiency. This can include building designs that consider natural lighting to significantly reduce
or eliminate dependence on interior lighting with the use of proper design and properly located
skylights. Finally, tree plantings when required in various residential areas, not only provide
beauty, but the trees are also recognized for their utility in providing shade, cooling, screening,
and air filtering.
These provisions encourage energy conservation in a context of flexibility and creativity in
residential building design. Because they tend to reduce the cost of monthly utility bills, they
contribute to the affordability of housing.
Green Development
As part of the General Plan Update, the City focused on Sustainable Development, Green
Buildings, Healthy Communities, Smart Growth, and Global Warming (AB 32). Throughout the
General Plan Update process, the City considered "How green do we want to be?" The Update
reviewed a broad range of green programs, both aggressive and non-aggressive from a variety of
cities. The Planning Commission and City Council will develop policies to address these
elements in the General Plan.

       Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant
       Rancho Cucamonga received an Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG)
       allocation through the U.S. Department of Energy. The stated purposes of the EECBG program
       are to assist eligible entities in creating and implementing strategies to reduce fossil fuel
       emissions, reduce the total energy use, and improve energy efficiency. As part of the City's
       Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (EECS) the City adopted two programs specifically
       designed to improve residential energy efficiency. These include a residential revolving loan
       program to encourage and fund energy saving projects for low income homeowners, providing
       funding to replace inefficient heaters, air conditioners, and water heaters, and a financial incentive
       program providing homeowners with a rebate for the installation of energy efficient appliances
       and other mechanical and electrical equipment.
       Housing Production Plan
       California Health and Safety Code §33413(b)(4) establishes that a Housing Production Plan
       (HPP) must be prepared to demonstrate how the RDA will meet State-mandated affordable
       housing requirements. The HPP focuses on housing production within the City's Redevelopment
       project area. The purpose of the HPP is to provide a strategy and time frame for meeting the
       minimum affordability needs of the City, as defined by the State. The HPP covers the time period
       from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2014; the current RDA Implementation Plan covers the five year
       time period from 2010 to 2014.
       Housing Production – Quantitative Requirements
       Residential Units Produced and Projected to be Developed
       During the lifetime of the RDA, 20,280 new housing units will be constructed within the
       redevelopment project area; the lifetime of the RDA extends through August 6, 2027.
       Approximately 18,957 housing units exist within the Redevelopment area; between 2008 and
       2014, another 206 units are projected.
       Production Units Required Within the Redevelopment Area
       Consistent with the requirement that 15 percent of new construction within a redevelopment area
       be affordable, a total of 3,042 low- and moderate-income units are required within the project area
       over the lifetime of the RDA. Of that total, 1,216 units (40 percent) shall be affordable to very low-
       income households (below 50 percent of the AMI) and 1,825 units (60 percent) shall be available
       to low- and moderate-income households (earning between 50 percent and 120 percent of the
       AMI).
       Under Health and Safety Code §33413(b)(1), redevelopment agencies must meet their affordable
       housing mandate in a timely manner. Performance will be monitored every five years. The next
       performance monitoring will occur in 2015, to coincide with updates to the RDA Implementation
       Plan.

       The RDA's affordability goal is 15 percent of the units constructed within the Redevelopment
       project area. State law identifies two different housing development scenarios with differing
       production requirements for each. The first (Health and Safety Code §33413(b)(1)) establishes
       that "at least 30 percent of all new and substantially rehabilitated dwelling units developed by an
       agency shall be … affordable" and the second (§33413(b)(2)(A)(i)) establishes that "at least 15
       percent of all new and substantially rehabilitated dwelling units developed by public or private
       entities … shall be … affordable". Typically, a redevelopment agency does not build units. The
       Rancho Cucamonga RDA does not plan to build units, so the 15 percent rule applies. The 15
       percent mandate can be illustrated as follows: for every 100 dwelling units developed or
       rehabilitated by entities other than the agency, 15 shall be affordable, with 6 available to persons
       of very low-income and 9 affordable to persons of low- or moderate-income.

Production Units Provided
As of January 1, 2010, a total of 2,424 restricted, affordable units have been provided to meet the
RDA's affordability obligation. Of these 2,424 units, 1,403 units are located within the
redevelopment project area. The RDA's affordability targets have been refined as a result of a
legal settlement between the RDA and the Western Center for Law and Poverty; State
requirements are less restrictive than the settlement targets. State income guidelines define
persons of low- and moderate-income as at or below 120 percent of the AMI, while the RDA's
settlement targets those at or below 90 percent of the AMI.
State categories are divided into "Very Low" (below 50 of the AMI), "Low" (50 percent-80 percent
of the AMI), "Moderate" (80 percent-120 percent of the AMI), and "Above Moderate" (above
120 percent of the AMI). State affordability targets include "Very Low," "Low," and "Moderate"
income levels. The settlement agreement with the Western Center for Law and Poverty, adjusted
for family size, are as follows: "Level I" (below 35 percent of the AMI), "Level II" (36 percent-
45 percent of the AMI), "Level III" (46 percent-60 percent of the AMI), and "Level IV" (61 percent-
90 percent of the AMI). If the RDA allocates resources to 100 units of housing, 17 must be for
Level I households, 34 for Level II households, 34 for Level III households, and 17 for Level IV
households.

RDA Funding Resources
Between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2014, approximately $99.8 million dollars will be generated
by tax increment funds for affordable housing development; however, the majority of these funds
are already committed towards bond debt and other projects currently under construction. When
additional funding is available it can assist in the production of restricted, affordable housing units.
  Consistent with the Implementation Plan, the RDA in combination with other public and private

       RDA Land Bank Resources
       As of January 1, 2010, the RDA had obtained 26.81 acres of residential land bank resources.
       Consistent with the General Plan Land Use Map and Zoning Ordinance, up to 249 affordable
       units could be located on these land bank sites.
       Redevelopment Area Vacant Land Resources
       The following tables list the vacant land resources available within the redevelopment area. The
       City's residential land use designations set a possible range of density development for each
       residential category. Within the redevelopment area, there are 48.13 acres of vacant land zoned
       for residential use for which no tract approvals exist or are pending. At 62.5 percent of the range,
       this acreage could yield 688 units (Table HE-56). Therefore, with redevelopment area vacant
       land resources, including RDA land bank resources, there is sufficient land to meet the estimated
       RDA lifetime production requirement of 3,042 affordable units.

       Legal Requirements
       State Mandates
       The RDA has adopted a number of policies and programs required by State law. Following is a
       review of State requirements and the RDA's programs to comply with State mandates. In most
       cases these are existing programs. In a few instances new programs are recommended in this
       HPP. Programs A through E below are designed to comply with State mandates. Program
       specific implementation measures are included under the Housing Plan section of this Housing
       Element.
       The California Community Redevelopment Law and California Health and Safety Code §33000,
       et seq., provides that one of the fundamental purposes of redevelopment is to increase and
       improve the community's supply of low- and moderate-income housing. This is accomplished in
       part through three different but interrelated requirements imposed on a redevelopment agency.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                          Housing Element 
HE‐80                                 R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

These three requirements provide for the production, improvement, and preservation of housing
for low- and moderate-income households. These Health and Safety Code requirements are
established by the following:
        20 Percent Set-Aside (§33334.2(a)): "Not less than 20 percent of all taxes that are
         allocated to the agency … shall be used by the agency for the purposes of increasing,
         improving, and preserving the community's supply of low- and moderate-income housing
         available at affordable housing cost";
        Replacement Rule (§33413(a)): "Whenever dwelling units housing persons and families
         of low or moderate income are destroyed or removed from the low- and moderate-
         income housing market as part of a redevelopment project … the agency shall, within
         four years of the destruction or removal, rehabilitate, develop, or construct, or cause to
         be rehabilitated, developed, or constructed, for rental or sale to persons and families of
         low or moderate income, an equal number of replacement dwelling units that have an
         equal or greater number of bedrooms as those destroyed or removed units at affordable
         housing costs within the territorial jurisdiction of the agency"; and
        Mandated Production Rule (§33413(b)): "At least 30 percent of all new and
         substantially rehabilitated dwelling units developed by an agency shall be available at
         affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families of low or moderate
         income."
Health and Safety Code §33413(b)(4) requires that each redevelopment agency adopt a plan to
comply with the requirements of the Mandated Production Rule. In addition, §33413.5 and
§33334.5 require replacement-housing plans for compliance with the Replacement Rule.
Housing Replacement Rule
Health and Safety Code §33413(a) requires that whenever dwelling units housing persons and
families of low- or moderate-income are destroyed or removed from the low- and moderate-
income housing market as part of a redevelopment project subject to a written agreement with a
redevelopment agency, the RDA shall, within 4 years of the removal of the dwelling units, cause
to be developed an equal number of replacement dwelling units. When dwelling units are
destroyed or removed on or after January 1, 2002, 100 percent of the replacement dwelling units
shall be available at affordable housing cost to persons in the same or a lower income category
(low, very low, or moderate), as the persons displaced from those destroyed or removed units.
Replacement Policy
The RDA shall replace housing units removed or demolished as a result of an RDA project as
required by law.
Implementation
No units under the definition of §33413(a) were removed prior to September 1, 1989. Further, no
affordable units under the aforementioned section have been removed prior to January 1, 2010.
Housing Replacement Requirement
Health and Safety Code §33413.5 requires each redevelopment agency to adopt by resolution, a
"replacement housing plan indicating how the agency will comply with the requirements of the
replacement rule as provided for in §33413(a). The replacement housing plan shall include: (1)
the general location of housing to be rehabilitated, developed, or constructed (2) an adequate
means of financing such rehabilitation, development, or construction, (3) a finding that the
replacement housing does not require the approval of the voters pursuant to Article XXXIV of the
California Constitution, or that such approval has been obtained, (4) the number of dwelling units
housing persons and families of low or moderate income planned for construction or
rehabilitation, and (5) the timetable for meeting the plan's relocation, rehabilitation, and
replacement housing objectives."
Health and Safety Code §33334.5 requires that "[e]very redevelopment plan adopted or amended
to expand the project area after January 1, 1977, shall contain a provision that whenever dwelling
units housing persons and families of low or moderate income are destroyed or removed from the
low- and moderate-income housing market as part of a redevelopment project, the agency shall,
within four years of such destruction or removal, rehabilitate, develop, or construct, or cause to be

       rehabilitated, developed, or constructed, for rental or sale to persons and families of low or
       moderate income an equal number of replacement dwelling units at affordable housing costs, as
       defined by §50052.5, within the project area or within the territorial jurisdiction of the agency, in
       accordance with all of the provisions of Sections 33413 and 33413.5." Irrespective of the
       January 1, 1977, implementation date expressed in §33334.5, §33413(d) imposes the
       Replacement and Production Rules on any Redevelopment Plan adopted on or after
       January 1, 1976.
       The City of Rancho Cucamonga's Redevelopment Plan was adopted on December 23, 1981. An
       amendment to the RDA approved August 6, 1987, did not change the area of the RDA's
       boundary, but did extend the term of the RDA; the 40-year term of the RDA ends in 2027.
       Replacement Requirement
       The RDA shall meet the Replacement Requirement under the Health and Safety Code (§33413),
       consistent with the agency replacement policy adopted December 23, 1981.
       Implementation
       Not less than 30 days prior to the execution of an agreement to remove or demolish any
       affordable housing unit, or units, the RDA shall prepare a Housing Replacement Plan. This plan
       shall include housing replacement guidelines to meet the requirement under Health and Safety
       Code §33413, and as stated in Section 402 of the RDA's Articles of Incorporation. As further
       stated in Section 402, a dwelling unit whose replacement is required by §33413, but for which no
       Replacement Housing Plan has been prepared, shall not be removed from the low- and
       moderate-income housing market.
       The RDA does not anticipate that any low or moderate income housing units will be removed as a
       result of projects or programs proposed in the Implementation Plan. If, however, some
       unforeseen activity does require removal of units, the RDA will comply with Health and Safety
       Code §33413.5, which requires that the Agency adopt a replacement housing plan 30 days prior
       to entering into any agreement which results in the destruction of units affordable to low and
       moderate income families. Additionally, there are no prior replacement housing obligations that
       the RDA is required to address as part of past Agency projects (Implementation Plan, page 63).
       As of January 1, 2010, the RDA has not removed any units under the Housing Replacement
       Requirement.
       Term Length of Affordability
       Health and Safety Code §33413(c) requires that replacement and production units shall remain
       available at affordable housing costs to the income levels indicated for the longest feasible time,
       but not less than 55 years for rental units, 45 years for home ownership units, and 15 years for
       mutual self-help housing units which includes, but is not limited to, unlimited duration.
       Health and Safety Code §33334.3(f) states that when housing units are developed or assisted
       with money from the RDA's 20 Percent Affordable Housing Set-Aside Fund, the RDA shall require
       that those housing units remain affordable for the longest feasible time, but for not less than 55
       years for rental units, 45 years for owner occupied units, or 15 years for mutual self-help units.
       Health and Safety Code §33334.13 requires that very low-income and lower-income units
       developed with assistance from a homeownership residential mortgage revenue bond program or
       a California Housing Finance Agency home financing program shall remain available at affordable
       housing cost for at least 30 years. Finally, Government Code §659159(c)(1) states that lower
       income units provided pursuant to a density bonus shall remain affordable for 30 years. The
       Implementation Plan states that "any units assisted by the RDA remain affordable for the longest
       period allowed by law".
       Length of Affordability Policy
       Very low-income, low-income, and moderate-income units developed pursuant to the previously
       mentioned affordability sections of the California Government Code shall remain affordable for the
       longest feasible period of time, up to and including the useful economic life of the project, with a
       minimum term of at least 30 years.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                          Housing Element

Implementation
Length of affordability shall be negotiated on a project-by-project basis for the longest feasible
period of time, up to and including the useful economic life of the project with a minimum term of
at least 30 years.
Low-Income Housing Production Rule
Health and Safety Code §33413(b)(1) requires that "at least 30 percent of all new and
substantially rehabilitated dwelling units developed by an agency shall be available at affordable
housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families of low or moderate income," and not less
than 50 percent of the affordable dwelling units required to be available to, and occupied by,
persons of low or moderate income shall be available at affordable housing cost to, and occupied
by, very low income households.
Section 33413(b)(2) requires that "at least 15 percent of all new and substantially rehabilitated
dwelling units developed within a project area under the jurisdiction of an agency by public or
private entities or persons other than the agency [but including those developed pursuant to a
written agreement with the RDA] shall be available at affordable housing cost to, and occupied
by, persons and families of low or moderate income," and not less than 40 percent of the
affordable dwelling units required to be available to, and occupied by, persons of low or moderate
income shall be available at affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, very low income
households.
Housing Production Plan Affordability Schedule
The RDA and the City of Rancho Cucamonga shall complete a schedule for housing production
that will meet the Production Requirement of §33413(b)(1) and (2) of the Health and Safety Code.
  This requirement shall be met within the legal boundaries of the RDA.
Implementation
This HPP shall establish a five-year schedule for meeting the State-mandated Housing
Production Requirements.
Housing Production Plan Requirement
Health and Safety Code §33413(b)(4) requires "[e]ach redevelopment agency, as part of the
implementation plan … shall adopt a plan to comply with the requirements of this subdivision [the
Mandated Production Rule]. The plan shall be consistent with, and may be included within, the
communities Housing Element. The plan shall be reviewed, and if necessary, amended at least
every five years in conjunction with either the housing element cycle or the plan implementation
cycle."
The Plan shall include estimates of the number of new or rehabilitated residential units to be
developed within the Project Area and the number of units for very low, low, and moderate
income households which will be developed in order to meet the requirements of the Mandated
Production Rule, paragraph (b)(2), for units developed by entities other than the agency. The
Plan shall also include estimates of the number of agency-developed residential units which will
be developed during the next five years, if any, and the number of units for very low, low-, and
moderate-income households which will be developed during the same period of time to meet the
requirements of paragraph (b)(1) for units developed by the RDA.
Section 33413(b)(2) requires that "at least 15 percent of all new and substantially rehabilitated
dwelling units developed within a project area under the jurisdiction of an agency by public or
private entities or persons other than the agency [but including those developed pursuant to a
written agreement with the RDA] shall be available at affordable housing cost to, and occupied
by, persons and families of low or moderate income," and not less than 40 percent of the
affordable dwelling units required to be available to, and occupied by, persons of low or moderate
income shall be available at affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, very low income
households.
Housing Production Plan Requirement
The RDA and the City of Rancho Cucamonga shall meet the requirements of §33413(b)(4).

       Implementation
       Through completion of this HPP and any necessary amendments of the City's Housing Element,
       the RDA shall provide a plan to meet Production Housing Requirements.
       Consistency Requirements
       Housing Element of the General Plan
       The HPP builds on the goal, objectives, and policies identified in the 2010 update to the Housing
       Element. Goal HE-2 of the Housing Plan states:
                Provide housing opportunities that meet the needs of all economic segments of
                the community including very low, low-, and moderate-income households and
                special needs groups.
       Programs include Residential Mortgage Revenue Bonds, density bonus programs, SCAG's
       RHNA goals, HUD's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy goals, Mobile Home Park
       voluntary rent stabilization, and the RDA's 20 Percent Set-Aside Fund (consistent with provisions
       of the Western Center for Law & Poverty Agreement).
       Units At-Risk Study
       The HPP supports programs identified in the Units-At-Risk analysis. In particular, the RDA shall
       work with Property Owners, Financial Institutions, Public Agencies, and Non-profit Housing
       Development Corporations to retain the availability of units currently restricted to low- and
       moderate-income households, with special emphasis on those units that are within the RDA
       project area.
       Implementation Plan
       The HPP shall be consistent with the RDA's Implementation Plan relative to issues relating to
       affordable housing. The Implementation Plan supports by providing, preserving, and promoting
       decent and sanitary housing affordable to low and moderate-income families. This can be
       accomplished through the following general affordable housing objectives:
               Granting a density bonus to leverage the affordability of new units.
               Establish the term of affordability as the useful economic life of the affordable housing
                units with a minimum term of at least 30 years.
               Units affordable to low-income owners and renters shall be scattered throughout the City.
               Multiple family projects that include affordable units shall be located within appropriately
                zoned areas of the City.
               All affordable units shall be of comparable quality, design, and appearance to market rate
                housing.
               Encourage mixed income and Mixed-Use projects.
               Encourage a variety of housing types and tenure including garden apartments, town
                home apartments, and condominiums, as well as limited equity cooperative ownership.
               Housing assisted by the RDA shall comply with Article 34 of the California Constitution.
                No more than 49 percent of the units, in a rental housing project developed by the RDA
                for households at 80 percent of the median or less, shall be assisted units.
               All residential development, including affordable units, shall be consistent with the
                General Plan.
               All units meeting State-mandated housing production requirements or affordable housing
                goals shall utilize the latest MSA median income published by HUD.
       Western Center for Law and Poverty Settlement
       In compliance with the Western Center for Law and Poverty legal settlement, the RDA's
       resources shall be allocated as directed by the settlement. The income levels, adjusted for family
       size, are as follows:
            Level I:      Families earning less than 35 percent of the AMI.
            Level II:     Families earning less than 36 percent and 45 percent of the AMI.
            Level III:    Families earning less than 46 percent and 60 percent of the AMI.
            Level IV:     Families earning less than 61 percent and 90 percent of the AMI.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                         Housing Element 
HE‐84                              R A N C H O   C U C A M O N G A   G E N E R A L   P L A N  

The settlement further requires that not less than 50 percent of the units assisted by the RDA
must be available for very low income households, of which one-third must be available to Level I
families.
The allocation for each income level is as follows:
        At least one-sixth for households with incomes not more than 35 percent of the AMI.
        One-third for households with income not more than 45 percent of the AMI.
        One-half for remainder (divided one-third for incomes between 46 percent and 60 percent
         of the AMI and one-sixth for incomes between 61 percent and 90 percent of the AMI).
In other words, if the redevelopment agency allocates resources to 100 units of housing, 17 must
be for households with incomes below 35 percent of the median income; 34 for households with
income between 36 percent and 45 percent of median income; 34 for households with income
between 46 percent and 60 percent of median income, and 17 for households earning between
61 percent and 90 percent of the median income.
California Constitution: Article 34 – Public Housing Project Law
Article XXXIV of the California Constitution states, "[n]o low rent housing project shall hereafter be
developed, constructed, or acquired in any manner by any state public body until, a majority of
the qualified electors of the city … in which it is proposed … voting on such issue, approve such
project by voting in favor thereof." And that "the term 'low rent housing project' shall mean any
development composed of urban or rural dwellings, apartments or other living accommodations
for persons of low income".
If the majority of the units in a multi-family development are market rate, the project is considered
to be a market-rate project. However, in the actual development of affordable housing projects up
to 100 percent of the units within the project are restricted, and affordable units are available to
persons earning 80 percent or less of the AMI. Consistent with the City's General Plan, the RDA
shall observe the scattered sites policy for assisted affordable owner programs.

Housing Plan
The previous sections of this Housing Element provided an assessment of the City's housing needs, an assessment of
constraints to the development of housing, and an inventory of housing resources. This section establishes the City of
Rancho Cucamonga's strategy for addressing the housing needs and mitigating constraints with available resources.
Housing Goals and Policies
Overarching Housing Element Goal: Provide opportunities and incentives for the provision of a variety of housing types
for all economic segments wishing to reside in the community regardless of race, religion, sex, or income group.
Adequate Housing Sites
GOAL HE-1: Allow and create new opportunities that enable a broad range of housing
                  types, maintain a balanced supply of ownership and rental units, and
                  provide sufficient numbers of dwelling units to accommodate expected
                  new household formations.
          Objective HE-1.1:         Ensure a wide range of housing alternatives and enable the City to achieve its
                                    share of the RHNA through the utilization of land use distribution and
                                    development standards to encourage a mix of housing types, including
                                    mobile homes and apartments, within a variety of price ranges.
            Policy HE-1.1.1:        Provide opportunities for a variety of housing types through implementation of the
                                    Land Use Plan, Development District Map, and Community Plans.
            Policy HE-1.1.2:        Review and amend provisions of the Development Code pertaining to mobile
                                    homes to allow manufactured homes in all residential districts.
            Policy HE-1.1.3:        Discourage the conversion of existing mobile home parks to other uses.
            Policy HE-1.1.4:        Maintain and administer a condominium conversion ordinance.
Program HE-1: Inventory of Residential Sites
The City will maintain an inventory of vacant residentially zoned sites to accommodate the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation of 1,282 units. Specifically, the City has already achieved 2,509 units since January 1, 2006, of which 958
units are credited towards the RHNA, leaving a remaining RHNA balance of 324 units. The City will ensure an
adequate supply of vacant sites at appropriate densities and development standards to accommodate the remaining
RHNA.
     Funding Source:          General Fund
     Responsible Agency: Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Monitor the sites inventory annually to assess the City's continued ability to facilitate a range of residential
             housing types.
          • Provide an inventory of vacant residentially zoned properties to interested affordable housing developers
             after adoption of the Housing Element. Annually update the listing to promote the continued availability
             and marketability of the identified properties.

Government Code §65852.3(a) specifies that local governments cannot exclude permanently sited manufactured
homes from lots zoned for single-family dwellings (unless manufactured housing is more than 10 years old). A city
may not require an administrative permit, planning or development process, or other requirement that is not imposed
on a conventional single-family dwelling in the same zone. The Development Code defines mobile home units, and
permits mobile homes on all lots zoned for single- family residential, except within the Very Low Residential District, but
does not address manufactured housing. To comply with State law and ensure that such uses further community
expectations for quality, the City will amend its Development Code to bring current codes up to date.
     Funding Source:             General Fund
     Responsible Agency: Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Amend the Development Code within twelve months of adopting the Housing Element to define
              manufactured housing and mobile homes consistent with State law and specify the zone, or zones, where
              such housing can be permitted.
          • Prepare design guidelines for mobile homes and manufactured housing to ensure quality development.
Program HE-3: Mobile Home Park Conservation
This program discourages the conversion of existing mobile home parks to other uses, consistent with Government
Code §65863.7, in order to maintain a valuable source of affordable housing. Mobile home parks are permitted in all
residential districts, subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit. Eight mobile home parks are located in the City
providing 1,380 mobile home units. Although the City has not enacted a Mobile Home Conversion Ordinance, the City
promotes the conservation of Mobile Home Parks.
     Funding Source:             General Fund
     Responsible Agency: Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Continue to encourage the conservation of mobile home parks and discourage the conversion of mobile
              home parks to other uses in order to maintain a valuable source of affordable housing.
          • Continue to promote the conservation of mobile home parks through implementation of the Mobile Home
              Accord (Program HE-9) that serves as a rent stabilization agreement between the City and mobile home
              park owners, implementation of the Mobile Home Rental Assistance Program (Program HE-10) that
              provides a monthly rental subsidy to low income mobile home households, and through the Building and
              Safety Departments enforcement of Title 24 as it applies to mobile homes to ensure mobile homes meet
              applicable building code requirements.
Program HE-4: Condominium Conversion
Multi-family units make up approximately 32 percent of the housing stock; consequently, the City has a somewhat
limited supply of apartment rentals. As a means of preserving the City's rental housing stock, the Condominium
Conversion Ordinance regulates the conversion of apartments to condominiums, but establishes a maximum annual
limit, defined as no more than one-half the number of multi-family rental dwellings added to the City's housing stock
during the preceding year, for the number of multi-family rental units that may be converted to ownership type.
     Funding Source:             CDBG
     Responsible Agency: Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Ensure compliance with the City's Condominium Conversion Ordinance.
          • Annually monitor the rate of conversion to determine if modifications to the ordinance are needed to
              maintain a healthy rental housing market.
Program HE-5: Mixed Use District
As part of the General Plan update the City designated additional properties within the Mixed Use District along Foothill
Boulevard, the City's major east-west corridor. These Mixed Use land use designations became effective with the May
19, 2010 adoption of the Rancho Cucamonga General Plan Update. These areas will provide opportunities for
additional residential development at densities up to 30 dwelling units per acre and have access to commercial
services, medical services, community facilities, and employment opportunities. Additionally, these parcels provide
opportunities for pedestrian friendly development, with convenient access to transportation, both public and private.

   Timeframe and Objectives:
       • Utilize the Mixed Use District to provide development standards ranging from 14 to 30 dwelling units per
          acre.
       • Amend the Development Code within eighteen months of adoption of the General Plan to establish the
          land use districts and development standards for the new Mixed Use Districts along Foothill Boulevard.
          The Development Code amendment will occur earlier should an application to develop one of the Mixed
          Use District sites be submitted.
       • Utilize appropriate development standards to achieve 30 units per acre on the four identified Mixed Use
          District properties, potentially achieving 1,035 dwelling units on 34.5 acres of land.
       • Utilization and development of these Mixed Use sites can occur through the implementation of Program
          HE-11 (Housing Production Plan (HPP)) as all four parcels are within the project area. Program HE-11
          focuses on the development of affordable housing units within the redevelopment project area.

Neighborhood Stabilization Program. Rancho Cucamonga is a direct recipient of NSP funds and received $2,133,397
to address foreclosure issues within the City. The City's NSP program operates two activities 1) an
Acquisition/Rehabilitation and Resale – First Time Homebuyer Program where acquired properties will be available to
households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, and 2) an Acquisition/Rehabilitation and Reuse – Affordable Housing
Program where acquired properties will be available to households earning below 50 percent of the AMI. These
programs are available in selected census tracts experiencing a high foreclosure risk.

Program HE-8: Section 8
The HUD funded Section 8 program is administered by the Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino
(HACSB). HACSB provides rent subsidies to very low income households and elderly households who spend greater
than 50 percent of their income on rent, live in substandard housing, or have been displaced. The subsidies represent
the difference between 30 percent of the monthly income and housing payment standards established by HUD.
Housing vouchers are utilized by many extremely low income households in Rancho Cucamonga. The City will work
with the HACSB to market the Section 8 program and improve its overall effectiveness.
    Funding Source:           HUD Section 8 Funds
    Responsible Agency: Planning Department/HACSB
    Timeframe and Objectives:
         • Promote the use of Section 8 by making program information available at the public counter and

        •    Continue to identify and purchase, or facilitate purchase, of existing multi-family projects that become
             available for sale. On a case-by-case basis, the RDA shall lease, purchase, or by other means secure
             affordability restrictions for individual units within existing and new construction multi-family units to
             increase the supply of restricted, affordable units. Consistent with the Implementation Plan policy, 40
             percent of the units shall be affordable to low and moderate income renters.
        •    Enter into discussion with property owners regarding acquisition and/or conservation of the 190 units-at-
             risk located within the redevelopment project area.
        •    Investigate the feasibility of establishing an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone and/or a Mixed Use Overlay
             Zone to facilitate the development of affordable housing.
        •    Utilize a variety of financial mechanisms to assist the development of affordable housing units including,
             but not limited to: loan write-down, mortgage revenue bonds, State tax credits, on-site improvement costs,
             off-site improvement costs, City fee waiver, and as well as a school fee waiver for Senior Housing.
Program HE-12: Preservation of At-Risk Units
Five publicly assisted housing projects with a total of 265 units may be at-risk of losing rent subsidies or converting to
market rate within the planning period of this Housing Element. Specifically, many households residing in publicly
assisted housing are extremely low income households with limited housing opportunities elsewhere. To meet the
needs of lower income households, the City must plan against the loss of existing affordable housing units.
    Funding Source:             RDA Set Aside
    Responsible Agency: RDA
    Timeframe and Objectives:
        • Continue to keep in contact with the owners of projects with units due to convert to market rate to
             determine the status of projects with respect to the expiration of regulatory agreements.
        • Continue to contact the owners of all units at risk and discussed options for retaining restricted affordable
             units.
        • Work with private non-profit agencies interested in purchasing and/or managing units at-risk, including but
             not limited to 501(c)(3) Housing Development Corporations. On a case-by-case basis, provide technical
             assistance to these organizations with respect to organization and financing.
        • On a case-by-case basis as opportunities arise, enter into agreements with property owners to preserve
             existing affordable housing units.
        • Purchase, or assist in the purchase, of projects that include units at-risk, as funds are available.

Program HE-16: Mills Act Contracts
The Mills Act, under State law, enables the owner of a "qualified historic property," to enter into an agreement with the
City to preserve, rehabilitate, and maintain the historic property in return for a reduction in property taxes under the
Revenue and Taxation Code Section 439. The money saved from the reduced property tax will be available to
maintain and restore the historic property, thereby benefiting the owner as well as the community.
    Funding Source:            General Fund
    Responsible Agency: Planning Department
    Timeframe and Objectives:
         • Monitor existing Mills Act contracts and promote the program to assist in the preservation of historic
             resources.
Program HE-17: Code Enforcement
The Building and Safety Department Code Enforcement Division has initiated proactive neighborhood conservation
programs focusing on specific neighborhoods which, though sound, are beginning to show signs of deterioration.
Programs include community education, neighborhood cleanups, yard maintenance, and abandoned vehicle
abatement. Focus neighborhoods are often low-income neighborhoods eligible for CDBG funding.
    Funding Source:            General Fund
    Responsible Agency: Building and Safety Department
    Timeframe and Objectives:
         • Continue to support the bi-annual neighborhood cleanup events within the focus neighborhoods assisting
             approximately 200 households.

    Responsible Agency: Public Works Services Department
    Timeframe and Objectives:
         • Continue to provide graffiti removal services to the residents of LMA eligible Census Tract Block Groups
             within the City.
Remove Constraints
GOAL HE-5: Where possible, eliminate governmental constraints.
         Objective HE-5.1:          Promote efforts to reduce procedural delays, provide information early in the
                                    development process regarding development costs, and charge only those
                                    fees necessary to adequately carry out needed public services and
                                    improvements.
           Policy HE-5.1.1:         Periodically review and update the City's fee schedule and the methodology on
                                    which the fees are based in order to determine the necessary costs for providing
                                    adequate public services and public improvements to ensure the continued health,
                                    safety, and welfare of the community.
           Policy HE-5.1.2:         Continue to facilitate the development review process through multiple techniques,
                                    including staff assistance, public information, articles in the City's newsletter,
                                    informal meetings with applicants, Preliminary Review applications to address
                                    technical issues, and Pre-Application Review to address policy issues.
           Policy HE-5.1.3:         Continue to evaluate and adjust as appropriate residential development standards,
                                    regulations, and processing procedures that are determined to constrain housing

                                      development, particularly housing opportunities for lower and moderate income
                                      households and for persons with special needs.
Program HE-19: Housing for Persons with Special Needs
The City of Rancho Cucamonga recognizes the need for a wide range of housing options to meet the varied needs of
all segments of the community, including seniors, persons with disabilities, female-headed households, large
households, homeless, students, and farmworkers. To encourage and facilitate the development of housing for
persons with special needs, the City will amend the Development Code to address the following:
        • Residential Care Facilities: Revise the definition of Residential Care Facilities to distinguish between
             board and care homes, sober living facilities, and housing for homeless people, and specify the permitting
             process, where such uses are permitted, and regulations to exercise appropriate review within the
             parameters of State law.
        • Emergency Shelters: Permit Emergency Shelter uses in the General Commercial (GC) District, as well
             as establish procedures and development standards (i.e., maximum number of beds, provisions for onsite
             management, length of stay, off-street parking based on demonstrated need, proximity of other shelters,
             and security) to facilitate the creation of emergency shelters.
        • Transitional Housing: Permit transitional housing facilities serving six or fewer clients by right in all
             residential districts. Differentiate transitional housing provided as group quarters versus transitional
             housing provided as multi-family housing developments. Where transitional housing facilities operate as
             group quarters assisting up to six residents, such uses will be permitted as residential care facilities, and
             where transitional housing facilities operate as multi-family housing developments, such uses will be
             permitted where multi-family housing is permitted.
        • Supportive Housing: Permit supportive housing facilities serving six or fewer residents by right in all
             residential districts. Differentiate supportive housing in the form of group quarters versus multi-family
             housing developments. Where supportive housing facilities operate as group quarters assisting up to six
             residents, such uses will be permitted as residential care facilities, and where supportive housing facilities
             operate as multi-family housing developments, such uses will be permitted where multi-family housing is
             permitted.
        • Single-Room Occupancy: Permit SRO units in the Medium (M) Residential District, Medium-High (MH)
             Residential District, High (H) Residential District, and Mixed Use (MU) Districts as a use in conjunction
             with other multi-family housing or mixed use developments. Conditions of approval for SRO units will
             relate to the performance characteristics of a proposed facility, such as parking, security, management,
             availability of public transportation, and access to commercial land uses.
     Funding Source:           General Fund and CDBG
     Responsible Agency: Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
        • Continue to fund a wide variety of nonprofit organizations providing services for homeless people, and
             those at risk of homelessness, through the Consolidated Plan process.
        • Amend the Development Code within twelve months of adopting the Housing Element to address special
             needs housing.
        • Amend the Development Code to permit emergency shelters "by-right" (without a Conditional Use Permit
             (CUP) or other discretionary approval) in the General Commercial (GC) District subject to the same
             development standards as other uses in the same zone and provide management and operation allowed
             by SB 2.
        • Amend the Development Code to permit SRO units "by-right" (without a CUP or other discretionary
             approval) in the Medium (M) Residential, Medium-High (MH) Residential, High (H) Residential , and Mixed
             Use (MU) land use districts subject to the same development standards as other uses in the same zone
             and provide management and operation allowed by SB 2.
        • Amend the Development Code to permit transitional and permanent supportive housing as a residential
             use in all residential land use districts and treat such uses in the same manner as residential uses in the
             same land use district.
        • Create development standards for emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, SRO,
             extremely low income households, large households, and other similar types of housing.

Program HE-20: Regulatory Incentives
The City approves General Plan Amendments, Development Code Amendments, Conditional Use Permits, Variances,
Minor Exceptions, and Density Bonuses where appropriate to facilitate quality housing that furthers City goals.
     Funding Source:             General Fund
     Responsible Agency: Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Continue to approve General Plan Amendments, Development Code Amendments, Conditional Use
               Permits, Variances, Minor Exceptions, and Density Bonuses as appropriate while balancing the goal of
               preserving established residential neighborhoods.
Program HE-21: Financial Incentives
The City encourages and facilitates the construction of affordable senior and family housing projects. Financial
assistance has included multiple-family revenue bonds, housing grants, low interest loans, and reductions in
development impact fees where feasible. Housing developers have utilized these financial incentives to leverage and
obtain funding sources, such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Taken together, the combination of public and
private financing sources allows developers to secure lower interest rate loans. The City will continue to offer financial
incentives for housing projects that address unmet needs in the community and seek creative means to further
increase funding for housing.
     Funding Source:             RDA Set-Aside/private financing
     Responsible Agency: RDA
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Offer RDA housing set-aside funds and grants to make feasible the construction of affordable housing
               projects that address the City's housing needs.
          • Seek opportunities to leverage housing resources with those of for-profit groups, developers, and nonprofit
               groups in the community.
          • Prioritize RDA funds for projects that include components for extremely low income households and large
               households.
Program HE-22: Permit Processing
Delays in the development review process, such as plan checking and permit processing, may increase the holding
cost of development. Complicated review procedures may also discourage development, especially by affordable
housing and special needs housing developers. To facilitate residential development, the City provides development
Pre-Application Review and Preliminary Review procedures to simplify and expedite development processing.
     Funding Source:             General Fund
     Responsible Agency: Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Continue to evaluate and improve the permit processing procedures to facilitate residential development.
          • Within twelve months of the adoption of the Housing Element, revise the development review process to
               establish fast-tracking procedures for those residential development projects that include housing for large
               households and lower income households, especially extremely low income households.
Program HE-23: Development Fees
The City charges various fees and assessments to cover the cost of processing permits and provide services and
facilities to the project. These fees contribute to the cost of housing and are ultimately passed on from the housing
developer to the consumer. The City may utilize RDA or other funds to offset the fees associated with the development
of affordable and special needs housing.
     Funding Source:             RDA Housing Set-Aside, HOME, CDBG
     Responsible Agencies:           RDA and Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Continue to use Housing Set-Aside and other available funds to help offset fees for affordable and special
               needs housing.
          • Pursue the availability of additional funds for infrastructure improvements needed to support affordable
               and special needs housing.

          •   Pursue the establishment of development fee waivers and development fee deferrals for those residential
              development projects that include housing for large households and lower income households, especially
              extremely low income households.
Program HE-24: Analyze Development Fees on the Supply and Affordability of Housing
The City will analyze the impacts of increased development fees on the supply and affordability of housing and commit
to biennial monitoring. As part of the outreach, the City will work with both for- and non-profit developers, and in
particular, will consider the cumulative costs of increased fees from the 2004 Fee Study given the costs associated with
optional development standards required to achieve maximum densities on properties within the High (H) Residential
District. Based on the results of this analysis, staff will recommend to the City Council actions necessary to mitigate
any identified constraints including allowing payment of fees upon certificate of occupancy, rather than prior to building
permit issuance to reduce developer construction financing costs and overall development costs for housing affordable
to lower-income households.
     Funding Source:            General Fund
     Responsible Agencies:           Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Within twelve months of the adoption of the Housing Element, analyze the impacts of increased
              development fees on the supply and affordability of housing and commit to biennial monitoring.
          • Promote the financial feasibility of development affordable to lower income households.
Equal Housing Opportunity
GOAL HE-6: Promote equal housing opportunities for all economic segments of the
                   community regardless of race, sex, or religion.
          Objective HE-6.1:           Pursue programs that will reduce the incidence of housing discrimination
                                      within the City.
            Policy HE-6.1.1:          Support outreach and education efforts to actively further fair housing practices and
                                      understanding of fair housing rights, with emphasis on proactive education and
                                      voluntary compliance, as well as through legal enforcement on a case-by-case
                                      basis, including, but not limited to, assistance with the resolution of tenant/landlord
                                      disputes and housing discrimination complaints.
            Policy HE-6.1.2:          Promote the provisions of disabled-accessible units and housing for the mentally
                                      and physically disabled.
Program HE-25: Fair Housing
The City of Rancho Cucamonga is committed to furthering and improving fair housing opportunities so that all persons
have the ability to find suitable housing in the community. To achieve fair housing goals, the City contracts with the
Inland Fair Housing and Mediation Board to provide fair housing services and landlord/tenant counseling services,
including education, counseling, mediation, outreach, and legal compliance. The City periodically prepares the
required Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice, to document the City's progress in improving and
maintaining fair housing opportunities. The City also prepares, as required by Federal law, housing planning
documents and progress toward fair housing goals set forth in the CDBG Consolidated Plan.
     Funding Source:            CDBG
     Responsible Agency: Planning Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
          • Continue to contract with local fair housing providers to provide educational, advocacy, and mediation
              services for the City.
          • Continue to provide fair housing and landlord/tenant counseling resources on the City website and make
              fair housing and landlord/tenant counseling brochures available at public counters and community
              facilities.

         •   Continue to periodically prepare an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice and implement its
             findings.
Program HE-26: Reasonable Accommodations
The Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that cities provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies,
and procedures where such accommodations may be necessary to afford individuals with disabilities equal housing
opportunities. While fair housing laws intend that all people have equal access to housing, the law also recognizes that
people with disabilities may need extra tools to achieve housing equality. Reasonable accommodation is one of the
tools intended to further housing opportunities for people with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation provides a
means of requesting from the local government flexibility in the application of building code, land use and zoning
regulations, and in some instances the waiver of certain restrictions or requirements because it is necessary to achieve
equal access to housing. Cities are required to consider requests for reasonable accommodations related to housing
for persons with disabilities and provide the accommodation when it is determined to be "reasonable" based on fair
housing laws and case law interpreting the statutes.
     Funding Source:           General Fund
     Responsible Agencies:         Planning Department and Building and Safety Department
     Timeframe and Objectives:
         • Create a formal process for making requests for reasonable accommodations for the development of
             housing for people with disabilities within one year of adoption of the Housing Element. The goal of the
             program will be to identify review procedures and to provide reasonable accommodations to explicitly
             allow for changes to land use, building codes, development code requirements (i.e., setback reductions
