                                  SECTION I. INTRODUCTION
I.0      Vision and Mission Statements
The General Plan Vision and Mission statements were prepared by the General Plan Task Force and subse-
quently adopted by the City Council prior to the development of the goals, objectives, policies and imple-
mentation programs by the General Plan Task Force and the City’s planning consulting team. The state-
ments guide the formation of programs and policies that are included in the General Plan.
Vision Statement—Malibu is a unique land and marine environment and residential community whose citi-
zens have historically evidenced a commitment to sacrifice urban and suburban conveniences in order to
protect that environment and lifestyle, and to preserve unaltered natural resources and rural characteristics.
The people of Malibu are a responsible custodian of the area’s natural resources for present and future gen-
erations.
Mission Statement—Malibu is committed to ensure the physical and biological integrity of its environment
through the development of land use programs and decisions, to protect the public and private health, safety
and general welfare.
Malibu will plan to preserve its natural and cultural resources, which include the ocean, marine life, tide
pools, beaches, creeks, canyons, hills, mountains, ridges, views, wildlife and plant life, open spaces, ar-
chaeological, paleontological and historic sites, as well as other resources that contribute to Malibu’s special
natural and rural setting.
Malibu will maintain its rural character by establishing programs and policies that avoid suburbanization and
commercialization of its natural and cultural resources.
Malibu will gradually recycle areas of deteriorated commercial development that detract from the public
benefits or deteriorate the public values of its natural, cultural and rural resources.
Malibu will provide passive, coastal-dependent and resource-dependent visitor-serving recreational opportu-
nities (at proper times, places and manners) that remain subordinate to their natural, cultural and rural set-
ting, and which are consistent with the fragility of the natural resources of the area, the proximity of the ac-
cess to residential uses, the need to protect the privacy of property owners, the aesthetic values of the area,
and the capacity of the area to sustain particular levels of use.
I.1      Introduction to the City
The City of Malibu is located along the Pacific Ocean northwest of the City of Los Angeles. Malibu is gen-
erally bounded on the north by the Santa Monica Mountains, on the east by Topanga Canyon, on the west by
Ventura County and on the south by the Pacific Ocean. Malibu was incorporated on March 28, 1991.
The Malibu area was settled in the 1890s by the Rindge Family who owned the Rancho Topanga Malibu
Sequit, a large ranch. Its remote location between the ocean and the mountains led to the current small-town
residential community development pattern. Malibu has remained a primarily residential community. Com-
mercial areas are limited to small neighborhood serving and visitor serving uses interspersed throughout the
City, but located primarily in the Civic Center area and the Point Dume area.
                                                          1

INTRODUCTION
Prior to incorporation, the County of Los Angeles dictated development policies in the area. Many of the
newer cities in Los Angeles County have experienced phenomenal growth in the past few decades. Although
Malibu too experienced growth, the growth was nothing like the growth of other cities in the northern Los
Angeles County. The citizens of Malibu, recognizing the need to protect the unique natural resources of the
area and retain the rural feeling, attempted to secure local control over growth through cityhood several
times over the past three decades.
I.2      The General Plan
The City of Malibu is seeking to guide development in ways that reflect the aspirations of its residents and
meet their needs. The General Plan serves as the major tool for directing growth while maintaining an attrac-
tive, viable and safe environment. It outlines a vision of what the City should be and establishes policies to
achieve the objectives.
The General Plan of the City of Malibu represents the efforts of the citizens of Malibu, the General Plan
Task Force (GPTF), several citizen study groups, City staff and the City Council to plan for the physical de-
velopment of the City.
The City of Malibu General Plan provides an analysis of existing conditions in the City, including physical,
social, cultural and environmental resources and opportunities. It looks at trends, issues and concerns that
effect the region and provides policies to guide development and change by identifying common goals, ob-
jectives and programs. Because changes are not wholly predictable, updates and revisions will be undertaken
periodically to keep the General Plan valid and relevant to the needs of the City.
Sections 65300-65403 and 65581-65589 of the California Government Code require each city to prepare and
adopt a general plan for the physical development of the City. State law mandates the development of seven
elements. These elements must form an integrated and consistent statement of the goals and programs of the
City.
The Draft Malibu General Plan contains the following seven state-mandated elements:
•     Land Use Element: Contains an analysis of the existing land uses in the City and designates areas
      where different types of land uses are desirable and allowed including standards for population density
      and building intensity.
•     Conservation Element: Contains a plan for the conservation of natural resources, including water,
      land, soils, animal and plant life, and other natural resources in the City and adjacent areas.
•     Open Space and Recreation Element: Contains an analysis of the open space lands and an action
      program for their preservation and conservation, scenic enjoyment, recreation and use of natural re-
      sources.
•     Circulation and Infrastructure Element: Contains roads and highways to be correlated with the land
      use plan. It also includes programs and policies that will provide for an efficient transportation network
      in the area. An acceptable map of trails is being developed and will be included with a trails plan in a
      succeeding amendment to the Plan. The circulation system has been designed to accommodate public
      transit services. This element also analyzes the organization of public services and utilities in the City,
      provides mechanisms to coordinate future service expansion, and evaluates service capacities and de-
      mands.

                                                                                             INTRODUCTION
•     Safety and Health Element: Discusses the hazards associated with earthquakes, slope instability,
      flooding, geologic faulting, fires, coastal erosion, tsunamis, and other locally present hazards, and pre-
      sents ways to protect the City from these risks through independent programs and standards. Emer-
      gency plans and resources are identified for coordination efforts in minimizing property damage and
      casualty during natural or man-made disasters.
•     Noise Element: Identifies the noise problems in the City as related to Pacific Coast Highway and other
      major roads in the City, as well as specific noise-generating uses. It provides goals and programs to
      keep noise within acceptable levels for human activity.
•     Housing Element: Contains an analysis of the existing population and housing stock, and provides
      ways for meeting the housing needs of current and future residents of the City, and to meet the City
      share of regional housing and employment needs. It addresses special housing needs and housing for
      lower income households.
All of these elements, taken together, establish a comprehensive plan, setting forth a consistent guide to fu-
ture development in the City. All development plans, zoning and subdivision ordinances, coastal develop-
ment permits and conditional use permits of the City are required to be consistent with the General Plan.
In addition, the General Plan relates to several requirements of the California Coastal Act; Appendix B to
this General Plan provides a cross-reference of General Plan goals, objectives, policies and implementation
measures that directly relate to requirements of the Coastal Act.
I.3       The Planning Process
The Draft General Plan is intended to be a reflection of the needs and goals of residents, property owners,
the business community, and others who have an interest in the City of Malibu. In order to ensure a wide
variety of public input and a truly representative plan, public participation was encouraged through the plan-
ning process. Citizen participation was invited during all phases of the plan preparation with notices, news-
letters, and news articles made at each step of the plan.
The General Plan Task Force (GPTF) was appointed by the City Council to guide the preparation of the
Draft General Plan. Although membership of the GPTF changed over time, during the preparation of the
Draft General Plan in 1992-93, the 23 members of the GPTF represented all sectors of the community and
different neighborhoods in the City. A cross-section of residents served on the GPTF to ensure that all con-
cerns were represented in the opinions and preferences expressed. The GPTF identified the major issues and
concerns facing the City and subsequently drafted goals, objectives, policies, and implementation measures
as well as a draft Land Use Policy Map. Citizen issues and concerns were gathered through public meetings,
public comment and participation in regularly scheduled GPTF meetings, workshops, neighborhood meet-
ings, and written input. The concerns were addressed during the formulation of the goals, objectives and
policies.
A series of 13 neighborhood meetings conducted throughout the community by the GPTF in the spring and
summer of 1991, attended by over 500 persons, identified the initial issues, concerns and preferences of the
community. A community survey interview was conducted in March, 1992 by the City’s planning consult-
ing team’s public participation specialists—Moore, Iacofano and Goltsman (MIG)—and gathered more de-
tailed and focused citizen concerns regarding each general plan element. MIG surveyed 15 people from the
community, including City Council members, GPTF members, and members from the community chosen by
                                                        3

INTRODUCTION
the City Council. The citizens in both interview processes were asked to express their views on planning
issues and the future of Malibu.
A town hall meeting was held on May 27, 1992 by the City’s planning consultant to explain the General
Plan process to residents and interested individuals. An explanatory document and opinion poll was distrib-
uted to participants. Subsequently, a series of three community workshops were held on June 3, 4 and 6,
1992 to identify specific issues to be addressed in the General Plan and suggestions for possible solutions to
perceived deficiencies.
In October, 1992 a mail-in survey was distributed to over 6,000 Malibu households and property owners,
which was followed by a second series of neighborhood meetings held October 24-25, 1992. A second series
of workshops were held in August, 1993 to present the GPTF’s preliminary set of draft goals, objectives,
policies and implementation measures and to obtain both oral and written comments from the public. The
GPTF’s Draft Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation Programs and the Land Use Policy Map were
then amended and finalized. In order to assure internal consistency and legal conformance of the Draft
Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation Programs, a GPTF subcommittee participated with the con-
sultant, their legal subconsultant and City Planning Department staff in a concentrated review of the GPTF’s
finalized draft document prior to submission to the City Council. The draft was then transmitted to the City
Council and the Council held an additional 55 public hearings to receive public input on the document. The
Draft General Plan was revised pursuant to City Council direction after these hearings and the official Draft
General Plan was then prepared and released.

Code, Section 65302(a), indicates that this element must designate the distribution, location, and extent of
the various land uses considered in the General Plan:
       A land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent
       of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural re-
       sources, recreation, enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and
       liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses of land. The land use
       element shall include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recom-
       mended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan. The land use element shall
       also identify areas covered by the plan which are subject to flooding and shall be reviewed annually
       with respect to such areas.
According to the State code, the location of a particular land use may be expressed in general terms on a
map. However, a property owner must be able to identify the General Plan designation for his or her parcel
from the land use map or diagram contained in the Land Use Element. The zoning ordinance and zoning
map must be consistent with the General Plan. The Land Use Element must also contain standards for popu-
lation density and building intensity for those areas governed by the General Plan. These standards must be
provided for all land use categories indicated on the map.
1.1.2     Purpose and Scope
Through text, tables, neighborhood descriptions, and maps, the City of Malibu Land Use Element estab-
lishes a pattern of land use and clearly identifies the standards described above. The Land Use Element and
neighborhood descriptions, along with the zoning code and map, serve as a guide for future development.
The Land Use Policy Map for the City of Malibu, which is included in this element, is a diagram which in-
dicates the distribution of land use designations geographically throughout the City. The Land Use Policy
Map is a diagram which illustrates the location and extent of these designations. To a large extent, the Map
reflects the existing character of development in Malibu. Where property is already subdivided into legal
lots, actual densities may be higher than indicated on the Land Use Policy Map. As a result, the overall dis-
tribution of land uses in the City will not change significantly. Residential development will remain the
dominant land use in Malibu aside from the expansive areas of open space located primarily in the northern
part of the City. Background descriptions of residential neighborhoods in Malibu are included as an appen-
dix to this element.
The Malibu Land Use Element is designed to provide maximum social, economic and environmental bene-
fits for City residents through planned distribution, location and intensity of land use. The element promotes
a balanced and functional mix of land uses, guide public and private investment, reflect land use opportuni-
ties and constraints identified in other General Plan elements, and reduce hazards. The Land Use Element
presents a background of land use data necessary to understand the current land use needs; with other ele-
ments, identify issues and constraints confronting future development; establish goals, objectives and poli-
cies; and identify implementation programs to guide the long term physical growth of the community.

LAND USE ELEMENT
1.1.3   Relationship to Other Elements
The Land Use Element is considered the key element of any general plan because of its broad scope. This
element plays a central role in synthesizing all General Plan issues, constraints and opportunities. It was pre-
pared to ensure consistency with the information, policies, and programs contained in the Circulation, Hous-
ing, Open Space, Conservation, Safety, and Noise elements of the General Plan and Local Coastal Plan.
1.1.4   Relationship to the Local Coastal Program
The California Coastal Act requires each community within the coastal zone to prepare a Local Coastal Pro-
gram (LCP) including a coastal Land Use Plan to protect, maintain, and, where feasible, enhance and restore
the overall quality of the coastal zone environment and its natural resources. An LCP consists of land use
plans, zoning ordinances and zoning district maps. LCPs must contain a specific public access component to
assure maximum public access to the coast and that public recreation areas are provided.
The entire City of Malibu is located within the Coastal Zone as defined by the Coastal Act. The Coastal
Zone boundaries extend several miles north of the City limits. Portions of this area represent land which
Malibu may seek to annex as its Sphere of Influence in the future. In addition to the coastal and marine re-
sources, there are significant natural terrestrial resources both within the City boundaries and the Coastal
Zone. Some of the habitat areas within the Coastal Zone adjoin the City and its jurisdiction by the City
boundaries. The City, therefore, has a significant interest in protecting and preserving these resources.
Prior to the City of Malibu’s incorporation, a draft Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan (LUP) was pre-
pared by the County of Los Angeles in 1982; this LUP was not accepted by the California Coastal Commis-
sion. A revised draft LUP was then prepared by the County and approved by the Coastal Commission in
1986. After approval, Los Angeles County did not implement the LCP by completing ordinances such as
zoning ordinance revisions or zoning maps. As a rule, the issues addressed in a City’s LUP are addressed in
its general plan. However, the LUP places more emphasis on certain issue areas. As Malibu completes its
General Plan, the Malibu LUP will be prepared. The new Malibu LUP will reflect the goals and preferences
of the City as set forth in its General Plan. In addition, many of the issues addressed in the General Plan will
also be addressed in the Malibu LUP. The LCP will be completed in conjunction with the City’s zoning or-
dinance.

1.2.0      Purpose
The following provides a summary and an overview of existing land uses in the City of Malibu. The material
is based on information in the Land Use Background Report, which is provided in the Technical Appendix
to the Malibu General Plan.
1.2.1      Characteristics of Development
Malibu was developed as a residential community with occasional neighborhood service facilities such as a
restaurant or grocery store located on or adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway. The area remains a “haven” for
people who prefer a quiet, small coastal town close to Los Angeles or other urban centers. Most residents
live in the community all year and others visit seasonally or whenever they can leave the urban area.
Development in Malibu first occurred along the coast in the late 1920s. As Malibu grew, those seeking
ocean views with more privacy expanded into the canyons and hillsides. As a result the City reflects charac-
teristics of both a beach area, and a rural community.
The City has retained its rural residential characteristic. Small businesses such as real estate, law firms and
medical practices are located in Malibu, but only as neighborhood serving enterprises. The local employ-
ment base remains focused in a few major employers such as the Hughes research facility and, adjacent to
the City, Pepperdine University. Many residents commute to Santa Monica, Los Angeles, the San Fernando
Valley or Ventura County.
The more intensive land uses, such as commercial and multifamily, have tended to cluster on both sides of
Pacific Coast Highway. Single-family residential neighborhoods are scattered in the hills. Although the City
is characterized by vast amounts of vacant land, only a small portion is suitable for development because of
the following constraints: steep hillsides, unstable soil and subsurface conditions, extreme fire hazard, and
sensitive environmental resources.
Prior to incorporation, land use planning in the City was governed by the Malibu Land Use Plan (LUP) and
the County of Los Angeles Zoning Ordinance. The existing distribution and extent of development in
Malibu is a reflection of the planning practices of both the County of Los Angeles and the California Coastal
Commission. The City is dominated by three land uses—open space (approximately 15% of the City), va-
cant land (approximately 60% of the City), and residential land (22%). Table 1-1 provides the distribution of
existing land uses within the City.1 Similar land uses have been grouped together. A generalized land use
map indicating the location and extent of existing land uses is provided in Figures LU-1A to LU-1D.

    The land use map, land use designations (the descriptions of the designations are contained in the Southern California 1990 Aerial Land Use
    Study, Land Use Level III/IV Classification prepared by Aerial Information Systems), and associated acreage, were data provided by the County
    of Los Angeles Department of Regional Planning. The data for the map was developed using 1990 aerial photographs and a computer mapping
    program, Geographical Information System (GIS). This data was verified by members of the Malibu General Plan Task Force, confirmed by
    windshield survey by HBA staff, and compared against existing subdivisions. The acreage was measured by planimeter. Due to the use of aerial
    photographs, a margin of error should be assumed. For purposes of this analysis, it is assumed this error is random and does not affect the gen-
    eral distribution of land uses in the City.

Residential land uses constitute the majority of developed land. Residential uses include single-family, mul-
tiple-family, and mobile home developments (as shown in Table 1-1, Existing Land Use).

Single-Family—The single-family residential category includes high density (more than two units per acre)
and low density (less than two units per acre) uses. The lower density single-family development is more
                                                                     13

LAND USE ELEMENT
dominant than higher density development. Higher densities are generally found along the beaches while
low density development is in the hillsides and canyon areas of the City.
Single-family homes sit on lots ranging from small clusters of approximately 10,000 square feet up to large
parcels of 40 acres or more. Single-family homes dominate both the coastline and the canyons and hillsides
from the City boundary on the east to approximately one mile west of Carbon Canyon Road. Residential
neighborhoods are found along canyons such as Big Rock, Las Flores, Rambla Pacifico and Carbon Canyon.
Between Carbon Canyon and Puerco Canyon, there are concentrations of single-family homes interspersed
with other types of development. These residential neighborhoods are primarily located along the beach, in
the hills above the Civic Center, adjacent to Pepperdine University, and clustered near the arterial roadways.
Puerco Canyon is the least developed for single-family residential. The area located between Latigo Canyon
and the western city limits is characterized by single-family homes on both sides of Pacific Coast Highway
extending into the hillsides. The largest concentration of residential neighborhoods is in the Point Dume area
and the Malibu Park area, north of Pacific Coast Highway and Zuma Beach. Residential development is the
primary land use along the coast between Malibu Park and the western boundary of the City, although there
are higher density multifamily developments in the Civic Center area as well as in the Trancas Beach area.
Several rural-like residential neighborhoods exist in Malibu. Rural-like residential homes are located in an
open setting and include backyard animal shelters, corrals, or pens for non-commercial horses or livestock.
These areas contain both high and low density residential properties. The majority of the low density rural-
like residential neighborhoods are located in the hillsides between Corral Canyon, Latigo Canyon and Rami-
rez Canyon. Higher density areas are located seaward of Pacific Coast Highway and Corral Canyon Road.
Several pockets of rural-like residential neighborhoods are also found just west of Trancas Canyon and
along Decker Canyon. In addition, there is a rural-like residential area located in the eastern portion of the
City adjacent to the northern City boundary along Carbon Canyon Road, although most of the parcels along
Carbon Canyon Road are 1 and 2 acres in size.
Multifamily—175.3 acres (or 6.5% of all land developed in Malibu for residential use) is multifamily. This
category includes:
•     Duplexes, triplexes and two or three unit townhouses and condominiums;
•     Low-rise apartments, condominiums or townhouses, mostly two stories in height, with 10 to 18 units
      per acre; and
•     Medium-rise apartments or condominiums, between three and four stories in height with more than 18
      units per acre.
The majority of multifamily units in the City are low rise apartments, condominiums or townhouses. There
are three areas of duplex, triplex or fourplex type units: along the coast between Las Tunas and Las Flores
Canyon Drive, east of Malibu Colony, and on Point Dume on Dume Drive. The only area which contains
medium-rise apartments is located north of Pacific Coast Highway and west of Kanan Dume Drive. In addi-
tion, there are medium-rise condominiums at Pacific Coast Highway and Zumeriz Road.
The largest concentration of multifamily residential is located in the westerly areas of the Civic Center north
of Pacific Coast Highway. There are a few pockets of multifamily development scattered east of this area
around Las Flores Canyon and between Puerco Canyon and Latigo Canyon south of Pacific Coast Highway.
In the Point Dume area there are multifamily residential units located both north and south of Pacific Coast

Highway. The only remaining two areas of multifamily development are located along Trancas Canyon and
immediately west.
Mobile Homes—This category includes mobile homes, trailers and pre-fabricated housing which are either
stationary with foundations or are capable of being moved. There are two mobile home parks in Malibu
which account for about 101.8 acres or 3.8% of all residential development. The two parks are both located
south of Pacific Coast Highway. The first is the Paradise Cove Mobile Home Park, located just east of Point
Dume and the second is the Point Dume Mobile Home Park.
Commercial—Since it has been determined to retain its rural environment, there has been no emergence of
a commercial center in the traditional sense. There are only about 184.9 acres of commercial land uses in the
City which account for less than 2% of all land uses in the City. The stretch of Pacific Coast Highway just
west of Carbon Canyon Road through the Civic Center represents the commercial core/strip of the City
Commercial uses include retail and service space and commercial recreation.
Commercial retail and service uses include strip development containing retail, restaurant, service shops and
offices along major traffic corridors with off-street parking, as well as retail centers which are non-strip de-
velopment with contiguous interconnected off-street parking. These retail centers typically contain one mag-
net store, usually a supermarket. Commercial retail and service uses also include office uses as well as hotels
and motels.
The commercial retail uses in Malibu are located primarily along the Pacific Coast Highway just east of the
Civic Center, in the Civic Center and surrounding area, as well as Point Dume. There are scattered pockets
of a few stand-alone commercial uses along both the north and south sides of Pacific Coast Highway
throughout the City, such as that found at Trancas Canyon Road.
Office uses include low and medium rise professional office buildings such as, business, medical, dental,
law, and public offices. The majority of office development is located in the Civic Center with a few office
buildings located at Point Dume. Commercial retail and service uses account for about 145 acres of land and
78% of all commercial uses.
There are five motels and one hotel within the City. These land uses are identified as visitor-serving uses by
the Coastal Commission and contribute to the satisfaction of required facilities for the Local Coastal Pro-
gram. Two of the motels, the Malibu Country Inn and the Malibu Riviera Motel, are located in the Point
Dume/Paradise Cove area. The other three motels, the Casa Malibu Motel, the Malibu Shores Motel and the
Malibu Surfer Motel, and the Malibu Beach Inn Hotel are located within the commercial core of the City,
just east of the Civic Center area. All are relatively small, ranging in size from 13 to 47 rooms. Collectively,
the hotels and motels offer 151 rooms.
There are two commercial recreational uses located within the City. The first, the Malibu Racquet Club, is
located just west of City Hall, and the second site, the Malibu Riding and Tennis Club, is located in the
western end of the City.
Research and Development—The research and development use in the City is the Hughes Research Lab
which is located on Malibu Canyon Road and accounts for less than 18 acres.
Public and Semi-Public Facilities—Public facilities which include government offices, sheriff stations, fire
stations, religious facilities, libraries, community centers, as well as educational facilities account for about
one percent of all land uses within the City. These land uses are scattered throughout Malibu. There is a gov-
                                                        15

ernment center, sheriff station, public library, medical offices and the Webster Elementary School located in
the Civic Center area. The Malibu Middle/High School and Juan Cabrillo Elementary School are located in
West Malibu in the Malibu Park area. Located in Point Dume is the Pt. Dume Community Center, which is
owned by the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. There are four fire stations located throughout
the City. Religious facilities such as churches and synagogues are also located throughout the City.
Semi-public facilities include light industrial uses such as open storage, utility facilities, water storage facili-
ties, and maintenance yards that are owned by State, county and municipal governments.
Agricultural—Traditional farming and ranching is practiced in only a minute fraction of land within the
City. Horticulture and horse ranches are more prevalent, usually as a transitional use or an adjunct to resi-
dential uses. Residents view preservation of these uses as important to the preservation of the rural atmos-
phere of the community.
Horticulture—The horticulture land use category includes both retail and wholesale commercial agricul-
tural properties of the types normally found in Malibu. Horticultural land can be used for irrigated and non-
irrigated cropland, such as avocado and herb fields, and improved pasture land for horses; orchards, vine-
yards, and nurseries; and other agriculture. Horticultural uses account for only 0.2% of all land use in the
City, or 24.8 acres. While none of these areas are of state-wide importance, there are some areas of prime
soils which are described more fully in the Conservation Element. These soils and the climate may combine
to make some of these properties unique for horticultural purposes.
The croplands include cultivated, in crop, harvested, fallow, or temporarily idle land. The improved pasture
land may be in pasture year-round or in the cropland seasonal rotation. There are three sites of this land use
type located within the City. One site is located east of Kanan Dume Road between the City limits and Pa-
cific Coast Highway, a second site is located north of Zuma Beach and Malibu Park, just south of the City
limits, and the third site is located north of the Civic Center along the City boundary.
Orchards, vineyards, and nurseries represent the greatest majority of horticultural land uses. Orchards and
vineyards are typically commercially productive tree, bush, and vine crops such as fruit and nut trees and
bush crops. Nurseries include land managed for the production of ornamental trees, plants and flowers,
vegetable seedlings, seed farms, sod farms, and wholesale greenhouses. These uses are scattered throughout
the City and found typically on the north side of Pacific Coast Highway and on Point Dume. Many small
plots have been developed on vacant residential lots and are devoted to such things as herbs and avocados.
There are two nurseries located west of Trancas Canyon, two orchards located north of Point Dume, one
nursery located just west of Pepperdine, and two nurseries and two orchards located in the Civic Center area.
No dairies, livestock, or poultry operations exist in Malibu. Other miscellaneous horticulture includes stor-
age facilities, compost piles, hydroponic farms, fish hatcheries, and apiaries. The category also includes,
backyard lots of mixed agricultural/nonagricultural uses. One of these sites is located north of Pacific Coast
Highway, east of the Point Dume area, and another site is located north of the Civic Center on the City
boundary.
Horse Ranches—Horse ranches are not specified on the existing land use map because in Malibu they in-
clude both commercial and noncommercial ranches, stables, tracks, barns and corral areas which have differ-
ing implications for planning. This land use falls under both residential and commercial. There are at least
38.7 acres of horse ranches in Malibu which account for at least 0.3% of total land in the City. The Los An-
geles County existing land use data identify four horse ranches or such areas in the City. They are located in

end of Zuma Beach and north of Pacific Coast Highway between Decker Canyon and the western boundary
of the City.
Public Open Space—Open space accounts for 14.9% of the total land in Malibu, making it the third most
prevalent type of land use in Malibu. There are 1,869.9 acres of open space including regional and local
parks, beach parks, and public open space used for recreation.
Local and regional parks make up 17.2 acres of the open space in Malibu. There is one local park in Malibu
as defined by the Aerial Information Systems. Local parks are typically community parks or sports fields
and their associated parking. Beach parks are not included in this designation. The 6.5 acre Malibu Commu-
nity Center located on Point Dume is considered the only neighborhood park.
There are two regional parks in Malibu as defined by the Aerial Information Systems. Malibu Bluffs Park
located at the mouth of Malibu Canyon which is approximately 8.7 acres and provides playing fields and the
Michael Landon Community Center. The second regional park in Malibu is the Malibu Lagoon State Beach.
The park is approximately 3.5 acres located just east of the Civic Center at the mouth of Malibu Creek. The
Malibu Bluffs Park is heavily used by local residents, so is also considered a community park for recreation
planning purposes. In addition, a portion of Charmlee Natural Area is also located within the City.
Beach parks and public open space used for recreation totaling 201 acres account for a large portion of the
open space in Malibu. The most dominant land use in this category are the beach parks which are located
throughout the City, along the coast.
Undeveloped Land—The land in Malibu is predominantly undeveloped. There are almost 7,296.5 acres of
undeveloped land that account for about 58.1% of the total land within the City. Most of the undeveloped
land in Malibu is in a natural state, containing tree, brush, shrub, or grassland vegetation. Undeveloped land
includes: park land, environmentally sensitive lands, beaches, undeveloped land which may be suitable for
development, abandoned agricultural land with limited improvements.
Beach areas include coastal beach areas which are not associated with a national, state, county, or a munici-
pal beach park. In Malibu these beaches are typically private beaches. They are located along the coast ex-
tending from the east end of the City (Las Tunas Beach) to the western boundary of the City including the
Las Flores, Big Rock, Carbon, La Costa and Big Rock Beach areas, Malibu Colony, Point Dume, Broad
Beach, Lechuza Beach and the Encinal beaches.
1.2.2    Land Use Trends
According to the 1990 Census, it is estimated that there are currently a total of 5,621 residential units in the
City.2 Census statistics indicate that from 1980 to 1990 there was a slight increase in the development of
multifamily dwelling units. This was accompanied by an increase in single-family dwelling units as well.
The population increased between 1980 and 1990 from 10,172 in 1980 to 11,116 in 1990, an increase of
9.3%.
These demographic trends indicate a pressure for continued growth. The Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG), the regional planning agency for the six-county region, prepares population forecasts
for the region, including individual cities. The SCAG projections for the City of Malibu are as follows:

Development constraints in Malibu may, however, prohibit significant future growth. Constraints are fully
described in the Background Reports to the remaining Elements and addressed, as appropriate, in those Ele-
ments. Soon after incorporation, the City enacted a moratorium on all development with exceptions applying
to single-family units. The moratorium expired on March 28, 1993.

    The surveys for the 1990 Census were conducted prior to Malibu’s incorporation, and therefore the existing census tracts cover areas far greater
    than the City boundaries. To obtain estimates of the number of dwelling units and population, the County of Los Angeles Department of Re-
    gional Planning overlaid the city boundary upon the 1990 Census tract and block boundaries. Block level data was used to isolate housing
    counts between the City and unincorporated areas because the City lies within portions of four census tracts. Where the blocks were split by city
    boundaries, department staff in the field counted housing units within the portion of the block located within the City.
    The following is the housing and population breakdown between the City of Malibu and the unincorporated areas for April 1, 1990. It assumes
    that the adopted city boundaries were in place as of April 1, 1990. In this way, census data may be used to provide a baseline for all subsequent
    estimates for the City. The division between the City and the unincorporated areas was conducted by the Los Angeles County Department of
    Regional Planning, Population Research Section.

                                       1.3     Proposed Land Uses
1.3.1    Buildout
Table 1-2 and Figures LU-2A to LU-2E tabulate and display the planned land uses and the distribution of
those land uses within the City. Table 1-2 provides an estimate of the number of units which could ulti-
mately exist in Malibu if all areas could be developed in accordance with the land use designations without
consideration to site specific topography, geologic, or environmental constraints. With regard to residential
buildout, which accounts for the vast majority of the land in the City, it also estimates potential buildout
based on vacant acreage, taking into account both the general topography of the City and the existing land
use designations which limit potential subdivision.
The buildout figures for residential and commercial development represent the maximum theoretical
buildout that would be permitted under the land use densities and intensities established in this plan. For
several reasons, however, these figures do not reflect the actual level of buildout that the City projects will
occur during the lifetime of this plan. Accordingly, these buildout figures are not reliable predictions and are
not regarded as a regulatory tool.
First, environmental constraints will limit the ultimate buildout of both residential and commercial develop-
ment in the City. For example, the City’s slope density formula will reduce the potential for subdivision and
development of larger parcels in the City. Furthermore, steep slopes and other geologic hazards in many
cases will limit commercial development to the lower intensities permitted under the floor area ratio appli-
cable to commercially zoned land.
Second, the buildout figures are based on the number of acres of vacant land in the City rather than the num-
ber of legal lots. Many of these acres cannot be developed because they are part of legal parcels; although
they are larger than the legal minimum, they are not large enough to subdivide.
Finally, there are practical impediments to development of many areas of the City, such as natural con-
straints and the cost of infrastructure. For example, more than 50% of the vacant, residentially designated
land in Malibu is of a slope greater than 35% and not suitable for development.
All of these factors will operate to limit both the rate and amount of growth that is expected to occur in the
City during the lifetime of the plan. However, it is impossible to definitively assess the actual amount and
timing of development that will occur in Malibu as implementation of the plan progresses. As a result, the
buildout calculation represents a worst case scenario for environmental review and planning. For the purpose
of assuring that the City meets its legal obligations under State housing law, the City has accounted for the
growth projections prepared by SCAG in order to accommodate the reasonably expected growth that will
create housing demands. The plan is also designed to limit growth to protect natural resources, avoid over-
burdening infrastructure that cannot be feasibly improved, and to maintain the rural residential character of
the community.
Furthermore, to ensure that pace of development in the City does not significantly increase over historic lev-
els, the City will establish a development monitoring program that will allow the City to monitor develop-
ment and take appropriate steps to regulate the rate of growth in the event that it exceeds levels established
by the City.

1.3.2    Land Use Policy Map
The Land Use Policy Map (Figures LU-2A to 2E) developed for Malibu identifies 20 land use classifications
including ten residential land use categories, five commercial land use categories, and categories for publicly
owned land, research and development, agriculture and horticulture, private recreational facilities, and Spe-
cific Plan Districts. These categories, their total acreage throughout the City and, for residential areas, the
corresponding allowable dwelling unit buildout totals are included in Table 1-2 and fully described in the
Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Implementation Measures. As previously noted, where property is already
subdivided into legal lots, actual densities may be higher than indicated on the table.
The data for the existing land use map (Exhibits LU-1A through 1D) was developed using 1990 aerial pho-
tographs and a computer mapping program. Due to the use of aerial photographs without regard to existing
parcel lines a large margin of error can be expected. Much of the land shown as vacant is the undevelopable
portion (canyons and steep slopes) of existing subdivided lots. These maps were used to estimate the number
of acres of vacant land available for residential development (Table 1-2) and as such the buildout numbers
are greatly exaggerated.
The Draft Land Use Policy Map, accepted by the City Council based on recommendations from the City’s
General Plan Task Force (GPTF) and substantial public input from July 1994 through April 1995, is based
on existing land uses in the City (as depicted on previous Table 1-1), and an analysis of existing conditions
and constraints. The constraints considered by the City Council and the GPTF included, but were not limited
to:
•     Watersheds in the City and the associated analysis of these watershed contained in the wastewater
      study conducted for the City by Dr. Peter Warshall (as depicted in Figure CO-2 of this General Plan);
•     Environmentally sensitive areas (as depicted in Figure CO-3 in the Conservation Element of this Gen-
      eral Plan);
•     Marine resources (see Figure CO-4);
•     Scenic resources (see Figure CO-5);
•     Recreation facilities (see Figure OS-1 of this General Plan);
•     Geologic conditions in the City (as depicted in Figures S-1 to S-10 of the Safety Element of this Gen-
      eral Plan);
•     Flooding in the City (as depicted in Figure S-11 of the Safety Element);
•     Brush fire history (as depicted in Figure S-16 of the Safety Element); and
•     Other background material, text and maps presented to the GPTF during the course of the preparation
      of the Plan.
The Land Use Policy Map for Malibu also requires the establishment of eight classification overlays reflect-
ing existing historical and natural resource, and development constraint overlay classifications. These over-
lays denote historically, geologically and environmentally sensitive areas, environmental buffer areas,
sloped areas, and flood and fire hazard areas. Development of properties in the areas covered by overlays
will require additional study prior to development. The overlay areas are identified and described in this

Element as part of Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Implementation Policies. The background material used
to develop these overlays may be found in the Safety and Conservation Elements and their Background Re-
ports.
Additional objectives which will be achieved through this element will include:
•     Promotion of a balanced and functional mix of land uses consistent with community values, neighbor-
      hood characteristics, the vision for the future of the City and sound planning techniques;
•     Guidance for public and private investment; and
•     Reflection of the opportunities and constraints affecting land use identified in the other elements of the
      general plan.

   Number of units that could be built if Malibu were perfectly flat, free from any environmental constraints, and entirely undeveloped.
2
   Number of units theoretically possible given the average gradient for the City and the average existing parcel size in proportion to the minimum
   required parcel size for the land use designation. According to the Opportunities and Constraints Report for the Safety Element (May 1993) and
   based on topographical maps of the City, more than 50% of the vacant, residentially designated land in Malibu is of a slope greater than 30%.
   Thus, at least 50% of the total acreage is unsuitable for development. Further, many acres of land cannot be developed because they are part of
   legal parcels, though larger than the minimum required, not large enough to subdivide. A conservative estimate is that 15% of the total acreage
   in the City falls in this category. Thus, the potential number of units adjusted for slope and redevelopment can be estimated using this formula
   [(total vacant acres - 50% for slope) - 15% for non-subdividable acreage] x maximum allowable density = maximum potential number of units.

               1.4     Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Implementation Measures
1.4.1 LU GOAL 1:             THE NATURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES OF MALIBU
                             ARE PROTECTED AND ENHANCED
LU OBJECTIVE 1.1:            DEVELOPMENT THAT DOES NOT DEGRADE THE ENVIRONMENT.
      LU Policy 1.1.1:       The City shall protect the natural environment by regulating design and permit-
                             ting only land uses compatible with the natural environment.
      LU Policy 1.1.2:       The City shall ensure that land uses avoid or minimize adverse impacts on water
                             quality and other natural resources, such as undisturbed watershed and riparian
                             areas.
      LU Policy 1.1.3:       The City shall control surface runoff into coastal waters, wetlands, and riparian
                             area.
      LU Policy 1.1.4:       The City shall preserve the City’s rural residential character.
      LU Policy 1.1.5:       The City shall require careful site planning which blends development with the
                             natural topography.
To implement these policies the City shall:
LU Implementation Measure 2: Identify impacts of proposed development on the sensitive environmental
resources within Malibu (Table 3-5) and impose all feasible mitigation measures as conditions of develop-
ment.
LU Implementation Measure 3: Monitor the cumulative impacts of development on sensitive environ-
mental resources and develop environmental protection guidelines to regulate development and avoid de-
struction or depletion of the resources.
LU Implementation Measure 4: Regulate grading and excavation to minimize impacts of construction on
water quality and natural resources. These regulations shall require the use of best management practices
(BMPs) to control erosion and manage storm water. These BMPs may include the use of seasonal and man-
datory year round control measures such as tarps, sandbag dams, on site retention of first flush rain, tempo-
rary drainage courses and erosion control measures, de-silting pounds, sediment traps, filter fencing, straw
bales and catch basin filtration.
LU Implementation Measure 5: Minimize the deleterious effects of runoff by limiting impermeable lot
coverage to no more than 45% of lot for single-family lots one-quarter acre or smaller, 35% for lots between
one-quarter and one-half acre, and 30% for lots greater than one-half acre. The maximum impermeable lot
coverage for single-family development shall be 25,000 square feet. Pools and spas shall not be included
within the calculation for the amount of impermeable lot coverage. These limits shall not apply to beach
front lots. (Resolution No. 13-35, 8/26/13)
LU Implementation Measure 6: Evaluate any increase in peak flow rate from surface runoff for proposed
development and mitigate any adverse impacts to property or the environment. Require a drainage control
system, including on-site retention or detention where appropriate for all new development. Storm runoff
                                                       23                             (Malibu General Plan Supp. No. 4, 12-14)

LAND USE ELEMENT
control systems shall be designed to ensure that the maximum rate of storm water runoff does not exceed
peak level that existed prior to development.
LU Implementation Measure 7: Prohibit grading during the raining season (from November 1 to March
31) in areas which might negatively impact Resource Protection Areas (RPAs) unless a delay in grading un-
til after the rainy season is determined to be more environmentally damaging. Where grading is permitted
during the rainy season, sediment basins (including debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps) shall be re-
quired on the project site prior to or concurrent with the initial grading operations and maintained through
the development process.
LU Implementation Measure 8: Require cut and fill slopes to be stabilized with planting at the completion
of final grading. In RPAs, planting on cut and fill slopes shall be of native plant species using accepted
planting procedures, consistent with fire safety requirements. Such planting should be adequate to provide
50% permanent coverage within 365 days and full coverage within 3 years. Planting shall be repeated if
necessary to provide such coverage. This requirement should apply to all disturbed soils. Jute netting or
other stabilization techniques may be used as necessary as temporary methods.
LU Implementation Measure 9: Require that development not interfere with public and private views and
view corridors to the greatest extent feasible.
LU Implementation Measure 10: Locate development to minimize vegetation clearance, consequent soil
erosion, and adverse impacts on wildlife and visual resources by clustering development near existing roads
on areas of relatively gentle slopes, as far as feasible outside of riparian areas in canyons, and outside areas
which serve as primary wildlife corridors.
LU OBJECTIVE 1.2:                        PRESERVE AND PROTECT RESOURCE PROTECTION AREAS.
        LU Policy 1.2.1:                 The City shall prohibit development in Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas
                                         (ESHA) unless no feasible alternative is available.
        LU Policy 1.2.2:                 The City shall require development in and adjacent to Resource Protection Areas
                                         (RPA) to be designed to mitigate environmental impacts to the fullest extent fea-
                                         sible.
        LU Policy 1.2.3:                 The City shall require any proposed new public access to and through ESHAs to
                                         be consistent with the natural resources of the area.
To implement these policies the City shall:
LU Implementation Measure 11: Keep a current database (inventories and/or maps) of RPAs, including
ESHAs, significant watersheds, wildlife habitat linkages, disturbed sensitive resource areas, blueline streams
and significant oak woodlands; consult the database when evaluating any proposed development.
LU Implementation Measure 12: Require all proposed development in or adjacent to ESHAs be reviewed
by the City Biologist or equivalent professional.
LU Implementation Measure 13: Where proposed development lies within an ESHA because no feasible
alternative site exists, in addition to review of other potentially significant environmental impacts require
applicants to conduct studies of biological resources to determine potential adverse environmental impacts
of proposed development and impose all feasible mitigation measures.

LU Implementation Measure 14: Site and design development in areas adjacent to ESHAs and public
parks to avoid impacts which might degrade those areas and to be compatible with the continuation of the
existing habitat areas.
LU Implementation Measure 15: Maintain natural vegetation buffer areas that protect sensitive riparian
habitats by requiring development other than driveways and walkways to be set back at least 100 feet from
outer limits of sensitive riparian habitats, where feasible.
LU Implementation Measure 16: Require environmentally sensitive walkways, board-walks, parking, trash
receptacles and restrooms where necessary and appropriate to access public parklands.
LU Implementation Measure 17: Develop programs to purchase conservation easements, accept donations
of land or conservation easements, use transfer of development rights, develop impact mitigation fees, en-
courage formation of a local open space district, explore inter-governmental agreements, and seek funding
from state and federal agencies for open space and natural resources protection.
LU OBJECTIVE 1.3:            LAND USES CONSISTENT WITH FLOOD, GEOLOGIC AND FIRE
                             SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
      LU Policy 1.3.1:       The City shall regulate development in floodways.
      LU Policy 1.3.2:       The City shall require proposed development to avoid geologic safety hazards
                             created by development.
      LU Policy 1.3.3:       The City shall require fire protection measures for development.
To implement these policies the City shall:
LU Implementation Measure 18: Implement the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) program in Flood Hazard Overlay Areas.
LU Implementation Measure 19: Amend the Building Code to regulate development to respond to local
conditions that require special consideration, such as impacts of septic systems on ancient and active land-
slides, unusual drainage problems, fire hazards and similar conditions.
LU Implementation Measure 20: Develop a system of incremental and progressive reviews of known or
suspected geologic and liquefaction hazards in connection with development applications so that review is
proportionate to the risk of such hazards.
LU Implementation Measure 21: Require study of potential soil creep, settling, mass movement and their
attendant hazards as part of geologic review for proposed development in areas where appropriate due to
known or suspected hazards.
LU Implementation Measure 22: Require applicants to execute release and assumption of risk from flood,
geologic and fire hazards where appropriate.
LU Implementation Measure 23: Implement regulations, such as those of the Los Angeles County Con-
solidated Fire Protection District, to minimize the risk of loss of life and property as a result of fire.

LU Implementation Measure 24: In consultation with the appropriate park agency, all development within
200 feet of public park lands, require a fire vegetation clearance prescription analysis and require appropri-
ate landscaping or vegetation clearance as a condition for development.
LU OBJECTIVE 1.4:            DEVELOPMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESERVATION OF THE
                             NATURAL TOPOGRAPHY AND VIEWSHED PROTECTION.
      LU Policy 1.4.1:       The City shall preserve significant ridgelines and other significant topographic
                             features (such as canyons, knolls, hills and promontories).
      LU Policy 1.4.2:       The City shall minimize the visual impact of hillside development.
      LU Policy 1.4.3:       The City shall minimize the alteration of existing land forms and require design
                             consistent with natural topography and processes of the site (i.e. geological, soils,
                             hydrological, water percolation and runoff).
      LU Policy 1.4.4:       The City shall require development to protect significant natural drainage courses
                             and, where safety considerations necessitate modification, require that projects
                             provide a natural appearance.
      LU Policy 1.4.5:       The City shall require hillside management review of all hillside development
                             prior to project approval.
To implement these policies the City shall:
LU Implementation Measure 25: Map significant ridgelines and other significant topographic features.
LU Implementation Measure 26: Develop a hillside management ordinance for residential and commercial
lots that:
•     Regulates grading and the use of retaining walls to preserve natural topography;
•     Establishes a slope density formula that reduces the effective lot area of lots with an average slope
      greater than 10% by a factor of 1.1 for 10.1—15% average slope, 1.3 for 15.1—20% average slope, 1.5
      for 20.1—25% average slope, 1.7 for 25.1—33% average slope and 1.95 for slopes over 33%;
•     Precludes development on slopes greater than 40%;
•     Protects significant ridgelines, hilltops and promontories by requiring appropriate setbacks;
•     Facilitates reclamation and enhancement of visually degraded areas;
•     Minimizes raw cut slopes; and
•     Locates development so that structures blend in with the hillside and do not exacerbate existing haz-
      ards.
LU Implementation Measure 27: Locate development as close as feasible to existing roadways, services,
and existing development to minimize the effects on sensitive environmental resources and surrounding
RPAs. However, protection of ridgelines and public ocean and ridgeline views shall have priority over any
increase in grading required by this policy.

                                                                                     LAND USE ELEMENT
LU Implementation Measure 28: Site and design development to protect public views from scenic road-
ways to and along the shoreline and to scenic coastal areas, including public parklands.
LU Implementation Measure 29: Require setbacks from blueline streams to protect natural drainage sys-
tems.
LU Implementation Measure 30: Design stream road crossings using the least environmentally damaging
method. Road crossings of streams shall be accomplished by bridging, unless other methods are determined
to be less damaging. Bridge columns shall be located outside stream courses if feasible.
LU OBJECTIVE 1.5:          INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.
      LU Policy 1.5.1:     The City shall scrutinize proposed development for any potential individual or
                           cumulative adverse environmental impact, in addition to those impacts that are
                           peculiar to development otherwise consistent with the General Plan.
      LU Policy 1.5.2:     The City shall reevaluate every five years the cumulative impacts predicted by
                           general plan buildout and the effectiveness of mitigation measures imposed to
                           implement the Plan.
To implement these policies the City shall:
LU Implementation Measure 31: Maintain an Environmental Review Board (ERB) comprised of qualified
professionals with technical expertise in resource management as a technical advisory committee. The ERB
shall review and make recommendations on proposed development in or adjacent to an ESHA and develop-
ment that may have a potential adverse environmental impact or which impose special environmental prob-
lems.
LU Implementation Measure 32: Identify and evaluate individual, cumulative and secondary adverse envi-
ronmental impacts of proposed development.
LU Implementation Measure 33: Develop local California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and ERB
guidelines, to assure comprehensive and timely environmental analysis setting forth procedures to determine
whether proposed development may have potential significant adverse environmental impacts.
LU Implementation Measure 34: Establish criteria for minimum qualifications of independent consultants
and specialists.
1.4.2 LU GOAL 2:           MANAGE GROWTH TO PRESERVE A RURAL COMMUNITY
                           CHARACTER
LU OBJECTIVE 2.1:          DEVELOPMENT OF A TYPE, AMOUNT AND LOCATION CONSISTENT
                           WITH MALIBU LIFESTYLE.
      LU Policy 2.1.1:     The City shall promote an aesthetically pleasing and visually stimulating envi-
                           ronment whose architecture, common and open spaces inspire and uplift the hu-
                           man spirit.
      LU Policy 2.1.2:     The City shall seek public input about proposed development and value the de-
                           mocratic participation of all citizens.

      LU Policy 2.1.3:      The City shall proportion commercially zoned properties based on community
                           need.
      LU Policy 2.1.4:      The City shall require development to be landscaped so that the project blends in
                           with the environment and neighborhood.
      LU Policy 2.1.5:     Consistent with the primary objective of protecting RPAs, the City shall protect
                           and preserve public and private ocean and mountain views, by striking an equita-
                           ble balance between the right to reasonable use of one’s property including the
                           maintenance of privacy and the right to protection against unreasonable loss of
                           views.
      LU Policy 2.1.6:      The City shall encourage pedestrian friendly design in concentrated commercial
                           areas.
      LU Policy 2.1.7:     In the event that current building permit activity for new residential or commer-
                           cial structures (not remodels) pursuant to this Plan exceeds the historic growth
                           rate for such uses, the City shall develop and implement a permit allocation sys-
                           tem to manage the orderly development of the City in accordance with the his-
                           toric growth rate. The City shall develop and adopt standards to determine when
                           the permit allocation system shall be implemented, based upon historic growth
                           trends and Plan buildout data. Calculation of these standards shall exclude per-
                           mits for structures rebuilt due to disaster, any periods in which the City’s devel-
                           opment moratorium was in effect, and County-issued permits during the incorpo-
                           ration process (December 1987—March 1991).
To implement these policies the City shall:
LU Implementation Measure 35: Prior to any required public hearing, require proponents to inform all
interested persons about proposed development applications through the use of (a) site signs; (b) direct mail
notification to affected residents, landowners and any person or group requesting notification; and (c)
neighborhood meetings.
LU Implementation Measure 36: Require commercial development to be designed with a residential scale
compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods.

                                     1.5       Land Use Designations
1.5.0    In General
Because of physical constraints and safety issues on certain properties, the identification of a maximum in-
tensity on the General Plan Land Use Map does not imply that all parcels could be developed at their maxi-
mum intensity. For all residential uses, the basic development intensity is one dwelling unit per buildable lot.
Lot sizes noted in residential land use designations are for newly created lots only.
Commercial development, either new uses or expansions of existing uses, is permitted the maximum devel-
opment intensity of the site as provided for in the Zoning Ordinance if the proposed development is consis-
tent with the goals, objectives, policies and implementation measures of the General Plan. Development in-
tensities greater than the Zoning Ordinance maximum development intensity may be permitted up to the
maximum development intensity bonus of the General Plan only if the proposed project provides public
benefits or amenities as specified below.
Public benefits shall include physical improvements dedicated and reserved for public use, including, but not
limited to, open space, wetlands, trails and walkways, parks, athletic fields, and civic or public buildings
(such as senior centers, youth facilities, city hall, etc.). The public benefit or amenity shall warrant the bur-
dens of the development intensity bonus over the Zoning Ordinance maximum, subject to review and ap-
proval by the City. (Resolution No. 99-24, 4/26/99)
1.5.1    Commercial General (CG)
The CG designation provides for more intense commercial uses, visitor serving uses and light industrial uses
located on larger sites. Floor-to-Area Ratio (FAR) shall range from a maximum of 0.15 to 0.25. Uses that
are permitted and conditionally permitted are defined in the Zoning Ordinance but would typically include
the following: all permitted uses within the CN and CC designations and mixed commercial and residential
projects, masonry supplies, plant nurseries, and restaurants, movie theaters and performing arts facilities.
Housing affordable to low, very low and moderate income families shall also be permitted.
1.5.2    Commercial Neighborhood (CN)
The CN designation is intended to provide for low intensity commercial activity such as individual retail and
service uses and cultural and artistic uses emphasizing convenient shopping/service to the residents in the
surrounding neighborhoods. This designation ensures that the types of uses and intensity of use must be
compatible with nearby and adjacent residential areas. Businesses are generally smaller in floor area than
those in other commercial categories and are located on smaller sites. Floor-to-Area Ratio (FAR) shall not
exceed a maximum of 0.15. Uses that are permitted and conditionally permitted are defined in the Zoning
Ordinance but would typically include the following: medical offices, small retail stores, bakeries, beauty
salons and bookstores, small restaurants, nursery schools/day care facilities.
Neighborhood commercial uses are generally located within a convenient walking and/or bicycling distance
from intended customers and shall be linked with surrounding neighborhoods by pedestrian and/or bicycle
access. Landscaped buffers shall be provided around the project site between neighborhood commercial uses
and other uses to ensure compatibility. All buildings shall be low-rise and shall include architectural/design
features to be compatible with the neighborhood. Permitted uses and building intensities shall be compatible
with surrounding land uses.

1.5.3     Commercial Recreation (CR)
The CR designation allows for facilities utilized for low intensity recreational use and athletic activities such
as hiking, equestrian, and tennis, and includes provision of food and beverage service for participants.
1.5.4     Commercial Visitor Serving (CV)
The CV designation provides for visitor serving uses which serve visitors and residents such as hotels and
restaurants which respect the rural character and natural environmental setting. Floor-to-Area Ratio (FAR)
shall range from a maximum of 0.15 to 0.25. CV designations are divided into two levels of density. Hotels
are only permitted in CV-2 designations, the highest density designation. Visitor serving uses such as motels
and hotels shall be consistent with compatible accessory uses, shall protect the surrounding properties, shall
ensure safe traffic circulation and shall promote economically viable visitor serving areas of the City.
1.5.5     Community Commercial (CC)
The CC designation is intended to provide for the resident serving needs of the community similar to the CN
designation, but on parcels of land more suitable for concentrated commercial activity. The community
commercial category plans for centers that offer a greater depth and range of merchandise in shopping and
speciality goods than the neighborhood center although this category may include some of the uses also
found in a neighborhood center. Often a supermarket or variety store functions as the anchor tenant. Floor-
to-Area Ratio (FAR) shall range from a maximum of 0.15 to 0.20. Uses that are permitted and conditionally
permitted are defined in the Zoning Ordinance but would typically include the following: all permitted uses
within the CN designation, financial institutions, medical clinics, restaurants, service stations and health care
facilities. The uses shall be located so as to prevent detrimental effects on adjacent land and to ensure access
to the street system. Locations shall be suitably separated from residential development. All areas proposing
a community commercial land use shall provide details regarding location, architecture, site design, land-
scaping, circulation, signage, height, and scale of the proposed development.
1.5.6     Flood Hazard Area Overlay (FHA)
The FHA Overlay identifies those areas identified by FEMA to be at a risk of flooding.
1.5.7     Historical Preservation Overlay (HP)
The HP Overlay provides for the protection and preservation of existing historically significant sites, area, or
structures which contribute to Malibu’s sense of time, place, community, or identity.
1.5.8     Institutional (I)
The I designation accommodates public and quasi-public facilities in the City. This designation includes
educational, cultural, athletic, religious, and governmental facilities. Floor-to-Area Ratio (FAR) shall range
from a maximum of 0.15 to 0.20.
1.5.9     Mobile Home Residential (MHR)
The MHR designation is intended to accommodate the existing mobilehome parks and would allow single-
family homes at one unit per acre.

1.5.9    Mobile Home Residential (MHR)
The MHR designation is intended to accommodate the existing mobilehome parks and would allow single-
family homes at one unit per acre.
1.5.10 Multifamily Beach Front (MFBF)
The MFBF designation consists primarily of existing multifamily development on beach front lots in the
City and is intended to provide for a variety of residential opportunities ranging from single-family to multi-
ple-family. Multifamily Beach Front (MFBF) allows for one unit per 1,885 square feet of lot area, not to
exceed four units per lot.
1.5.11 Multifamily Residential (MF)
The MF designation describes an area with multifamily development and provides for a variety of residential
opportunities and uses. Multifamily Residential (MF) allows for up to six units per acre with a minimum lot
size of 20,000 square feet.
1.5.12 Planned Development (PD)
The PD designation provides for a mix of residential and recreational development on the Crummer Trust
property located east of Malibu Bluffs State park and south of Pacific Coast Highway. (Resolution No. 09-
43, 7/13/09)
1.5.13 Private Recreational Facilities (PRF)
The PRF designation provides for private recreational facilities whose members receive membership
through deeded rights, property ownership or membership.
1.5.14 Public Open Space (OS)
The OS designation provides for publicly owned land which is dedicated to recreation or preservation of the
City’s natural resources. This designation primarily addresses public beaches, parklands and preserves
within the City boundaries.
1.5.15 Recreational Vehicle Park (RVP)
The RVP designation provides for recreational vehicle parks and requires ten-acre minimum lot size.
1.5.16 Rural Residential (RR)
The RR designation is intended for sensitively designed, large lot single-family residential development,
ranging from 1 to 40 acres, as well as agricultural uses and animal keeping which respects surrounding resi-
dents, and the natural environment.
1.5.17 Single-Family Residential (SF)
This land use designation includes all remaining single-family residential areas. It is intended to enhance the
rural characteristics of the community by maintaining low density single-family residential development on
lots ranging from 0.25 to 1 acre in size in a manner which respects surrounding property owners and the
natural environment. Single-Family Low (SFL) allows for creation of up to two lots per acre with a mini-
                                                       41                            (Malibu General Plan Supp. No. 7, 12-17)

LAND USE ELEMENT
mum lot size of 0.5 acre. Single-Family Medium (SFM) allows for the creation of up to four lots per acre
with a minimum lot size of 0.25 acre.
1.5.18 Specific Plan Overlay (SP)
The SP Overlay enables the City to address unique areas within the community which warrant a comprehen-
sive set of land use policies and standards through adoption and implementation of specific plans. The SP
Overlay shall be developed according to adopted performance standards, including traffic, geological, hy-
droelectrical and wastewater impacts.

                           1.6    Appendix—Neighborhood Descriptions
1.6.1    Trancas Canyon Area
The Trancas Canyon area serves as a dividing line between the higher density neighborhoods of Malibu
West and Malibu Park and the more sparsely developed areas of West Malibu. The area is roughly bounded
to the north and northeast by National Park Service land, to the southeast by Malibu Park neighborhood and
the Trancas Lagoon, to the south by Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), and to the west by the end of Bailard
Road. The topography of the area ranges from the steeply mountainous areas of the parklands on the north
and east to gently sloping and in places almost flat areas to the south and in the mouth of the canyon. Devel-
opment in Trancas Canyon is located south of the national park, and consists of a small commercial center
and three distinct neighborhoods: Malibu West; upper Trancas Canyon Road and the Trancas Highlands;
and the Bailard/Lunita area. There is also a large parcel of undeveloped land, with one-half mile of frontage
on the Pacific Coast Highway, separating the Malibu West and Bailard/Lunita neighborhoods. Elevations of
the developed areas range from approximately 800 feet (some homes in the Trancas Highlands) to near sea
level (some homes in Malibu West). Trancas Creek runs through the canyon, draining a watershed of 6233
acres, much of it outside the city’s boundaries. The creek once flowed through the entire canyon bottom in
years of heavy rain, but when Malibu West was built, it was lined with concrete and channelized for flood
control. The creek culminates in a small disturbed coastal lagoon adjacent to the commercial center, which
has been targeted for restoration by the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project. Another unnamed blueline
stream bisects the undeveloped area to the west of Trancas Canyon Road, and there are a number of other
arroyos and natural drainage courses in the area. The Malibu Coast fault is shown on the U.S.G.S. map as
trending through the Trancas Canyon area, running east to west through Malibu West, and into the Trancas
Highlands. There is a debris basin upstream of the creek to retain materials which might impact the flood
control channel, and another located above homes in Malibu West which is monitored by the County during
times of heavy rainfall. Like much of Malibu, the Trancas Canyon area is in an extreme fire hazard zone, a
condition exacerbated by a lack of roads which can be used for evacuation and Fire Department access in
case of a wildfire, and by the limited amount of water pressure available to those areas which have water
hookups, and the lack of water in those areas which do not.
The Trancas Canyon area is home to a number of species of wildlife, including deer, bobcats, mountain li-
ons, and coyotes; owls, quail, and hawks; and several varieties of snakes and lizards. In winter and early
spring, residents near Trancas Creek hear the croaking of frogs into the night. The flora of the undeveloped
land in this area consists mostly of that characteristic of mountain chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and grass-
land habitats, and there are small areas of riparian habitat near the blueline streams. Malibu West is also
home to a number of old sycamore trees, and some oak trees.
Trancas Canyon was once an important Chumash site. A Chumash burial ground was located in the area
now occupied by a garden center. Though the massive grading associated with the development of Malibu
West in the 1960s obliterated many traces of the settlement, some Chumash artifacts can still be found in the
Trancas Canyon area. The commercial center at the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Trancas Can-
yon Road consists of a midsize grocery store, a restaurant and bar, a garden center, a gas station, and a small
real estate office. Most of these establishments primarily serve the needs of the West Malibu community,
though the grocery store and gas station serve large numbers of visitors during the summer months, and the
restaurant attracts visitors from neighboring communities year-round with its country music and western
dance lessons. A small shopping center at Busch Drive and PCH and a larger one on Point Dume also serve
                                                       43

LAND USE ELEMENT
the needs of area residents. The commercial center is located in a flood hazard zone, and an area where the
soils might be prone to liquefaction. The intersection of PCH and Trancas Canyon Road is the last signaled
intersection between Malibu and Oxnard. It is the terminus of the Los Angeles Rapid Transit District’s bus
route through Malibu, except during the summer months, when service is extended to Leo Carillo Beach.
The proximity of this intersection to the bus line and the garden center has led to its becoming a gathering
place for transients who solicit work on the street corner, to the concern of area residents.
Malibu West is a built-out 30-year old subdivision of 200 single-family homes and 37 condominiums, 148
of which are located within Trancas Canyon (and thus not visible from the highway), and 89 of which are
located alongside Trancas Canyon Road and on private streets above the canyon and Trancas Creek (includ-
ing all of the 37 condominiums). Most single-family homes in Malibu West range from approximately 1,600
square feet to 2,600 square feet, on lots ranging from less than a quarter acre to more than an acre in size.
Most of the homes are one- and two-story 1960s suburban-style tract homes in five or six basic floor plans.
The majority of the homes are owner-occupied, many by families with children drawn by the area’s prox-
imity to local schools and the relatively moderate (for Malibu) home prices. Recreational amenities available
to residents of the subdivision include two community tennis courts and a private beach club, as well as hik-
ing and riding trails through the adjacent national parklands. Residents of the condominiums also have use
of a common swimming pool. The nearest community park and playground are at the Malibu Community
Center, approximately five miles away. Many of the homes in Malibu West have ocean and/or mountain
views, and some of the homes in the canyon abut Trancas Creek.
The only access to PCH from Malibu West is via Trancas Canyon Road, a local collector road. A single pri-
vate roadway, Principio Drive, provides the only egress to Trancas Canyon Road for those residents in the
canyon, whose homes are located on a series of private streets maintained by a homeowners association, the
Malibu West Swim Club. Utilities are underground, and there are no street lights. Some, but not all, of the
private streets have sidewalks. Wastewater is treated at the Trancas Treatment Plant, located near the mouth
of Trancas Creek, which was built for the subdivision and is maintained by the County of Los Angeles. It is
currently operating at capacity. The community is served by Waterworks District #29, and receives its water
from the 16-inch main under PCH.
Most of the homes in Malibu West were built in the 1960s and 1970s. As the homes have aged, and new
families have moved in, residents have increasingly remodeled their homes to suit their changing needs and
tastes. All building and uses within Malibu West are subject to review by the Board of Directors of the
Swim Club, and governed by the Codes, Covenants and Restrictions (CC&Rs) of the association. These
CC&Rs expire in 1999.
To the north of Malibu West, Trancas Canyon Road becomes much narrower and steeper, and there is a
more sparsely developed area of larger homes on larger parcels, up to 10 acres in size. These homes are ar-
chitecturally distinctive and mostly newer than those in Malibu West, and have ocean and canyon views
some are equestrian properties, including the Kincaid Ranch at the top of Trancas Canyon Road, one of the
original Malibu homesteads. There is also a specimen tree farm at the top of the road. To the west of the
road is a gated area known as Trancas Highlands, comprised of 41 lots, ranging in size from 1 to 17 acres,
20 of these lots are built with architecturally distinctive homes ranging in size from 2,000 to 17,000 square
feet, but generally in the 3,500 to 4,500 square feet range. Homes in Trancas Highlands are located on steep
and narrow private streets, maintained by the Trancas Highlands Homeowners Association. Approximately
half the roads are paved. Residents of these homes access PCH via Trancas Canyon Road. Most homes have

water tanks on the property, and rely on wells and imported water for their needs. The Homeowners Asso-
ciation is currently trying to form a water district to extend municipal water service from Trancas Canyon
Road near Malibu West to these residences. Wastewater is treated in on-site septic tanks, and utilities are
both above and underground. One home in the Highlands has a helicopter landing pad on the property and is
permitted a limited number of takeoffs and landings a year. Noise from these landings has in the past been
an issue of concern to residents of the Trancas area.
To the south and west, there is a small pocket of residential uses along Bailard Road near its intersection
with Lunita Road. The public portion of Bailard Road is a mix of horse ranches, single-family homes, du-
plexes, triplexes, and one 14-unit condominium complex, on large lots ranging in size from 1 to 12 acres.
Many are set far back from the street. A private extension of Bailard Road to the east contains nine addi-
tional single-family homes. There are approximately 30 parcels in this area, which is not entirely built out.
Many of the homes on both Bailard Road and Bailard Road Private have at least some ocean view. Access to
PCH for these residents is via Lunita Road, a two-lane light duty roadway. All of the homes in the Bailard-
Lunita area are on septic systems, and all are served by Waterworks District #29. There are no street lights
or sidewalks in this area.
The half-mile stretch between Trancas Canyon Road and Lunita Road south of the Trancas Highlands con-
tains approximately 100 acres of undeveloped land. This acreage is bisected by a blueline stream running
from the mountains toward the ocean, and contains a small riparian habitat and some archaeological sites.
The area was once used by the Rindge family to graze its cattle, and more recently was used by hikers,
mountain bikers, and dog walkers until a large parcel was fenced by its new owners in 1989. The land is
sometimes used by Sheriff and Fire Department emergency helicopters as a landing pad for rescues and
emergency evacuations.
1.6.2    Sycamore Park Neighborhood
The Sycamore Park Community is a small residential development across Pacific Coast Highway from Es-
condido Beach and Cove Colony. It consists of three streets which fan out from a central, PCH entrance, at
Via Escondido, which begins in a roughly north/south direction, and curves to become an east/west street at
the end, Sea Vista to the east, running east/west; and Sycamore Meadows, to the west, also running
east/west.
The Sycamore Park boundary cuts through Sea Vista midway, dividing it into, for these purposes, Sea Vista
“east” and Sea Vista “west.” Sea Vista “east” branches off into Via Linda. Sycamore Park and Sea Vista
“east” combined will be referred to as Sycamore Park.
The area is characterized by relatively dense development, consisting of about one single-family home to
one-half acre, to one home to a maximum of about six acres. Homes in the area are generally from 2,000 to
8,000 square feet, and are from one to three stories in height.
The Sycamore Park development originally dates back to a style of architecture that reflects the fifties genre.
Most of these older homes have been upgraded through additions and remodeling in recent years and many
newer homes have been built. Some older homes still exist as they were built.
Most of the homes in the area are two-story structures, some are single-story, and some are three stories in
height. Most of the lots are on hilly terrain that affords sweeping views of the ocean or/and the surrounding
hillsides. All the roads are privately maintained by homeowners. Sea Vista east has many new homes that
                                                        45

are frequently substantially larger than current standards allow. Most of the homes feature large backyards.
There are several homes which have pools, a few with tennis courts, and some with corrals and/or stables.
Via Escondido follows the path of Escondido Creek. A bridge over the creek affords residents access to the
beach, bypassing the highway. On the farthest end from the highway, Via Escondido opens into the area
known as Escondido Canyon. The canyon is shared with the residents of Winding Way.
Discreetly located on Sycamore Meadows is a small apartment complex, buried in the vegetation. It is not
visible from the street. Along the highway, on Sea Vista and Via Escondido, there is a private tennis club,
with three tennis courts and a landscaped common area.
Sea Vista east is characterized by large, deep lots, some of which have been subdivided to afford room
enough for several large houses. There are some lots with separate guest houses, garages, or servant’s quar-
ters. Some parcels are still undeveloped. These lots are surrounded by developed parcels. The most defining
features of this neighborhood are the rolling hills and the canyon, formed by Escondido Creek.
The issue of public access across private property is of major concern to residents here. There is the ocean
on one side of Sycamore Park and Escondido Canyon on the other. Residents often find the entrance being
used as a parking lot for the general public. People use the private roads and private access to the beach. The
privately deeded beach has an easement for the public to the mean high tide line. Others use the private
roads to park and access Escondido Canyon.
In addition, those wishing to play tennis often find the parking is taken by public beachgoers. Mobile homes,
RVs, campers, and horse trailers are sometimes parked there, seriously compromising security in the area.
There have been complaints that transients, sleeping under the bridge on Via Escondido or at Latigo Can-
yon, next to Sea Vista east, have frightened residents and small children.
As for the canyon, residents have been bothered by off-road vehicles, mountain bike clubs, horse trailers,
and hikers who generally show a disdain for the residents and their rights to private property. More seri-
ously, Escondido Canyon, which is not patrolled or secured, has been the site of overnight camping, includ-
ing open campfires. At the Via Escondido entrance to the canyon, there have been repeated episodes of ille-
gal dumping of trash. At one time, campers were found in the canyon with an open campfire left smoldering
next to a dumped gasoline container.
This is not a gated community, and law enforcement is not quick to respond to complaints. No adequate en-
forcement procedures are currently in place.
In recent years, the problems associated with liability have surfaced here in relation to the equestrian traffic
across private property, pedestrian traffic, bicycle traffic, and beachgoers who are on private property. Be-
cause of the resources here, public access and liability are a problem.
1.6.3    Paradise Cove
The area known as Paradise Cove is located at the mouth of the Ramirez Canyon watershed. The topography
of the area ranges from sea level to approximately 200 feet. The boundary lines are the Pacific Ocean to the
southeast, Pacific Coast Highway on the northwest, Zuma View Drive and the western watershed on the
west, and a short distance east of the driveway on the east. It is approximately 80 acres in size, contains two
watershed areas and consists of two large parcels and four smaller, single-family residential lots located on
Zuma View and Pacific Coast Highway. Approximately 30 acres of the property lie in the Ramirez Canyon

floodplain, which drains a watershed of 2,880 acres. The area within the floodplain includes 71 mobile
homes, a restaurant, parking lot, guard house, manager’s office, and the remnants of a fishing pier.
Ramirez Creek is a blueline stream that generally runs year round, and is the major drainage course into
Paradise Cove. Although the portion of the stream bed within the park has been converted into a cement
drainage culvert, the area still contains some ancient Sycamore trees. The western portion of the property
contains a three-quarter-mile long watershed, about eight to ten acres in size. This area is basically unspoiled
and still contains riparian vegetation, including coastal sage scrub and malay willows. Because of the abun-
dance of vegetation in the western watershed, it supports a variety of wildlife such as raccoons, possums,
bobcats, gray and red foxes, coyotes, bats, and birds, such as hawks, owls, roadrunners—including the local
flock of Point Dume parrots—and many types of lizards, snakes, frogs and toads. This stream bed is basi-
cally seasonal, and during the dry months is a much-used wildlife corridor. Additionally, Paradise Cove con-
tains hundreds of eucalyptus and pine trees that are home to many of the birds in the area.
Paradise Cove is a place of great cultural and archaeological importance, as the entire area is the site of the
large Chumash coastal village of Sumo, which is one of the largest sites in the Los Angeles County area. It
is second only to the Chumash village of Humaliwu located in the Malibu Lagoon area. Exploration indi-
cates that Sumo was a major fishing and trade village, as its protected location on the leeward side of Point
Dume afforded shelter, good fishing and easy access to the small outer islands, such as Santa Barbara. Major
research over the past 50 years indicates that this site is at least 8,000 to 9,000 years old, and contains a
7,000-year-old cemetery and more recent sacred burial grounds of the Chumash Indians. Many Chumash
Indians who were baptized at Mission San Fernando and Mission San Buenaventura show in the ancient reg-
isters as residents of Sumo, here in Paradise Cove.
In more recent times, the “cove” was used as a small port by the early settlers of the area, and once con-
tained a portion of the “Hueneme Malibu and Port of Los Angeles Railroad,” installed by the Mrs. Rindge in
1906 to keep the Southern Pacific Railway from laying track through the area to Santa Barbara, traces of
which still exist adjacent to the mobile home park clubhouse.
In the 1940’s, when the Marblehead Land Company was formed and subdivided the area, creating the
Malibu Riviera’s #1 - 4, Paradise Cove was a favorite picnic and fishing spot. In the 1950’s, it became a
mobile home park. It remained a rather rustic, sparsely developed mobile home park until it was sold to the
Kissel family in 1964, who continue to operate it as the Paradise Cove Land Company. In the early 1970’s
the mobile home park was expanded, with the addition of 200 more residences on the higher elevations of
the park, bringing the total number of homes up to the current level of 271. Residential mobile home spaces
in the park range in size from 1,000 to 7,000 square feet. The mobile home park contains two laundry facili-
ties that are open on an alternating basis, a small clubhouse, a small RV storage area, a set of children’s
swings, a weathered handball/basketball court, and a lovely tennis court that is maintained by a group of
residents.
There is only one open access road into the park, which is Paradise Cove Road that intersects with Pacific
Coast Highway. There is another entry/exit location on Pacific Coast Highway, but it is locked and used
only in emergency situations. Travel within the park is by means of small, paved roadways. For emergency
vehicle access, there are two unpaved fire roads that are used mainly by residents as footpaths to the beach.
There are no sidewalks. The commercial area serving the public has street lights, but the residential section
contains few street lights, which enhances viewing of the star-filled evening sky. Even with the added
                                                       47

LAND USE ELEMENT
homes, the large expanse of open space, sandy beach, numerous trees and abundant vegetation and wildlife,
the rural feeling and rustic character of the park has been maintained.
The public area contains, in addition to residential units, a guard house that is maintained on a 24-hour basis,
the popular Sand Castle Restaurant for shoreline dining, a lovely beach and the Paradise Cove Land Com-
pany office. The beach is open to visitors for a fee, on a year round daily basis, with no charge to restaurant
diners. During the summer months, the beach is crowded with many of the visitors to the Malibu area. The
once lovely pier that had a bait shop, snack bar, and fishing boats, was destroyed during the storms in the
winter of 1982, and has not been rebuilt. It is, however, open during daylight hours and still used as a loca-
tion for many movie shoots, as is the rest of the park.
The utilities are varied, with some being above ground and some underground. The older residences in the
creekside area are serviced by overhead electrical service and propane gas. The residences in the upper sec-
tion of the park are serviced by underground utilities and natural gas. All of the park utilizes septic tanks and
leach fields for disposal of wastewater. Due to the increased development of the mobile home park in the
1970’s, as well as the construction of scores of condominium units directly across Pacific Coast Highway
that sit at a higher elevation and possibly recharge the groundwater, the soils in the park are severely im-
pacted. As such, the park has a variety of septic problems, and is specifically mentioned in the 1992 City of
Malibu Wastewater Study as an area requiring further study of its soils and geology.
The geology of Paradise Cove is complex. The southern splay of the Malibu Fault is shown on the Septem-
ber 1992 Hazards Map as traversing the property in an easterly to westerly direction, entering the property
east of the pier and exiting just south of Zuma View Drive. The mouth of Ramirez Creek, where the restau-
rant and the 71 mobile home residences are located is a liquefaction area.
The area surrounding Paradise Cove on the ocean side is developed with single-family homes on approxi-
mately 1.5 to 3.0 acre parcels, with homes ranging in size from 1,600 square feet on Zumirez Drive, to 9,000
square feet on the beach bluffs, and wood frame in construction. The style of architecture in the area is
eclectic. There are small, older, ranch style residences, intermingled with large Mediterranean homes, and a
variety of other styles, such as Cape Cod, Barn, and French Normandy. Due to the topography and abun-
dance of vegetation, few of the residences are visible from the scenic corridor of Pacific Coast Highway. On
the land side of Pacific Coast Highway, consists of two churches, some single-family residences and four
condominium complexes. Two of these complexes have remained virtually empty, one complex is com-
pletely occupied, and one 69-unit complex is currently under construction.
Located at the mouth of a major watershed subject to wildfires and containing hundreds of towering euca-
lyptus trees many of which are overhanging homes, Paradise Cove is considered an area of major fire haz-
ard, especially during the autumn season of the Santa Ana winds. And, in fact, 47 homes were lost in the
major wildfire that swept the area in the fall of 1982.

1.6.4      Zuma/Westward Beach to the City’s West Boundary and South of Pacific Coast Highway
The most significant element of the area between Leo Carrillo State Beach Park and Lechuza Point is
Malibu’s most extensive stretch of pristine shoreline. Walking along the beach one finds long expanses of
                                                                      48

sandy beach punctuated by rock formations and tide pools at the mouths of a sequence of seven distinct wa-
tersheds and marking the points that separate the watersheds.
This shoreline is protected by the most abundant kelp beds remaining in Southern California. Once the ma-
rine hunting grounds of the Chumash people who inhabited the coastal shelf and the canyons above, these
flourishing kelp beds are, today, the Southern California mainland’s most prolific skin and scuba diving
area, underwater photographer’s paradise, and dolphin supermarket.
The principal threats to the kelp forests are inland development which causes increased turbidity, which pre-
vents photosynthesis; siltation, which can smother the kelp holdfasts; and the prospect of shoreline barriers
to protect development, which tend to result in the scouring of beaches and relocation of sand to cover the
cobble where the holdfasts are anchored.
Sea lions haul out wherever they can find a deserted spot. While the tide pools have been somewhat depleted
by visitors, there is surprisingly much sea life to be found there. The City could work with the State Depart-
ment of Parks and Recreation to increase awareness of the fragility of this precious resource. A number of
surf breaks are found between Leo Carrillo State Beach and Point Dume Headlands.
While most of the shoreline remains undeveloped, sparse clusters of homes are to be found along the way.
Most of the homes in this section are located atop tall bluffs on parcels ranging from as large as eight acres
to as small as one-eighth of an acre. (Specifics to follow: more about parcel sizes and small lot subdivi-
sions.)
Malibu residents and visitors from elsewhere seeking passive recreation reach the shoreline at Leo Carrillo
State Beach; Nicholas County Beach; El Sol County Beach Access (not developed); the Robert Meyer State
Pocket Beaches (El Pescador, La Piedra, and El Matador); West Sealevel Drive; East Sealevel Drive; and
two Broad Beach accessways managed by Los Angeles County. Several other accessways have been dedi-
cated, but remain undeveloped.
Zuma County Beach and Westward Beach are more extensively used by the general public because they of-
fer easy parking, food services in season, more consistent lifeguard services, volleyball courts, restrooms,
competitive events, and community services such as Junior Lifeguard training. North Beach Lifeguard
Headquarters are at Zuma. The fire department uses the area for training. The lifeguard boat Baywatch
moors off lifeguard headquarters during times of intense use.
1.6.5    Ramirez Canyon
Ramirez Canyon is a 2,880 acre watershed located between Kanan Dume Road and Escondido Canyon. The
topography of the area ranges from the stream bed and flood plain area, to steep mountains. The canyon has
a relatively small floor, bounded by relatively steep hills on both the East and West sides. Ramirez Creek is
the major drainage course into the Paradise Cove area. With the construction of the “Roosevelt Highway”
during the early part of this century, the Ramirez watershed was divided into two almost equal parts, with
the mouth of the floodplain located in Paradise Cove. The Ramirez Canyon Watershed also drains many
smaller drainage courses and arroyos.
Ramirez Creek is a significant blueline stream with a thriving native riparian habitat lining the creek, and
includes many native tree species of oak and sycamore. Although development has disturbed native plant
communities adjacent to the stream bed, the hillsides still contain coastal sage scrub. The flora of the upper,
undeveloped watershed areas is thriving and consists of abundant native plant communities, such as chapar-
                                                        49                           (Malibu General Plan Supp. No. 1, 3-12)

LAND USE ELEMENT
ral, coastal sage scrub and grassland habitat. These remain relatively undisturbed. The lower portions of the
watershed also contain exotic annual grasslands. The abundance of vegetation and a natural watercourse pro-
vides an ideal home to a number of species of wildlife, including deer, bobcat, raccoon, badger, gray fox,
coyote and cougar. Additionally, many species of birds inhabit the area, including hawks, eagles, owls and
roadrunners, and there are a variety of snakes, lizards and frogs.
Trails in the area include the Lower Ramirez Canyon Lateral Trail, the Ramirez Canyon Connector Trail, as
well as many wildlife corridors. Additionally, a trail has been dedicated and is in the process of being com-
pleted in the upper east end of the canyon that will connect Ramirez Canyon Road to another trail easement,
creating an entrance/exit to the west side of the canyon, where the trail continues and connects with Zumirez
Road. Due to the fragility of this Sensitive Environmental Resource Area, no additional trails are contem-
plated.
The area’s geology is extremely complex and is riddled with both ancient and active slides. There are four
mapped slides in the watershed, as well as active debris flow areas located in the upper watershed. Recent
grading for development in the upper watershed has exacerbated these problems, and there are now some
areas of questionable stability that require further study. In addition, there are four splays of the Malibu
Coast Fault traversing the watershed in an easterly/westerly configuration. Due to the canyon’s unstable and
complex geology, further studies of these problems needs to be done prior to additional development being
added to this already overburdened and fragile biological habitat and watershed area.
The floodplain portion of the watershed is a liquefaction zone. Water damage has occurred in the area as a
result of runoff from excavated, unstable hillsides. Any debris flow from development can have great impact
on both the stream and Ramirez Canyon Road, because the road follows the natural topography, and the dips
in the road are part of the bed of the running stream as it traverses the road in five places. Historically, the
residents in the flood plain have not suffered any damage from severe winter storms, with the exception of
locations where the water has been rechanneled, causing erosion to some stream banks and to the sides of
the road, and water from excavated channels to enter some homes.
Ramirez Canyon is an area of archaeological and cultural importance, as it is an extension of the large Chu-
mash village of “Sumo” located in Paradise Cove. There are sites identified as many thousands of years old,
and there are ancient burial grounds, as well. It is believed that the canyon was used by the Chumash Indians
for at least 9,000 years, until the early 19th century.
In the early part of this century, the Rindge family’s Adohr Dairy Company ran their cattle in the canyon,
until the area was subdivided by the Marblehead Land Company in 1941. This was the first subdivision by
the Marblehead Land Company (which has since become the Adamson Company), a Delaware Corporation,
and the first tract was sold and deeded in March of 1942 to Hope Ann Goodrich.
There were 38 original parcels in this subdivision which, during the ensuing years, have been subdivided
down into 70 to 80 parcels, approximately three to five acres in size, with some smaller lots of one to two
acres. At the present time, there are approximately 50 to 60 homes in the canyon, ranging in size from 2,000
square feet to 8,000 square feet, but including some much smaller residences. The homes vary greatly in
style and architecture, including small, original cottages, medium-sized ranch style homes, and large, mod-
ern or Mediterranean structures.
Ramirez Canyon Road is a private road that is gated at the Winding Way and Paradise Cove entrances. The
Ramirez Canyon community, through the Ramirez Canyon Homeowners Association, collects monies and

provides the following services: road repair and maintenance, signage, monitoring of speed limits, mainte-
nance of gate phone, speed bumps, and bridges. Road access can only be provided to residents who have
recorded deeded easements (the Hope Ann Goodrich easement). Access at the Paradise Cove location is by
means of a tunnel beneath Pacific Coast Highway. Historically, all residents have been responsible for their
own trash pick-up.
Wastewater in the watershed is disposed of by means of on-site septic tanks and leachfields.

1.6.6      Las Flores Canyon Watershed
Las Flores Canyon is one of the largest watersheds in the Malibu area. Within the watershed are the
neighborhoods of Las Flores Canyon, Las Flores Mesa, Rambla Pacifico and La Costa.
CIRCULATION: Seven-tenths of Las Flores Canyon Road is within the Malibu city limits. Las Flores Mesa
Drive, a privately maintained road, is accessed only from Las Flores Canyon Road. Rambla Pacifico, a main
north/south thoroughfare until sliding caused the road to become impassable in the early 1980s, is usually
reached via Las Flores Canyon Road. Over two miles of Rambla Pacifico Road are within city limits. North
of the city limits, Las Flores Canyon Road interconnects with Rambla Pacific Road. Further north, hairpin-
type roads off Rambla Pacifico, such as Schuerin or Piuma, provide ingress and egress to the San Fernando
Valley. The neighborhood of La Costa is accessed from Pacific Coast Highway on the east via Rambla Vista
and Pacific Coast Highway on the west via Rambla Vista. All of the above roads are winding, have narrow
shoulders and no sidewalks or curbs. Off-site parking is limited. The exception to this is the strip of La Costa
homes built on Pacific Coast Highway. The highway has curbs, and off-site parking is available.
1.6.6(a) Las Flores Canyon
HISTORY: Las Flores Canyon was one of the first residential settlements because a guarded Rindge Ranch
fence west of the road prevented westward development. The office of Malibu’s first justice of the peace (he
was a bartender at the stage coach stop, now known as Charlie Brown’s Sea Lion Restaurant) and some
Rindge Ranch bunkhouses were on Las Flores. Two bunkhouses remain. Other buildings near the mouth of
Las Flores, easily identified by their architecture and wood siding, are nearly 100 years old. Though close to
Pacific Coast Highway, the area feels isolated and tranquil.
LAND USE: Las Flores Canyon has an eclectic mix of single-family, multifamily rentals, commercial, hor-
ticultural, institutional and public facility zoning within the city limits. A nursery sits at the opening of Las
Flores. About a block and a half north on the east side of the road is a place of business. On its south is a
four-unit apartment building. The balance of land north of the business and on the east side of the road is all
single-family. County zoning permitted multifamily development to four-tenths of a mile up Las Flores. A
private school is on the east side, a county maintenance yard on the west, at the north end of the road. The
very few infill lots remaining are used for parking overflow (in particular and on a regular basis by the office
building for employee parking and the 20-unit apartment building). The majority of parcels are one-quarter
acre. Houses average about 2,000 to 2,500 square feet. There has been no “mansionizing.” Most structures
have been built at the canyon floor; a few are on hillsides or hilltops. Wood is the predominant siding for
single-family and multifamily buildings and reflects the “woodsy,” rustic character of the neighborhood.
                                                                        51

LAND USE ELEMENT
HOUSING: Multifamily rentals include four duplexes, two triplexes (one is uninhabitable due to flood dam-
age), three fourplexes, one six-plex and one 20-unit apartment building. Units range from one- to two-
bedrooms. A triplex, fourplex, and six-plex are on the creek side (west of the road). There are no condo-
miniums. Two small Rindge bunkhouses are rentals. There are granny unit rentals in single-family resi-
dence.
CONSERVATION: Las Flores Canyon is the only residential deep canyon in Malibu and has been desig-
nated by the County as a “Most Important” Significant Ecological Area. A creek, which flattens as it runs
through the city limits of the canyon, carries runoff from one of the largest watersheds in the Santa Monica
Mountains and provides sand for Las Flores Beach. Within city limits, the creek is bounded on the east by
housing and the nursery; on the west by Rambla Pacifica. Besides coastal shrub and wildflowers, Las Flores
Canyon also has pine trees, sycamores, pepper trees, and cactus. Minimal formal landscaping (lawns, etc.)
gives the area a “natural” appearance. Wildlife, including deer, quail and rattlesnakes, can be found in the
canyon.
OPEN SPACE: Open space is visual, not publicly owned. The visually open, aesthetically pleasing areas are
the by-product of the steep canyon walls and “natural” vegetation.
NOISE: Man-made sounds echo in the canyon, but are normally unobtrusive. Because the road is now a
main thoroughfare, traffic sounds can be a nuisance, particularly in the warmer months. Natural sounds of
frogs, coyotes and birds abound.
HEALTH AND SAFETY: Las Flores Canyon is a floodplain. Many of the buildings along the creek are
built on pilings. Two properties, a triplex and a single-family residence which sit below the creek bed as a
result of the Rambla Pacifico slide, were destroyed by flooding in February of last year. The triplex was re-
modeled and re-rented, but again was destroyed by flooding in December. The two Rindge bunkhouses (at
creek bed level) received substantial water damage but are again rented. The balance of creekside properties
sit four to fifteen feet above the creek bed. During rains, the creek either rises and widens or runs narrow and
deep. Also, the bed level is negatively impacted by rocks tumbling and siltation streaming from the steep
upper watershed outside the city limits.
Las Flores Canyon is sandwiched between two slides, Rambla Pacifico and Las Flores Mesa. The Rambla
Pacifico slide is the subject of litigation and will not be discussed here. The recent rains caused several prob-
lems on Las Flores Canyon Road from activity on Las Flores Mesa: runoff, surficial mudsliding, rocks and
boulders, a fallen tree, and a dormant, natural spring which ran down Las Flores Mesa Drive and onto Las
Flores Canyon Road for several weeks. The runoff has undermined the asphalt.
1.6.6(b) Las Flores Mesa
LAND USE: The area, which saw development begin in the late fifties, is single-family residential. Lots
average one acre. Houses are frequently perched along bluffs, down steep hillsides, or in the case of Sierks
Way, built on a flat promontory. Homes average around 2,000 square feet in size. However, in the last two
years, houses ranging in size from 4,000 to 6,500 square feet have been constructed. Most residences have
ocean views.
HOUSING: N/A
CONSERVATION: Homes on Sierks Way have lawns, but homes on Las Flores Mesa Drive and Eagle Pass
Drive are primarily surrounded by natural vegetation. The undeveloped hills provide a wildlife corridor.

OPEN SPACE: Because of the steepness of the hillsides, there are acres of privately-owned open space.
NOISE: Peaceful.
HEALTH AND SAFETY: The downslope side of Las Flores Mesa Drive has experienced movement, pri-
marily surficial sliding, as has Eagle Pass Drive. The roads are privately owned; the homeowners are re-
sponsible for maintenance and storm drains. Rainwater from the roads, which either overwhelms the drain or
can’t enter plugged drains, frequently floods Las Flores Canyon Road.
1.6.7    La Costa
BACKGROUND: The hillside neighborhood of La Costa, the oldest subdivision in Malibu, dates back to
1926. The neighborhood’s CC&Rs, which expired around 1970, required architectural review and approval
of all development.
LAND USE: The area is predominately single-family residential built along narrow winding streets and on
steep hillsides. On the north sides of the roads, structures are built up the hillsides primarily; obvious cuts
into the hillside are infrequent. On the south sides of the roads, structures are built down the hillsides or rest
on pilings. Most structures have very little or no setback from the roads. The original homes are primarily
Mission Revival in design. However, since the expiration of the CC&Rs, an eclectic mix of design has
emerged. Telephone lines are underground. Most homes have ocean views. La Costa now includes single-
family built later along Pacific Coast Highway and these homes have setbacks.
Malibu’s original mixed-use strip center is located between Rambla Pacifico and Rambla Vista on Pacific
Coast Highway. In the past, the first floor was commercial while the second floor was residential. Today, the
first floor is commercial/retail; the second floor is commercial/office. The first-floor businesses serve both
residents and visitors.
HOUSING: On the east end of Rambla Vista, housing is primarily multifamily with five duplexes and one
eight-unit apartment building.
CONSERVATION: Because of the age of the area, trees have reached enormous heights but enhance the
hillside neighborhood’s beauty. Vegetation is natural. Three historic structures are located on Pacific Coast
Highway. Representing the Mission Revival style in design, one structure, referred to as the “Old Sheriff’s
Station,” is made of brick; the other two, at the La Costa neighborhood shopping area, are stucco. All have
tile roofs and in some rooms, original Malibu tile.
OPEN SPACE: Open space is visual, due in large part to the topography, and privately owned.
NOISE: Tranquil, except for the homes which are built along Pacific Coast Highway.
HEALTH AND SAFETY: The eastern half of La Costa has experienced slope movement. Gas lines are
above ground. Rambla Orienta, Paseo Hidalgo, and Calle de Barco, at the northern top of the neighborhood,
are dewatered. Due to sliding in the eighties, some houses on the east end of Rambla Orienta were de-
stroyed, or remain but are uninhabitable.
1.6.8    Las Tunas Beach to Carbon Beach
Part of the magic of Malibu is, like few places in the world, it is a place where the mountains come down to
meet the sea.

LAND USE ELEMENT
Steep unstable bluffs crisscrossed with earthquake faults line Pacific Coast Highway and present a potential
danger to travelers to inclement weather. The highway bisects the bluffs from the beaches. Along the
beaches are a mix of single-family and multifamily residences, some on sandy beaches and some on wet
beaches. For the most part, the residences are on narrow lots and are both single and two-story construction
with varied architectural styles.
The beach side of PCH has a few commercial lots and single-family and multifamily units. It has a private
beach club for residents who own property above La Costa Beach. It has the only inn and motel on the sand
in the Los Angeles area. There is limited public access to these beaches, no public facilities or guard sta-
tions. The Las Tunas beach portion has a groins system in place.
All of the property is serviced by septic systems, and public facilities. As in all beach communities there is
heavy surf at times and beach erosion and replacement.
On the land side of PCH where the terrain has allowed, there is multifamily development, single-family
residences and commercial strip, office and stores.
This side has some fault lines which may also run through some of the beach side properties but as a result
some of the land side property may not be buildable.
Because of the way Pacific Coast Highway ribbons through the varied distances between bluffs and beach
there is limited pedestrian accommodations and no bicycle lanes.
Highway noise and aircraft noise is endemic to the beach property.
The strip shopping was created by the Coastal Commission concept of serving tourism rather than the needs
of the local community.
The most significant characteristic of this area is the beauty of the sites and the shoreline of the ocean.
1.6.9    Malibu Park
The boundaries of the Malibu Park neighborhood are defined by the four shared and interconnected accesses
to the Pacific Coast Highway (Bonsall Drive, Busch Drive, Morningview Drive and Guernsey Drive), in-
cluding the property which fronts on PCH and lies between the Bonsall and Guernsey accesses. The Malibu
Park community is bounded on the North by the Zuma-Trancas section of the Santa Monica Mountains Na-
tional Recreation Area (SMMNRA) parkland, on the south by the PCH and Zuma Beach County Park, on
the West by Trancas Creek and the Trancas wetlands, and less precisely, on the east by the slopes rising to-
wards Kanan Dume Road.
Three types of topography are represented in Malibu Park. Approximately 75% of the area can be described
as “coastal shelf,” rising from the 50-foot high bluffs facing PCH to an elevation of about 350 feet in a hori-
zontal distance of about 4,500 feet—an average slope of about 15:1. This gently sloping shelf undulates
transverse to the coastline as the result of a series of small intermittent streams (several are “blueline
streams”) which ultimately flow directly into the ocean, crossing PCH through culverts. Prior to 1970 virtu-
ally every parcel in the shelf area had a blue-water view, including several Channel Islands, and over half
had a white-water view. Less than 10% of these views remained in 1993 as a result of view blockage by
trees—primarily Blue-gum Eucalyptus and Pine.

Approximately 20% of the land can be considered to be “canyon land,” located along the Zuma Creek.
Large, old sycamore trees currently dominate this area, though formerly it was meadowland. The remaining
five percent of the area is steep hillside rising from the shelf area to an elevation of about 800 feet in a hori-
zontal distance of about 1,800 feet—an average slope of about 4:1. This area, originally developed as “Hori-
zon Hills,” features spectacular coastline views sweeping from Palos Verde to Leo Cabrillo and including
five Channel Islands.
Malibu Park is crossed on its north side by an ancient fault, and several landslide or slump zones have been
identified in the steeper areas. Most of the Zuma-Canyon area has a high water table, and has been identified
as a potential flood zone. In the shelf area the water-table generally lies 25 to 50 feet below the surface, and
periodically this underground water “surfaces” as it emerges from the coastal bluffs fronting PCH.
Portions of the Malibu Park area have been swept by wildfires, with significant loss of property. These fires
are driven by Santa Ana winds channeled through Zuma and Trancas Canyons. Major fires occurred in
1956, 1967, 1970, 1977, 1978, 1980, and 1983.
The Malibu Park area is largely developed as single-family residences on large lots, though about one per-
cent of the shelf area has been developed as small lots (smaller than one-third acre). There is no multifamily
development in Malibu Park, and the only commercial development is a small neighborhood-serving shop-
ping center at the intersection of Busch Drive and PCH.
The shelf area was used to graze cattle and raise vegetables until the 1950s. Portions of Malibu Park were
divided for residential development starting in the late 1940s. The land in the “shelf” area was subdivided
into two to five acre parcels, and at the south end of Bonsall Canyon Drive and in the Horizon Hills area into
one to two acre parcels. Some parcels remained in the seven to 40-acre size range, particularly at the north
end of Bonsall Canyon Drive, and on the eastern slope of the Trancas watershed, on the western side of
Malibu Park. Most of the Malibu Park original subdivision parcels carried deed restrictions which shaped
the size of the homes, and which encouraged agricultural use of the land. As these restrictions expired, some
of the parcels were divided further, and a few of those divided still again. Today Malibu Park contains in-
termixed parcels varying in size from one-quarter acre to 12 acres, with the majority in the one to four acres
range.
The nature of the land, the mild weather, and the unusually clean air, encourages agricultural uses. Whole-
sale orchid ranches are located on Bonsall and Harvester Roads. Small commercial Avocado orchards are
scattered throughout Malibu Park. Herbs and flowers are grown commercially on the undeveloped portions
of a number of parcels. Several parcels are used as wholesale tree nurseries. A large number of homes keep
riding horses; and goats, chickens, and geese are raised for home consumption.
Prior to the 1970s, about 250 ranch style homes, varying in size from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet, were built
in Malibu Park. In the 1970s home sizes increased to the 2,000 to 5,000 square-feet range, with a few as
large as 8,000 square feet. Most of these were single-story, though about 10% of these newer homes were
two-storied.
This building pattern continued in the 1980s, with a tendency towards the larger end of the size spectrum,
until the vote for incorporation of the City of Malibu. After the vote in favor of incorporation, Malibu Park
became the site of a building frenzy of very large homes (up to 22,000 square feet), and large homes (typi-
cally 8,000 square feet, two-story) on smaller (less than one acre) lots. Many of these were built for specula-
tion and having not sold in two years, were foreclosed. Some of the largest “mansions” have become “show

places,” frequently cited as examples of what should not happen in Malibu. This development brought forth
the problem of excessive run-off water to Malibu Park, resulting in flooding of several homes in 1991 and
1992.
The rural character of the Malibu Park neighborhood is expressed by the low, ranch-style houses, the large
lots, and the agricultural uses of the undeveloped land. It is also reflected in the virtual absence of sidewalks
and curbs, and by the minimum use of street and home-security lighting.
A large parcel of land owned by the Santa Monica-Malibu (SM-M) School District is located in the center of
the shelf area. The Juan Cabrillo Elementary School and the Malibu Park School (grades 7 through 12) are
located on this land. The Malibu Methodist Church, which operates a nursery school, is located near the
public schools.
Malibu Park contains three secondary trailheads to the SMMNRA at approximately the intersection of
Guernsey and Morningview Drives (the Chumash Indian Trail), and at the north end of Busch and Bonsall
Drives (the Zuma Ridge and Zuma Canyon Trails, respectively). Los Angeles County has leased a portion of
the SM-M School District land for an equestrian center. This center is linked by roads and trail easements to
the Chumash Trail from Morningview and Harvester Drives, to the Zuma Ridge trail head at Busch Drive,
and the Zuma Canyon trail head at Bonsall Drive.
Zuma Beach receives several million visitors each year. To avoid the parking fee charged by the County at
Zuma Beach, large numbers of beachgoers park along PCH, and on Morningview and Guernsey Drives.
Since circa 1990 these “parkers” have created a significant problem to the neighborhood in the form of ob-
struction of the roadsides used by equestrians and pedestrians, trash and litter, and an increasing number of
burglaries and thefts.
Opossums, raccoons, skunks, squirrels, rabbits, gophers, rattlesnakes, roadrunners, quail, redtail hawks,
owls, parrots and numerous smaller animals and songbirds are found throughout Malibu Park. These, and
domestic animals, provide good hunting for coyotes, owls, and hawks. Deer were abundant in Malibu Park
through the 1970s, but are only seen occasionally today. Bobcats and mountain lions from the hills to the
north occasionally drop in for dinner.
1.6.10 Winding Way - De Butts Terrace
The area defined by Winding Way and De Butts Terrace north from Pacific Coast Highway to the Escondido
Falls is a community of about 100 properties which are accessed by these private roads.
The majority of parcels are two to five acres in size, although parcels range from one-third to over 100 acres.
Lack of a county water supply had been a major obstacle to development in the area, and most of the parcels
were undeveloped. When in recent years a water improvement district was formed, the property owners
were assessed and a new water line and road improvements were accomplished. A five-foot equestrian ease-
ment was dedicated alongside the road as a Coastal Commission condition of these improvements.
Much new construction took place, and consequently the homes are newer, larger, and taller (exceeding cur-
rent standards) than those that exist in most communities, reflecting a change in the undeveloped character
of the neighborhood.

The topography is that of rolling hills that provide an opportunity for unmatched ocean and coastline views.
Although the feeling is rural, most homes are no longer oriented toward equestrian uses. Property values are
higher than average for the land side communities of Malibu.
The roads are private, though not gated, which is consistent with the quiet residential character that the com-
munity has traditionally enjoyed. However, with the acquisition of land by the Conservancy (the Conser-
vancy now owns approximately 30 acres of land in the area) has come the unlimited public access for hikers,
bikers, campers and gangs. Security and liability have become a problem and the fire danger has increased.
Recreationists and tourists park along the equestrian trail.
Two waterfalls exist in the upper region of Escondido Canyon which are accessible by hiking or horseback
along trails through private property. There is conflict among the various types of users as to the impact on
the sensitivity of this area as well as the residential character.
Of utmost importance to the continuance of the historic community character is the ability of the residents to
control this recent increase in public access so that the integrity of the residential lifestyle can remain intact.
The residents are adamantly opposed to the acquisition of any more property in the area by the Conservancy
because of these problems and the increased public use of the area which is considered sensitive in nature,
and which cannot support this increased level of use.
1.6.11 Area inland of Pacific Coast Highway west of Lunita/Bailard Tract to west City line
This area’s topography ranges from gently to steeply sloping terrain between Pacific Coast Highway and the
Eastern boundary of the City. There is relatively sparse single-family development located on large lots usu-
ally served by private roads or driveways serving several properties. There is one semi-developed subdivi-
sion, Lechuza Highlands, which exists around the mouth of Encinal Canyon Road that was initially sold to
individual buyers in late 1959 by the Crummer family. The area is about one-half developed, and subdivided
lots range from several sites of one-half acre to three acres in size. The roads are private and maintained by
residents. Many are dead-end and are intended to serve residents only. The neighborhood is very rural in
appearance and lacks typical urban amenities such as sidewalks and streetlights. The area has a history of
geological instability. There were several landslides closing Encinal Canyon Road in the late 1960s through
1980. These areas continue to be unstable. The development of structures in Lechuza Highlands was con-
trolled by CCRs until they expired in 1986.
The general area affords wonderful views of the Pacific Ocean as well as the mountains and canyons from
most existing and potential development sites. The areas not in the Lechuza subdivision are primarily larger
parcels.
Existing housing development ranges from small, older structures from 2,000 square feet to recently built
8,500 square-foot structures. Most are, or appear to be, multi-story. This often can be misleading in that the
structure may only be one story at the level of the access road but is built down the slope and appears two or
three stories high looking up from PCH.
Land uses in the area are almost all residential except for the Malibu Tennis and Riding Club at the western
end which provides facilities for horse boarding, horse shows, and a tennis club which are clustered on the
portions of the property fronting PCH. The upper steeper portions of the property provide trails for users of
the facility. There also is a pet boarding kennel and a horse ranch which provides boarding and equestrian
teaching facilities on two other properties nearby.

LAND USE ELEMENT
Historically, there have never been any multiple-family or commercial uses other than the Tennis and Riding
Club which had a low-intensity recreational commercial land use designation under the Coastal Plan.
Other than some areas of geological instability, the primary hazard is from fire and high winds, which can be
severe. The area has experienced several wildfires; one in 1978 burned 250 homes in western Malibu. High-
way noise can be annoying for homes immediately uphill of PCH.
Water service to the area is provided by Waterworks District 29 but lateral lines are often inadequate to
serve some areas. Electricity, cable TV and phone service is available in most of the area. Natural gas ser-
vice is provided to some areas, not to others.
The closest shopping area is at Trancas Canyon Road and PCH which is between three and eight minutes by
car from most properties. A medium size grocery chain market, a restaurant, a nursery and a full-service gas
station are located there.
Two highways, Encinal Canyon Road which joins Kanan Dume Road, and Decker Canyon Road, a state
highway, provide access from PCH across the mountains to the Ventura Freeway.
The recreational opportunities available are primarily natural in nature and passive in use. There are four
State-owned beaches on the ocean side of PCH across from this area. They are characterized by picnic and
parking areas on the bluff with relatively primitive stairways to the natural beach below. They receive sig-
nificant visitor use, especially in the summer months, creating parking hazards on PCH, which is a popular
bike route. Several years ago a young man was killed crossing four lanes of PCH from La Piedra Park near
the intersection of PCH and Encinal Canyon Road. Charmlee County Park provides a magnificent natural
hiking and picnicking area for residents and visitors. It is both within and without the City, with an entrance
beyond City limits off Encinal Canyon Road. The park runs through Lechuza Canyon between Encinal Can-
yon Road and Decker Canyon Road, abutting National Park Service land which connects the park to La
Pescadore Beach on the ocean side at Decker Canyon Road. The whole area has abundant wildlife, including
deer, coyote, hawks, buzzards, Monarch butterflies, etc.
1.6.12 Malibu Knolls
The Malibu Knolls neighborhood consists of 65 residential parcels situated on a crescent-shaped area above
and surrounding the Civic Center Area. These lots form the northern and part of the western boundary of the
Civic Center area. The average elevation of the neighborhood is approximately 200 feet above the flat land
below. The neighborhood is separated by a deep gulch into two distinct areas—East Knolls (40 parcels), and
West Knolls (25 parcels). The largest lot is over four acres and the smallest lot is less than one-half acre. The
average lot size is 1.02 acres.
All of the homes front on dead-end streets, all of which can only be accessed from Malibu Canyon Road.
During peak traffic hours, the residents are subjected to extreme traffic hazards by the high speed canyon
traffic when entering or exiting the neighborhood. The East Knolls, in particular, has an intersection with
Malibu Canyon Road at a blind curve on the canyon.
Most homes in Malibu Knolls have an unobstructed view of all of Santa Monica Bay from Palos Verdes to
Santa Barbara Island. There is also an unobstructed view of the Malibu Civic Center. The physical terrain
creates an amphitheater where the residents are the audience to the sights, sounds and any other activity that
emanates now and in the future from the Civic Center.

1.6.13 Point Dume
The essential character of Point Dume is a predominance of single-family homes on lots that are extremely
large for parcels on the ocean side of Pacific Coast Highway, together with views from those parcels of
and/or proximity and access to the beach. Point Dume has a lack of sidewalks and street lights, as well as
roads which are rarely straight or flat, all of which adds to the rural atmosphere prevalent on Point Dume.
Many homes have ocean views and/or sounds or mountain views, and the surrounding beaches are both tra-
ditional Southern California wide, sandy beaches, such as Westward Beach, as well are more unique
beaches, such as the “Big Dume” beach, with its extensive tide pools.
Original construction on Point Dume customarily consisted of single-story ranch style homes in the 2,000
square foot range, with “building standard” type interior finishes. However, most homes constructed on
Point Dume since approximately 1985 have been large, often finished in an opulent style, and with widely
divergent styles, and such homes now constitute a significant (although not overwhelming) portion of the
Point. Such larger homes are particularly prevalent on perimeter drives and bluff streets (e.g., Cliffside and
Birdview), while original styles predominate elsewhere (e.g., Wandermere).
Although single-family residences predominate, a few multiple-unit structures were also built on Point
Dume. Multiple-unit structures and multiple structures on single lots were not part of the original neighbor-
hood character or architecture, as still are not, nor have multiple-unit structures been completed recently on
Point Dume. Although multiple-unit structures are rare on Point Dume, a significant number have recently
been built in close proximity to Point Dume on the non-beach side of the Pacific Coast Highway, and the
number of multiple-unit structures in the area is therefore at a saturation point. Point Dume contains a mo-
bile home park on the tip of the Point at the end of Heathercliff. Most of the lots on Point Dume have now
been built out, though sporadic unimproved lots remain.
Shopping and related needs of Point Dume area residents are assured, and seem assured into the future,
through two existing complexes on Point Dume, one on either side of Heathercliff at the Heathercliff en-
trance to Point Dume. In addition, retail office space is also provided at Heathercliff, as well as at another
complex off Portshead.
Passive and active recreational needs are met by the Malibu Community Center, which provides public ac-
cess and parking off Fernhill, the Point Dume Headlands, (and associated foot trails), which provides public
access and parking from Westward Beach.
As a result of the shopping and office centers and as a further result of “Z” traffic which does not commence
or terminate on Point Dume, but which merely uses the Point as a short-cut, including but not limited to traf-
fic leaving Westward Beach contrary to the designated traffic flow, the volume and speed of traffic on Point
Dume is at an unacceptably high level.
Crime and potential fire hazards on the Point have also become concerns, particularly as nonresidential de-
velopment has increased, vagrancy has increased, itinerant workers tend to congregate near Heathercliff and
the PCH, and alcohol has been made available for both on-site and off-site consumption, including late into
the night.
1.6.14 Serra Retreat
“Serra Retreat” is a wooded canyon area adjacent to Malibu Creek in Lower Malibu Canyon, as well as a
portion of Sweetwater Mesa. The approximately 96 property owners of the small, secluded area belong to
                                                        59

LAND USE ELEMENT
the Serra Canyon Property Owners Association, which was formed to maintain and protect the privately-
owned, country road of the canyon community.
Serra Canyon consists of approximately 96 lots ranging from under one-half acre to four acres, with a few in
excess of four acres. All but a handful are developed as single-family residences at this time. The homes
range from small to large, reflecting the diverse economic and architectural make-up of the special Malibu
locale. Eighty percent of the lots are one acre or less, with the remaining 20% more than one acre. As
Malibu’s historic ranch center, its rural character is unique and treasured.
1.6.15 Malibu Country Estates
Malibu Country Estates is an enclave of single-family homes north of Pacific Coast Highway and adjacent
to the western border of the Pepperdine University campus. It consists of 107 lots of which five remain un-
developed. A “Declaration of Restrictions” recorded on August 28, 1972 in the County of Los Angeles and
valid at least until January 1, 2010 defines the boundaries of each lot, whether it is for one or two-story
structures, and specifies a set of restrictions regarding height, setbacks, size of floor area, visual impact, etc.
Malibu Country Estates has paved streets, sidewalks, public water supply, storm sewers, street lights—the
amenities and look of a suburban community. Its wastewater is treated at the recently upgraded Malibu Mesa
Reclamation Plant, which is partly dedicated to meeting the fixed permanent needs of Malibu Country Es-
tates. The Malibu Mesa Reclamation Plant is shared with Pepperdine University.
1.6.16 Malibu Road
Malibu Road is a two-lane “country road” which runs north and south paralleling the Pacific Ocean for ap-
proximately two and one-half miles. Malibu Road has one entrance—Webb Way—which is a 100-plus-foot
wide access road from Pacific Coast Highway. There is a large shopping center bordered by Webb Way,
PCH, and Malibu Road. There are also professional offices at the entrance to Malibu Road. Since the
enlargement of the shopping center, egress and ingress to Malibu Road has been hampered (some would say
dangerous) due to the infrastructure’s inability to handle the increased traffic.
There are over 250 living units situated on Malibu Road, the majority of which are two-story single-family
homes located on the ocean side of the Road. These beach-front lots are approximately 60 feet wide and 100
feet deep. The land side residences are also mostly two-story homes, but sit on larger lots ranging from one-
quarter to four acres. At the far north end of Malibu Road there are several multifamily units which offer
semi-affordable rental units.
The City of Malibu recently took over management of Bluffs Park, which is located on the palisades above
Malibu Road. The park offers active recreational opportunities with a visitor’s community center (The Mi-
chael Landon Center), a Little League field, and open recreational space popular with those who like to fly
remote control planes or simply enjoy the spectacular ocean views as they wander the designated trails
which wind down to Malibu Road.
The geological hazards on the land side of Malibu Road are well known and have been the subject of ongo-
ing studies regarding the watering practices of Pepperdine University which is situated on the hills above the
road. It is believed that excess watering of the hills surrounding the university have contributed to the move-
ment of the bluffs along the road.

Malibu Road residents are served by an active homeowners association which represents their interests and
concerns.
1.6.17 Malibu Canyon Village Homeowners’ Association, Inc.; Maison de Ville Homeowners
         Association; Malibu Pacifica Condominium Association, Inc.
Flanking the westernmost section of the Malibu Civic Center “bowl” arena, and overlooking a slight hillside,
stand three condominium properties—Malibu Canyon Village, Maison de Ville, and, tucked away beside a
grade school and a Catholic church, Malibu Pacifica.
Bordered along their ocean side by Civic Center Way and the Maison de Ville sewage treatment plant, these
three Malibu condominium properties contain 169 individual condominiums housing more than 400 resi-
dents on approximately 10 acres of real estate. Due in part to its proximity to Catholic and public schools,
this area has become the most densely populated in Malibu. Each of the condominium properties as it exists
today is fully developed and operating under condominium association covenants, conditions and restric-
tions.
With automobiles ricocheting up and down Civic Center Way at speeds often in excess of 60 miles per hour,
condominium residents and the school children are subject to extreme traffic hazards when entering or leav-
ing the neighborhood. Any consideration for further development of this area should take into account the
existing traffic, population density, and the already overloaded sewage treatment plant.
1.6.18 Zuma Canyon
Leaving Pacific Coast Highway and its profusion of fast, noisy cars and crowds of beachgoers behind and
entering Zuma Canyon, one can only marvel at the uncommon beauty and tranquility. Everywhere there are
tress and flowers. The near-perfect silence is interrupted only by birds singing, crickets chirping, and the
occasional hum of a distant mower.
What is almost unbelievable is traveling just a few hundred feet and being in such a pastoral setting, free of
congestion, noise and visual disharmony. From the start, the visitor senses that Zuma Canyon is a rare and
special place. There is immediately a feeling of having discovered a place unspoiled and undisturbed by
civilization. Only upon a closer look does one become fully aware of the homes tucked behind a camouflage
of thickset bougainvillea hedges colorfully lining the street.
Zuma Canyon property was originally settled with a population density of about one homestead per every
five acres of land. Today, there are approximately 50 single-family building sites, each occupying an aver-
age of about three acres. Most have been developed in secluded estate-like settings.
From the vantage point of a western rim, one can observe a patchwork of small orchards, truck farms, sta-
bles and corrals stretching over the gently rolling terrain. There are groves of oranges and avocados, apple
orchards, and greenhouses where rare varieties of orchids and nursery stock are grown. The unusual climatic
conditions of Zuma Canyon are favorable to producing a wide variety of plants, fruits and vegetables.
Agriculture represents the only commercial enterprise permitted by RA-1 zoning in the Canyon, and it is an
important source of livelihood and interest to more than a few of the canyon’s property owners.
Zuma Canyon is located on the eastern side of Pacific Coast Highway along the stretch of Malibu between
Kanan Dume Road to the south and Trancas Canyon to the north. At one end of the Canyon lie the Zuma

wetlands and beach; at the other end is land currently designated as a National Park. There is no access to
the beach from Zuma Canyon; there are no ocean views. Residential properties are nestled on a floodplain
below steep slopes and rugged ridgelines.
Zuma Canyon is one of the least disturbed canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains, and it is considered a
Significant Ecological Area. Its dry slopes and ridge are sparsely covered by a mixture of chaparral, coastal
sage scrub and natural grasses. In contrast, the riparian bottom of the Canyon is dominated by narrow bands
of dense native Oaks and Western Sycamore woodlands. Significant watershed areas surround the wood-
lands.
Zuma Creek flows down the mountain and interior valleys towards the Pacific Ocean. The interaction be-
tween the ocean and stream bed forms one of the last remaining wetlands along the Southern California
coast.
The brushy, grassy habitat of Zuma Canyon provides a haven for a rich diversity of wildlife. Deer, bobcats,
rabbits, raccoons, badgers and other species continue to be sighted in Zuma Canyon. The Canyon’s canopy
of trees and shrubs provide a sanctuary for many bird species, including trashers, quail and Golden Eagles.
Members of the Audubon Society find Zuma Canyon a paradise for birdwatching activities. Historically, the
high cliffs of Zuma Canyon provided a nesting habitat for the Peregrine Falcon, a State and Federally listed
Endangered Species.
Describing the physical attributes of Zuma Canyon is much easier than defining the personality of its
neighborhood. Even with access to an entire vocabulary it is difficult to find the proper words to express the
quality of life existing in the Canyon. Many Zuma Canyon property owners are longtime residents who
came to the Canyon seeking solitude and serenity. They, as well as newcomers to the Canyon, have chosen
to retain those qualities. Over the years, the quiet, secluded, rural character of the Canyon environment has
remained virtually unchanged.
Several residents of the Canyon are now retired and appreciate more than ever the intimacy of canyon living.
Others are professionals who work in the city but pay the price of lengthy commutes to return to a slower
pace once their day’s work is complete. Even non-residents enjoy the Canyon’s ambience; riders regularly
enjoy a ride through the Canyon.
A common denominator shared by Zuma Canyon property owners is a desire for privacy. This has brought
about a feeling of closeness and community among the neighbors that is hard to find nowadays.

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
                                             2.1      Introduction
2.1.0     Overview
The following describes some of the key open space resources, opportunities and constraints facing the City
of Malibu. A complete assessment of open space resources is provided in the “Open Space Background Re-
port” provided in the technical appendix to the Malibu General Plan.
2.1.1     Legislative Authorization
The State of California Government Code states that “the general plan shall include an open-space element
as provided in Section 65302(e).” “Open space land” is any parcel or area of land or water which is essen-
tially unimproved and devoted to an open-space use and which is designated on a local, regional or state
open-space plan as any of the following:
•      Open space for the preservation of natural resources;
•      Open space used for the managed production of resources;
•      Open space for outdoor recreation, including areas of scenic, historic, and cultural value; airshed, and,
•      Open space for public health and safety including areas which require special management or regula-
       tion because of hazardous conditions such as earthquake fault zones or floodplains.
2.1.2     Purpose and Scope
The purpose of the Open Space and Recreation Element is to improve the overall quality of life for Malibu
residents and visitors through the management of its natural resources and open space lands. The Open
Space and Recreation Element deals with open space and recreation issues including outdoor recreation fa-
cilities and trails. The issues addressed in this element include the different aspects of the natural environ-
ment that contribute to an ecological balance.
The Malibu Open Space and Recreation Element is to be used as a guide for the maintenance of existing
parkland, the acquisition and development of additional parks and recreational facilities, as well as vacant
open land.
Several factors of special concern to Malibu residents addressed in this Open Space and Recreation Element
include:
•      The rapid development of open space continues to decrease the availability of parkland for future ac-
       quisition.
•      Planning for acquisitions and improvements now can also provide for more cost effective purchases.
•      State legislation permits local jurisdictions to require parkland dedication from developers if a parks
       and recreation element has been adopted which sets forth a rationale and standards for the dedication.
•      The population increases which are projected as new development occurs will create a burden on exist-
       ing parks.
•      Malibu comprises the major portion of the coastal section of the Santa Monica Mountains National
       Recreation Area (SMMNRA). Enabling legislation for the SMMNRA mandates interagency coopera-
       tion to provide open space and recreational and cultural activities.

                                                              OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
              2.2     Description of Existing Open Space and Undeveloped Land
2.2.0    In General
Undeveloped open space land is generally defined as areas that are not built upon and may include both
manmade and natural landscapes and, as noted previously, includes any parcel or area of land or water
which is essentially unimproved or devoted to an open-space use and which is designated on a local, re-
gional or state open-space plan. Open space can separate or unify urban functions or areas, depending on its
form and location. In addition, open space provides opportunities for resource protection, enjoying scenic
views, conservation of habitat and natural resources, outdoor recreation, public health and safety.
Open space within Malibu includes undeveloped land, parks, public and privately owned beaches, floodplain
areas, earthquake areas, steep slopes, and all existing natural conservation areas.
2.2.1    Private Undeveloped Land
Vacant, undeveloped land dominates Malibu. There are 7,578.3 acres of vacant land which accounts for
60.4% of all land in the City. Most of the vacant land in Malibu is in a natural state, containing tree, brush,
shrub, or grassland vegetation. Vacant land includes: natural park land, environmentally sensitive lands,
beaches, undeveloped land which may be suitable for development, and abandoned agricultural land with
limited improvements. Vacant beach areas include coastal beaches not associated with a national, state,
county, or municipal beach park. In Malibu, this designation typically refers to private beaches. There are
113.3 acres of vacant/private beaches in the City. These beaches are located along the coast extending from
the east end of the City (Las Tunas Beach) to the western boundary of the City including Las Flores, Carbon,
La Costa, and Big Rock Beach areas, Malibu Colony, Point Dume, Broad Beach, Lechuza Beach, and the
Encinal beaches.
2.2.2    Public Open Space
Open space accounts for 14.9% of the total land in Malibu, making it the third most prevalent type of land
use in Malibu. There are 1,869.9 acres of open space including regional and local parks, beach parks, and
public open space used for recreation.
Local and regional parks make up 743.7 acres of the open space in Malibu. There is one local park in Malibu
as defined by the Aerial Information Systems. Local parks are typically community parks or sports fields
and their associated parking. Beach parks are not included in this designation. The 6.5 acre Malibu Commu-
nity Center located on Point Dume is considered the only neighborhood park; the Center is owned by the
Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District. Malibu Bluffs Park located at the mouth of Malibu Canyon
which is approximately 8.7 acres includes playing fields and the Michael Landon Community Center. The
second regional park in Malibu is the Malibu Lagoon State Park. The Malibu Lagoon State Beach, approxi-
mately 3.5 acres and located just east of the Civic Center at the mouth of Malibu Creek, also includes the
Adamson House. The Malibu Bluffs Park is heavily used by local residents, so it is also considered a com-
munity park for recreation planning purposes. Beach parks and public open space used for recreation total-
ing 201 acres account for a large portion of the open space in Malibu. The City has several regional (City,
county, state or federal) parks, including Charmlee Natural Area (formerly Charmlee Regional County Park)
which is managed by the City of Malibu. This is a 524-acre site with small visitor/nature center and petting
area with small animals. Hiking, picnicking, equestrian, nature trails and whale watching sites exist within
the park.

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
Malibu Lagoon State Beach’s facilities include fee and street parking, restrooms, drinking water, hiking and
nature trails, and disabled access. The lagoon contains important bird refuge supported by diverse marsh
vegetation. The lagoon also supports steelhead trout and tidewater goby. Surfrider Beach is a widely recog-
nized surfing area. The classic hollow peeling Malibu wave is one of Malibu’s most significant natural re-
sources formed by the cobble contours of the ocean floor.

                        2.3      Description of Existing Recreation Facilities
2.3.0     In General
Malibu is located within the boundaries of the SMMNRA which extends from Griffith Park in the City of
Los Angeles to Pt. Mugu in Ventura County and is comprised of City, State, County, and Federally owned
park lands and relies on cooperation between managing agencies and private land owners. Recreation areas
are either publicly owned and operated by governmental agencies or are privately owned and operated, yet
available to the public. Most recreation areas within the City of Malibu and its surrounding area are public
beaches or mountain parks. The emphasis at these sites is on water oriented activities at beaches or on inter-
pretation of the natural environment in the mountains. Figure OS-1 displays the existing public recreation
facilities within and adjacent to the City of Malibu.
2.3.1     City of Malibu Recreation Facilities
Prior to the City’s incorporation, park maintenance and recreational services were provided by the Los An-
geles County Parks and Recreation and Harbors and Beaches Departments, the State Department of Parks
and Recreation, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and the National Park Service. Since incorpora-
tion, the City Parks and Recreation Department manages the Equestrian Center, Charmlee Natural Area and
Malibu Bluffs Park by agreement with Los Angeles County; and administers programs in these parks as well
as other locations. Child development programs, summer camps, and special events are provided by private,
organized groups. The Malibu Community Center, although a popular site for City-run meetings, is owned
jointly by the Point Dume Community Services District composed of City residents along with the Santa
Monica/Malibu Unified School District.

      This site contains some tidepools. Giant coreopsis flourish as well as loon and cormorant nests, scenic
      rock formations, and tall bluffs.
2.3.4    Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy
Corral Canyon Park is approximately 16.1 acres and is located on the Pacific Coast Highway between Pu-
erco Canyon and Corral Canyon. The park, managed by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, provides
hiking, equestrian trails, and parking.
Solstice Canyon Park is located at Pacific Coast Highway and Corral Canyon Road. The site is approxi-
mately 556 acres and provides hiking and equestrian trails, mountain biking, picnicking, grills, camping,
swimming, disabled access, parking, drinking water, restrooms, and access to the Backbone Trail. The Park
is managed by the National Park Service.
2.3.5    National Park Service
The National Park Service is responsible for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The
entire City of Malibu is within the Santa Monica Mountain National Recreation Area, a federal designation.
The legislation of Public Law 95-625 mandates the National Park Service to manage the recreation area in a
manner which will preserve and enhance scenic, natural and cultural resources, and its public health value as
an air-shed, and provide recreational and educational opportunities. The Natural Park Service is committed
                                                        88

                                                               OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
to cooperative working together with agencies and jurisdictions to create a system of land use, recreational
and educational opportunities, and resources conservation and preservation.
The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA) was established by Congress in 1978.
The National Park Service has developed multiple-use policies for managing the area and aspires to acquire
those lands which offer significant natural, cultural, and recreational resources and which are not already
under governmental jurisdiction or private preservation/recreation-oriented use. People will continue to live
and work within the boundary of the recreation area. These people are not considered “in-holders,” to be
removed one day, in the traditional park sense, but “neighbors.” Regulation of their land use is not the re-
sponsibility of the federal government but of local jurisdictions.
The City of Malibu lies within the boundaries of the SMMNRA. The National Park Service is committed to
cooperation with the City of Malibu to preserve Malibu’s natural and cultural resources, watershed, and
open space.
Zuma and Trancas Canyons are an important part of the SMMNRA and together make up one of the largest
contiguous landholdings in the mountains. The lower canyons are within the City of Malibu. The National
Park Service owns over 5,700 acres of this unique example of a Mediterranean ecosystem, which provide
core wildlife habitat. Streams help support wildlife, including reptiles, birds, deer, coyote, bobcat, and
mountain lion. Several plant communities are represented: chaparral, coastal sage scrub, riparian/oak wood-
land, and grassland. Several sensitive plant species are found in the canyons, such as Santa Susana tarweed,
Hoover’s baccharis, Santa Monica live-forever, and the State and federally listed Pentochaeta lyonii. The
steep rugged canyons of natural beauty and tranquility provide visitors with a variety of recreational oppor-
tunities, including hiking, equestrian, and mountain bike trails, or resplendent contemplation.
2.3.6    Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District Recreation Facilities
The Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District (SMMUSD) operates three facilities within the City of
Malibu. Those schools within the City of Malibu include Cabrillo Elementary School, Webster Elementary
School, and Malibu High School. These schools provide recreational facilities and classrooms that may be
used by local residents. In addition to school recreational facilities, the SMMUSD leases its Point Dume
Elementary School to the Point Dume Community Service District for a Community Center. The school dis-
trict was also leasing property adjacent to the existing Malibu High School to Los Angeles County for opera-
tion of the equestrian center. The County is currently transferring the lease on this property to the City.
•     Cabrillo Elementary is located at 30227 Morningview Drive and serves grades K-5. Recreation facili-
      ties on-site include basketball courts, a blacktop, and a small grassy area. The school facilities are open
      to the public for use outside of regular school hours.
•     Malibu High School is located at 30215 Morningview Drive, adjacent to Cabrillo Elementary and just
      northwest of Point Dume. The school currently serves grades six through nine and will continue to add
      a grade for the next three years resulting in the service of grades 6 through 12 by the year 1995. The
      school site is approximately 49 acres. The SMMUSD leases approximately 20 of those acres (for one
      dollar a year) to the City (the lease is being transferred from the County in 1993) for the Malibu Eques-
      trian Center. Recreational facilities on-site include one swimming pool that has been void of water for
      several years, a track, an auditorium, one baseball field, two tennis courts, 15 outdoor basketball
      courts, a gym with one indoor basketball/volleyball court, and one football/soccer field. All fields and
      courts are open to the public and organized groups upon permit. The City has a shared-use agreement
                                                         89

trict, and private groups and include youth and adult sports programs, senior citizen activities, and special
interest programs. Youth sports programs include such activities as basketball, soccer, football, and baseball.
Various adult sports programs include softball and tennis. Senior citizen activities include special monthly
programs, travel tips, weekly book study group, and exercise program. Special interest programs include
numerous classes such as tap and jazz dancing, aerobics, martial arts, yoga, gymnastics, day camps, and af-
ter school child-care. Indoor recreation facilities used for the various programs include the Malibu Commu-
nity Center (on Fernhill Drive in Point Dume), the Malibu Bluffs Park located on Pacific Coast Highway,
the Michael Landon Community Center located at Malibu Bluffs Park, and the Malibu Lagoon State Beach
area.
2.3.8     Private Recreation Facilities
Private recreation consists of privately owned facilities which generally require some form of membership
or residence. Boating, tennis, and riding clubs exist throughout the. City. Beach clubs encompass beaches
for private use by members. In addition, there are a number of privately owned camps which include hiking,
camping, picnicking, and other outdoor recreational opportunities. Among these are Calamigos Star C
Ranch Camp, Jewish Centers Association, Bloomfield Foundation for the Junior Blind, and the Salvation
Army. Other private recreation facilities include the Malibu Tennis Club and the Malibu Riding and Tennis
Club.
Organized groups in Malibu that currently provide recreational opportunities include the Malibu Recrea-
tional Council, soccer associations, baseball leagues, softball leagues, football leagues, equestrian clubs, sen-
ior citizen groups, and religious groups.
Commercial recreation developments or facilities also serve public recreational needs. Sailing, surfing,
windsurfing, and scuba instruction and equipment rentals are available at locations in the Malibu Pier area.
Other commercial recreation activities include chartered boats, fishing, and horseback riding.
Visitor-serving facilities are defined to include private and public developments that provide accommoda-
tions, food and commercial-recreation developments, such as shopping, eating and amusement areas for
tourists. One recreational vehicle (RV) park—the Malibu RV Park—is located in Malibu near Malibu
Beach.

2.3.9     Trails
The Santa Monica Mountains Trail Council (SMMTC) works with many agencies, organizations, compa-
nies, and individuals to organize trail projects, coordinate volunteer trail maintenance, support acquisitions
of public land for trails, and promote public awareness and use of trails. Their greatest accomplishment has
been the adoption of their Comprehensive Trail Plan by Los Angeles County as part of their General Plan,
which includes 23 proposed trail routes. The County now works with landowners to preserve easements
along the adopted trails. The SMMTC plans to work with Ventura County in a similar manner in the future.
Figure OS-2 depicts the existing and proposed trails in and adjacent to the City of Malibu, which are listed
in the Comprehensive Trail Plan. Conceptually, there are three major components to the trails system, in-
cluding the Backbone Trail, which traverses the coastal zone from the City of Los Angeles to Ventura
County, a series of lateral trails which provide north-south access linking the Backbone Trail and coastal
areas, and a series of connector trails. Once ultimately completed, the trail system is intended to: (a) provide
an integrated network of trail corridors linking recreational facilities and public land to population centers;
(b) provide a functional linkage between coastal and mountain areas; (c) facilitate access to significant
physiographic and ecologic features; (d) establish connections with the regional trail network; and (e)
maximize safe opportunities for hiking and equestrian use.
The Backbone Trail is being completed in segments by the SMMTC. When it is complete, it will extend ap-
proximately 55 miles, linking the major parklands throughout the mountains and the City. While Figure OS-
2 only depicts proposed trails, there are smaller additional trails located within each park in the vicinity of
                                                              93

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
the City of Malibu which provide opportunities for exploration. Hiking guides and maps are available at ma-
jor park information centers.
Ten out of the 23 proposed trails are located within the City limits. They are as follows:
•     Coastal Slope Trail. The Coastal Slope Trail would connect Leo Carrillo State Beach and Charmlee
      Regional Park with the Backbone Trail near Saddle Peak. The trail would traverse several scenic can-
      yons with ocean views throughout. The trail intersects with several coastal canyon trails.
•     Corral Canyon Trail. This trail runs through Corral Canyon and would connect to the Coastal Slope
      Trail as well as the Solstice Canyon Trail. This trail would also connect Corral Canyon State Beach to
      Malibu Creek State Park.
•     Escondido Falls Trail. This trail would connect the Coastal Slope Trail with Escondido Falls.
•     Malibu Creek Trail. This trail, which would intersect with the Backbone Trail at Tapia County Park
      and with the Coastal Slope Trail, would connect the mountain parks with the Malibu Lagoon State
      Beach. Significant features along the path of the trail would include scenic canyon walls with rock out-
      croppings and the riparian habitat. The Malibu Creek Trail would be designated for hiking only.
•     Paradise Cove Trail. This trail would connect Paradise Cove along the coast with the Zuma Ridge,
      Ramirez Canyon, and via the Coastal Slope Trail, the Escondido Falls Trails.
•     Ramirez Canyon Lateral and Connector Trail. This trail would run along a ridge between Ramirez
      and Escondido Canyons connecting the Coastal Slope Trail with National Park Service property in
      Ramirez Canyon.
•     Solstice Canyon Trail. This trail would intersect with the Backbone and Coastal Slope Trails, provide
      a link between Malibu Creek State Park and the ocean. The trail route descends from north to south
      along the mid coastal slope, passes through a riparian corridor, and provides significant ocean views.
•     Three Park Trail. This trail would connect the Backbone Trail with Encinal Canyon Road and
      Charmlee Park and continue down to the Pacific Ocean. The proposed trail would also run along the
      spurs of Los Alisos Canyon, providing the hiker with ocean views.
•     Trancas Canyon Lateral Trail. This trail would connect the Backbone Trail with the Pacific Coast
      Highway and Zuma Beach, providing a link between the mountains and the ocean. The trail would run
      along the midslope of Trancas Canyon overlooking the ocean and riparian area.
•     Zuma Ridge Trail. This trail would be a main north-south cross mountain trail and would intersect
      with the Backbone Trail and five lateral trails. The trail would connect Zuma Canyon Park, the pro-
      posed Ramirez Canyon Park, Zuma Beach, and the Calabasas Landfill which is to be the site of a fu-
      ture regional park. The trail would traverse the Zuma Canyon Significant Watershed.
Peak uses of the majority of recreation facilities, in and adjacent to Malibu, occur between the months of
April and September. During peak use periods, maximum capacity is generally reached at the beaches.
Maximum capacity is defined as having been reached when the parking lot(s) serving the beach(es) are full.
In addition to the trails proposed in the Comprehensive Trail Plan, many trails and trail fragments have been
dedicated and proposed throughout the City. Some of these trails are in use. Other trails which are in use
have never been recorded. The resultant confusion has created some controversy concerning which trails
should be included in a comprehensive trails and access plan for the City.

The Open Space Subcommittee of the General Plan Task Force and the local trail committee have re-
searched dedications for trails and trails easements. Many of these trail dedications appear to be part of
roadway rights-of-way. Others provide important links among existing trails and access to the local beaches.
Local homeowners associations provided documentation that several of the dedicated trails were held in
common by the associations and not open to the general public. All roadways in Malibu may be considered a
source of trails right-of-way, but must be inspected to ensure there is an unobstructed right-of-way width
adequate to safely accommodate pedestrians and, as appropriate, equestrians. The trails dedication informa-
tion is provided by the Open Space Subcommittee of the General Plan Task Force as part of the Goals, Ob-
jectives and Policies of the General Plan. When title and physical adequacy have been verified, the informa-
tion will be a useful tool in development of a comprehensive trails plan for the City on an area-by-area basis,
after which unnecessary easements can be retired.

                                  2.4      Opportunities and Constraints
2.4.1     Overview
The preservation of open space is constrained by the rising property values and strong development pres-
sures that cause rapid development. Rapid development may adversely affect the preservation of open space
and visual resources, proceeding before adequate studies can be done.
Piecemeal development can contribute to the lack of a unified open space system in the Malibu area. Open
space provided by individual developments tends to be small, and often does not relate to neighboring parks,
trails, ridgelines, habitat linkages or other open space areas.
The National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) has set standards for the number, size, and type of
parks and recreation facilities required to adequately serve a given community. By these standards, the City
of Malibu is currently experiencing a shortage of such facilities. Future population growth will further in-
crease recreational needs and impact the existing facilities.
In order to meet the future needs of Malibu residents, several types of recreational facilities, ranging from
small tot lots and “vest pocket” parks to larger park facilities will be needed. Basic criteria for the provision
of public parks and specialized recreation facilities are shown in Tables 2-3 and 2-4.
Neighborhood parks normally serve a neighborhood population within a one-quarter to one-half mile radius.
Generally, these parks are set aside for passive recreation such as walking and relaxation. The park normally
requires 5 to 15 acres; however, the size may vary depending on the size of the neighborhood and the prox-
imity to a community park.
These constraints are balanced by numerous opportunities available to the City. Some of these opportunities
include the availability of state and federal funds. In the past few years, voters have approved several bond
issues for the acquisition of parks and recreational facilities. In addition, because large portions of the hill-
sides and mountains in and around the City have very steep slopes that are not suitable for development,
many of these areas are potential candidates for future acquisitions. The Santa Monica Mountains Conser-
vancy, the Mountain Restoration Trust, the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the National
Park Service all have plans for future parkland acquisition. In addition, other parks may be developed
through donations of land (such as the recent donation by Barbra Streisand of property to the Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy).
Community parks provide for a variety of active recreational opportunities such as outdoor organized sports
and passive services for all age groups. Such activities normally require more space than a neighborhood
park, and are typically designed to serve a population of 20,000 to 30,000. The suggested size requires an
area of 15 to 20 acres with at least two thirds of the area developed for active recreation purposes. Beaches
are not designated under this category.

  2.4.2      Deficiencies and Projected Needs
  Based on the NRPA standards, and a 1990 Census-estimated population of 11,116, the City should have ap-
  proximately 27.8 acres of neighborhood parks, 27.8 acres of community parks, and 222 acres of regional
  parks; based on the projected population of 14,254 in the year 2010, the City should have 35 acres of
  neighborhood parks, 35 acres of community parks, and 280 acres of regional parks. Currently, Malibu has
                                                                           97
OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
1,869.9 acres of dedicated open space, which is substantially more than is currently needed or projected to
be needed. Many of these parks serve more than one function. Neighborhood park needs may be met by all
of the parks, because all may be used for walking and relaxation. Malibu Bluffs Park is a regional park, but
offers community park facilities. There are thousands of additional acres of county, state, and national park-
land located outside City limits. Most of these parklands are within hiking distance, or accessible in minutes
by car. These parklands are open to the public and are used regularly by Malibu residents. It can be assumed
that these parklands could satisfy the regional park requirements for the City.
Deficiencies may be found in the distribution of developed recreational facilities. The City has only 15.2
acres of community park, the Malibu Community Center and part of Malibu Bluffs Park, resulting in a defi-
ciency of about 12.6 acres of community parks. The remainder of the community is without easy access to
these types of recreational facilities, except as residents they may access facilities common to their private
residential communities or the private clubs to which they may belong. These needs may appropriately be
met with Play Lots and Vest Pocket Parks throughout the community.
In addition to parkland requirements, there are NRPA standards for specialized facilities (see Table 2-4).
Based on the current Malibu population, a minimum of two baseball fields, four softball diamonds or youth
ball fields, six tennis courts, 22 basketball courts, one outdoor theater and one swimming pool should be
provided by the City for its residents. The maximum range on Table 2-4 indicates the standard which should
be met if the City population increases according to projections developed for the General Plan. Assuming
the swimming pool at Malibu Middle/High School is repaired, the remaining current-to-projected needs in-
clude one swimming pool, four to six tennis courts, and four to 14 basketball courts. It may be argued that
the auditorium at the Malibu Community Center serves community needs for theater space which if met by
an outdoor theater would not conform to the City goal of reducing the community noise level.
Also, as noted in the NRPA standards, in smaller communities regional parks may serve the entire popula-
tion. This is true for Malibu; however, the City is experiencing pressures related to privacy issues in parks
for residents. Some of the pressures may be relieved by opening school playgrounds to the public, or by City
acquisition of small parcels of vacant infill parcels to develop as small neighborhood pocket parks. There are
many acres of vacant land available for small park facilities. Despite the lack of smaller local parks, the
large number of regional parks does alleviate some of the pressures for outdoor activities. In addition, there
are several acres of beach land located throughout the City that are used by the residents of the community
and visitors as well.
Although the City’s limited financial resources may restrict its ability to purchase land for open space pres-
ervation and parks and recreation needs, grants and state or federal funds may be available to the City. City
funds are more likely to be spent first on high priority items, such as providing infrastructure and public ser-
vices to residents. In addition to limited funds available for the purchase of land and facilities for park and
recreation programs, rising park development and maintenance costs have curtailed parkland expansions in
recent years. Even if parkland can be acquired, the costs of developing and operating the park facilities can
be prohibitive.
2.4.3    Trail System
Existing trails within the City limits may be a constraint to homeowners. Unmarked trails appear on private
residential properties. Due to the proposed trail systems adoption prior to City incorporation, the system re-
flects the Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy,
                                                        98

and the National Park Service ideas and desires. There is a lack of cohesiveness with the trail system and the
existing structures and property owners in Malibu. A revised trail map reflecting the needs of the City along
with other responsible and interested agencies should be created in the near future.
The proposed trail system, while providing the opportunity to link regional and local parks and cities, would
also result in more foot and vehicular traffic through residential neighborhoods. Trails extending through or
adjacent to private homes will reduce privacy for most affected homeowners. Hikers normally drive to
Malibu and park before starting on the trails. Adequate parking facilities at trailheads should be provided.

               2.5       Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures
2.5.1 OS GOAL 1:              AN ABUNDANCE OF OPEN SPACE CONTRIBUTING TO A RURAL,
                              NATURAL ENVIRONMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPEN SPACE
                              MANAGEMENT PLAN
OS OBJECTIVE 1.1:             AMPLE AND DIVERSE PUBLIC PARKLAND AND OPEN SPACE, INTE-
                              GRATED BY CIRCULATORY AND VISUAL LINKS, TO CREATE A RU-
                              RAL, OPEN FEELING.
      OS Policy 1.1.1:        The City shall encourage acquisition and dedication of appropriate land into
                              parks.
      OS Policy 1.1.2:        The City shall pursue all appropriate site acquisition, maintenance and program
                              funding opportunities.

                              natural open space as a scenic resource of great value and importance to the qual-
                              ity of life of residents and to the enhancement of the scenic experience of visi-
                              tors.
To implement these policies the City shall:
OS Implementation Measure 1: Work with other agencies to develop an Open Space Acquisition Program
that includes detailed scientific studies of land characteristics to determine suitability, possible multiple-uses
of areas and the environmental impact of proposed acquisition.
OS Implementation Measure 2: Actively seek donations and grants, and when economically feasible fund,
purchases of beach access easements and inland and shoreline properties for open space and recreational
uses.
OS Implementation Measure 3: Support acquisition by public agencies and private conservancies of prop-
erties appropriate for parks.
OS Implementation Measure 4: Create a land trust program that accepts donations of land and preserves it
for open space including a system of incentives for donations of land.
OS Implementation Measure 5: Evaluate all opportunities to purchase vacant Santa Monica-Malibu Uni-
fied School District or tax delinquent properties located in Malibu for neighborhood or community park use.
OS Implementation Measure 6: Require property owners to mitigate the impact of development on park-
land and open space through dedications of land or payment of in-lieu fees.
OS Implementation Measure 7: Develop incentives to encourage owners of contiguous legal lots to con-
solidate the lots into larger, single holdings.
OS Implementation Measure 8: Notify the National Park Service of proposed developments outside exist-
ing developed areas.

OS OBJECTIVE 1.2:           PORTIONS OF PRIVATELY OWNED PARCELS REMAIN AS NATURAL
                            OPEN SPACE.
       OS Policy 1.2.1:     The City shall encourage dedication and maintenance of private open space to
                            preserve Malibu’s natural and rural character.
       OS Policy 1.2.2:     The City shall encourage clustering of development to preserve large, unbroken
                            blocks of open space where clustering can be accomplished without creating ur-
                            ban development patterns in rural areas.
       OS Policy 1.2.3:     The City shall require development to link and integrate open space visually and
                            link open space to activity centers, other open spaces and scenic routes through a
                            system of trails.
       OS Policy 1.2.4:     The City shall work cooperatively with schools to stretch the tax dollars through
                            joint use of areas and facilities and co-sponsorship of programs and special
                            events.
To implement these policies the City shall:
OS Implementation Measure 9: Develop and implement a program/system of incentives to encourage vol-
untary dedication and maintenance of natural open space areas. Incentives may include (a) reduced setbacks,
(b) increased grading, and (c) increased structure size.
OS Implementation Measure 10: Regulate construction activities to eliminate potentially destructive prac-
tices that remove topsoil or dump soils in areas intended to be preserved as open space.
OS Implementation Measure 11: Develop and implement a transfer development credit program resulting
in permanent open space. This program shall provide incentives to retire otherwise developable parcels that
are geologically unstable, in floodways or are otherwise environmentally sensitive.
OS OBJECTIVE 1.3:           OPEN SPACE THAT COMPLIMENTS THE CITY’S HEALTH AND SAFETY
                            POLICIES.
       OS Policy 1.3.1:     The City shall favor the dedication of open space where the dedicated land could
                            be used to prevent damage from fires; flood, landslides and other natural hazards.
To implement this policy the City shall:
OS Implementation Measure 12: Where necessary to mitigate the potentially hazardous impacts of devel-
opment, require dedication of open space.
OS Implementation Measure 13: Seek Fire Department cooperation in protecting coastal sage scrub habi-
tat from unnecessary clearing.
OS Implementation Measure 14: Encourage multiple use of public land and easements, where appropriate,
such as use of flood zones, for recreational purposes including trails, consistent with protection of Resource
Protection Areas (“RPAs”).

                             ment for future generations.
To implement these policies the City shall:
OS Implementation Measure 15: Conduct a neighborhood by neighborhood study to identify any unmet
need for local parks.
OS Implementation Measure 16: Adopt and implement a master plan of parks and recreation based upon
the character and desires of the community as one of the several components of the City’s integrated capital
budget.
OS Implementation Measure 17: Consider special bond issues to implement the Parks Master Plan for fi-
nancing land acquisition and capital improvements.
OS Implementation Measure 18: Design parks, including selection of materials and location and design of
any permanent structures, to compliment the natural rural beauty of the site.
OS Implementation Measure 19: Accept private land donations which are consistent with the master plan
of parks and recreation and compatible with the recreation policy of Malibu to be conveyed (with restric-

To implement these policies the City shall:
OS Implementation Measure 23: Develop design criteria for recreation-serving facilities to minimize traf-
fic, noise and visual impacts on adjacent neighborhoods. The criteria shall, at minimum, prohibit outdoor
lighting from illuminating beyond the parameter of the site, require appropriate fencing and screens for ball
fields, golf and tennis courts and similar recreation facilities, and require access from an arterial street where
feasible.
OS Implementation Measure 24: Secure locations for two soccer fields and two baseball diamonds suit-
able for use by the Little League or similar organizations.
OS Implementation Measure 25: Develop and post an appropriate set of park rules which encourage re-
spect for the facility in all its aspects, including respect for fellow users.
OS Implementation Measure 26: Permit only passive recreational activities in environmentally sensitive
areas, including hiking, nature study, horseback riding, bicycling, picnics, sunbathing, swimming, surfing,
diving, and photography.
OS Implementation Measure 27: Require that entrance roads, fee kiosks, parking facilities and other nec-
essary developments in recreation areas be designed to maintain environmental and visual compatibility with
the surrounding area.
OS Implementation Measure 28: New paving for parking lots shall not be permitted on sandy beaches
unless a comparable replacement area of sandy beach is restored through removal of existing paving or
structures.
OS Implementation Measure 29: Develop shared-use agreements with the school district and other public
agencies which make available sports facilities, libraries, fields, classrooms, and auditoriums for public rec-
reation.

2.5.3 OS GOAL 3:            AN INTEGRATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM OF PUBLIC TRAILS
OS OBJECTIVE 3.1:           A COMPREHENSIVE, SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE TRAIL SYSTEM SERV-
                            ING HIKERS, EQUESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS.
       OS Policy 3.1.1:     The City shall create a safe, properly maintained trail system throughout
                            Malibu’s mountains and seashore that can achieve the following:
                            •     Link major recreational facilities;
                            •     Link with trail systems of other jurisdictions;
                            •     Provide recreational corridors between the mountains and the coast;
                            •     Provide for flexible, site-specific design and routing to minimize impact on
                                  adjacent property, communities, and fragile habitats. In particular, ensure
                                  that trails located within ESHAs are designed to protect fish and wildlife;
                            •     Provide connections with populated areas;
                            •     Provide for and be designed to accommodate multiple use (walking, hiking,
                                  equestrian and bicycle) wherever appropriate;
                            •     Facilitate linkages to local trail systems;
                            •     Provide for a diversity of recreational and aesthetic experiences;
                            •     Designate trail use by physical constraints;
                            •     Prohibit motorized vehicle on public trails.
       OS Policy 3.1.2:     The City shall seek to protect the residents from inappropriate or irresponsible
                            use of designated trails.
       OS Policy 3.1.3:     The City shall favor trails that alleviate trespass and do not infringe on the pri-
                            vacy of residents.
To implement these policies the City shall:
OS Implementation Measure 41: Map trails systems and bicycle routes within the City and connecting to
trails outside the City using existing information including, but not limited to, that gathered from historical
maps, subdivision maps, tract maps, Malibu Trails Association data, Santa Monica Mountains Trails Asso-
ciation, Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation, State Parks and the National Park Ser-
vice.
OS Implementation Measure 42: Develop a comprehensive trails plan on an area by area basis based on
the information gathered in connection with the trails map for the primary purpose of connecting trails
within the City and joining them to trails in its planning area.
OS Implementation Measure 43: Explore east-west routes for pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails to
enable people to move throughout Malibu avoiding Pacific Coast Highway.

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
OS Implementation Measure 44: Give priority in implementation to proposed trails, especially bicycle
routes, located adjacent to or leading to schools and recreation facilities and trail systems for cross town
connections.
OS Implementation Measure 45: Ensure public participation during the preliminary planning and selection
of final alignment of trails.
OS Implementation Measure 46: Examine every development application for the existence of easements
that connect with, and continue to allow public access to, recreation and open space areas, and monitor con-
struction with a view toward the preservation of those easements.
OS Implementation Measure 47: Mark public trails and bicycle lanes with directional signs coordinated
with the natural environment for identification and access and provide buffers to ensure protection of sensi-
tive environmental resources.
OS Implementation Measure 48: Establish trailheads and/or equestrian staging areas on a trails plan and
give priority to regional trail connections.
OS Implementation Measure 49: Work with other agencies to ensure adequate parking at all established
trailheads and staging areas.
OS Implementation Measure 50: Incorporate safety standards into all trail and bicycle route designs such
as minimum width standards, posting level of difficulty notices, and segregating bicycle from equestrian
trails.
OS Implementation Measure 51: Incorporate safe street crossing provisions into any trails/routes crossing
highways and roads and establish formal “crossings” on a trails plan.
OS Implementation Measure 52: Reclaim public streets for trail use by requiring the removal of walls,
landscaping and similar obstructions in public rights-of-way.
OS Implementation Measure 53: Where possible, obtain trail dedications and easements consistent with
the trails plan.
OS Implementation Measure 54: Prohibit grading of trails that inhibits their safe use and work with other
agencies to unblock trail/road easements to allow for safe passage of trail users.
OS Implementation Measure 55: Adopt procedures for investigating the validity of prescriptive rights.
Where public prescriptive rights or implied dedication (historic public use) is found, require an offer of
dedication or an equivalent public access easement. Site development in an area of historic public use only if
equivalent type, intensity and area of replacement public access is provided on or within 1,000 feet of the
project parcel.
OS Implementation Measure 56: Post and maintain directional and regulatory signs in publicly accessible
RPAs.

OS OBJECTIVE 3.2:            ACCESS TO THE BEACH AND SHORELINE CONSISTENT WITH THE
                             PROTECTION OF COASTAL RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION.
       OS Policy 3.2.1:      The City shall require reasonable and equitable beach access for the public, bal-
                             ancing the rights of the individual property owner and the public’s right of ac-
                             cess.
To implement these policies the City shall:
OS Implementation Measure 57: Prepare a beach accessway map to show dedicated accessways and ac-
cessways that are improved and opened. Evaluate all proposed access dedications considering site-specific
circumstances including topography, the capacity of the site to sustain use at the intensity anticipated, the
proximity to adjacent residential uses, the impact on privacy of adjacent owners, the feasibility for providing
litter collection, and the public safety.
OS Implementation Measure 58: Assure that improvements are in place and a public agency is willing to
accept management of an accessway before opening a beach accessway requiring vertical pedestrian path-
ways.
OS Implementation Measure 59: Offer beach agreements in areas where the beach is bordered by residen-
tial development. The agreements may establish permitted and prohibited uses and, conditions of use (such
as hours and areas subject to use) taking into account the particular beach’s characteristics, potential recrea-
tional opportunities and existence of public vertical and lateral accessways.
OS Implementation Measure 60: To mitigate the impacts of development, in connection with development
agreements require dedicated beach accessways.
OS Implementation Measure 61: Unless the public interest on a particular site implicates different stan-
dards, the design standards and accessway goals for the City are as follows:
Vertical Access: For all land divisions, nonresidential new development, and residential development on
lots with 75 or more feet of frontage, or with an existing drainage or utility easement connecting a public
street with the shoreline, or on groups of two or more lots with 50 feet or more of frontage per lot, an irrevo-
cable offer of dedication of an easement to allow public vertical access to the mean high tide line shall be
required, unless needed public access is already fulfilled by an existing developed accessway within the
standard of separation provided under “Beach Access Program” (Table 2-5). Such offer of dedication shall
be valid for a period of 21 years, and shall be recorded free of prior liens except tax liens. The access ease-
ment shall measure at least 10 feet wide. Where two or more offers of dedication closer to each other than
needed for reasonable access have been made pursuant to this policy, the physical improvement and opening
to public use of offered accessways sufficient to meet such need shall result in the abandonment of other
unnecessary offers.
Exceptions to the above requirement for offers of dedication may be made for beaches identified as needing
limitations on access in order to protect sensitive marine resources.
Lateral Access: For all development between the first public road and the ocean, an irrevocable offer of
dedication of an easement to allow public lateral access along the shoreline shall be required unless findings
are made consistent with Section 30212 of the California Coastal Act, that access is inconsistent with public
safety. Such offers of dedication shall run with the land in favor of a public agency or private association
                                                       107

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
approved by the City. Such offers shall be in effect for a period of 21 years, and shall be recorded free of
prior liens, except tax liens.
The area subject to an access easement shall extend from the mean high tide line landward to (a) the dripline
of an existing or proposed structure, or (b) to the top outer face of an approved seawall or revetment, or (c)
to the base of the bluff where the bluff exceeds five feet in height, whichever is further seaward. Where the
easement area adjoins a residential structure, as in (a) above, a strip 10-feet wide, measured seaward from
the structure, shall be available only for public pass and repass when the remainder of the easement area is
not passable.
Notwithstanding the above requirements, the lateral access requirement on lots fronting Broad Beach shall
be as follows: an irrevocable offer of dedication of an easement from the mean high tide line to a line 25 feet
inland of the daily high water line. This offer of dedication shall state that the daily high water line is under-
stood by all parties to be ambulatory from day to day, as is the 25-foot wide strip of dry, sandy beach. In no
case shall said access easement be closer than 10 feet to the approved development. On shoreline developed
with residential uses, the required lateral access easement shall be limited to passive recreational use.
In addition, all fences, no trespassing signs, and other obstructions that may limit public lateral access within
the dedicated easement or deed-restricted area shall be removed as a condition of development approval.
The City shall support acceptance of offers of dedication by appropriate groups or governmental agencies.
OS Implementation Measure 62: Impose appropriate development fees to mitigate the impacts of commer-
cial development on beach access and explore other methods to finance the construction and maintenance of
new vertical access points.
OS Implementation Measure 63: Require parking lots for general office buildings be designed with the
goal of serving not only office development during ordinary working hours, but also public beach parking
during off hours, in conjunction with public transit or shuttle buses serving beach recreation areas.
OS Implementation Measure 64: Work with other agencies to ensure that existing developed accessways
are not closed, abandoned or rendered unusable..
OS Implementation Measure 65: Use the following criteria when acquiring and improving vertical ac-
cessways and to determine the appropriate frequency of public accessway locations in view of localized
beach settings and conditions:
•     Priorities for improved vertical public access in the City shall be in accordance with Table 2-5. These
      priorities are based on (a) the extent to which existing, opened accessways fulfill the need for vertical
      accessways and (b) the need to protect sensitive environmental resources.
•     Improvement of access to sandy beaches where there is no current public access.
•     Improvement of accessways already in public ownership or by accepting offers of dedication which
      were already made where to do so would allow the agency to avoid requiring future unnecessary offers
      of dedication.
•     Capacity to allow emergency vehicle passage from highway to beach and return, except where steep-
      ness or the existence of stairs would not allow vehicle use.
•     Improvement of accessways where parking or access to a public transit stop is available. Where possi-
      ble, new off-street parking or public transit facilities should be provided.

    Matador. Two vertical access offers of dedication shall be required in the area between Nicholas Canyon and El Pescador for a separation of ap-
    proximately one accessway per quarter mile. Development of the El Sol accessway may satisfy one of the two requirements. The second offer of
    dedication shall be located at least 600 feet west of El Sol.
(2) Adequate physical access via Point Dume State Park area.
(3) Public purchase of sandy beach for passive recreational purposes and other recreation-supporting facility, e.g., restored pier.
(4) Dedication required to meet an objective of one vertical accessway in addition to those existing at Escondido Creek and Geoffrey’s. One of the
    two is presently under construction under management of the Surfrider Foundation.
(5) Access locations at this time are unknown. Requires Access Map update.

                                            3.1       Introduction
3.1.0    Overview
The following information provides an overview and summary of the natural resources in the City of
Malibu. This information is only a summary of the more detailed information provided in the “Conservation
Element Background Report” presented in a Technical Appendix to the Malibu General Plan.
3.1.1    Legislative Authorization
The California Government Code requires all city and county general plans to contain a Conservation Ele-
ment as part of the General Plan. Specifically, Government Code Section 65302 requires that a conservation
element address the conservation, development and utilization of natural resources including:
•     Beaches and shoreline              •      Rivers and other waters
•     Fisheries                          •      Soils
•     Forests                            •      Water and its hydraulic force
•     Harbors                            •      Watersheds
•     Minerals                           •      Wildlife
•     Plants
3.1.2    Purpose and Scope
The purpose of the Conservation Element is to serve as a guide for the conservation, protection, restoration
and management, development, and appropriate and responsible utilization of the City’s existing natural re-
sources. Substantial areas of land within the City of Malibu and north of the City within the Malibu Coastal
Zone (MCZ) are undeveloped or contain an abundance of natural resources. To protect these resources, it is
important for the City to establish policies which promote intelligent management of the resources. These
policies should address a variety of natural resources issues that include water quality, coastal and slope ero-
sion, maintenance of unique plant communities, habitat protection, and viable populations of plants and
wildlife, and preservation of visual resources.
The MCZ (Figure CO-1) is used as the geographic unit whose resources are addressed by this Conservation
Element. The resources of this area are addressed because natural resources located within the City limits are
(a) an extension of resources located elsewhere within the MCZ, (b) intimately interrelated with other re-
sources located elsewhere in the MCZ, and (c) potentially affected by impacts to other resources within the
MCZ. The resources of the entire MCZ are also addressed because (d) they provide significant opportunities
to residents and visitors to the City and (e) the City’s sphere of influence may include these resources in the
future.

                                    3.2      Existing Natural Resources
3.2.0    In General
The City of Malibu is located on the coastal slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains and is bounded by the
Pacific Ocean to the south. The City has a variety of unique natural resources due to this juxtaposition be-
tween the mountains and the ocean. These resources include canyon and coastal topography; a. variety of
terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats; rare, threatened and endangered species of plants and wildlife;
and numerous historic, archaeological and paleontological sites. These resources, as well as other natural
assets, are each addressed in greater detail within the Conservation Element.
3.2.1    Air Resources and Climate
3.2.1.1      Regional Meteorology/Climatology
Malibu’s climate is classified as dry summer subtropic or Mediterranean. Regions within this climate zone
are characterized by hot, dry summers with relatively cool, moist winters. This climate only occurs in five
areas of the world at approximately 33 degrees latitude on the western edges of continents and includes:
southern California; central Chile; southern Australia; the cape region of South Africa; and the Mediterra-
nean region of Europe. Only about three percent of the world’s land surface have this climate. The unique
characteristics of the Mediterranean climate regime, particularly the extended period of summer drought,
have led to the evolution of distinctive associations of plant and animal species.
The regional climate is controlled almost entirely by the semi-permanent Pacific High Pressure Cell (Pacific
High) and the cold water California Current. The summer climate is strongly influenced by stable air flow-
ing out of the Pacific High to the west. During the Malibu winter the Pacific High migrates south putting the
City on the fringe of the influence of a low pressure cell. The combined effect of these meteorologic and
oceanographic systems is a tempering of local weather such that extremes of wind, temperature and precipi-
tation are relatively uncommon.
Skies are mostly clear from mid-summer through autumn. Heavy cloud cover and fog occur primarily during
spring and early summer when stratus clouds associated with the marine layer move in from the west. Com-
pared to other locations of the same latitude and climate, Malibu summers are generally cooler with tem-
peratures in the upper 60s to low 70s, and winters tend to be mild within the range of the upper 50s to low
60s.
3.2.1.2      Air Pollution Meteorology
The City of Malibu is located within the South Coast Air Basin. The South Coast Air Basin’s air quality is
affected not only by the emission sources located in the region, but also to a large extent by three natural
factors or combinations of: (a) terrain; (b) a dominant on-shore flow; and (c) atmospheric inversion. The first
of these factors is static, but plays a significant role by placing a natural barrier to emission dispersion north
and east of the metropolitan Los Angeles area.
The second factor provides the driving mechanism for both air pollution transport and dispersion. This
mechanism has been shown to be a predominantly on-shore flow. Air pollution which has its origins in the
industrial areas along the coast and immediately inland is driven toward the natural terrain barrier mentioned
above with the result that horizontal dispersion is severely limited. The effect of this second factor can be
seen as a gradual degradation of air quality from coastal to inland areas. Malibu is typical of some of the
                                                         122

                                                                                CONSERVATION ELEMENT
South Coast Air Basin’s best air quality areas because of its location along the coast upwind from most mo-
bile and stationary sources. The greatest impacts can be seen in the San Gabriel Valley and near Riverside at
the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains.
The third factor which affects air quality involves atmospheric inversions which limit dispersion of air pollu-
tion on a vertical scale. Inversions can be classified into one of two general categories: (1) inversion aloft or
(2) surface based inversions. These two categories are the result of different meteorologic conditions and
tend to affect different sources.
Inversions aloft are probably the most critical factor in the degradation of regional air quality. The condition
is defined by a vertical temperature profile which initially conforms to standard conditions. For example,
temperature typically decreases with height. However, under inversion conditions temperature begins to in-
crease at some height above the ground. This height is called the base of the inversion. The temperature in-
crease continues through an unspecified layer after which the temperature change with height returns to
standard conditions. The inversion layer is typically very stable and acts as a cap to the vertical dispersions
of pollutants.
The largely undeveloped Santa Monica Mountains provide some amelioration of air quality impacts from
the urbanized Los Angles basin.
3.2.1.3     Air Quality Regulatory Environment
The basis for determining the significance of air quality impacts generated by a base case project are the
State and Federal Ambient Air Quality Standards (AAQS). These standards define the level of air quality
capable of protecting the public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety. The AAQS were de-
veloped to protect those portions of the population most susceptible to respiratory distress. Classified as sen-
sitive receptors, this group includes persons with asthma or other respiratory disorders, the elderly, very
young children and hospital patients. Normally, healthy adults can tolerate periodic exposure to air pollution
in concentrations well above the standards. However, even this segment of the population has shown signs
of deteriorating health under long term exposure to air pollution at or above the standards.
The Federal standards were established in 1971 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA
allows states to adopt standards of their own as long as they are at least as stringent as those issued at the
Federal level. California, due to the complexity of its air quality problems, adopted its AAQS prior to the
adoption of the Federal standards.
In 1976 the State legislature enacted the Lewis Air Quality Management Act which established the South
Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and required it, in conjunction with the Counties and
Cities within the District, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) and the State Department of Transportation (Caltrans), to develop a plan to attain
and maintain the State Ambient Air Quality Standards in the South Coast Air Basin. The SCAQMD, how-
ever, is responsible only for local stationary sources of pollution while CARB retains authority over all mo-
bile source emissions.
3.2.2    Mineral Resources
In order to promote the conservation of the State’s mineral resources and ensure adequate reclamation of
mined lands, the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) was enacted. SMARA requires
that the State geologist classify land in California for its mineral resource potential. Local governments are
                                                       123

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
required to incorporate the mineral classification reports and maps into their general plans in order for the
resources to be given consideration when making land use decisions.
Sand and gravel resources are the only mineral resources which have been mapped in western Los Angeles
County. However, to date the State Division of Mines and Geology has not mapped these resources or other
mineral resources in the Malibu area. Given the presence of the numerous incised canyons and drainages,
sand and gravel resources are expected to occur in the MCZ. Mapping of this area is scheduled to occur
prior to 1996 if the appropriate funding is allocated (R. Miller, State Division of Mines and Geology, per-
sonal communication).
3.2.3    Soil Resources
Soil types in the City of Malibu have been classified by the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service (SCS). (Note that the SCS has recently been reorganized as the Natural Resources
Conservation Service, NRCS.) These SCS classifications are associated with identified soil capabilities
which may be used in planning for agricultural, urban, watershed, recreational and wilderness uses. The
identified soil capabilities provide the basis from which opportunities and constraints associated with soil
resources are identified.
The SCS has identified 22 soil series and 45 soil phases in the Malibu area (Malibu Soil Survey, 1967). Soil
series are soils that are grouped together because they have a similar set of soil profile characteristics. The
soil phase is a division of the soil series in which the soils are grouped together by common surface and sub-
strata characteristics. Important characteristics used to determine soil phase are surface texture, slope and
quantity of stones.
Agricultural land is limited within Malibu. This limitation is primarily due to the patchy distribution of soils
that have high capability for agricultural uses, and that these soils typically occur along the low relief slopes
adjacent to the coast. These areas are the same areas which have the highest capability for urban develop-
ment and many have already been developed. As a consequence, agriculture currently accounts for only 52.4
acres (0.5%) of all land uses within the City. Historically, agricultural uses, including grazing, were much
more widespread and these previous uses may have influenced the types of plant communities which are
currently found in the City.
Over 80% of the soils identified by the SCS in the Santa Monica Mountains have high or very high erosion
potential. The native vegetation is critical to protecting the soil from erosion, particularly on steep slopes.
Removal of vegetation leads to accelerated erosion which adversely impacts stream and marine resources.
The engineering capabilities identified by the SCS are also a very useful planning tool for the City of
Malibu. Soil suitability for road and building construction, recreation facilities, septic tank filter fields and
other uses are all identified in the Malibu Soil Survey (1967). Further discussion of soils, especially as they
relate to engineering capabilities is provided in the Safety Element.
3.2.4    Water Resources
The City of Malibu is located within a 27 mile coastal stretch along the Pacific Ocean. There are numerous
streams and creeks which drain the hillsides and canyons within this area. In addition, Malibu Lagoon,
which is located at the mouth of Malibu Creek, is one of two significant coastal marshes occurring in Los
Angeles County.

3.2.4.1      Surface Water
There are 44 blueline streams identified by the United States Geological Service (USGS) within the City of
Malibu. These streams include perennial and intermittent streams which are defined by a variety of non-
standardized, qualitative criteria such as the presence of riparian vegetation, a stream bed, or actual hydrol-
ogy. Many of the USGS bluelines have not been updated since 1950 and there are many channels that are
not significantly different hydrologically from streams with blueline status. Consequently, the identification
of all hydrological channels that are associated with the City of Malibu has not been conducted. To effec-
tively manage these drainages would require development of new qualitative, as well as quantitative, criteria
based on floodplain width, flow rate and periodicity, erodibility, riparian vegetation, presence of sensitive
flora and fauna, and human influence on channel hydraulics. The location, significance, constraints, and op-
portunities associated with these channels can be determined only after development of these criteria.
There are 62 identified watersheds which occur within the boundaries of the City of Malibu (Malibu Waste-
water Management Study, 1992). These watersheds consist of smaller, coastal terrace watersheds which of-
ten have their headwaters located within a few hundred feet of the ocean and large watersheds which drain
the coastal drainages of the Santa Monica Mountains (Figure CO-2 illustrates the 28 major mountain drain-
ages). Malibu Creek is the only cross-mountain watershed and drains portions of the Simi Hills in addition
to portions of the Santa Monica Mountains. The largest watershed is the Malibu Creek coastal watershed
which drains an area of approximately 74,000 acres (115 square miles). Large coastal watersheds include
Ramirez (4.5 square miles), Las Flores (4.75 square miles), Solstice (4.43 square miles), Trancas (8.39
square miles), and Zuma Canyon (8.86 square miles), Topanga (19.68 square miles) and Arroyo Sequit
(10.96 square miles).
Of the watersheds identified within the City boundaries, 22 of the drainage areas extend beyond the northern
boundary and are affected by residents and agencies not under the jurisdiction of the City of Malibu. Effec-
tive management of these watersheds requires joint-powers agreements designed to protect downstream re-
sources and users of these resources.
Watersheds are the basic geographic unit within which non-point sources of pollution and sedimentation can
be addressed. Within the City of Malibu these sources of water quality contamination are primarily associ-
ated with upstream discharge of treated effluent from lands inland of the City and stormwater conveyance of
fertilizers, manure, petroleum products (i.e., gasoline, oil, other lubricants), chemicals from car exhaust,
livestock (i.e., horses), commercial discharges, sedimentation and dispersed contributions of pathogens from
local septic systems (Malibu Wastewater Management Study, 1992). Much of the chemical contamination is
originally derived from the surfaces of pavement and other forms of hardscape, while increased sediment
loads are associated with grading, excavation, and other forms of vegetation disturbance (i.e., fires, grazing,
agricultural practices, vegetation removal for fire and flood control).
The primary sources of discharge to City of Malibu watersheds are the Tapia Water Reclamation Facility
(TWRF) at Calabasas and urban stormwater runoff. The former source of discharge is only associated with
Malibu Creek. TWRF is known to discharge up to 7.4 million gallons per day (daily average during March
1991) of treated effluent to the upper reaches of the drainage; TWRF has permits to expand to 16 million
gallons per day. These discharges, however, have varied widely from season-to-season and year-to-year
(Harris, 1991; Gearhart and Waller, 1989). As an example, 1990 was a low release year because the Las
Virgenes Water District sold all of its discharge for July, August, and September. Although effluent from the
TWRF has accounted for a significant portion of the past annual flow in the creek, especially during the
                                                       125
CONSERVATION ELEMENT
summer months, demand for reclaimed water now reportedly exceeds supply and it is unknown if TWRF
discharges will continue to provide significant flow to Malibu Creek (Malibu Wastewater Management
Study, 1992; Steve Witbeck, TWRF, pers. comm.). TWRF’s goal is to reclaim all water entering the facility,
but achievement of this goal is dependent upon demand for the water. Recent trends do indicate that summer
demand for the water is very high. This period of peak demand coincides with the period in which dis-
charges to Malibu Creek would have the greatest potential adverse effects, although significant impact from
overflow due to winter storms also occurs. These effects are primarily associated with seasonal flow and
nutrient loading.
The stormwater drainage system which has been constructed in the Malibu area was designed for the pur-
pose of flood control and gave little consideration to water quality, seasonality, and destination. In addition,
the system has not only transported stormwater and its associated contaminants, but has been used as an
overflow “fail safe” for sewage pump stations. At present, stormwater runoff within the MCZ does not re-
ceive deliberate treatment, though certain small marshes may provide some treatment through natural proc-
esses. The stormwater drainage system within the City of Malibu therefore conveys a variety of potentially
harmful contaminants to Malibu Lagoon and Santa Monica Bay.
Malibu Creek empties into Malibu Lagoon. Malibu Lagoon is a small brackish estuary of approximately 13
acres (exclusive of adjacent associated land), but is significant since it is one of only two remaining coastal
marshes in Los Angeles County. The estuary provides major migratory bird habitat, fish migration and
spawning habitat, and it affects adjoining water-based recreation at Surfrider Beach. The estuary is main-
tained by a sandbar that lies between the Malibu Creek outlet and the ocean. Periodically, the estuary is open
to the ocean when creek flows have enough energy to push through the sandbar to the ocean. The estuary is
also artificially opened to the ocean by the State Department of Parks and Recreation when its waters sur-
pass 3.5 feet in depth. Due to increased surface discharges from Malibu Creek, increased baseflow during
the summer, and the seasonal closure of the sand bar, the estuary experiences a variety of water quality prob-
lems which include eutrophication from nutrients, potential health risks from pathogens, rapid and/or un-
natural changes in pH and salinity gradients, sedimentation and temperature.
3.2.4.2     Water Supply
The City of Malibu’s water supply is provided by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
(MWD). The MWD obtains its water from the State Water Project and the Colorado River. Wholesalers of
this water in the Malibu/Santa Monica Mountains area are the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District and
the West Basin Municipal Water District. These wholesalers distribute to three retailers which include the
Los Angeles County Waterworks District No. 29, Silvas Park Mutual Water Company, and Las Virgenes
Metro Water District. There are also a number of private wells that supply water within the City. However,
the utilization of wells as a source of potable water has steadily declined since 1965, when water became
available through the MWD. Although the amount of water supplied by these wells is now considered to be
insignificant (Incorporation of Malibu EIR, 1989), they are sources of inexpensive water to agricultural and
other interests located away from piped water service.
3.2.4.3     Groundwater
Groundwater, including underground streams and springs, is one of the least understood resources in the
Malibu area. Studies conducted throughout the City of Malibu including Big Rock, the most intensively
studied area in the City, have been inconclusive in determining definitive information on subsurface re-
                                                      126

                                                                                CONSERVATION ELEMENT
charge and discharge. The difficulties in quantifying groundwater stem from the complexity of the Malibu
area’s subsurface geology and subsurface flow. Groundwater is often held at different levels at a given loca-
tion with each pocket of groundwater behaving differently. The amount and retention times of groundwater
stored, its quality, seasonal and annual fluctuations, directions of movement and points of discharge are
therefore, at best, only roughly determined (Malibu Wastewater Management Study, 1992). Due to the steep
and impervious nature of the various small watersheds located within the MCZ, accompanied by the very
rapid runoff of the low and variable annual rainfall, there are no local, dependable surface water supplies and
very limited groundwater supplies within the MCZ. The various well and spring water sources, which had at
one time provided a limited public water supply for the MCZ, have largely gone dry or have been contami-
nated by sea water intrusion and other pollutants and are now abandoned. The few remaining viable private
well water sources are of limited capacity and serve individual homes or small developments.
The primary factors that effect the presence of groundwater in the Malibu area are seasonal and annual pre-
cipitation patterns, topography, soil and rock permeability, and faults. Many of the rock formations in the
area are not conducive for holding groundwater. Groundwater can be found along the coast in alluvium,
beach deposits, and terrace deposits at a depth of only a few feet (Incorporation of Malibu EIR, 1989), but
depth of groundwater increases in the consolidated rock of inland areas and can reach several hundred feet.
The dominant source of groundwater recharge in the City is groundwater flow from the upper portions of the
watersheds. Other sources of recharge include more localized percolation of rainfall, streamflow, irrigation
runoff, and septic system disposal.
3.2.5     Beach and Shoreline Resources
The City of Malibu has approximately 27 miles of coastal area. Within this coastal area, there are three dis-
tinct elements, including the inshore or shoreface (where the water breaks onto the shore); the beach or
shore; and the coast (upland from the beach or shore). The City of Malibu beach and shorelines consist of
several geologic forms including, bedrock, terrace deposits, artificial fill, beach sand deposits, wind blown
dune sand and rip-rap.
The bedrock formations are found in either the high cliff areas (along Point Dume) or the highly fractured
and broken bedrock areas (north of the fault trace at Paradise Cove) which are more prone to erosion. Ter-
race, deposits consist of less hardened and consolidated material than the bedrock and are generally found at
higher elevations on top of flat areas that overlook Malibu. Other terrace deposits are located west of
Lechuza Point where the deposits extend down to the sea cliffs and bluffs of the coast. Artificial fill is lo-
cated sporadically throughout Malibu, but is typically found in areas where it has been used for the construc-
tion of roadways and beach front homes. In some cases, this fill has been exposed and is susceptible to ero-
sion. The location of the fill material is otherwise difficult to determine.
The sand supply along the Malibu coast is determined by the local littoral sediment system. There are two
littoral cells along the Malibu coast: (1) the Zuma Cell west of Point Dume; and (2) the Santa Monica Cell
east of Point Dume. Any consideration of coastal erosion and sedimentation for management purposes
should recognize the discrete nature of the coastal process-response systems east and west of Point Dume.
The Zuma Cell is considered a distinct entity because, although linked to the Santa Barbara Cell, much of
the sediment derived from the west is lost down Hueneme and Mugu submarine canyons. These canyons and
several smaller offshore canyons are the ultimate sinks for sediment moving from the Santa Barbara Cell
into the Zuma Cell, for very little beach-forming sediment appears to continue eastward around Point Dume.
The Santa Monica Cell extends from Point Dume to Palos Verdes Peninsula and is represented by the broad

arc of Santa Monica Bay which, compared to other parts of Southern California, is relatively shallow with a
shelf less than 100 meters deep and extending 10 to 18 kilometers offshore (A. Orme, 1992; The Malibu
Coast, Appendix B, Technical Memo 10, The Malibu Wastewater Study).
Beach sand deposits are located along much of Malibu’s shore zone. Although local beach sand deposits
generally vary in thickness from 5 to 15 feet, Carbon Beach has approximately 25 feet of sand. Wind blown
dune sands also occur in Malibu, but are generally associated with only the widest beaches. Some of these
dunes contain sand deposits that are 30 feet above the original beach level. The last geologic formation is
rip-rap. Large quantities of rip-rap have been imported and placed at scattered locations from Topanga
Beach to the Ventura County line. In most cases, the large 4 to 6 foot in diameter boulders that make up the
rip-rap are used to protect the toes of the fill slopes located along the Pacific Coast Highway. Further, dis-
cussion of beach and shoreline resources is provided in the Safety Element.
3.2.5.1     Environmentally Sensitive Beach and Shoreline Resources
The following areas have been identified as locations for sensitive beach and shoreline resources in the
Malibu Coastal Zone:
      Arroyo Sequit Creek Mouth: This rocky headland and off-shore rock is west of the City limits. How-
      ever, it is affected by conditions and actions within the City. A diverse marine fauna, including mussel
      beds and rocky intertidal species, is located at this site. The mouth of the creek is a critical area during
      the annual migration of steelhead.
      Beach Area Between Nicholas Bluffs and Lechuza Point: This stretch of beach is relatively undis-
      turbed by recreational use and urban development. It supports a high diversity of habitats including tide
      pools, sandy beaches, beach cliffs and adjacent bluffs.
      Trancas Beach Dunes: Trancas Beach Dunes are the only extensive dunes in the MCZ. This area sup-
      ports a flora and fauna restricted to coastal foredunes and upper beaches. While many of the dunes are
      dominated by ice plant (Carpobrotus spp.), the outer dunes support native foredune vegetation.
      Zuma Creek Mouth: The mouth of Zuma Creek supports a small freshwater estuary and associated
      wetland vegetation. The area also supports a diverse array of aquatic insects, amphibians and birds. Al-
      though the creek mouth is exposed to foot traffic, garbage, grading and parking facilities, there is po-
      tential for the restoration of this area to a more diverse freshwater estuary with higher value and func-
      tion.
      Point Dume and Paradise Cove (including Pirate’s Cove, Dume Cove, Little Dume and the asso-
      ciated headland): Point Dume is a prominent headland which rises approximately 200 feet above the
      Pacific Ocean. The area contains both sandy beaches and rocky points. Access is limited in the rocky
      areas, thus protecting the tide pools and other rocky intertidal habitats from intensive recreational use.
      Sensitive Coastal dune and bluff vegetation, including stands of giant coreopsis and other endangered
      species, exists along the bluffs and cliffs. Foot traffic in this area has led to the loss of portions of the
      unique dune and bluff vegetation.
      Paradise Cove: Tidepools hosting a variety of sea creatures (protected as an ESHA) extend intermit-
      tently from the western end of Paradise Cove to the Headlands of Point Dume.

      Latigo Point: Latigo Point supports relatively undisturbed rocky headlands, tide pools and sandy
      beaches which contain a diversity of marine species.
      Malibu Lagoon: Several habitats including sandy beach, rocky beach, coastal dune, salt marsh, mud
      flats and salt-water to brackish estuary are supported by Malibu Lagoon. The site is part of the Pacific
      Flyway and the only estuary in Los Angeles County providing a stop-over for various migratory birds.
      Several species of native fishes, including the locally uncommon steelhead also utilize the estuary.
      Grunion-Spawning Grounds: Grunion spawn at the western end of Decker Beach, Zuma Beach, Sol-
      stice Beach and other locations throughout the Malibu area. The spawning grounds are considered sen-
      sitive because the continued success of the species depends on the availability of the spawning habitat.
3.2.6     Marine Resources
The Malibu coastline is a relatively undisturbed coastal region where upwelling of nutrient-rich waters and a
verity of habitats support highly productive and extremely diverse marine communities. The area possesses
some of the best kelp bed habitat south of Santa Barbara, and the only remaining natural kelp beds on the
mainline coast of Los Angeles County. These areas may be 100 times more productive than adjacent sand
bottom communities and provide refuge, food, and nursery grounds for thousands of species.
Rocky outcrops alternative with sandy stretches along this coastline and are found to a depth of 600 feet.
The stability of the substrate and the variety of exposures provide microhabitats for a great number of organ-
isms. Characteristically, rocky shorelines from the lower intertidal zone to about 100 foot depth can be the
most biologically active areas in the world. Rocky intertidal habitat occurs at Point Dume, Leo Carillo and
Big Rock.
This coastline also possesses the only complete, undisturbed sandy beaches remaining in Los Angeles
County. Although very dynamic in physical stability and, therefore, unfavorable for the development of a
diverse biological community, these areas do offer habitat for a number of organisms. An important micro-
community of decomposers is present. Sandy beaches provide feeding areas for many bird species. Previ-
ously, a number of bird species nested on the sandy beaches including the snowy plover, the California least
tern, and the light-footed clapper rail. In addition, the soft substrate offers a repository for eggs and nursery
grounds for many species.
The Malibu shoreline remains as a remnant of what once was typical of rocky and sandy shore-line in south-
ern California. West of Point Dume, some minor pollution does occur but the kelp is healthy. East of Point
Dume there is minor to moderate pollution and kelp does not grow below 35 feet (England and Nelson,
1976; SEA1: The Malibu Coastline).
3.2.6.1     Marine Vegetation Communities
The only marine vegetation community which is described for the MCZ near-shore region is Surfweed
(Thorne, 1976). This community occurs along the rocky coast below the low tide level where there is heavy
surf. Only plants that can withstand the physical force of the waves can survive in this region. Common
plants which occur in this community include sea-palms (Postelsia palmaeformis, Eisenia arborea), kelps
(Macrocystis pyrifera, Egregia laevigata, Hesperophycus harveyanus, Halidrys dioica, Pelvetia fastigiata),
red algae (Plocamium cartilagineum, Corallina officinalis), and surf-grass (Phyllospadix scouleri, Phyl-
lospadix torreyi).

3.2.6.2     Rare, Endangered and Threatened-Species
The marine and beach area within the Malibu coastline includes the range of several endangered, rare and
threatened species. The gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) passes offshore in its annual migration. The
southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) has been seen periodically off the Malibu Coast. This species has
been extending its range southward and it appears to be only a matter of time before it will be established in
kelp beds off the Malibu coast.
Harbor seals and sea lions which are found along the Malibu coast are afforded protection under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act.
Three other species, the California least tern (Sterna albirons bowni), the Belding savannah sparrow (Passer-
culus sandwichensis beldingi) and the light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes), once had breed-
ing colonies within this area. The California least tern and the light-footed clapper rail have been observed
passing through, but not breeding in the area of Malibu Lagoon in recent years. The brown pelican (Pele-
canus occidentalis) is seen in areas along the coast, such as Point Dume (LCP Research and Analysis Ap-
pendices, Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning, 1982).
3.2.6.3     Environmentally Sensitive Marine Resources
The following areas have been identified as locations for sensitive marine resources in the Malibu Coastal
Zone:
      Arroyo Sequit Creek Mouth: This rocky headland and off-shore rock area support a diverse marine
      fauna. A major kelp bed lies offshore extending eastward to Trancas beach.
      Beach Area Between Nicholas Bluffs and Lechuza Point: This area supports offshore kelp beds.
      There is a small population of sea lions which haul out on the rocky portions of this stretch of beach,
      while grunion spawn in some of the sandy habitats.
      Point Dume and Paradise Cove (including Pirate’s Cove, Little Dume and the associated head-
      lands): As shown in Figure CO-4, biologically-rich kelp beds are located offshore. Pismo Clams in-
      habit the reefs from the Headlands extending almost as far north as Trancas. Pismo Clam shells are of-
      ten found at Pirate’s Cove. Sea lions which were once common in Pirate’s Cove haul out on rocky is-
      lets and offshore buoys due to the growing number of people utilizing the cove. The ecological value
      of Point Dume is extremely high due to the presence and proximity of the many habitats and associated
      species. Specifically, the offshore habitat extending from the Headlands to Malibu Lagoon is desig-
      nated as an Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area.
      Paradise Cove: Relatively undisturbed rocky habitats with an abundant coverage of marine algae are
      present near Little Dume at the western side of Paradise Cove. These offshore reefs are considered by
      the State of California to be marine resources of special biological significance. Additionally, this area
      is an historical grunion spawning ground.
      Latigo Point: Latigo Point supports relatively undisturbed rocky headlands, tide pools and sandy
      beaches which contain a diversity of marine species. Latigo Point is scientifically important because it
      has been the site of numerous field studies documenting the characteristics of marine habitats, and it is
      the southern limit of distribution for a variety of marine species.

      Kelp Beds: There are two major kelp beds in the Malibu area. One area is located between Leo
      Carrillo and Trancas Beach and the second stretches east from Point Dume to the Malibu Lagoon area.
      An abundant and diverse fauna and flora is associated with these kelp beds.
      Grunion-Spawning Grounds: Grunion spawn at the western end of Decker Beach, Zuma Beach, Sol-
      stice Beach and other locations throughout the Malibu area. The spawning grounds are considered sen-
      sitive because the continued success of the species depends on the availability of the spawning habitat.
3.2.6.4     Areas of Special Biological Significance (State Water Quality Control Board)
The most extensive natural coastline in Los Angeles County is within the City of Malibu. Marine resources
along the Malibu coast include kelp beds, tide pools, marine fisheries, offshore reefs, sandy beaches, rocky
headlands, sea lion haul outs, coastal dunes and isolated wetlands. In order to protect these sensitive re-
sources, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) designated the entire coastline from Point
Mugu to Latigo Point as an Area of Special Biological Significance (ASBS). The SWRCB defines an ASBS
as an area “requiring protection of species or biological communities to the extent that alteration of natural
water quality is undesirable.” The SWRCB has adopted water quality control plans which afford special pro-
tection to marine life in an ASBS by prohibiting waste discharge within the area. Specifically, discharge of
elevated temperature wastes and discrete, point source sewage or industrial process wastes in a manner that
would alter the water quality conditions from those occurring naturally are prohibited. Additionally, dis-
charge of waste from non-point sources, including but not limited to stormwater runoff, silt and urban run-
off, must be controlled to the extent practicable. Designated Areas of Special Biological Significance must
also be incorporated into the basin water quality control plans prepared by the Regional Water Quality Con-
trol Board (RWQCB), and thus be used to establish waste discharge requirements in these areas.
Based on the quality of the biological resources in the ASBS, the General Plan has designated the coastline
between Point Mugu and Latigo Point as an environmentally sensitive habitat area (ESHA), consistent with
the resource protection language of the Coastal Act.
3.2.7     Vegetation and Wildlife Resources
The vegetation of the MCZ is the unique product of a Mediterranean climate, steep and varied topography
and proximity to the Pacific Ocean. The MCZ has high ecological and species diversity which includes a
number of endangered and threatened plants and animals. The location and type of vegetation in the MCZ
depends largely on the type of soil and the amount of moisture available during annual period of drought
from approximately April to October.
The dominant chaparral and coastal sage communities are fire successional and strongly adapted to periodic
wildfires. The vegetation of the MCZ is affected by the frequency, intensity and size of fires. The modern
fire pattern is significantly different than that of the past due to fire suppression and arson.
3.2.7.1     Holland Terrestrial Plant Communities
The Malibu Coastal Zone contains seven major categories of terrestrial vegetation communities, including:
(a) Chaparrals; (b) Coastal Sage Scrub; (c) Oak Woodland and Forest; (d) Riparian Scrubs, Woodlands, and
Forest; (e) Coastal Dune Scrub; (f) Freshwater Marsh; and (g) Coastal Brackish Marsh. These major vegeta-
tion types have been further classified as discrete plant communities that generally share characteristic spe-
cies and have similar physiographic site characteristics (Holland, Terrestrial Natural Communities of Cali-
fornia; California Department of Fish and Game; 1986).

The following describes these natural communities:
      Southern Coastal Bluff Scrub: Another plant community which is associated with coastal locations is
      Southern Coastal Bluff Scrub. This community occurs on rocky, poorly developed soils of coastal
      bluffs and slopes that are exposed to salt-laden, desiccating winds. Characteristic species include a va-
      riety of woody or succulent plants that can reach three feet in height. Such as Coreopsis gigantea, Atri-
      plex centfomis, Eurelia californica, hoploppippos enicoricles, and H. venetrus. This community has
      been significantly reduced due to beach front development and other disturbances within the MCZ and
      is now limited to the Point Dume area. As with many of the previously described plant communities, it
      is considered to be a highest priority special plant community which is in need of protection.
      Southern Foredunes: Areas of sand accumulation along the coast historically supported Southern
      Foredunes. This community, which typically occurs on foredunes or upper beaches, is now much re-
      duced due to urban and other development. Southern Foredunes are dominated by a variety of suffru-
      tescent (woody but diminutively shrubby) plants that are typically less than one foot in height. Charac-
      teristic species include sand-verbena (Abronia spp.), silver beachweed (Ambrosia chamissonis) and
      horned sea-rocket (Cakile maritima) in exposed sites, while beach morning-glory (Calystegia
      soldanella) and beach evening primrose (Camissonia cheiranthifolia) are more common in sites less
      exposed to desiccating, salt and sand-bearing winds. Due to the limited remaining distribution of this
      community and development pressure on areas which support the community, it is identified by the
      California Department of Fish and Game as a highest priority special plant community which should
      be protected. Southern foredunes can be found at Broad Beach and some elements at Zuma Beach,
      Point Dume and Leo Carillo State Beach.
      Southern Dune Scrub: A dense coastal scrub community of scattered shrubs, subshrubs and herbs,
      generally less that 1 meter tall and often developing considerable cover. lntergrades toward the coast
      with Southern Foredunes and away from the coast on rockier soils with Venturan Sage Scrub. Species
      include Atriplex leucophylla, Croton californicus, Ericamerica ericoides, Haplopappus venetus
      vernonioides, Lupinus chamissonis, Opuntia littoralis and Rhus integrifolia. With the notable exception

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
   of the El Segundo Dunes, this community has been virtually eliminated from mainland southern Cali-
   fornia. Other small examples persist in Baja California, the Channel Islands and Point Dume.
   Coastal Brackish Marsh: Malibu Lagoon is classified as a Coastal Brackish Marsh. This community
   type usually occurs at the interior edges of coastal bays and estuaries or in coastal lagoons. The com-
   munity is dominated by perennial, emergent, monocots which are characteristic of both coastal Fresh-
   water Marsh and Southern Coastal Salt Marsh. Although salinity in this community often varies con-
   siderably it is more often brackish due to substantial freshwater input and limited marine influence in
   the summer months due to the development of a sand barrier between the estuary and the ocean. Brack-
   ish marsh vegetation, like that of southern coastal salt marshes, includes a variety of halophytic (salt-
   tolerant) species. At Malibu Lagoon, the dominant species are Saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), jaumea
   (Jaumea samosa) and pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) (Manion and Dillingham, 1989). The distribu-
   tion of brackish and coastal salt marshes has been severely restricted along the southern California
   coast and much of the habitat has been degraded. This community is, therefore, considered a highest
   priority community in need of protection.
   Freshwater Marsh: Coastal Freshwater Marsh typically occurs in small pockets within the floodplains
   of the MCZ’s drainages. These areas are permanently flooded or saturated with freshwater and typi-
   cally are dominated by rushes (Juncus spp.), tules (Scirpus spp.) and cattail (Typha spp.). The marsh
   wetlands which occur at the mouths of the largest watershed, including Topanga, Trancas, Zuma and
   Arroyo Sequit, can be characterized as seasonal estuaries. These wetlands are exposed to marine tidal
   influences during the winter months, but are isolated from the Ocean as stream flows decline and sand
   barriers develop. Despite the periodic influences of salt water, these habitats are characterized as pre-
   dominately freshwater wetland habitats. The Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project’s “Wetland Inven-
   tory and Restoration Potential” report identified the estuary at Zuma Beach as having freshwater vege-
   tation (see page 4 of the Appendix of that report).
   Coastal Freshwater Marsh also develops in isolated depressions which are fed by springs or seeps. Al-
   though areas of this type that support the community are less common in the MCZ, there is a large
   Coastal Freshwater Marsh located at the mouth of an unnamed canyon north of Trancas Canyon
   (Josselyn et al, 1992). Due to urban development, stream channelization for flood control, and altera-
   tion of hydrological input, this community has experienced a significant reduction in distribution and is
   considered a highest priority community in need of protection.
   Valley Needlegrass Grassland: This native grassland is characterized by perennial, tussock-forming
   valley needlegrass (Stipa pulchra), but often supports a cover of various other native and introduced
   annuals which provide greater cover than the needlegrass. This community usually occurs on fine-
   textured soils that are moist or even waterlogged during winter when germination occurs, but are very
   dry during summer. This community is considered to be very threatened due to the limited distribution
   of remaining stands, competition with introduced annual grasses, and development pressure on areas
   which support the community. The community is identified by the California Department of Fish and
   Game as a highest priority special plant community which is in need of protection.
   Non-Native Grassland: Non-native Grassland occupies many of the areas which would have histori-
   cally supported Valley Needlegrass Grassland. This community consists of a dense to sparse cover of
   annual grasses which are more effective competitors than native bunchgrasses when areas are over-
   grazed or regularly disturbed in other ways. The community is also often associated with numerous
                                                   134

species of native annual wildflowers, especially in years of favorable rainfall. Non-native Grassland
occurs on the same soils that support Valley Needlegrass Grassland and often intergrades with Coast
Live Oak Woodland much as the native grassland does. Although not considered a rare or threatened
community, this plant association provides important wildlife habitat and is now much reduced in dis-
tribution in Los Angeles County due to agricultural and urban development.
Coastal Sage Scrub: The Coastal Sage Scrub community is represented by Venturan Coastal Sage
Scrub. This community is characterized by low, mostly soft-woody shrubs that are 0.5 to 2 meters tall.
Crowns in this community often touch and in some areas there is typically bare ground underneath and
between shrubs (while in other areas there is an understory). Common plants in this community include
California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), black sage (Salvia mellifera), purple sage (Salvia leuco-
phylla), California encelia (Encelia californica), deer weed (Lotus scoparius), and California buck-
wheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum). This community is considered to be a sensitive plant community type
by the CDFG due to development pressure on areas which support the community type.
Chaparral: The local chaparral community is principally Chamise Chaparral. This one to three meter
tall chaparral is overwhelmingly dominated by chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum). Other associated
species such as Eastwood’s manzanita (Arctostaphylos glandulosa), big-pod ceanothus (Ceanothus
megacarpus), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides), and toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia) gen-
erally contribute little to total cover. This community occurs on the shallow, dry soils of slopes and
ridges and is characterized by a relatively frequent fire cycle (every 10 to 15 years). Because of this
frequent fire cycle, many species within the community respond to fire by stump and root sprouting
and by germination of fire stimulated seeds. Mature stands, not recently affected by fire, are often
densely interwoven and support very little herbaceous understory.
Another relatively common chaparral which occurs in the MCZ is big-pod ceanothus chaparral. This
tall, dense chaparral is strongly dominated by big-pod ceanothus. This species does not stump sprout,
but is apparently long lived in the absence of fire. The community typically occurs on dry slopes with
shallow, rocky soils and intergrades with Venturan Coastal Sage Scrub and Chamise Chaparral on drier
sites and Coast Live Oak Woodland on moister sites. Less common chaparrals that occur in the MCZ
include hoary-leaf ceanothus chaparral, Redshank Chaparral, Scrub Oak Chaparral, and Northern
Mixed Chaparral. These communities are each more fully described by Holland in the State Depart-
ment of Fish and Game’s Preliminary Descriptions of the Terrestrial Natural Vegetation Communities
of California (1986).
Riparian Woodland, Scrub, and Forest: Southern Coast Live Oak Riparian Forest is similar to Coast
Live Oak Woodland, but is characterized by a denser canopy which is largely closed. This community
typically occurs in well-shaded valley bottoms and along low, adjacent slopes. It provides resources
which are similar to the resources provided by Coast Live Oak Woodland. The California Department
of Fish and Game identifies this as a highest priority special plant community in need of protection.
Other local communities which are largely associated with drainages include a variety of riparian
woodland, forest, and scrub communities. These communities include Southern Cottonwood Willow
Riparian Forest, Southern Sycamore Alder Riparian Woodland, White Alder Riparian Forest, Southern
Willow Scrub, and Mule Fat Scrub.
Distinctions between these communities are often vague as they intergrade with one another, but spe-
cies composition and physiographic characteristics often allow these riparian communities to be identi-
                                                 135

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
   fied to type. Each of these communities with the exception of Mule Fat Scrub are considered to be
   ecologically important.
         White Alder Riparian Forest is a medium to tall deciduous streamside forest dominated by white
         alder (Alnus rhombifolia). Understories are shrubby, deciduous and typically represented by wil-
         lows (Salix spp.) and mule fat (Baccharis saliciplia). This community is best represented along
         the high gradient reaches of perennial steep-sided drainages and as a consequence generally oc-
         curs as a very narrow riparian corridor.
         Southern Sycamore Alder Riparian Woodland is a tall deciduous streamside woodland that is
         dominated by western sycamore (Platanus racemosa) and occasional white alders. These wood-
         land stands seldom form closed canopies and may even appear as trees scattered in a shrubby
         thicket. The community is typically associated with rocky stream beds that are subject to high in-
         tensity flooding. The intermittent nature of most of the drainages within the MCZ favors western
         sycamore as the dominant species, but white alder increases in abundance on more perennial
         streams.
         Southern Cottonwood Willow Riparian Forest is a tall, open, deciduous riparian forest dominated
         by Fremont’s cottonwood (Popuius fremontii), western sycamore, and various tree willows (Salix
         spp.).Understories are usually shrubby willows. This community usually occurs on the lower gra-
         dient reaches of perennial drainages where it is best represented in subirrigated canyon bottoms
         and overflow areas as well as along stream sides. The community is perhaps not differentiable
         from Southern Cottonwood Sycamore Riparian Forest with the exception that this latter commu-
         nity may be characterized as containing a higher proportion of western sycamores and is more
         likely to occur on sub-perennial or intermittent streams. Cottonwood is relatively uncommon in
         the Malibu Coastal Zone and neither community type is abundant.
         Southern Willow Scrub occurs as a dense, deciduous riparian thicket dominated by several species
         of willows. Scattered emergent Fremont’s cottonwoods and western sycamores are also often pre-
         sent. The community occurs along the lower gradient reaches of drainages where sandy or fine al-
         luvium is deposited. This early seral stage requires frequent disturbance from flooding to prevent
         succession to Southern Cottonwood Willow Riparian Forest or Southern Cottonwood Sycamore
         Riparian Forest.
         Mule Fat Scrub is a tall, herbaceous riparian scrub that is strongly dominated by mule fat. This
         early seral community is maintained by frequent flooding. In the absence of such flooding the
         community succeeds to a variety of cottonwood or sycamore-dominated forests or woodlands.
         The community typically occurs along intermittent stream channels with fairly coarse substrate
         and moderate depth to the water table. It often occurs as a patchy understory in light gaps in cot-
         tonwood or sycamore-dominated riparian woodlands.
   California Walnut Woodland: California Walnut Woodland is similar to Coast Live Oak Woodland
   but with a more open tree canopy locally dominated by California walnut (Julous californica). The
   more open canopy allows a more extensive development of a grassy understory. The community typi-
   cally occurs on relatively moist, fine-textured soils of valley slopes and canyon bottoms, but may also
   occur around rocky outcrops of slopes and canyon walls. Drier, rockier sites often intergrade to Ven-
   turan Coastal Sage Scrub, while moister sites intergrade to Coast Live Oak Woodland or Southern
                                                   136

      Coast Live Oak Forest. This community is also identified as a highest priority special plant community
      which is in need of protection by the California Department of Fish and Game.
      Oak Woodlands: Oak Woodlands within the MCZ are primarily Coast Live Oak Woodland. This
      community typically occurs on north-facing slopes and shaded ravines in the Malibu area. On drier
      sites, Coast Live Oak Woodland intergrades with Venturan Coastal Sage Scrub and Chamise Chapar-
      ral. As the name implies, this oak woodland community is dominated by coast live oak (Quercus agri-
      folia). On deeper, bottom land soils and along larger streams, this community intergrades to Southern
      Coast Live Oak Riparian Forest. Oak woodlands are locally important because they provide a variety
      of food, shelter, shade, and nesting site resources which are not provided by other, more widely dis-
      tributed communities. Valley Oak Woodland occurs on the interior valley and coastal slopes, fre-
      quently on the valley bottom on deep, well drained alluvial soils.
3.2.7.2 Wildlife Habitat
The Malibu Coastal Zone (MCZ) supports a rich and diverse fauna of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds
and invertebrates. Sufficient intact wildland habitat still remains in the MCZ and throughout the Santa
Monica Mountains to support almost the entire complement of wildlife native to the Santa Monica Moun-
tains, including large mammals such as the mountain lion, bobcat, coyote and deer.
Each of the vegetation communities of the MCZ provide wildlife habitat. Although each community pro-
vides essential habitat parameters for certain species, some of these communities provide higher value habi-
tat or habitat for a wider diversity of species. The location of environmentally sensitive resource areas which
function as important wildlife habitat are displayed in Figure CO-3.
Riparian scrubs, woodlands and forests are often characterized as having the greatest biological diversity and
the highest productivity of all California wildlife habitats. Riparian vegetation communities provide shade,
food, cover, breeding habitat, water and dispersal and migration corridors for many mammal species, bird,
reptile, amphibian, fish, and invertebrate. A significant number of wildlife species are found only in riparian
habitats. Twenty-five percent of California mammals, 80% of amphibians, and 40% of reptiles are limited to
or dependent upon riparian zones, and more than 135 species of California birds depend upon or prefer ri-
parian habitats.
Oak woodland and forest provides many of the same habitat parameters as riparian habitats. The most nota-
ble exception is the availability of water. Oak woodland and forest also improves the wildlife habitat value
of other adjacent vegetation communities since species which occur in grasslands, chaparral or scrub make
significant use of the shade, food and cover of adjacent oak habitat. Significant stands of oak woodland and
forest have been mapped in the Malibu Local Coastal Program (1986) (see Figure CO-3).
Coastal sage scrub is a community which lacks the total species diversity of the two previously described
wildlife habitats, but which is none-the-less important to discuss due to its significant reduction during the
last 40 years. Estimates place the extant coastal sage scrub at between 10 and 30% of the historic distribution
of the community. As a consequence at least 35 species of California wildlife associated with coastal sage
scrub are considered to have sensitive status due to the limited and often fragmented distribution of remain-
ing areas of this community (Murphy, 1992). A number of these species occur or potentially occur in the
MCZ. The sensitive animal species associated with Southern California’s coastal sage scrub include the fol-
lowing: Southern California rufous-crowned sparrow, Bell’s sage sparrow, California horned lizard, San
                                                       137

Freshwater marsh is a habitat which has been severely reduced throughout California. Within the MCZ this
habitat may have never been very extensive with the exception of occurrences at the mouths of the larger
drainages. Many of the areas which historically supported this habitat have been filled and developed or
have been altered due to channelization and other flood control activities. The current wildlife habitat value
of most areas in the MCZ supporting this community are is limited due to the extent and degradation of the
habitat. It should be noted however that the habitat and water quality values and functions of this community
can be restored and expanded with proper planning and implementation. Efforts of this type are important
because the year-round water and vegetative cover provided by freshwater marsh is important to many wet-
land-inhabiting species of wildlife.
Coastal brackish marsh in the MCZ occurs only at Malibu Lagoon. The estuary provides important wildlife
habitat for a variety of species including resident and migratory birds, resident and migratory fish, and a
number of brackish and saltwater species of invertebrates. Bird diversity and abundance is greatest during
January to March when northern breeding species which winter in the area are attracted to the predictable
fish and invertebrate resources of the estuary. Species which are typically observed during winter include a
variety of gulls, dabbling and diving ducks, fish-eating divers (i.e., cormorants, loons and mergansers),
plunge divers (i.e., terns and belted kingfisher), and long-legged waders (i.e., herons and egrets). Although
the abundance and diversity of bird species declines from March to August there is still significant use of the
estuary during this time. During surveys conducted from April 1987 to March 1988 a total of 151 species of
birds were recorded at Malibu Lagoon (Manion and Dillingham, 1989).
The estuary also provides habitat for fish. Twenty-nine species of native and non-native fish have been re-
corded in the estuary (Swift, 1982). The estuary has been identified as a breeding and nursery ground for
several species of coastal fish including California halibut (Paralichthys californicus). Many species utilize
coastal estuaries as breeding and nursery grounds because of abundant food, warmer water temperatures and
reduced competition or predation from other fishes. Species which appear to be most abundant in the estuary
include California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis), topsmelt (Atherinops affinis), arrow goby (Clevelandia
ios) and staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus). These four species represented over 98% of individuals
accounted for during studies conducted in 1987-1988 (Manion and Dillingham, 1989).
Malibu Lagoon provides habitat for the Tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi), a federally listed en-
dangered species. Malibu Lagoon has been identified as a critical habitat component in the life cycle of
steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) which spawn in Malibu Creek. Malibu Creek is the southernmost run of
the steelhead. Juvenile steelhead enter the estuary prior to continuing on to the ocean. The time spent in the
brackish waters of the estuary allows the juvenile steelhead the necessary time to transition physiologically
from freshwater to saltwater. Historically, the steelhead stayed in the estuary until winter storms opened the
estuary to the ocean. It is unknown what effect the aseasonal input of freshwater to the estuary and the artifi-
cial opening of the estuary to the ocean have had on the Malibu Creek steelhead population, but it can be
assumed that the effects have been deleterious. There is evidence that Malibu Creek steelhead has experi-
enced dramatic decreases in its population. During 1987-1988 only one adult steelhead is known to have
been recorded from Malibu Creek (Jensen, 1989).

In addition to the habitat provided by vegetation communities, there are a variety of other natural areas
which provide habitat for local wildlife. These areas include habitat provided by drainages and ponds, rocky
and sandy intertidal zones, and offshore rocks and islets.
Freshwater aquatic habitat is limited within the MCZ, due to the short rainy season and the steep topogra-
phy. Most local drainages typically contain intermittent streams which have no surface flow for up to eight
months of the year. These intermittent streams, as well as more perennial drainages, provide important habi-
tat for a variety of aquatic or semi-aquatic amphibians, reptiles, fish and invertebrates. Although the pres-
ence of surface water in the MCZ is typically seasonal, the species which rely on this resource have evolved
in response to the seasonal precipitation pattern. Many of the species which utilize local streams, migrate or
move from other adjacent habitats to these drainages when they have surface flow or pooled water (i.e. an-
urans, California newt, steelhead). Other species such as the native arroyo chub (Gila orcutti) are resident in
the perennial reaches of the streams.
Freshwater ponds also provide aquatic habitat within the MCZ. These bodies of water support many of the
same species as local drainages and provide a source of water for terrestrial species. Freshwater ponds are
found in Solstice, Corral, Trancas and Zuma Canyons and at Nicholas Flats (Sarah Dixon, Malibu General
Plan Task Force, pers. comm.).
The MCZ contains a variety of rocky and sandy intertidal habitats. These areas support a diversity of marine
invertebrates which in turn support many species of coastal birds. Sandy intertidal habitats on Malibu
beaches also provide spawning habitat for grunion.
Offshore rocks and islets provide nesting sites and refuge for marine mammals, and coastal and pelagic
birds. These areas are generally inaccessible to humans and domestic animals and as such are usually secure
from disturbance from human activities. These resources are used as haul outs by California sea lions (Zalo-
phus californianus) and as breeding sites by gulls (Larus spp.) and cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.). These
resources also often provide habitat for shorebirds which feed in rocky intertidal habitats.
3.2.7.3    Rare, Endangered or Threatened Species
Sensitive species within the MCZ are here identified as those plants and animals that are considered rare,
threatened, or endangered by state or federal agencies, thereby requiring special protection; see Tables 3-2
and 3-3. Many of these species are currently protected by the state and federal Endangered Species Acts.
Other species are protected by provisions of the Fish and Game Code of California as fully protected spe-
cies. Species which do no receive protection from the aforementioned regulations, but which are experienc-
ing local and regional population declines, are often considered or identified as candidates for listing under
the state and federal Endangered Species Acts. The California Department of Fish and Game maintains a
statewide inventory on sensitive threatened plant and animal species. These species receive limited protec-
tion through mitigation of impacts to the species under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Many of the sensitive species in Malibu are associated with coastal wetland and strand habitats which are
becoming increasingly rare biotic communities due to coastal development. Many other sensitive species
within the MCZ are associated with riparian vegetation communities.

3.2.8     Identification of Significant Natural Resources
3.2.8.1       Prior Inventories and Evaluations of Sensitive Biological Resources
The significant biological resource areas of the MCZ have been previously identified in the Los Angeles
County General Plan, the Malibu/Santa Monica Mountains Interim Area Plan, and the Malibu Local Coastal
Program Land Use Plan (Malibu LCP LUP). Additionally, the Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB) identified a portion of the Malibu coastline as a significant biological resource area.
3.2.8.2       Significant Ecological Areas (Malibu/Santa Monica Mountains Interim Area Plan and Los
Angeles County General Plan)
Los Angeles County has defined Significant Ecological Areas (SEAs) as ecologically fragile or important
land and water areas which are valuable as plant or wildlife habitat. The specific criteria used to identify
SEAs included the following: the habitat of rare, endangered, and threatened plant and animal species; biotic
communities, vegetation associations, and habitats of plant and animal species that are either one of a kind,
or are restricted on a regional basis; biotic communities, vegetation associations and habitats of plant and
animal species that are either one of a kind or are restricted in distribution in Los Angeles County; habitat
that at some point in the life cycle of a species, serves as a concentrated breeding, feeding, resting or migrat-
ing grounds, and is limited in availability; biotic resources that are of scientific interest because they are ei-
ther an extreme in physical/geographic limitations or they represent an unusual variation in population or
community; areas important as game species habitat or undisturbed examples of the natural biotic communi-
ties in Los Angeles County; special areas which do not fit any of the above criteria but may be individually
noteworthy due to special characteristics (England and Nelson, 1976; Los Angeles County Significant Eco-
logical Study, 1986).
In the MCZ there are eight designated SEAs. These SEAs include the Malibu Coastline (no acreage avail-
able), Point Dume (129 acres), a portion of Zuma Canyon (3,253 acres), a portion of Malibu Canyon includ-
ing Malibu Lagoon (3,638 acres), upper La Sierra Canyon (280 acres), Hepatic Gulch (18 acres), Malibu
Creek State Park Buffer (195 acres), Tuna Canyon (1,450 acres), and Cold Creek Canyon (1,505 acres). Ta-
ble 3-4 summarizes the specific resource values of each of the MCZ SEAs based on the 1976 England and
Nelson study, as well as on a later report prepared for the Los Angeles County Department of Regional
Planning by Dr. Richard Friesen (Significant Ecological Areas of the Santa Monica Mountains Report, Los
Angeles County Museum of Natural History Foundation).
Any development project proposed in an SEA within the anticipated area of the Malibu Coastal Zone must
be reviewed by the County’s Environmental Review Board (ERB). As a condition of project approval, this
review board must make a determination that the development is highly compatible with sensitive resources
found within the SEA. In the Malibu General Plan, areas classified as SEAs have been reclassified according
                                                                       148

to California Coastal Act resource protection terminology. Based on the type of biological resources identi-
fied in the SEAs within the Malibu Coastal Zone, the SEAs have been reclassified as environmentally sensi-
tive habitat areas (ESHAs) or as significant watersheds (See Table 3-4).
The Malibu Coastal Zone SEAs, described below, are classified by the Coastal Act criteria of environmen-
tally sensitive area according to either rarity or ecological importance.

3.2.8.3 Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas (Malibu LCP Land Use Plan)
The California Coastal Act of 1976 (Section 30107.5) defines “environmentally sensitive areas” as “...any
area in which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of their spe-
cial nature or role in an ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human activities and
developments.” This definition applies equally to both marine and land resources. The Coastal Act further
requires that these areas be identified and protected from any loss or degradation of habitat value.
The Malibu LCP Land Use Plan identified those habitats (see Figure CO-3, Environmentally Sensitive Land
Resources and Figure CO-4, Environmentally Sensitive Marine and Beach Resources) in the MCZ which
met the Coastal Act definition of “environmentally sensitive areas” based on the following criteria:
•     Habitats that are unique, rare, restricted in distribution or extremely fragile (such as coastal dune vege-
      tation, riparian woodlands).

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Those terrestrial resources which were identified in the Malibu LCP Land Use Plan to meet the criteria and
legal definitions of an environmentally sensitive area, as well as those areas adjoining sensitive habitat
which are functionally related to, or act as a buffer to are identified in Appendix A to this Conservation
Element (Malibu Local Coastal Plan Research and Analysis and Appendices, October, 1992 by the Los An-
geles County Department of Regional Planning Coastal Studies Section).
Those marine and beach resources which meet the criteria for environmentally sensitive areas are identified
in Section 3.2.6.3 (Environmentally Sensitive Marine Resources) and Section 3.2.5.1 (Environmentally Sen-
sitive Beach and Shoreline Resources).
3.2.9    Protection of Sensitive Habitat Areas
3.2.9.1     Resource Protection Standards in the Coastal Zone
Standards: The California Coastal Act protection standards for land resources are defined in the Section
30240 as follows:
      30240.(a) Environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHAs) shall be protected against any significant
      disruption of habitat values, and only uses dependent on such resources shall be allowed.
      30240.(b) Development in areas adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas and parks and rec-
      reation areas shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade such ar-
      eas, and shall be compatible with the continuance of such habitat areas.
The protection standards for marine resources are defined in Sections 30230 and 30231 as follows:
      30230. Marine resources shall be maintained, enhanced and, where feasible, restored. Special protec-
      tion shall be given to areas and species of special biological or economic significance. Uses of the ma-
      rine environmental shall be carried out in a manner that will sustain the biological productivity of
      coastal waters and that will maintain healthy populations of all species of marine organisms adequate
      for long-term commercial, recreational, scientific, and educational purposes.
      30231. The biological productivity and the quality of coastal waters, streams, wetlands, estuaries and
      lakes appropriate to maintain optimum populations of marine organisms, and for the protection of hu-
      man health shall be maintained and, where feasible, restored through, among other means, minimizing
      adverse effects of waste water discharges and entrainment, controlling runoff, preventing depletion of
      groundwater supplies and substantial interference with surface water flow, encouraging waste water
      reclamation, maintaining natural vegetation buffer areas that protect riparian habitats, and minimizing
      alternation of natural streams.
3.2.9.2     Resource Protection Areas in the Malibu Coastal Zone
The resource protection standards of the California Coastal Act recognize several important principles of
biological resource conservation: (1) that the rarest and most ecologically important habitats (ESHAs) are
protected from direct development (Section 30240(a)); (2) that natural habitat areas adjacent to environmen-
tally sensitive habitat areas are necessary to the health and continuance of those sensitive areas (Section
30240(b)); and (3) that the health of marine resources is dependent on terrestrial land uses and in particular
is related to the control of surface runoff and waste discharge and to maintaining natural stream flows with
protection of riparian and wetland areas and watershed buffer areas (Section 30231).

Based on the resource protection standards of the California Coastal Act and the nature of the biological re-
sources identified in the MCZ, the Malibu LCP Land Use Plan defined five types of resource protection ar-
eas with associated planning and development policies. The five protection areas are: (1) Environmentally
Sensitive Habitat Areas (ESHAs); (2) Disturbed Sensitive Resource Areas (DSRAs); (3) Significant Water-
sheds; (4) Significant Oak Woodlands and Savannahs; and (5) Wildlife Habitat Linkages, or Wildlife Corri-
dors. Additionally, USGS designated blueline streams are recognized as a critical component of the hydro-
logical system affecting both land and marine resources and, as such, require special development standards.
The MCZ resource protection areas are defined and described below (see, also, Table 3-4). The biological
resources which are included in each resource protection area are identified and their distribution and loca-
tion approximately mapped in Figure CO-3 (Environmentally Sensitive Land Resources) and Figure CO-4
(Environmentally Sensitive Marine and Beach Resources). The major resource protection goal associated
with each resource protection category is stated and the permitted uses and development standards required
to meet each conservation goal are summarized in Table 3-5, Resource Protection Goals and Development
Standards in Sensitive Resource Areas.

Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas (ESHAs)
      Definition: ESHAs are any area in which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or espe-
      cially valuable because of their special nature or role in an ecosystem and which could be easily dis-
      turbed by human activities and developments.
      Resource Protection Goals: Environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHAs) shall be protected
      against any significant disruption of habitat values.
      Biological Resources included in the ESHA Resource Protection Category: Major riparian corri-
      dors; oak woodlands (including those in proximity to existing highways and/or residential, develop-
      ment); coastal wetlands and estuaries; offshore rocks and rocky shoreline areas; marine resources; kelp
      beds; undeveloped sandy beaches; coastal bluffs and coastal sand dunes between Arroyo Sequit and
      Paradise Cove (Malibu LCP Land Use Plan Figures 6 and 7; Malibu LCP Research Analysis and Ap-
      pendices).
      Malibu Coastline SEA including the offshore area from the lower intertidal to 100 feet in depth and
      undisturbed sand beaches; upper Zuma Canyon SEA; Upper La Sierra Canyon SEA; Malibu Canyon
      and Lagoon SEA; Hepatic Gulch SEA; Point Dume SEA, including the rocky shoreline, coastal bluffs,
      sandy beaches and main canyon drainages; the riparian woodlands, bay laurel woodlands and live oak
      woodlands of the Tuna/Pena Canyons SEA (Los Angeles County’s SEA Study, 1976 and the Signifi-
      cant Ecological Areas of the Santa Monica Mountains Report by Dr. R. Friesen for the Los Angeles
      County Department of Regional Planning and Table 3-4 of this Conservation Element). Plant commu-
      nities of limited distribution and ranked as very threatened by the State of California’s Department of
      Fish and Game, including: Southern Coastal Bluff Scrub; Southern Foredunes; Southern Dune Scrub;
      Coastal Brackish Marsh; Coastal and Valley Freshwater Marsh; Valley Needlegrass Grassland; South-
      ern Willow Scrub; and California Walnut Woodland (see previous Tables 3-1 and 3-4).
Disturbed Sensitive Resource Areas (DSRAs)
      Definition: DSRAs are those areas which would historically have met the Coastal Act definition of an
      environmentally sensitive habitat. However, coastal development has resulted in substantial modifica-
      tion of the resources in these areas. Although DSRAs no longer have the same biological significance
      or sensitivity as an undisturbed ESHA, they are sufficiently valuable to warrant resource protection.
      Resource Protection Goals: To prevent further degradation of remaining biological resources and to
      restore disrupted habitat values where feasible and ecologically desirable.
      Biological Resources Included in the DSRA Resource Protection Category: In general, developed
      riparian corridors in coastal canyons and development in Significant Oak Woodlands (see Figure 6 of
      the Malibu LCP Land Use Plan and Figure CO-3 of this Conservation Element). Examples include de-

     veloped portions of Escondido, Ramirez and Las Flores Canyons, and coastal bluffs and canyons on
     Point Dume.
Significant Watersheds
     Definition: Significant Watersheds in the MCZ are designated in accordance with Section 30240 of the
     Coastal Act. Significant Watersheds are considered necessary to ensure protection of sensitive resource
     areas and associated species, particularly wildlife. Significant Watersheds are not considered to be as
     environmentally sensitive as ESHAs, because they are dominated by vegetation and wildlife which are
     common throughout the Santa Monica Mountains. Although these watersheds are dominated by com-
     mon species, they provide habitat for various declining, restricted, rare or endangered species and plant
     communities. The common vegetation type of the MCZ, Venturan Coastal Scrub, is placed by the State
     of California in its most threatened category in the Department of Fish and Game’s inventory of Cali-
     fornia’s terrestrial plant communities. Significant watershed are those watershed with significant drain-
     age areas (greater than one square mile; see Table VIII.1 of the Malibu Wastewater Management
     Study, 1992) which develop significant riparian vegetation, or drain into an area of sensitive marine re-
     sources which would be susceptible to damage from terrestrial impacts related to erosion and runoff.
     Resource Protection Goals: To protect the habitat values of the sensitive marine and terrestrial habitat
     areas within the watershed or offshore from the watershed by minimizing vegetation removal, erosion,
     sedimentation, and increased surface erosion. To protect those plant communities of widespread distri-
     bution in the MCZ, but nonetheless ranked as very threatened by the California Department of Fish and
     Game. To minimize habitat fragmentation with subsequent loss of biological diversity.
     Watersheds Included in the Significant Watershed Resource Protection Category: Include but are
     not limited to Arroyo Sequit, Zuma Canyon, Solstice Canyon, Corral Canyon, Ramirez Canyon, Las
     Flores Canyon, Encinal Canyon, San Nicholas Canyon, Los Alisos (Decker) Canyon, Lechuza Canyon,
     Escondido Canyon, Latigo Canyon, Puerco Canyon, Carbon Canyon, Topanga Canyon and its tributar-
     ies, Malibu Canyon, Tuna Canyon, and Trancas Canyon.
Significant Oak Woodlands and Savannahs
     Definition: These resources are located outside the riparian corridor of significant watersheds, and may
     be found in areas close to existing roads and development. Even in a relatively disturbed condition, oak
     woodland and oak savannah habitats are considered a biologically critical resource because of the large
     number of wildlife species which depend upon the resources provided by oak trees. These areas are
     also considered to be an important biological resource because of the declining nature of oak-
     dominated habitats in southern California.
     Resource Protection Goals: Oak woodlands shall be considered an environmentally sensitive habitat
     areas which shall be protected against any significant disruption of habitat values.
     Oak Woodlands Included in the Significant Oak Woodland and Savannahs Resource Protection
     Category: Those areas identified on Figure 6 of the Malibu LCP Land Use Plan and Figure CO-3 of
     this Conservation Element, and any area which meets the plant community descriptions of Coast Live
     Oak Woodland and Valley Oak Woodland of the California Department of Fish and Game Terrestrial
     Natural Communities inventory. Significant oak woodlands are found in scattered locations within the
     MCZ, including Ascended Canyon and along Topanga Canyon and its tributaries.

Wildlife Habitat Linkages
     Definition: Areas of relatively undisturbed open space, which by virtue of their geographic location
     and habitat characteristics, facilitate movement and provide life cycle requirements of plant and animal
     species between major habitat areas. These habitat areas provide connections between significant wa-
     tershed canyons and the core habitat reserves of the SMMNRA park lands. Core habitat reserves in-
     clude Topanga State Park, Malibu Creek State Park, Zuma/Trancas Canyons, Leo Carrillo State Beach
     and Point Mugu State Park.
     Resource Protection Goals: To provide sufficient habitat for wide-ranging animal species with large
     home territories as well as for other wildlife species. To protect the biological diversity of the
     SMMNRA by providing sufficient habitat area to ensure the long-term survival of species by protect-
     ing populations from random or periodic, catastrophic extinction processes. To protect those plant
     communities of widespread distribution in the MCZ, but nonetheless ranked as very threatened by the
     California Department of Fish and Game. To minimize habitat fragmentation with subsequent loss of
     biological diversity. To provide a protected wildlife area extending nearly the entire length of the Santa
     Monica Mountains coastal zone.
     Wildlife Habitat Linkage Areas Included in the Wildlife Habitat Linkage Resource Protection
     Category: Those areas identified in Figure 6 of the Malibu LCP Land Use Plan and Figure CO-3 of
     this Conservation Element, including the habitat areas between Topanga State Park, Malibu Creek
     State Park, Zuma/Trancas Canyons, Leo Carrillo State Beach and Point Mugu State Parks.
Blueline Streams
     Definition: Those major drainage pathways identified by a blue line on USGS topographic maps.
     Resource Protection Goal: Protect the natural hydrological patterns of the coastal canyons and protect
     the plant communities associated with the drainage pathways.
     Streams Included in the Blueline Stream Resource Protection Category: Those drainage channels
     identified by a blue line on the following USGS quadrangle maps: Triunfo; Point Dume; Malibu
     Beach; Topanga; and other quadrangles that encompass inland areas adjacent to the City of Malibu that
     have blueline streams that are tributaries to blueline streams within the City of Malibu.
3.2.10 Scenic Resources
Scenic resources are natural features of the landscape which exhibit a high scenic value. These resources
include landforms, vegetation, and water forms which are relatively distinct from the general landscape
found throughout the coastal zone. They provide visual enhancement and pleasure and are worthy of preser-
vation for aesthetic, historical, topographical, cultural, or biological reasons.
The City of Malibu is located in the Malibu Coastal Zone (MCZ) and is thereby subject to Coastal Act pro-
visions relating to scenic and visual resources. The Coastal Act provisions state that such resources are to be
protected and that new development must be sited in such a manner as to preserve these resources. A pri-
mary concern under Section 30251 of the Coastal Act is the protection of views from public areas rather
than from private residences. An inventory of Malibu’s visual resources was conducted and analyzed in the
1982 Local Coastal Program for the Malibu area. Visual resources analyzed were from public areas such as
highways, public beaches, vista points, and parks.

3.2.10.1   Vistas
There are approximately 22 “scenic resources” in the City and surrounding areas identified in the Malibu
Local Coastal Program (see Figure CO-5). Scenic resources which are not located within the City limits
have been included in this inventory because of their proximity to and access from the City. Many of these
resources, located outside of the City, are either visible from within the City or provide views of areas within
the City.

      background feature, framed by the V-shaped canyon mouth.
      Newton Canyon Hillside: The slopes on the south side of Newton Canyon Road are covered with a
      richly-textured, dense stand of oaks. These slopes are highly visible from Latigo Canyon Road and fea-
      ture both middleground and foreground, depending upon the viewer’s location. One or two residences
      have been developed along the canyon bottom; associated grading is visible from Latigo Canyon Road.
      Measures should be taken to soften this graded area either by using agricultural or natural vegetation.
      Lower Latigo Canyon: Lush riparian vegetation exhibiting a diversity of color and texture lines the
      canyon bottom. The area is accessed by Latigo Canyon Road.
      Tuna Canyon: In both of these areas along Tuna Canyon Road, lush riparian woodland forms a visu-
      ally pleasing canopy over the road.
There are numerous vista points in the Malibu area. Vista points are areas that provide highly scenic and
panoramic views of several miles with little or no sense of boundary restriction. Such views are typically
available from a high vantage point. There are five areas in and adjacent to Malibu that display characteris-
tics which make them suitable as vista points. These vista points are as follows:
      Little Sycamore Canyon Vista Point: The view from the approximate midpoint encompasses almost
      the entire West Mulholland Viewshed and the ocean beyond. Visual components include the jagged,
      rocky peaks and ridgeline on the northwest side of the viewshed. The southeast portion of the viewshed
      displays rolling hills covered with a dark green mantle of chaparral. These components, in conjunction
      with the distant blue of the ocean, create a vista rich in color, form and texture.
      Trancas Vista Point: An existing unpaved public viewing area located on the seaward shoulder of Pa-
      cific Coast Highway, just above Trancas Beach, offers a significant panoramic view. To the west,
      Lechuza Point is visible along with the coastline and its architecturally distinct seaside homes. The
      view to the east encompasses the length of Zuma and Point Dume Beaches, a broad sandy strip ending
      with the high relief of the Point Dume promontory. The white water of waves, the expanse of blue
      ocean to the horizon, and the distinct coastal configuration all contribute to a highly scenic vista.
      Point Dume Vista Point: The tip of Point Dume offers a 360 degree panorama of ocean, bluffs, moun-
      tains, and canyons.
      Kellers Shelter Vista Point: An undeveloped blufftop situated directly above the Pacific Coast High-
      way near Malibu Lagoon State Beach, offers significant views of Malibu Point and Kellers Shelter.

      Components of this view includes the Malibu Pier, the white water waves breaking along the point, and
      the half moon-shaped bay.
      Saddle Peak-Schueren Vista Point: The area where Saddle Peak and Schueren Roads intersect pro-
      vides views to the north and south. The northern view stretches for many miles, and encompasses the
      San Fernando Valley. Isolated peaks and background ridgelines exhibit reddish-brown hues. The view
      to the south looks down on steep slopes exhibiting a dark green mantle of chaparral. The irregular to-
      pography includes many rock outcroppings.
      Charmlee Park: The park has a number of vista points that give expansive views of the Pacific Ocean,
      the Channel Islands and of the undeveloped coastal slopes and western Malibu.
3.2.10.2    Ridgelines
Significant ridgelines also constitute a scenic resource of the coastal zone due to their high visibility from
many vantage points. Ridgelines are typically defined as the line separating drainage basins. Significant
ridgelines are those whose ridges silhouette the sky or the ocean, and are clearly visible from scenic roads.
These ridgelines are located throughout Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains.
3.2.10.3    Scenic Highways
A primary component of many outdoor recreation activities is movement or travel. One of the most popular
forms of outdoor recreation in southern California is driving for pleasure. The travel to and from recreational
areas is considered a major part of the landscape system, both as a connecting element and as a landscape in
its own right. A scenic highway presents opportunities for visual stimulation from automobiles or tour buses.
In the Malibu area, views from the roads are characterized by panoramic vistas of both steep canyon slopes
covered with native vegetation and the Pacific Ocean. Although development along the coast has signifi-
cantly reduced views of the ocean in some areas of Malibu, there is an opportunity for public investment to
ensure the preservation of many existing views. Many roads in Malibu are considered scenic, but only the
Pacific Coast Highway has been officially designated as an eligible scenic highway by the California De-
partment of Transportation. Official designation of scenic highways is conducted by the State Scenic High-
way Advisory Committee. There are no specific regulations that define the visual characteristics which qual-
ify a road as a scenic highway, but the following considerations are often utilized:
•     Visibility - The driver should be able to experience scenery without having to stop or significantly
      change the necessary angle and duration of vision required for safe driving.
•     Landforms - This parameter includes the physical characteristics of the natural corridor, such as gently
      rolling hills or rugged cliffs, streams, geologic formations, and distant ridges.
•     Vegetation - This parameter includes the type of vegetation within view, such as row crops, orchards,
      chaparral or woodlands.
•     Structures - Buildings may be included in scenic corridors and may add to scenic quality.
•     Panoramas - Scenic overlooks with panoramic views of urban, rural, or natural areas should be in-
      cluded when available.

3.2.10.4    Viewsheds
Viewsheds providing views of the ocean and surrounding areas generally follow watershed patterns and are
displayed in Figure CO-5. They are separated from each other by major ridgelines. Several viewsheds have
high point evaluations. Although these viewsheds are visually distinct from one another, they are similar in
that their visual components are highly scenic. These viewsheds exhibit those characteristics of importance
in the coastal zone- undisturbed natural settings offering scenic viewing opportunities.
3.2.11 Cultural Resources
3.2.11.1    Historic Sites
Malibu history dates back to the Chumash Indians and the village of Humaliwo at the mouth of Malibu
Creek. Point Dume was named by the English Explorer George Vancouver in 1794. Between 1800 and 1892
there were four European owners of the area that is now Malibu. In 1800, Jose Bartolome Tapia acquired a
“use” concession from Spain for the 13,000 acre Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit. This concession stretched
from Point Mugu to Pacific Palisades. In 1848, Leon Victor Prudhomme, the husband of Jose Tapia’s grand-
daughter, purchased Rancho Malibu for 400 pesos. Nine years later, in 1857, Matthew Keller bought the
Rancho for $1,400. The last owners were Frederick and May K. Rindge. It is the legacy of the Rindge Fam-
ily’s determination to restrict development which is responsible for the vast amount of open space found in
the Malibu area today. A more detailed history of Malibu is provided in the Background Report for the Land
Use Element.
There are over 250 officially recognized historic sites in Los Angeles County, four of which are located in
Malibu:
      Adamson House: This site is located at the Malibu Lagoon State Park. It was once the home of Rhoda
      Rindge Adamson, daughter of Frederick and May. K. Rindge. It is the best surviving work and only in-
      tact example of architecture from Stiles O. Clements and represents the Moorish-Spanish Colonial Re-
      vival Style popular in the late 1920s. The site is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and as
      a California Historical Landmark.
      Serra House: This site is located on Landumus Hill near the mouth of Malibu Creek. It is a site of lo-
      cal historic interest as it was once known as the unfinished Rindge Mansion. The site was purchased in
      1942 by the Franciscan Order.
      Malibu Pier: This site is located east of Malibu Lagoon State Park in the commercial core of the City.
      The site is a registered Los Angeles County Landmark and a California Point of Historical Interest.
      Historic Village of Humaliwo: National register site.
3.2.11.2    Archaeological Resources
Present knowledge of the earliest occupations in Malibu is very limited due in part to the small size of early
groups and the reduced probability of charcoal, bones, and shells being preserved in earlier sites. Addition-
ally, earlier coastal sites may have been flooded by rising sea level caused by melting of glaciers and there
was typically poor preservation of stratigraphic features (King, 1993). The following discussion on the
Chumash is based primarily on the paper, Malibu General Plan: Native Societies of Malibu by Chester King,
Ph.D. which is contained as an appendix to this section.

The Santa Monica Mountains were home to Native American Indian people who developed complex social
and economic systems.
The Malibu area was historically occupied by Chumash. The territory inhabited by the Chumash included
San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, the majority of Ventura, southwestern Kern, and northwestern Los Angeles
Counties. The name Chumash has been accepted as an ethnic designation by anthropologists and descen-
dants of people baptized at the Spanish missions in Chumash territory. Chumash cultural sites are important
for providing an identity for the City of Malibu. The name Malibu is derived from Humaliwu, the Chumash
village which served as a capital for the Santa Monica Mountains area (King, 1993).
Chumash society evolved during the last 9,000 years. The evolution of Chumash society is reflected in
changes in artifact forms and diversity, changes in plant and animal food refuse, changes in the organization
of cemeteries, and shifts in settlement patterns. The Chumash were considered to be the most advanced na-
tive society in California because of their emphasis on manufacturing and trade, their development of mari-
time fishing, and their complex bead money system (King, 1993).
In Malibu, the prehistoric period represents over 9,000 years and ended with the beginning of the Spanish
colonization of California in 1769 and the beginning of maintenance of archives of historical documents.
The first historic period was the mission period which ended in approximately 1834 due to the secularization
of the missions (King, 1993).
There are approximately 120 archaeological sites in the City of Malibu. Sites in the Santa Monica Mountains
include village sites, burial grounds, camps or food processing areas, quarries and rock art sites. Many sites
have already been destroyed or disturbed. Currently, only a small percentage of the area has been surveyed,
indicating that additional archaeologically significant sites may exist in the Malibu area.
The east west trend of the Malibu area resulted in the formation of many places well suited to boat launching
and up-welling which provided a rich marine environment. These conditions contributed to a high density of
population along the coast. Within the boundaries of the City four villages have been identified which were
occupied during the period of recruitment to Spanish missions between 1785 and 1810. These villages were
(east to west) Lisiqshi, Sumo, Lojostogni, and Humaliwo.
The village of Lisiqshi was located at the beach near the mouth of Arroyo Sequit and is currently traversed
by Highway 1. The village was inhabited by people recruited by the Ventura Mission.
The village of Sumo is the second largest Chumash site to have been identified in Los Angeles County. It is
believed to have occupied the Point Dume and Paradise Cove area, possibly including all of the marine ter-
races between Little Sycamore and Malibu Canyons. People from the Sumo village were baptized at the San
Fernando and Ventura missions (King, 1993).
Possibly, the most well-documented and intensively investigated site in Los Angeles County is the Hu-
maliwu site. The site contains three separate areas of archaeological or historical significance, including a
prehistoric Indian site, a historic Indian site and an old frame house which was built by original white set-
tlers in the Malibu area (it is now used as a museum). Much of the Humaliwu site is preserved. A second
site, currently located under Highway 1 to the east was also apparently part of the historic village (King,
1993). The site is listed on the National Register of historic places.
In Malibu, cemetery and residential contexts have been excavated which are approximately 7,500 years old.

Channel area indicated that people living along the coast were fishing with bone hooks, using boats or rafts
to trade with the Channel Islands, and were taking sea mammals and large fish. Early mainland residential
sites frequently contain large numbers of milling stones for processing small seeds. Hunting was also of im-
portance (King, 1993).
Early settlements were small hamlets, defensively situated on elevated land forms. Over time, the tendency
was to settle in less defensive and locate in more central locations to facilitate social and economic integra-
tion. Shortly after 1542, many small hamlets were abandoned and some large towns and villages were
formed. The population distribution changes can be attributed to growth in importance of trade centers
(King, 1993).
In addition to permanent settlement sites, other sites in Malibu were occupied during particular seasons
while people were conducting activities away from their villages. These camp sites include sites occupied
while gathering and hunting (King, 1993).
Ethnographic information indicates that Point Dume was an important suns shrine to many native cultures
throughout southern California. Ethnographic literature indicates that the priests of the Point Dume shrine
were respected for their powers which were believed to include the ability to cause rain and to resurrect dead
people (King, 1993).
Due to the culturally sensitive nature of the archaeological resources in the area, the location and extent of
other recorded sites will not be disclosed in this document. Specific sites may be identified as subsequent
environmental documentation is prepared for the City or to determine the impact of individual projects.
3.2.11.3    Paleontological Sites
Los Angeles County is one of the richest areas in the world for both fossil marine vertebrates and land verte-
brates from sediments deposited over the last 25 million years. Many fossilized remains are found in sedi-
mentary rocks of the Santa Monica Mountains that have been tilted and uplifted. There are three significant
paleontological resources in the Santa Monica Mountains in the vicinity of the Malibu area. Only one of
these sites is located in close proximity to the City boundary. The three sites, their location and the signifi-
cant paleontological resources which have been recorded there are described briefly below:
•     West of Topanga Canyon Road and south of the Los Angeles City line - material from the late Mio-
      cene era in the Modelo Formation.
•     Old Topanga Road, south of Calabasas - several marine birds were found in the Modelo Formation
      Upper Member.
•     Southwest of the Ventura Freeway and east of Westlake Boulevard vertebrates from the recent Pleisto-
      cene epoch.
The invertebrate fossils which are found in the area are from the Miocene period. Some of the larger sites
containing these fossils include Old Topanga Canyon Road near Calabasas Peak and Dry Canyon.

                                            3.3     Constraints
3.3.0    In General
Constraints which effect environmental resource management include ecological, governmental, and eco-
nomic factors. The area’s finite resources and their interrelationship with other aspects of the regional eco-
system determine their suitability for management and use. City regulations may have unforeseen side ef-
fects on the preservation and prudent use of these resources. Economic constraints and pressures are often
felt by private land owners in planning the use or development of their land. These economic constraints are
also experienced by public agencies when they attempt to preserve open space and develop parks and recrea-
tion facilities. These constraints and others that may affect environmental resource management in Malibu
are discussed in greater detail below.
3.3.1    Physical Changes in the Environment
Development associated with human settlement results in physical changes to the environment. These
changes typically involve reduced availability or quality of soil and water resources that are important for
human use and the needs of other biological resources. These changes also often result in a reduction of
habitat value and function - for many species of plants and wildlife. This reduction in value and function is
generally associated with a reduction in the areal distribution of vegetation communities and other natural
features which provide essential habitat, but can also involve unnatural competition and predation from in-
troduced, non-native species of plants and wildlife; disruption of the normal fire cycle of local vegetation;
reduced recruitment of young native oaks; fragmentation of existing habitat; noise; unnatural lighting; crea-
tion of barriers to dispersal or migration; and the introduction of environmental contaminants which affect
species viability.
Development can also affect the way we perceive our environment. Changes to scenic resources or visual
viewsheds are often associated with a negative change in the environment. Many people experience a
“crowding” effect when areas that were previously open space are developed. This effect increases in direct
proportion to the magnitude of the physical change in the area or viewshed.
3.3.2    Lack of Comprehensive Resource Surveys
A significant obstacle to the preservation of many of the Malibu area’s natural resources is the lack of com-
prehensive surveys to identify areas supporting sensitive resources. The coastal areas of the MCZ are rela-
tively well-described, but many portions of the upper watersheds have not received as much attention.
The City of Malibu and the MCZ are largely undeveloped and have not been surveyed extensively for the
presence of archaeological, paleontological, and historic resources. These resources have received some at-
tention from academic institutions, but most recorded resources are associated with studies conducted to
comply with CEQA. These studies are rarely comprehensive.
Biological studies which identify important migration and travel corridors also appear to be lacking. A focus
on sensitive vegetation communities and drainages does nothing to ensure that individual watersheds do not
become biologically isolated. Many areas of habitat, not considered to be sensitive, are contiguous with
more sensitive resources and provide the continuity required to avoid biological and genetic isolation of
populations. Preservations of defined areas of suitable habitat is not always sufficient to ensure that popula-
                                                      163

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
tions will not become locally extirpated. This approach is especially true of species which require large areas
of habitat or which occur in very dispersed populations.
Continuing development pressure provides mechanisms (i.e. CEQA and NEPA processes) by which investi-
gation of these resources can occur, but this approach typically results in a piecemeal approach to preserva-
tion of resources. Regional planning for the continued viability of natural resources is much more effective,
but often requires inter-jurisdictional agreements between jurisdictions which do not always agree on the
implementation necessary to maintain the resources. Regional planning is also more costly and the costs are
often not born by development interests.
3.3.3    Maintenance of High Quality Water Resources
Water is a fundamental requirement of all living things. Water is especially important to humans due to our
water-intensive lifestyle. We use water for domestic consumption, to reshape our environment (i.e. lawns
and ornamental plantings), industrially, and to dispose of domestic wastes. These uses however have the po-
tential to affect the availability and quality of water resources, not only for human uses, but for use by other
biological resources.
Much of Malibu has been developed using individual septic systems for each residence rather than a public
sewer system. This strategy has been strongly supported in the community as a means to reduce the rate and
intensity of growth. Because many areas within the MCZ have shallow soils, soils that are impermeable or
slowly permeable, perched water tables, and are subject to flooding, there is some potential to negatively
affect both ground and surface water quality from continued development and use of on-site septic systems,
if such systems are not properly designed and maintained. In recent years, residents have actively worked to
ensure that septic systems are properly designed and maintained. As long as a high level of supervision of
design and maintenance of these systems is maintained, septic systems are not expected to significantly im-
pact the quality of the groundwater resource (Warshall & Williams, 1992).
Another important non-point source of contamination is the Malibu stormwater drainage conveyance sys-
tem. This source of contamination provides some aseasonal flows to drainages, but more importantly con-
veys a variety of urban contaminants which affect biological resources in the drainages, Malibu Lagoon, and
Santa Monica Bay. Each of these resources would benefit from a stormwater drainage management plan
which establishes seasonal water quality standards for these receiving waters. These resources would also
benefit from restoration of freshwater wetlands which can provide some level of biological treatment of con-
taminants as well as development of other measures which trap potential urban pollutants.
Lastly, urban runoff from communities located to the north of Malibu, such as Calabasas, Agoura Hills, and
Westlake, also provide a non-point source of contamination. This source of runoff is also typically aseasonal
and contains various urban pollutants which affect aquatic and marine resources within the MCZ. To address
this issue, Malibu should strive to develop inter-agency management agreements which establish water qual-
ity standards for the various receiving waters.
Point sources of pollution affecting the MCZ have been almost nonexistent with the exception of the Tapia
Water Reclamation Facility (TWRF). The TWRF has been a significant source of aseasonal water flows and
nutrient loading in Malibu Creek and especially Malibu Lagoon. This source of contamination has had major
impacts on the Malibu Creek/Malibu Lagoon system and will continue to reduce the quality of the resources
provided by this drainage if seasonal water quality standards for these receiving waters are not established.

3.3.4    Recreational Uses
Malibu’s location between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains provides residents and visi-
tors with a diversity and abundance of recreational opportunities. These opportunities were officially recog-
nized when the U.S. Congress established the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in 1978.
The canyons, hillsides, beaches, and rocky coast support a variety of natural vegetation communities and
their associated flora and fauna. Many of these resources are located within County, State, and Federal park-
lands or are accessible by local trails. While these resources present a tremendous opportunity for recrea-
tional pursuits, intensive and irresponsible recreational uses of these lands can result in degradation of the
resources. While it is important to manage open space areas for multi-use, it is important to recognize that
some uses are not always compatible in all areas. The physical, visual, and biological resources which attract
many users to areas of open space can be degraded simply by the presence of more people.
Marine resources along the coast have been significantly degraded due to the magnitude of recreational use
and associated human disturbance. As examples, California sea lions which historically hauled out along
Point Dume have moved offshore due to continuing disturbance and the estuaries located at the mouths of
Zuma Creek and Malibu Creek have become polluted not only by urban runoff, but by litter and other wastes
introduced by recreational users.
In order to preserve the quality of the resources which people have come to expect from the Malibu area, it
may be necessary to establish people at one time (PAOT) criteria for some areas of open space which have
been severely effected. It may also be necessary to prohibit access to certain areas until they can be restored.
Lastly, there should be continuing education programs for the residents of and visitors to Malibu that address
the human impacts which affect local resources. Only through the use of mechanisms such as these can the
Malibu area’s resources and the recreational opportunities which they provide be preserved in perpetuity.
3.3.5    Limited City Resources
The limited financial resources of the City can restrict the City’s ability to purchase fee title to land for open
space and natural resource protection. However, a variety of other mechanisms can be utilized to provide for
open space acquisition. These mechanisms include purchase of conservation easements, donations of land or
conservation easements, transfer of development rights, impact mitigation fees, formation of local open
space districts, inter-governmental agreements, and funding from state and federal agencies.
These mechanisms should be explored to the extent possible, especially given that the City may have a more
immediate need to allocate funding to public services. Although private development should not bear the
cost of all open space acquisition, this source of funding can generally provide the most immediate source of
funds for needs of this type.
3.3.6    Development Pressure and Rising Property Values
The preservation of open space and natural resources is also constrained by rising property values and strong
development pressures that result in increased development. From 1980 to 1990 residential development
increased (i.e. individual dwelling units) in Malibu by 10.6%. Development has occurred along the coast, in
the canyons, and on the hillsides of Malibu. Along the coast there is a finite amount of land which can be
developed. A significant amount of the land which is suitable for development has already been developed.
The north side of Pacific Coast Highway appears to provide much of the existing opportunities for develop-
ment in Malibu. However, environmental constraints indicated in the Land Use Element present obstacles to
                                                       165

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
development in many of these areas. Due to demand for suitable land, land prices continue to rise, and in the
absence of strong environmental regulation, development may begin encroaching on areas not subject to
engineering-related environmental hazards, but which support sensitive natural resources. As an example, in
1992 two large residential developments in Trancas Canyon were approved. These areas both supported sig-
nificant terrestrial and marine resources. As land prices continue to rise, difficult land use decisions involv-
ing sensitive or important natural resources are expected to increase.
The unrestricted loss of significant natural resources and open space would be expected to ultimately create
diminished financial and aesthetic values for owners of developed property as well as for visitors to the City.

        3.5      Appendix A—Analysis of Sensitive Terrestrial Habitats by Location
3.5.1    Purpose
Described below are those marine and terrestrial resources which were identified in the Malibu LCP Land
Use Plan to meet the criteria and legal definitions of an environmentally sensitive area, as well as those areas
adjoining sensitive habitat which are functionally related to, or act as a buffer to, the sensitive habitat area
(Malibu Local Coastal Plan Research and Analysis and Appendices, October, 1992 by the Los Angeles
County Department of Regional Planning Coastal Studies Section).
The following describes the environmentally sensitive terrestrial habitats in the Malibu Coastal Zone.
3.5.2    Arroyo Sequit
Arroyo Sequit supports some of the most extensive riparian and oak woodland and associated stream habitat
(pools and waterfalls) in the MCZ. Dense thickets are located along the East Fork. Above the East Fork, the
watershed is undisturbed with the exception of one small stretch of the canyon bottom which contains resi-
dential development and camps. The lower half of the canyon is within Leo Carrillo State Park and is undis-
turbed with the exception of campground facilities located on the canyon floor. Arroyo Sequit may continue
to support steel head.
3.5.3    Willow Creek
Located within Leo Carrillo State Park, this stream supports dense riparian willow thickets and some scat-
tered trees.
3.5.4    San Nicholas Canyon
Coast live oak woodland and grassland are located in the uppermost portion of the canyon. The middle sec-
tion supports diverse and dense riparian woodlands. The lower canyon still retains native trees, although the
understory vegetation has been removed due to grading associated with a private recreational facility. Adja-
cent to the Pacific Coast Highway and extending southward across the highway to the canyon mouth is a
less disturbed and more varied riparian woodland. Directly above the beach, at the mouth of San Nicholas
Canyon are coastal bluffs which support stands of giant coreopsis and other sensitive coastal bluff plant spe-
cies. There are also significant marine resources present at this beach.
3.5.5    Los Alias (Decker) Canyon
There is a diverse riparian woodland dominated by western sycamores and coast live oaks at the canyon bot-
tom. Due to residential development in the vicinity of Decker School Road, the woodland has been altered
significantly. The riparian woodland, which extends south of Pacific Coast Highway, contains numerous
exotic trees, but is dominated by native western sycamores. Significant marine resources are found at this
beach.
3.5.6    Lechuza Canyon
The Lechuza Canyon watershed is relatively undeveloped from the canyon bottom eastward. There are iso-
lated homes in the western portion. Riparian woodland habitat and associated wildlife exist in the canyon
while slopes on the east side support dense stands of coast live oak. A narrow, yet dense stand of riparian
woodland extends south of the Pacific Coast Highway to near the beach.

with oaks, sycamores, ferns and other species typical of the habitat type. A rich diversity of wildlife has been
observed in the canyon, including bobcat, mountain lion, deer, grey fox, coyote, ring-tail cat, bats, three spe-
cies of owls, raptors including the golden eagle and kestrel, and Carolella busckana, a C2 candidate species
for listing as a federally endangered species.
3.5.8     Encinal Canyon
The floor of this canyon contains dense coast live oak and western sycamore dominated woodland. There is
residential development and associated grading on the ridge on the western side of the canyon, while the
eastern side of the canyon is undeveloped. South of the Pacific Coast Highway, at the canyon mouth there
are native riparian trees interspersed with planted ornamentals.
3.5.9     Steep Hill Canyon
The upper section of this corridor contains coast live oaks and western sycamores and is considered sensi-
tive. The lower portion of the canyon however, is not considered sensitive as it is disturbed and dominated
by non-native plants such as castor-bean, palms and eucalyptus.
3.5.10 Trancas Canyon
This canyon is one of the larger canyons in the MCZ. The upper half of the canyon contains scattered
homes, ranches and recreational facilities, while the lower half remains relatively undisturbed. The canyon
mouth is largely developed and suburbanized. The Trancas Canyon Watershed is drained by Trancas Creek,
the major drainage course into the Trancas Lagoon. The estuary area occupies nine acres. The estuary is a
disturbed environmental area which is targeted for restoration by the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project
with the objective of both enhancing the beauty of the area and creating a migration stopover for water fowl.
Additional resident reports about the Canyon resources provide a typical case study of the need for further
research in the Malibu region. These reports include the following:
•      Between Trancas Canyon Road and Lunita Road is a significant blueline stream with thriving native
       riparian habitat at its mouth. The stream allows wildlife movement throughout the area.
•      Within the Malibu West development some of the original floodplain vegetation, including sycamore
       trees and willows, still grow along with oaks within the development. The existing riparian woodland
       is dominated by coast live oaks and western sycamores.
•      The flora of the undeveloped areas consist of mountain chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and grassland
       habitat. Diverse riparian vegetation including willows, sycamores, and live oaks, proliferate along the
       Trancas Creek inland of Malibu West and at the mouth of the blueline stream which defines Trancas
       and Lunita. Deeper into the Trancas Canyon area are oak woodlands.
•      The abundance of vegetation and open space has resulted in the Trancas Canyon area becoming home
       to a number of species of wildlife, including deer, bobcats, raccoon, badger, grey fox, coyotes, hawks,
       eagles, owls, and a variety of snakes, lizards and frogs.

3.5.11 Zuma Canyon
Zuma Canyon is one of the most remote and least disturbed canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains.
Coastal sage scrub and chaparral are scattered over the dry slopes, while the canyon bottom contains a di-
verse riparian woodland and freshwater pools. The pools scattered along the canyon’s perennial stream sup-
port a distinctive freshwater fauna including western pond turtles and native fishes. Secretive species such as
golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), bobcat (Fells lynx), and mountain lion (Fells concolor) continue to be
sighted in Zuma Canyon. Historically, Zuma Canyon also provided nesting habitat for the peregrine falcon.
The Zuma Canyon watershed does not have a significant amount of development. Existing development is
confined to the upper and lower limits of this watershed. The upper watershed is developed with a small
sewage treatment plant and some residential development. The southern end of the watershed is developed
with residential uses. There is one other small developed area within the watershed while the remainder of
the watershed is disturbed only by fire breaks and dirt roads. In the southern portion of the watershed the
stream and associated riparian woodland have been retained in the residential area and constitutes a dis-
turbed, yet significant streamside habitat. The mouth of Zuma Canyon contains a freshwater estuary and
marsh, which is degraded, but has been funded for restoration by the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project,
the National Park Service and Los Angeles County.
3.5.12 Newton Canyon
This canyon is an upper tributary of Zuma Canyon. While it supports riparian woodlands and dense oak
woodlands it has been significantly altered by grading for future and existing development.
3.5.13 Point Dume
This rocky headland supports diverse coastal and upland habitats. The small canyons and ravines dissecting
Point Dume support a mixture of exotic and native vegetation dominated by willows, coyote brush, sage-
brush and several stands of giant coreopsis. Native vegetation has been replaced in many places by urban
development. The upland terrace above the ravines and canyons is almost completely built out with residen-
tial development and associated roads, while much of the canyon and ravine habitats have been disturbed by
the runoff from these areas. Residents report several pockets of relatively undisturbed riparian corridors and
habitat within the Point Dume watershed.
3.5.14 Walnut Canyon
Dense native walnut woodland, willows and scattered elderberry shrubs (Sambucus sp.) are located in this
riparian corridor. While it is relatively undisturbed, there is development on the marine terraces lining both
sides of the canyon.
3.5.15 Ramirez Canyon
The upper and middle sections of Ramirez Canyon are densely wooded with native oaks and scattered west-
ern sycamores. The watershed has been disturbed by grading for Kanan Dume Road (which is located on the
west side of the canyon) and is also bisected by Pacific Coast Highway. However, the location of the wood-
land is not affected by the road and supports diverse wildlife. The lower third of the watershed is developed,
but the native trees and natural stream are intact throughout the canyon bottom. Development in this area
includes a restaurant and mobile homes. Existing data for this canyon may also be somewhat dated. Local
residents report personal observation of alder trees in the upper Canyon.

3.5.16 Escondido Canyon
Residential development and associated roads are located within the Ascended Canyon watershed, particu-
larly on the ridge west of the canyon bottom. Latigo Canyon Road runs through portions of the east side of
the watershed. A sycamore and oak-dominated woodland is located on the cooler north-facing slopes located
west of the stream bottom. The lower and middle sections of the canyon are developed with scattered resi-
dential development, much of which is situated in the riparian woodland. While the stream bed and native
trees are intact throughout much of the developed lower watershed, they are disturbed in the middle portion
where grading and development are more extensive. The mouth of Ascended Canyon extending approxi-
mately one-half mile is targeted for restoration from damage due to grading runoff.
3.5.17 Latigo Canyon
The Latigo Canyon watershed contains scattered residential development and Latigo Canyon Road. Com-
pared to other watersheds in the MCZ, Latigo Canyon and its riparian corridor are relatively small. The least
disturbed and most heavily wooded portions of the canyon are located below and upstream from the Malibu
Vista development. The riparian woodland is fragmented by scattered residential development located just
below the sharp bend in Latigo Canyon Road.
3.5.18 Solstice Canyon
Solstice Canyon is a relatively undisturbed watershed with a riparian woodland that supports white alder
(Alnus rhombifolia), coast live oak, western sycamore and California bay (Umbellularia californica). A few
scattered homes and a narrow road lie at the canyon bottom, but the woodland is intact throughout the can-
yon. A large native wildlife population is present in this watershed due to both the lack of disturbance and
the well-developed vegetation. Unlike many of the other coastal canyons in the area, white alder is present
throughout the entire watershed and indicates a perennial supply of water. While the riparian woodland ex-
tends downstream, there is no natural stream habitat south of the highway. The vegetation is however recov-
ering in this area due to a program of exotic vegetation removal and revegetation (Sarah Dixon, Malibu
General Plan Task Force, personal communication).
3.5.19 Dry Canyon
There is some well-developed riparian woodland in Dry Canyon. However it is less diverse than that of the
other canyons and is adjacent to the extensive El Nido residential development.
3.5.20 Corral Canyon
The upper portion of this watershed is heavily wooded with riparian oak woodlands. From the crest to the
Ocean, habitats are connected. With the exception of the Malibu Bowl development, a few structures in the
lower canyon and scattered dirt roads, the watershed is relatively undisturbed. Corral Canyon is notable for
supporting a broad, wooded flood plain at the canyon mouth, north of and immediately adjacent to the Pa-
cific Coast Highway.
3.5.21 Puerco Canyon
Puerco Canyon is a small watershed which is largely undisturbed. The canyon floor is lined with dense wil-
lows and associated riparian shrubs while the slopes support coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Due to the
undisturbed condition, this canyon supports a large area of high value wildlife habitat.
                                                      181
CONSERVATION ELEMENT
3.5.22 Malibu Canyon
Malibu Canyon supports oak and riparian woodlands with an unusually large variety of riparian plant spe-
cies. Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), California bay, leatherleaf ash (Fraxinus velutina var. cori-
acea), white alder, arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), western sycamore, coast live oak, wild grape (Vitis
girdiana) and giant chain fern (Woodwardia fimbriata) are all abundant. The majority of the watershed is
dominated by a diverse mosaic of chaparral, coastal sage scrub, grassland and native woodlands. Much of
the watershed is remote and undisturbed, particularly the northwest and central portions. Malibu Creek, the
largest creek in the Malibu area, is biologically distinctive due to the fact that it supports a very diverse flora
and fauna which include a number of sensitive species. Malibu Creek also continues to sustain a native
steelhead population. These steelhead area remnant population which historically spawned in the upper
reaches of the creek. The Rindge Dam has provided a barrier to these reaches since the 1920’s, and any
spawning which now occurs takes place below the dam. Malibu Canyon also provides habitat for wide-
ranging species such as mountain lion and golden eagle. In addition, Malibu Lagoon is located at the mouth
of Malibu Creek and is one of only two coastal marshes in Los Angeles County. Malibu Canyon and Malibu
Lagoon have been affected by many human impacts including habitat removal, increased siltation, sewage
effluent discharge, harassment of wildlife by domestic animals and people, and fragmentation by roads and
residences. However, much of the watershed is still undisturbed. Development is concentrated in the ex-
treme upper watershed (Monte Nido, Westlake Village, Agoura Hills, and Calabasas) and the extreme lower
watershed (Civic Center area).
3.5.23 Carbon Canyon
The floor of Carbon Canyon is covered with riparian woodland, particularly in the upper sections of the can-
yon. The lowermost portion of the riparian corridor is disturbed with sparse development located adjacent to
Carbon Canyon Road. The west side of the watershed is undeveloped while the east side contains residential
development and Rambla Pacifico Road. Rock formations in the upper reaches of the canyon provide roost-
ing and possibly nesting sites for sensitive birds of prey such as golden eagle, peregrine falcon and prairie
falcon (Falco mexicana).
3.5.24 Cold Creek Canyon
Cold Creek Canyon is a relatively undisturbed watershed containing year-round water and supporting native
vegetation and wildlife. Undisturbed stands of chaparral, oak woodland, coastal sage scrub, riparian wood-
land and associated wildlife occur in the canyon. The Cold Creek watershed is the last remaining watershed
in the Santa Monica Mountains to support stoneflies (Plecoptera), a group of insects whose aquatic larvae
are very sensitive to siltation and urban runoff containing petroleum based compounds. Many other locally
uncommon species occur in this area including flowering ash (Fraxinus dipetala), redshank (Adenostoma
sparsifolium), Channel Island mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides var. blanchaea), big leaf maple
(Acer macrophyllum), interior live oak (Quercus wizlizenii), Humboldt lily (Lilium humboldtii) and stream
orchid (Epipactis gigantea). In addition, several stands of native grassland support Lyon’s pentachaeta (Pen-
tachaeta lyonii) within this watershed. Native grassland and Pentachaeta lyonii are both uncommon within
the Santa Monica Mountains. The central core of the Cold Creek watershed is generally undisturbed and
utilized only for natural resource oriented uses since much of it is in public ownership. However, residential
development is present both in the upper and lowermost parts of the drainage basin.

3.5.25 Hepatic Gulch
This area is a small, steep hillside which supports an unusual blend of primitive moisture-requiring plant
species. These species include mosses, liverworts, hornworts and ferns. These plants form an unusual asso-
ciation with drought-adapted species such as yucca (Yucca whipplei) and other coastal sage scrub species.
This unique habitat has developed as a result of rapid runoff in the drainage channel. Hepatic Gulch is
mapped as an SEA for these biological resources. However, the mapped location is not co-incident with the
actual location of the unusual vegetative association. The area has been affected by upstream drainage from
an abandoned Nike Missile site, but now appears to be stable.
3.5.26 Piedra Gorda Canyon
Piedra Gorda Canyon is a small, undeveloped watershed. It supports scattered riparian trees and dense ripar-
ian thickets. Due to the degree of isolation, wildlife utilization is expected to be extensive.
3.5.27 Las Flores Canyon and Little Las Flores Canyon
The middle and upper portions of the canyon are remote and undisturbed, while the lower regions contain
substantial development concentrated along Las Flores Road. The riparian woodland and associated stream
habitat that extends upstream from the intersection of Gorge Road and Las Flores Canyon Road supports
western sycamore, white alder, California bay, coast live oak and associated sensitive understory species.
3.5.28 Tuna and Pena Canyons
Tuna and Pena Canyons are adjoining watersheds which are almost completely undisturbed with the excep-
tion of concentrated ranch areas and Tuna Canyon Road. The canyons are considered sensitive because they
support riparian woodlands, year-round water and the lack of significant development (with the exception of
upper Tuna Canyon). The riparian woodlands include dense stands of western sycamore, coast live oak,
California bay, white alder (lower half of Tuna Canyon), black cottonwood and giant chain fern. With the
exception of off road vehicle tracks in the uppermost portion of the watershed, Pena Canyon is nearly undis-
turbed. There has been greater human impact in the northwest portion of Tuna Canyon, due to grading and
grazing.
3.5.29 Topanga Canyon and Tributaries
Topanga Canyon is the largest coastal watershed in the MCZ and supports extensive riparian vegetation.
There is localized residential development throughout the canyon and major holdings of public parklands.
Diverse riparian woodlands with coast live oak, western sycamore, and stands of California bay, big leaf
maple and cottonwood are located on the canyon bottom and adjacent north-facing slopes. Dense native
woodlands are also located in tributaries such as Red Rock, Hondo and Greenleaf. With the exception of
Malibu Canyon, the greatest diversity of amphibian and reptile species in the Santa Monica Mountains are
reported for this watershed (The Distribution and Present Status of the Herpeto Fauna of the Santa Monica
Mountains, Special Publication No. 2, Southwest Herpetological Society, 1986).

4.1.1    Legislative Authorization
Government Code Section 65302(b) requires the general plan to include:
      A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
      thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all corre-
      lated with the land use element of the plan.
Additionally, Government Code Section 65303 is pertinent to the circulation element:
      The general plan may...address any other subjects which, in the judgement of the legislative body, re-
      late to the physical development of the county or city.
4.1.2    Purpose and Scope
The Circulation and Infrastructure Element which has been required to be included in the general plan since
1955 is not considered just a transportation plan. The element should address the circulation of people,
goods, energy, water, sewage, and communications. The purpose of this element is to present a plan for en-
suring that public transportation, services, and utilities are constantly available to permit orderly growth and
to promote public health, safety, and welfare. The element provides a framework within which individual
property owners can plan the development of their property and be assured that basic infrastructure and ser-
vices are available and adequate. Individual service providers and property owners generally are not aware
of citywide or regional issues that affect the ultimate users of their development. This element provides an
area-wide assessment of the different public transit, services, and utilities for a broader understanding of ser-
vice provision.
The Circulation and Infrastructure element sets forth policies and standards for the rational and cost-efficient
provision and extension of public services to support planned development and protect natural resources. It
addresses present conditions and concerns and sets measures for improvement. It is structured to accommo-
date future growth and development patterns. The purposes and goals of the other elements go hand-in-hand
with the goals of the circulation and infrastructure element. Together, they will serve as a guide for decision
making by public and private investors, and for the future expenditure of public funds.
Specifically, the Circulation and Infrastructure Element serves the following purposes:
1.    As one of the state-mandated elements, it fulfills the requirements of the State Planning Act, and the
      regulations in Sections 65530 et seq. of the Government Code of the State of California.
2.    The Circulation and Infrastructure Element evaluates the existing level of services of roads and public
      services and utilities in the city including vehicular roads, bike routes, bus service, water, sewer, police
      and fire protection, power, natural gas, telephone, solid waste disposal, cable, library, hospital and
      school services. It identifies concerns, deficiencies, needs and plans for meeting future needs.
3.    The Circulation and Infrastructure Element informs the public of the goals, objectives, and policies of
      the City for maintenance and improvement of public services. It provides implementation measures
      and programs that will serve as a guide for the day-to-day operational decisions of City staff.

                                          4.2     Circulation System
4.2.1    Description of System
The following section includes a brief description of circulation network found within the Malibu planning
area. More detailed descriptions are contained in the Circulation and Infrastructure Background and Oppor-
tunities and Constraints Reports prepared for the City as part of the General Plan program.
The hierarchy of streets and highways in Malibu range from local streets to state highways. There are four
classifications which summarize the existing roadway network in the City of Malibu: Major Arterials, Minor
Arterials, Collectors, and Locals.
•     Modified Major Arterial: Major roadways providing access from rural to urban areas and access to
      freeways. A typical major arterial consists of a 100-foot right-of-way with six lanes and controlled ac-
      cess, divided by a raised or striped median. Major arterials, serving as an intercity or community facil-
      ity are expected to carry the majority of traffic between Malibu, adjacent communities, and the freeway
      system (see Figure CI-1). Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) would typically be designated a major arterial.
      However, given topographical and safety constraints, PCH in Malibu is limited to four lanes and is des-
      ignated as a modified major arterial.
•     Minor Arterial: Streets providing through service to commercial areas and between cities and/or pro-
      viding access to highways and freeways. This roadway classification consists of an 80-foot right-of-
      way with four lanes, typically with a raised or painted median. Minor arterials, serving as a community
      facility, carry traffic through the community and collect traffic from collector roads.
•     Collector: Streets that collect traffic from local streets within residential areas. Collectors are typically
      characterized by both two lane and four lane undivided roadways with 64-foot rights-of-way. Collec-
      tors within this classification move moderate volumes of traffic through the community and serve as
      routes for locally generated traffic to connect to major and minor arterials. They serve as access routes
      for local residents to reach activity areas in the city and may also provide direct access to commercial
      properties.
•     Local: Streets whose primary purpose is to provide access to individual properties. Locals are two-lane,
      undivided roadways with frequent driveway access and 48- to 58-foot rights-of-way, although many of
      the City’s canyon access roads have less right-of-way. These roads are intended to provide access to
      adjacent residential land uses and to feed traffic to collectors and arterials.
The existing roadway network in the City of Malibu and its vicinity is shown on Figure 4-1. The arterial
network in Malibu consists of Pacific Coast Highway, a major four-lane state highway running the length of
the City, and winding, mountainous, two-lane roadways with sharp turns, steep grades, and poor sight dis-
tance.
The following is a description of the existing roadway network serving the City of Malibu.
•     Santa Monica Freeway (1-10) is a six-lane east-west freeway providing access to downtown Los An-
      geles. The freeway ties into the San Diego freeway (I-405) and, further to the east, the Harbor Freeway
      (I-110) and a chain of freeways in the vicinity of downtown Los Angeles. Near the coast, the Santa
      Monica freeway and State Highway 1 - Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) merge, serving the city as a
      four-lane roadway. The Santa Monica Freeway carries about 143,000 vehicles per day (Source: Cal-
                                                        209

    trans, 1990) at its junction with PCH. Santa Monica Freeway is a designated route within the Conges-
    tion Management Program for Los Angeles County’s roadway system.
•   Ventura Freeway (US 101) is an eight-lane east-west freeway north of the City of Malibu. It provides
    access to Ventura County to the west and San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles metropolitan area
    to the east. Interchanges at Topanga Canyon Boulevard, Las Virgenes Road (Malibu Canyon Road)
    and Kanan Road provide access to and from the City of Malibu. The Ventura Freeway carries ap-
    proximately 187,000 and 149,000 vehicles per day (Source: Caltrans, 1990) at its junctions with To-
    panga Canyon Boulevard and Las Virgenes Road, respectively.
•   Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) (State Route 1) is a four-lane state highway traversing the city from
    east to west along the Pacific Coast. The right-of-way includes an intermittent center turning lane.
    Within the city, PCH is about 25 miles long with a posted speed limit between 45 and 55 miles per
    hour. PCH is the only major arterial within the city. It serves mostly commuters during the weekday
    peak hours. In the summer months, it serves as an access route to the beaches along the coast. Peak pe-
    riods for visitor traffic are on weekends and coincidental with the weekday afternoon commuter peak
    period. PCH has an average daily traffic level varying between 18,000 vehicles per day at its junction
    with Decker Canyon Road and 52,000 vehicles per day (Source: Caltrans, 1990) at its junction with
    Cross Creek Road. PCH carries approximately 47,000 vehicles per day (Source: Caltrans, 1990) at its
    junction with Las Flores Canyon Road. PCH also carries approximately 56,000 vehicles per day
    (Source: Caltrans, 1990) at its junction with Topanga Canyon Road. In the peak months, PCH carries
    approximately 57,000 vehicles per day in the vicinity of Cross Creek Road (Source: Caltrans, 1990).
    Left-turn lanes are provided at major intersections, and an intermittent center lane serves as a turn lane
    for developments along the highway. PCH is a designated bicycle route. Trucks over three axles are
    not permitted on PCH except for local delivery. PCH is a designated route within the Congestion Man-
    agement Plan for Los Angeles County’s roadway system.
•   Topanga Canyon Road (State Route 27) is a two-lane roadway just outside the eastern city border.
    Topanga Canyon Road starts at PCH and extends north to the San Fernando Valley, thus providing re-
    gional access to a predominantly residential neighborhood just outside the City of Malibu. It inter-
    changes with the Ventura Freeway (Hwy 101), and further north with Highway 118. At Pacific Coast
    Highway, Topanga Canyon Road is signalized and left-turn lanes are provided. Near PCH, Topanga
    has an average daily traffic (ADT) of about 14,000 vehicles (Source: Caltrans, 1990). North of Malibu,
    in the Woodland Hills area, Topanga becomes a four-lane arterial carrying about 30,000 vehicles per
    day (Source: Caltrans, 1990) near the Ventura Freeway. The posted speed limit is 35 mph. Topanga
    Canyon Road is a designated route within the Congestion Management Plan for the Los Angeles
    County roadway system.
•   Malibu Canyon Road (County Highway N1) is a north-south arterial that extends from PCH to
    Highway 101 across the Santa Monica Mountains. Malibu Canyon Road has generally one lane in each
    direction. It is a four-lane roadway between PCH and Civic Center Way. It provides access to Pepper-
    dine University, Malibu Creek State Park located just north of the City, and to Hughes Research Cen-
    ter, just inside the City Limits. At its intersections with Pacific Coast Highway and Civic Center Way,
    Malibu Canyon Road is signalized. Near Mulholland Highway, Malibu Canyon becomes Las Virgenes
    Road, which interchanges with the Ventura Freeway. It provides regional access to communities south
    of the Ventura Freeway including Soka University. It is estimated that Malibu Canyon Road carries
    about 9,400 vehicles per day near PCH (Source: Los Angeles County Public Works, 1991) on a typical
    weekday. Also, Malibu Canyon Road is estimated to carry 19,600 vehicles per day north of Civic Cen-
                                                       210

  and through trips. Through trips are those trips which have both origin and destination outside the City
  of Malibu. A significant portion of through trips access western portions of Los Angeles County out-
  side Malibu from the areas around the Highway 101 corridor through the various canyon roads like
  Malibu Canyon Road. This is also referred to as Z-traffic. Further, a significant number of Z-trips ac-
  cess PCH from Malibu Canyon Road via Civic Center Way, thence Webb Way.
• Corral Canyon Road is a two-lane north-south arterial connecting the Santa Monica Mountains Na-
  tional Recreation Area, located north of the city, with Dan Blocker State Beach and Solstice Canyon
  Park. Further north, Corral Canyon Road provides access to Malibu Creek State Park, where it ends.
  Corral Canyon Road carries approximately 120 vehicles during the A.M. Peak Hour (Source: Los An-
  geles County Public Works, 1991).
• Latigo Canyon Road is a two-lane roadway oriented in the southeast/northwest direction. It begins at
  Pacific Coast Highway and goes northwest across the Santa Monica Mountains, meeting Kanan Dume
  Road near the intersection at Mulholland Highway. This roadway serves mostly residents of Latigo
  Canyon. The posted speed limit varies from 10 to 20 miles per hour. It is estimated that Latigo Canyon
  Road carries about an average daily traffic volume of approximately 1,000 vehicles per day north of
  Pacific Coast Highway, and about 300 vehicles per day near Kanan Dume Road (Source: Los Angeles
  County Public Works, 1991).
• Kanan Dume Road (County Highway N9) is a four-lane highway extending from PCH in the south
  to Ventura Freeway in the north. It provides on/off ramps to the Ventura Freeway. It also provides re-
  gional access across the Santa Monica Mountains into the Malibu area. Kanan Dume Road connects
  Agoura with Malibu. It provides access to the beach. It becomes Kanan Road in the Seminole Hot
  Springs area north of Mulholland Highway. Within the City limits, Kanan Dume Road is a City road
  and not a County road. In the vicinity of PCH, Kanan Dume Road has four travel lanes. The intersec-
  tion of Kanan Dume Road and PCH is signalized, and left-turn lanes are provided. A runaway vehicle
  escape median (Truck Arrestor) is provided on Kanan Dume Road at PCH. Vehicles of weight over
  8,000 lbs. or over two axles are not allowed on Kanan Dume Road. Kanan Dume Road carries ap-
  proximately 500 vehicles north of PCH during the A.M. Peak Hour (Source: City of Malibu, Traffic
  Counts 1992). Kanan Dume Road serves both local and through trips (“Z-traffic”). South of Latigo
  Canyon Road, Kanan Dume Road carries an average daily traffic volume of approximately 5,400 vehi-
  cles per day (Source: Los Angeles County Public Works, 1991).
• Decker Road (State Route 23) is a two-lane winding undivided roadway extending from Pacific
  Coast Highway to Mulholland Highway just north of the city limit. Decker Road merges with Mulhol-
  land Highway just north of its intersection with Lechusa Road. At Pacific Coast Highway, Decker
  Road is stop-controlled, and has an ADT of approximately 1,200 vehicles (Source: Caltrans, 1990).
  Decker Road is a designated scenic route. It is also a designated route within the Congestion Manage-
  ment Plan for Los Angeles County’s roadway system.
• Encinal Canyon Road is a north-south, two-lane roadway providing a connection between PCH and
  Mulholland Highway. Near Decker Road, Encinal meets Lechusa Road, which meets Decker Road,
  and continues east to Saddle Rock where it merges with Mulholland Highway. Encinal Canyon Road is
  stop-controlled at PCH. It is estimated from counts that Encinal Canyon Road carries about 1,200 ve-
  hicles per day near PCH (Source: Los Angeles County Public Works, 1991).

•     Mulholland Highway is a two-lane arterial which extends southeast from PCH to Topanga Canyon
      Boulevard. Mulholland Highway starts as a north-south route just west of the city limit, then merges
      with Decker Road and Encinal Canyon Road further east, and continues east to Calabasas Highlands.
      At PCH, Mulholland Highway is stop-controlled. It connects major areas of state and local parks. Mul-
      holland Highway is a designated scenic route.
•     Cross Creek Road is a two-lane roadway connecting various developments in the Malibu Civic Cen-
      ter area to Malibu Canyon Road via Civic Center Way and to Pacific Coast Highway. The Cross Creek
      Road intersection with PCH is signalized. Cross Creek Road is a public roadway for a two block length
      serving commercial developments by PCH and a private road serving the residential area of Sierra Re-
      treat. In the vicinity of PCH, Cross Creek Road is estimated to carry 9,300 vehicles per day (Source:
      Los Angeles County Public Works, 1991).
•     Las Flores Canyon Road is a winding, two-lane roadway that intersects PCH in Malibu and Rambla
      Pacifica north of the city limits. The Rambla Pacifica and Las Flores Canyon Road intersections with
      PCH are both signalized, and operate with a single signal controller. North of PCH, Las Flores Canyon
      Road carries approximately 3,000 vehicles per day (Source: Los Angeles County Public Works, 1991).
      At this time, Las Flores Canyon also carries traffic from Rambla Pacifica neighborhood since Rambla
      Pacifica was closed due to slide activity.
•     Civic Center Way is an east-west two-lane undivided roadway that connects Malibu Canyon Road
      and Cross Creek Road. It serves Malibu Civic Center traffic as well as Z-traffic traveling to and from
      Malibu Canyon Road to PCH. It intersects with Malibu Canyon Road at a signalized intersection. It ex-
      tends further to the east through Stuart Ranch Road/Webb Way to Cross Creek Road. The posted speed
      limit is 40 mph except for a short segment from Vista Pacifica Street to Malibu Canyon Road where
      the speed limit is 25 mph in the school zone only.
•     Trancas Canyon Road is a winding, two-lane undivided, mountainous roadway that extends north
      from Pacific Coast Highway to Santa Monica Mountains National Recreational Area. It intersects with
      PCH at a signalized intersection. It serves a primarily residential area.
4.2.2    Level of Service
The concept of level of service (LOS) is normally used to describe the ability of a roadway to accommodate
prevailing traffic volumes at the critical intersections based on the physical characteristics of the roadway.
LOS ranges from “A” (which represents uncongested free-flow conditions) to “F” (representing total break-
down with stop-and-go operation). LOS definitions are presented in more detail in Table 4-1. Caltrans has
established that State Highways intersections have reached capacity when their LOS declines to E and that
an acceptable operation on Pacific Coast Highway is LOS D. Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu has been
defined by Caltrans to be in an urbanized area. Table 4-1 describes the relationship between operating char-
acteristics and the volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios for the various Levels of Service as defined in the Con-
gestion Management Program for Los Angeles County, Final Draft, September 1992. These definitions are
related to how well intersections function. The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) offers additional
definitions for Level-of-Service in its literature. The ITE definitions describe roadway segment function, a
standard used in many other states.
Traffic counts comprising typical weekday A.M. and P.M. Peak Hour counts were compiled at all the major
intersections along Pacific Coast Highway within the City of Malibu. The data was primarily compiled from
the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and previous studies by Barton-Aschman Associates,
                                                       212

Inc. This information was supplemented by traffic count data collected by Wiltec and Willdan Associates. In
addition, a field reconnaissance on Pacific Coast Highway was conducted. The intersection data compiled
from the above sources was updated to 1992 base year conditions by applying the regionally accepted ambi-
ent growth rate wherever necessary.
The various intersections analyzed in this study include the following:
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Topanga Canyon Road
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Las Flores Canyon Road/Rambla Pacifica
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Malibu Canyon Road
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Corral Canyon Road
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Latigo Canyon Road
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Zumirez Drive
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Kanan Dume Road
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Encinal Canyon Road
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Decker Road
•     Pacific Coast Highway at Mulholland Drive
The intersections of PCH with Mulholland Highway and Topanga Canyon Boulevard are located outside the
City limits. For the purposes of this study, both signalized and unsignalized intersections were analyzed us-
ing the “Intersection Capacity Utilization” technique. The capacity values used for unsignalized intersections
were lower than those used for signalized intersections.
Table 4-2 summarizes the existing levels of service at all the intersections listed above. The time periods
analyzed are the A.M. and P.M. peak hours on a typical workday. In general, during the time periods ana-
lyzed all the intersections except one (PCH and Topanga Canyon) are operating at levels of service accept-
able to Caltrans. The PCH intersection with Topanga Canyon is operating at level of service F in the A.M.
peak hour and D in the P.M. peak hour. The PCH/Las Flores Road intersection is operating at level of ser-
vice C in the A.M. peak hour and D in the P.M. peak hour.
Traffic conditions are expected to worsen in the future with or without buildout. However, the City is limited
in what it can do to address the problem. Many of the roadways within Malibu are under the jurisdiction of
either the State or the County. As regional growth increases, commuters will continue to utilize PCH as an
alternative route to and from Los Angeles and visitors to beaches and regional parks in the City will in-
crease; at the same time, the City does not expect the capacity of PCH to substantially increase. The City of
Malibu considers itself as a rural rather than urban area and has adopted land use designations that will
minimize traffic from resulting development in the City as much as possible but recognizes that the City will
be forced to accept some of the expected regional traffic impacts because they are beyond the City’s control.
To the extent feasible and taking into account the other goals and policies of this Plan, the City will work to
mitigate traffic impacts by cooperating with Caltrans and other surrounding jurisdictions, by ensuring ade-
quate infrastructure for new development and by considering the adoption of a fee on proposed development
to mitigate traffic impacts and fund necessary infrastructure improvements.

A            0.00—0.60        At Level-of-Service A there are no cycles which are fully loaded, and full are even close
                              to loaded. No approach phase is fully utilized by traffic and no vehicle waits longer than
                              one red indication. Typically the approach appears quite open, turning movements are
                              easily made, and nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
B            0.60—0.70        Level-of-Service B represents stable operation. An occasional approach phase is fully
                              utilized and a substantial number are approaching full use. Many drivers begin to feel
                              somewhat restricted within platoons of vehicles.
C            0.70—0.80        In Level-of-Service C station operation continues. Full signal cycle loading is still
                              intermittent, but more frequent. Occasionally drivers may have to wait through more than
                              one red signal indication, and back-ups may develop behind turning vehicles.
D            0.80—0.90        Level-of-Service D encompasses a zone of increasing restriction approaching instability.
                              Delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial during short peaks within the peak
                              period, but enough CKX with lower demand occur to permit periodic clearance of
                              developing queues, thus preventing excessive back-ups.
E            0.90—1.00        Level-of-Service E represents the most vehicles that any particular intersection approach
                              can accommodate. At capacity (V/C = 1.00) there may be long queues of vehicles waiting
                              upstream of the intersection and delays may be great (up to several signal cycles).
F            >1.00            Level-of-Service F represents jammed conditions. Back-ups from locations downstream
                              or on the cross street may restrict or prevent movement of vehicles out of the approach
                              under consideration; hence, volumes carried are not predictable. V/C values are highly
                              variable, because full utilization of the approach may be prevented by outside conditions.

4.2.3    Scenic Highways
A primary component of many outdoor recreation activities is movement or travel. One of the most popular
forms of outdoor recreation in southern California is driving for pleasure. The travel to and from recreational
areas is considered a major part of the landscape system, both as a connecting element and as landscape. A
scenic highway presents opportunities for visual stimulation from automobiles or tour buses. In the Malibu
area, views from the roads are characterized by panoramic vistas of both steep canyon slopes covered with
native vegetation and the Pacific Ocean. Although development along the coast has significantly reduced
views of the ocean in some areas of Malibu, there is an opportunity for public investment to ensure the pres-
ervation of many existing views. Many roads in Malibu are considered scenic, but only the Pacific Coast
Highway has been officially designated as an eligible scenic highway by the California Department of
Transportation. Official designation of scenic highways is conducted by the State Scenic Highway Advisory
Committee.
There are no specific regulations that define the visual characteristics which qualify a road as a scenic high-
way, but the following parameters are often employed:
•     Visibility - The driver should be able to experience scenery without having to stop or significantly
      change the necessary angle and duration of vision required for safe driving.
•     Landforms - This parameter includes the physical characteristics of the natural corridor, such as gently
      rolling hills or rugged cliffs, streams, geologic formations, and distant ridges.
•     Vegetation - This parameter includes the type of vegetation within view, such as row crops, orchards,
      chaparral or woodlands.
•     Structures - Buildings may be included in scenic corridors and may add to scenic quality.
•     Panoramas - Scenic overlooks with panoramic views of urban, rural, or natural areas should be in-
      cluded when available.
The Scenic Highways Element of the Los Angeles County General Plan has identified 21 roads in the
Malibu Coastal Zone as potential scenic highways. The scenic roads within the City of Malibu are:
•  Pacific Coast Highway                    •  Tuna Canyon Road
•  Kanan Dume Road                          •  Corral Canyon Road
•  Malibu Canyon                            •  Latigo Canyon Road
•  Birdview Avenue                          •  Cliffside Drive
•  Encinal Canyon Road                      •  Saddle Peak Road
•  Decker Road                              •  Rambla Pacifico Road
•  Cold Canyon Road                         •  Las Flores Canyon Road
Many of these scenic roads not only enhance the quality of the recreation experience, but also provide the
kind of “open space system” that organizes and communicates the coherence and identity of the region.
4.2.4    Parking
On-street parking is allowed at various locations within the City of Malibu, either on one or both sides along
PCH (see Figure 4-2). PCH serves as the major route of access to the various beaches and beach side facili-
ties within the City of Malibu. Also, there are several surface parking lots on the beach side of PCH within
Malibu. On-street parking on Pacific Coast Highway has exacerbated peak hour traffic congestion as people
                                                         215

look for spaces, and get in and out of their vehicles. This parking arrangement has encouraged jay walking
creating hazards for pedestrian and driver alike. The Local Coastal Plan must include sufficient parking for
visitors.
The approximate locations of on-street and off-street parking along PCH within the City of Malibu are
shown in Figure CI-2. Except for a short segment of PCH just east of Big Rock Drive, on-street parking is
allowed on either side of PCH from the eastern boundary of the City of Malibu to Corral Canyon Road.
Parking is not allowed on either side of PCH between Busch Drive and Morning View Drive, and also in the
vicinity of Trancas Canyon Road. Also, on-street parking is not allowed on the ocean side of PCH for a
small segment just east of Encinal Canyon Road, and is restricted on the ocean side of PCH at Zuma Beach.
4.2.5     Public Transit Services
The City of Malibu is currently served by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(MTA), which operates an intercity express bus route from Los Angeles to Trancas Canyon Road. Figure
CI-3 shows the transit line #434. Para-transit services are also provided in the city. These services are oper-
ated by Babaeian Transportation under contract with the City.

4.3.1    Fire Protection
The Los Angeles County Fire Department provides fire protection service to the City of Malibu. Currently,
four stations (Nos. 70, 71, 88 and 99) directly serve the City, but all Los Angeles County Fire Department
resources are available to serve the City.
The adequacy of fire protection services is assessed according to standards of response distance from a fire
station. The distance standards vary according to the type and intensity of residences (see Table 4-4). Table
4-4 summarizes the equipment and staff resources at each station. As shown, there are a total of seven en-
gine companies which are staffed with firefighters in and near the City of Malibu during each shift.
In the event of a major fire, additional equipment is kept in reserve at most of the stations to be used by off-
duty firefighters. The Ventura County Fire Department’s staff indirectly provides fire protection services to
the Santa Monica Mountains by protection and control of fires on adjacent lands. The United States Park
Service also provides additional fire protection.
4.3.2    Police Services
The City of Malibu is served by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. The sheriff operates a station
in the Lost Hills area north of the City; the County recently closed their station in the Civic Center. Police
protection in the City is hampered by the length of the City and its relatively low density. The secluded ori-
entations of many residential neighborhoods provide little or no opportunity for regular visual inspection
from major arterial roadways. Average response time is within normal range because the Lost Hills station is
fully staffed.
4.3.3    Schools
The elementary schools and high school district in Malibu are served by the joint Santa Monica-Malibu Uni-
fied School District, an independent agency governed by a Board of Trustees. Enrollment has increased sub-
stantially since 1980. The classrooms in Malibu are nearing capacity due to population increases. There are
two elementary schools in Malibu run by the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District: Cabrillo Ele-
mentary and Webster Elementary. Both schools are now experiencing increasing levels of enrollment. Dur-
ing the 1995 school year both schools experienced an increase of approximately 30 students. Some of this
increase is from students who do not live in Malibu. The schools each accept students from other districts if
their parents work or have some type of child care arrangements in Malibu. Existing and proposed student
enrollment is listed in Tables 4-6 and 4-7. A third elementary school on Point Dume was closed in the 1980s
due to lack of students and is now operated as a community center. This site is still owned by the school dis-
trict.

High School
Malibu High School is located at 30215 Morning View Drive, adjacent to Cabrillo Elementary and just
northwest of Point Dume. The school currently serves grades 6 through 9 and will continue to add a grade
for the next three years resulting in the service of grades 6 through 12 by the year 1995. The school site is
approximately 25.9 acres with 20 of those acres donated for the Malibu Equestrian Center by the
Malibu/Santa Monica Unified School District. An additional 22 acres declared as surplus has been given to
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for first right of refusal. Existing and proposed student enrollment
is listed in Table 4-8.
4.3.4     Hospitals
The City of Malibu uses Santa Monica Hospital as the base hospital for emergency care for residents in
Malibu. Santa Monica Hospital is located at 1250 16th Street in the City of Santa Monica—a distance of
between 4.5 and over 25 miles from Malibu, depending upon from where in Malibu the distance is meas-
ured. Travel to the hospital can take as much as 40 minutes at other than peak hours. Nearby hospitals used
when Santa Monica Hospital emergency facilities are at full capacity are the University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center located at 10833 Le Conte Avenue in Los Angeles, and Westlake Hospital
located at 4415 South Lakeview Canyon Road, Westlake Village. Helicopters are often used during peak
periods to reduce travel times. The adequacy of hospital services is difficult to determine due to the different
range of services offered.
4.3.5     Libraries
The Malibu Library is a branch of the Los Angeles County library system and is located at 23519 Civic Cen-
ter Way. It is the only library facility serving the City of Malibu. The Malibu Library provides adult and ju-
venile reference services and materials; audiovisual materials, including compact discs, VHS videocassettes
and Listen for Pleasure audiocassettes; Reader’s Advisory. The Malibu Library serves a population of
20,282 and 7,506 housing units in and around the City. The library is 16,530 square feet and holds over
64,000 books. The library maintains a cooperative lending relationship with County library in Los Angeles
through the South State Cooperative Library System.

4.3.6     Utilities
The Southern California Edison Company (SCE) provides electricity from three primary stations and three
secondary stations. The Southern California Gas Company provides natural gas and General Telephone pro-
vides telephone service. Cable television is an information and entertainment source for residents of most
areas of the City. Presently, Falcon Cable services the Malibu area.
Water is supplied to the City of Malibu by County Waterworks District No. 29 from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California (MWD). The MWD obtains its water from the State Water Project and the
Colorado River. Wholesalers of this water in the Malibu/Santa Monica Mountains area are the Las Virgenes
Municipal Water District and the West Basin Municipal Water District. These wholesalers distribute to three
retailers which include the Los Angeles County Waterworks District No. 29, Silvas Park Mutual Water
Company, and Las Virgenes Metro Water District.
Many of the City’s water mains and tanks have been identified by the City and by Waterworks District No.
29 as severely undersized. District No. 29 estimates it may cost $100,000,000 to upgrade the City’s water
system to current minimum standards.
There are also a number of private wells that supply water within the City. However, the utilization of wells
as a source of potable water has steadily declined since 1965, when water became available through the
MWD. Although the amount of water supplied by these wells is now considered to be insignificant, they are
sources of inexpensive water to agricultural and other interests located away from piped water service (In-
corporation of Malibu EIR, 1989).
Municipal sewer service is available only up to the far eastern end of the City. There is no municipal sewer
in Malibu. There are five small, package sewage treatment plants within the city: the Latigo Bay Shores,
Point Dume, Trancas Canyon, Malibu Mesa and Maison de Ville. Hughes Research Lab operates their own
facilities and Pepperdine University is served by the Malibu Mesa Plant. These plants are described in detail
in the Philip Williams & Associates Ltd. and Peter Warshall and Associates report of March 1992 entitled
“The Malibu Wastewater Management Study.”
Most wastewater is treated on-site. Improperly maintained septic systems have caused alleged health and
safety problems, but, with adequate area for leaching fields or regular disposal, can be safely operated in
almost all areas of the City. The “Malibu Wastewater Management Study” recommends programs for ensur-
ing that septic systems are properly engineered, installed and maintained. Details of the hazards associated
with the systems are described in the Background Report to the Safety Element.
Solid waste disposal in Malibu is presently handled by four private hauling companies, one of which is un-
der contract to service the Los Angeles County/Malibu Garbage Disposal District. All four haulers deliver
solid waste to the Calabasas Landfill. The Calabasas Landfill is owned and operated by the Los Angeles
County Sanitation District and services Malibu as one of many regional sources. The landfill is presently
scheduled for closure in 2015 and as of 1990, has a remaining capacity of 12 million tons of waste yielding a
projection that the landfill will accommodate an average 500,000 tons of waste each year during that period.
Malibu contributes less that 10% of that amount. Based on the 1992 Preliminary Draft Source Reduction and
Recycling Element for the City of Malibu, there were 38,750 tons of waste disposed from Malibu residents
and businesses in 1991.

               4.4      Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures
4.4.1 C GOAL 1:              SAFE, ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AND EFFICIENT
                             TRANSPORTATION FOR THE CITY
C OBJECTIVE 1.1:             SAFE, EFFICIENT AND CONVENIENT TRAFFIC SYSTEM WITH A
                             MINIMUM OF IMPACT OR COST.
      C Policy 1.1.1:        Where level of service at signalized intersections and roadways is below LOS C,
                             the City shall ensure that proposed development maintains the then current LOS.
                             Where LOS at signalized intersections and roadways is at LOS C or above, the
                             City shall ensure that proposed development (1) does not cause a degradation of
                             LOS greater than or equal to two percent in the circumstances set forth in Land
                             Use Implementation Measure 70 and (2) does not degrade LOS below LOS C.
      C Policy 1.1.2:        The City shall utilize sound traffic engineering and enforcement principles to
                             safely regulate traffic and improve traffic flow.
      C Policy 1.1.3:        The City shall improve traffic flow through procedural improvements.
      C Policy 1.1.4:        The City shall reduce peak time traffic.
To implement this policy the City shall:
C Implementation Measure 1: Implement the provisions of the Los Angeles County Congestion Manage-
ment Program by requiring development projects to analyze and provide appropriate mitigation for traffic
impacts on regional circulation facilities.
C Implementation Measure 2: Utilize appropriate operational and physical improvements such as meter-
ing, signal synchronization, pedestrian overpasses, re-signalization, provision of acceleration/deceleration
lanes, and improvement of existing and creation of new left turn lanes.
C Implementation Measure 3: Cooperate with Caltrans, the Counties of Los Angeles and Ventura, the City
of Los Angeles, and neighboring cities along the Ventura Freeway to improve the flow of traffic in sur-
rounding areas which impact Malibu traffic.
C Implementation Measure 4: Ensure that proposed development mitigate traffic impacts by building or
financing infrastructure improvements necessary to serve the development and by considering adoption of a
traffic impact fee.
C Implementation Measure 5: Undertake a study of 1996 traffic conditions in the City, including peak
hour and summer traffic. The study shall include an analysis of future infrastructure capacity. The results of
the study shall be presented to the City Council in Fall 1996.
C Implementation Measure 6: Promote cooperation between the City, County, Sheriff and Caltrans to limit
and restrict hours of closure of PCH, Malibu Canyon Road and Kanan Dume Road lanes during repairs, con-
struction, filming, and other activities.

SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
                                            5.1      Introduction
5.1.1    Legislative Authorization
California Code Section 65302(1) requires each local government to prepare and adopt a Safety Element as
a component of their General Plan. This involves identifying and mapping natural hazards and the admini-
stration of zoning and subdivision regulations that account for the safety hazards. Avoiding loss of life and
property can be achieved if the problem areas of a community are recognized early and if the planning and
approval process undertake an orderly means of mitigating potential hazards.
California Government Code Section 65302(g) recognizes that many actions that reduce risk from such haz-
ards as fire, storms, flooding, and landsliding also may result in the reduction of risks from earthquakes. In
accordance with the statutory requirements of the code, the Safety Element must assess threats to public
health and safety from, but not limited to, the following:
•     Seismic hazards: ground shaking, surface rupture, and ground failure;
•     Geologic hazards: slope instability, landsliding, and unstable ground;
•     Flood and inundation hazards: tsunami, seiche, dam failure, and storm induced flooding;
•     Wildland and urban fire hazard; and
•     Other safety issues as desired by the community, or suggested in the General Plan Guidelines, includ-
      ing the threat of hazardous materials releases, potentially hazardous buildings, protection of critical fa-
      cilities, and emergency response issues.
5.1.2    Purpose and Scope
Much of the City of Malibu remains undeveloped as a result of constraints posed by the natural environ-
ment. Early identification of these hazards can minimize the level of public exposure. With regard to fault-
ing and seismicity, primary hazards include surface fault rupture and ground shaking, while secondary seis-
mic hazards include tsunamis, seiche, liquefaction, lateral spreading and seismically-induced subsidence and
landslide movement. Slope instability, including landslides, mud and debris flows, and soil creep, have a
common occurrence in hillside areas. Expansive soils, compressible or collapsible soils, high groundwater
and shoreline regression are additional geologic/geotechnical hazards which occur throughout the City. Each
of these geologic/geotechnical and safety hazards is a constant threat to the property and health of residents
in Malibu within and surrounding the areas where they exist.
The purpose of the Safety Element is to create a cohesive guide consisting of specific policy-oriented im-
plementation measures. The policies and implementation measures contained in this element will provide
direction and a course of possible future action for the various City departments. To achieve its purpose, the
City of Malibu General Plan accounts for hazardous issues. The intention is to reduce the potential for loss
of life, injuries, damage to property, and social and economic dislocation resulting from major hazards
throughout the community. A detailed analysis of the physical characteristics of Malibu and a list of the
source documents used in the analysis may be found in the Safety Element Background Report.

                                        5.2       Existing Conditions
5.2.0    Purpose
The following information summarizes background data and analysis prepared as part of the preparation of
this General Plan and Safety Element. A full and complete copy of the background studies is available for
public review in the City’s Planning Department offices.
5.2.1    Geology and Topography
The City of Malibu is located within the Santa Monica Mountains which are characterized by steep and rug-
ged hillsides and valleys and canyons draining into the Pacific Ocean. Elevations within the City range from
sea level to approximately 1,700 feet above sea level. Most of the developed areas along the coast lie below
100 feet with the exception of the Point Dume and Malibu Park areas which reach an elevation of 500 feet.
The hillsides and coastal mesas such as Big Rock and Las Flores have elevations ranging from 300 to 400
feet above sea level.
The City is in an area of the California coast that encompasses extremely complex geology that has resulted
from the geologic uplift that formed the Santa Monica Mountains. The City is located within the northwest-
ern corner of the Los Angeles basin, which lies at the boundary or juncture between two major geomorphic
or structural provinces of southern California: the Peninsular Ranges province, consisting primarily of a
northwest-oriented structural grain, and the Transverse Ranges structural province, which features a pre-
dominantly east-west-oriented structural grain.
The Los Angeles structural basin originated roughly 16 million years ago in what is designated the Miocene
geologic epoch, but the Los Angeles basin area in general has been a site of continuous sedimentary deposi-
tion for at least the past 80 million years, or since the Late Cretaceous period (Yerkes et al, 1965). The sedi-
mentary rocks underlying the Santa Monica Mountains in the Malibu area are generally highly folded and
complexly faulted, making their stratigraphic interpretation very difficult for geologists (Yerkes and Camp-
bell, 1979).
The geologic formations that are present in the Malibu area (see also Figure S-1) include a full range of en-
gineering geologic rock types that include, in alphabetical order:
•  Alluvium (creek beds)               • Conglomerates                       • Mudstones
•  Beach and sand dune deposits        • Colluvium (foothill areas)          • Sandstones
•  Cemented sandstones                 • Debris flow deposits                • Shales
•  Cherts                              • Diatomaceous beds                   • Siltstones
•  Claystones                          • Mixed-rock terrace deposits         • Various volcanic rocks
The common geologic formation names in the Malibu area would include, in alphabetical order:
•  Calabasas Formation                 • Conejo Volcanics                    • Coal Canyon Formation
•  Llajas Formation                    • Modelo Formation                    • Monterey Shale
•  Sespe Formation                     • Topanga Canyon Formation            • Trancas Formation
•  Tuna Canyon Formation               • Vaqueros Formation                  • Zunia Volcanics
                                                        235

SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
Other geologic names used to describe the earth materials in the Malibu area which are geologically younger
than the formations listed above would include:
•  Artificial fill                                         • Landslides and landslide deposits
•  Coastal terrace deposits                                • Stream terrace deposits
•  Debris trains                                           • Undifferentiated surficial deposits
•  Fan deposits
The complexity of the interrelationship between all of the geologic rock types has resulted from the fault
movements along the Malibu Coast fault and the myriad of subsidiary faults, mapped and as yet unmapped.
The local bedrock structure of the Santa Monica Mountains in the Malibu area north of the Malibu Coast
fault zone can be modeled as an asymmetric, south-vergent, westward-plunging anticline, whose southern
limb has been partially truncated by the Malibu Coast Fault Zone (Yerkes and Campbell, 1980; Dibblee,
1982). This structural style of broad anticlinal folding reflects a higher degree of mechanical competency,
and propensity for brittle deformation, within the sandstone and siltstone bedrock sequence occurring north
of the Malibu Coast Fault Zone; e.g., Tuna Canyon Formation, Sespe Formation, Vaqueros Formation, and
Topanga Group.
South of the Malibu Coast Fault Zone, the ductile bedrock units, Trancas and Monterey Formations, contain
a high percentage of shales, mudstones and diatomaceous rocks exhibiting complex folding and pervasive
shearing. However, bedrock structure on both sides of the Malibu Coast Fault Zone exhibit overwhelming
evidence for south-vergent compressive deformation, including north-dipping bedding parallel to axial plane
shear surfaces, gently plunging fold axes trending east-west, small-scale shear and fault surfaces exhibiting
top-to-the-south displacement in exploratory trenches and roadcuts, and the ubiquitous 45-to-80-degree
northward dips of all fault splays within the Malibu Coast Fault Zone, including the Malibu Coast Fault
proper (Yerkes and Wentworth, 1965; RSA Associates, 1989, 1990; Rzonca et al, 1991).
5.2.2     Geologic Hazards
Faulting and Seismicity: The recently published foreword from “California at Risk, Reducing Earthquake
Hazards 1992-1996” explains the State viewpoint on the importance of recognizing seismic hazards with the
following:
      It is government’s primary duty to assure public safety. No California jurisdiction would ignore a ma-
      jor toxic spill threat, a big fire hazard, or any other such “clear and present danger.” While the dan-
      gers posed by earthquakes are clear, many of the responsible government officials do not see them as
      clearly present and immediately threatening. Thus it is essential to emphasize the earthquake danger to
      public safety and economic stability. This ever-present hazard can be reduced and emergency response
      strengthened.
The State of California has aggressively embarked on its goal to significantly improve earthquake safety by
the year 2000. An agenda of initiatives has been established that will involve dozens of state agencies, local
agencies, the private sector, and volunteer groups. The state program includes 42 initiatives in five catego-
ries:
1.    Addressing the hazards associated with existing vulnerable facilities, including utility and transporta-
      tion systems as well as buildings;
                                                        236

                                                                         SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
2.    Improving the seismic resistance of new facilities;
3.    Improving management of the emergency response and relief efforts;
4.    Improving disaster recovery; and
5.    Supporting research and public information and education.
The important initiatives that have resulted from the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake in the San
Francisco area are a clue to some of the important issues which could be important to Malibu as follows:
•     Initiative 1.1: Establish seismic evaluation and retrofit building standards.
•     Initiative 1.3: Improve safety of older public school buildings.
•     Initiative 1.8: Improve safety of homes. Improper wall bracing and anchorage can lead to condemned
                       buildings and the number of homeless following a major quake.
•     Initiative 1.9: Improve safety of mobile homes.
•     Initiative 1.11: Reduce work-place hazards. Furniture, equipment, and stock often are not secured,
                       causing loss of function, hazards to employees, and significant damage.
•     Initiative 1.16: Improve earthquake performance of transportation structures. A major effort is re-
                       quired to retrofit highway bridges.
•     Initiative 2.2: Map geologic hazards.
•     Initiative 3.1: Improve emergency communications systems.
•     Initiative 3.6: Improve shelter planning. Urban earthquake victims require shelter services for a
                       longer period than victims of other disasters.
•     Initiative 4.1: Implement recovery guidelines.
In addition to the above, a review of the Initiatives in the “California at Risk, Reducing Earthquake Hazards
1992-1996” also outlines numerous other state initiatives which can serve as guidelines for the City of
Malibu when picking its priorities. Summaries of these important initiatives have been reproduced in the
Safety Element Background Report in Appendix B, Summary Of California Seismic Safety Commission
Initiatives, 1992-1996. Actual State legislation which may affect Malibu is summarized in Appendix C, Leg-
islation: The Last Five Years.
There are numerous faults surrounding and traversing the Malibu area, including the Malibu Coast Fault, the
Santa Monica Fault, the Las Flores Reverse Fault, and the Anacapa Fault. These faults are not well defined
as they are not generally visible on the surface. Maps provided in the Background Report to Safety Element
of the General Plan delineate a 1,000-foot area on either side of all faults as areas which could be subject to
seismic hazard; see also Figures S-2 and S-3.
The location, geometry, sense of displacement and magnitude of maximum credible earthquake (MCE)
events along the following regional faults, each of which may generate strong ground shaking impacting the
Malibu area, are described below. (The Maximum Credible Earthquake Event is the worst-case design
earthquake magnitudes.) Historical and predicted maximum earthquake magnitudes are given as moment
                                                       237

SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
rather than the historically more common Richter magnitude, since the former is generally accepted as a bet-
ter estimate of the seismic energy released during an earthquake because it is calculated from the actual
physical dimensions of a fault zone (Wesnousky, 1986; Joyner and Fumal, 1985).
San Andreas Fault
      Although it lies 81.5 miles east of the Malibu area, the southern segment of the San Andreas fault, run-
      ning from Tejon Pass to Cajon Pass, is considered capable of generating a maximum 8.0 magnitude
      earthquake which could generate significant ground shaking in the City of Malibu. This design earth-
      quake is supported by the historical record, including the great 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, estimated
      at 7.9 magnitude, and the more recent 1992 Landers earthquake of magnitude 7.4. The San Andreas
      fault has strike-slip displacement, and a well-documented mean recurrence interval of approximately
      130 years for great earthquakes. Recent data suggest that such large events may actually occur in tem-
      poral “clusters” separated by much larger time periods on the order of 300 to 400 years apart (Sieh,
      1984; 1989).
Anacapa (Dume)-Santa Monica Fault Zone
      Originally recognized on the basis of bathymetric contours in Santa Monica Bay, the Anacapa or Dume
      fault is a near-vertical offshore escarpment exceeding 600 meters locally, with a total length exceeding
      62 miles (Yerkes and Wentworth, 1965; Junger and Wagner, 1977). It occurs as close as 3.6 miles off-
      shore south of Malibu at its western end, but trends northeast where it apparently merges with the off-
      shore segment(s) of the Santa Monica Fault Zone, thus lying as close as two miles south of the Malibu
      Beach/Carbon Beach area. This fault is assumed responsible for generating the historic 1930 M5.2
      Santa Monica earthquake, the 1973 M5.3 Point Mugu earthquake, and the 1979 and 1989 Malibu
      earthquakes, each of which possessed a magnitude of 5.0 (Ziony and Yerkes, 1985; Hauksson, 1990).
      Analyses of the first-motion seismic waves produced by these latter three earthquake events suggests
      that the faults which produced them were north-dipping structures, and that the earthquakes resulted
      from south-vergent compression of the crust (Stierman and Ellsworth, 1976; Hauksson and Saldivar,
      1986; 1989). Such studies are termed “first-motion” or “focal mechanism” solutions for the earth-
      quakes, and suggest that the Anacapa fault is a south-vergent thrust fault. Because the Anacapa fault
      appears to truncate the northwest-striking, strike-slip Palos Verdes Fault Zone of Peninsular Ranges af-
      finity, the former fault is considered the present-day southern margin of the zone of thrust faults which
      punctuate the Transverse Ranges province.
The Santa Monica Fault
      The Santa Monica fault is interpreted as a 25 mile long zone with physiographic up-to-the-north scarp
      features along its trace which imply at least Late Quaternary displacement (Weber, 1980; Crook et al,
      1983). The fault is truncated eastward by the Newport-Inglewood zone, implying that the latter be-
      haves as a tear fault and possibly a segment boundary (Dolan and Sieh, 1992). Focal mechanism solu-
      tions of small-magnitude (micro seismicity) earthquakes at the eastern end of this fault suggest that it is
      active (Ziony and Yerkes, 1985) as a thrust fault with a minor component of left-lateral horizontal dis-
      placement; evidence for this left-lateral component can be seen in a series of en echelon left-stepping
      fault scarps (Dolan and Sieh, 1992). Hauksson (190) considers the Anacapa/Santa Monica fault zone as
      the westernmost segment of the Elysian Park Fold and Thrust Belt, a buried or “blind thrust” fault zone
      forming the southernmost boundary of the Transverse Ranges, and which was responsible for the 1987

     M5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake (Hauksson and Jones, 1989). This fault has not yet been fully
     evaluated under the Division of Mines and Geology Fault Evaluation Program (FER), and thus does
     not currently possess Alquist Priolo classification as an active fault.
Newport-lnglewood Structural Zone
     Located between 18 and 31 miles east of the City of Malibu, the Newport-Inglewood zone consists of a
     series of enechelon, northwest-striking right-lateral strike-slip fault segments and related fold structures
     defined physiographically by a series of low hills crossing the Los Angeles coastal plain. The north-
     ernmost of these, the Inglewood segment, intersects the Santa Monica fault zone in the Cheviot Hills
     area, which represents the complex structural boundary between the Peninsular Ranges and Transverse
     Ranges. The fault has a potential to generate moment magnitude of 7.0 (Ziony and Yerkes, 1985; Top-
     pozada et al, 1988). Total onshore length of the fault is 46.5 miles; all mapped surface deformation
     zones along the various segments of the fault have been granted Alquist-Priolo classification (Hart,
     1990). The fault produced the 1920 magnitude 4.7 Inglewood earthquake and the great 1933 magnitude
     6.2 Long Beach earthquake, and the 1989 magnitude 4.6 Newport Beach earthquake. This fault zone
     has more seismicity associated with it than any other Late Quaternary faults in the Los Angeles basin
     (Hauksson, 1990).
Palos Verdes Fault Zone
     Located south of Malibu, the northernmost trace of this northwest-striking, right-reverse-slip fault oc-
     curs 7.5 miles south of the city limits, in Santa Monica Bay where it apparently intersects or merges
     with the Anacapa (Dume) fault discussed above. Its onshore segment forms the northwestern boundary
     of the Palos Verdes Hills and has significant reverse-slip component, whereas offshore it appears to be
     dominated by right-lateral displacement. The zone apparently displaces acoustically-transparent ocean-
     floor sediments in San Pedro Bay (Darrow and Fischer, 1983), interpreted to be water-saturated and
     thus formed recently in the Holocene period. The zone is about 50 miles long. Increases in recent seis-
     micity along the Santa Monica Bay segment of this fault also imply Holocene displacement, although
     the spatial correlation of this seismicity with the geophysically-mapped offshore fault trace is not pre-
     cise (Hauksson and Saldivar, 1989). Nevertheless, the fault is considered active and assumed capable
     of generating a maximum earthquake magnitude of 7.0; although it has not yet been granted active
     classification under Alquist-Priolo.
Ventura/Pitas Point Fault
     Located 19.8 miles northwest of Malibu, this fault, like the San Fernando Fault, has a thrust or reverse-
     slip sense of displacement. Although only 6.2 miles of onshore surface trace has been mapped, the
     fault extends offshore to the west for a minimum of 24.5 miles and displaces probable Holocene sedi-
     ments (Greene and Kennedy, 1986). This fault has been zoned active under Alquist-Priolo, and was the
     probable source of a 7.1 magnitude 1812 event, a 6.8 magnitude 1925 event, a 5.0 magnitude 1930
     event, and a 5.6 magnitude 1978 event, all of which had epicenters along the offshore extension of this
     fault in the Santa Barbara Channel. Therefore, a maximum design magnitude of 7.25 is assumed for
     this fault. Rates of crustal compression and tectonic uplift in the Southern California area are highest
     along this fault zone, based on the ages of uplifted and deformed marine terraces in the Ventura area
     (Lajoie et al, 1979).

SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
San Fernando Fault
     Located 14.8 miles northeast of Malibu, at the north end of the San Fernando Valley, this is a thrust
     fault with similar length, sense of displacement and character to the Malibu Coast Fault Zone and other
     Transverse Ranges-type faults. This fault generated the 1971 San Fernando earthquake of magnitude
     6.6, which caused strong ground shaking in the Malibu area, and which was the impetus behind the
     Alquist-Priolo legislation. The fault is estimated to be able to yield a maximum 6.5 magnitude earth-
     quake by Wesnousky (1986), based essentially on its mapped 10.5 miles of surface rupture during the
     1971 event; however, Mualchin and Jones (1987) assume continuity with the Sierra Madre fault zone
     to the east, which has similar sense of displacement and a maximum design magnitude of 7.5 (Crook et
     al, 1987). A maximum earthquake magnitude of 7.0 is estimated herein. The entire fault zone, based on
     the surface rupture in 1971, is designated as active under Alquist-Priolo. On January 17, 1994, an esti-
     mated 6.7 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Northridge/Reseda area of the San Fernando Valley;
     preliminary analysis indicates that this earthquake was not part of the San Fernando Fault but was as-
     sociated with the Oak Ridge Fault Zone or the Santa Susana Fault Zone.
Malibu Coast Fault Zone
     The Malibu Coast fault zone runs in an east-west orientation onshore subparallel to and along the
     shoreline for a linear distance of about 17 miles through the Malibu City limits, but which also extends
     offshore to the east and west for a total length exceeding perhaps 37.5 miles (Junger and Wagner,
     1.977; Greene and Kennedy, 1986). Onshore, this fault extends from Sequit Point in the west to Carbon
     Beach in the east (Yerkes and Campbell, 1980; Dibblee and Ehrenspeck, 1990), although recent map-
     ping suggests that the Las Flores thrust fault may conceivably represent an onshore extension of this
     fault zone, thus pushing its onshore eastern limits to the Big Rock/Las Tunas beach areas (Dibblee and
     Ehrenspeck, 1992).
     The onshore Malibu Coast fault zone involves a broad, wide zone of faulting and shearing as much as
     one mile in width; the Malibu Coast fault proper is only one fault splay within this broad deformation
     zone, but it is the most prominent feature within the zone because it juxtaposes two crustal blocks of
     extremely different character on either side of its length (Durrell, 1954; Schoellhamer and Yerkes,
     1961; Yerkes and Wentworth, 1965). To the north, a basement terrain of granite and related igneous
     rocks, intruded into older metasedimentary-rocks termed the Santa Monica Slate, is overlain by a thick
     sequence of sedimentary rocks ranging in age from Late Cretaceous to Recent; to the south of the
     Malibu Coast fault proper, a basement terrain of high-pressure metamorphic rocks termed the Catalina
     Schist is overlain unconformably by a sequence of sedimentary rocks no older than Miocene, including
     the distinctive Monterey Formation, which is locally highly diatomaceous (Yerkes and Campbell,
     1979). This latter crustal block south of the Malibu Coast fault is often termed a “Continental Border-
     land” terrain (Yerkes et al, 1965; Legg, 1992), because the Catalina Schist basement terrain underlies
     most of the offshore zone of southern California, which is conventionally known as the Continental
     Borderland.
     The Malibu Coast Fault Zone (MCFZ) has not been officially designated as an active fault zone by the
     State of California and no Special Studies Zones have been delineated along any part of the fault zone
     under the Alquist-Priolo Act of 1971. However, evidence for Holocene activity (movement in the last
     11,000 years) has been established in several locations along individual fault splays within the fault
     zone. Due to such evidence, several fault splays within the onshore portion of the fault zone are identi-
                                                     240

      fied as active in the Seismic Element of the County of Los Angeles (Leighton and Associates; 1990).
      With reference to inferred active fault splays in Malibu, the Los Angeles County Seismic Safety Ele-
      ment map contains a note which states:
            “A primary objective of this map is to increase public awareness of fault rupture hazards recog-
            nized by the state-mandated Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act (APSSZ). Additional faults
            inferred to be active are included on the map because there is published information or scientific
            opinion by staffs of authoritative agencies that indicate there is a reason to consider them active.
            Their inclusion is not intended to prohibit development, but to insure that proposed projects are
            supported by detailed geologic and seismic investigations that will provide the most accurate ob-
            tainable data on the presence or absence of a hazards and identify necessary mitigative meas-
            ures.”
      In general, the City of Malibu has adopted of Los Angeles County Seismic Safety Element Map as dis-
      cussed above and regards the Malibu Coast Fault Zone as active; however, it is recognized that indi-
      vidual splays within the fault zone may not necessarily be classified as active based upon site-specific
      geologic and seismic investigations.
Table 5-1 lists the large historic earthquakes recorded in Southern California. This list includes activity on
all faults in Southern California, any of which might, during a major event, precipitate activity in Malibu;
see, also, Figure S-4.
Liquefaction and Subsidence - Liquefaction is a process by which water-saturated sediment suddenly loses
strength, which commonly accompanies strong ground motions caused by earthquakes. During an extended
period of ground shaking or dynamic loading, porewater pressures increase and the ground is temporarily
altered from a solid to a liquid state. Liquefaction is most likely to occur in unconsolidated, sandy sediments
which are water-saturated within less than 30 feet of the ground surface (Tinsley et al., 1985).
Few areas of significant liquefaction susceptibility exist in the City of Malibu. These few areas are located
along the beaches and in the flood plains of the major streams, such as Malibu Creek. Liquefaction suscepti-
bility as used for this study is a qualitative measure of the fraction, or percent, of the area considered likely
to be underlain by deposits susceptible to liquefy if strong shaking occurs. The susceptibility value is deter-
mined as the product of three important factors:
1.    The probability of finding cohesionless sediment in the area considered;
2.    The probability that the cohesionless sediment, when saturated, would be susceptible to liquefaction;
3.    The probability that the cohesionless sediment would be saturated.
The detailed information to determine these factors is only available for Los Angeles, San Diego and San
Francisco. Because the USGS study of the Los Angeles region missed the Malibu area, susceptibility values
based upon the values obtained nearby, at Santa Monica and Oxnard, were extrapolated into the City of
Malibu.

Subsidence is the settling of the ground surface due to the compaction of underlying unconsolidated sedi-
ment. It is most common in uncompacted soils, thick unconsolidated alluvial material and improperly-
constructed artificial fill. Subsidence is typically associated with the rapid removal of large volumes of
groundwater or oil. It is also a secondary hazard associated with seismic activity, as groundshaking may
cause the settling of loose, unconsolidated grains. Due to the fault zones and the unconsolidated alluvial
sediments underlying much of the city and planning area, the potential for seismically-induced subsidence is
considered high. Some subsidence could also be expected if large volumes of groundwater are withdrawn
for developments in the area.
Landslides: Slope instability or landsliding is related to slope gradient, soil or rock type, and erosion sus-
ceptibility. Landsliding can also be seismically-induced, resulting from extended periods of groundshaking
and high ground accelerations (see Figure S-5). Improper grading, and excessive rainfall or irrigation can
also increase the probability of landsliding.
                                                                  242

The 1990 Los Angeles County Safety Element (LACSE) prepared a map that was a generalized inventory of
landslides that included:
                          • Block Glides • Slumps • Debris Flows • Rockfalls
The minimum size of an individual landslide shown on the Landslide Inventory Map was five acres. Review
of the Los Angeles County Landslide Inventory map indicates that the Malibu area, and the Santa Monica
Mountains area in general, constitute one of the three areas of Los Angeles County that display a high pro-
pensity for landsliding. Only the Santa Susana Mountains and the Castaic area appear to equal the degree of
landsliding displayed in the Malibu area; see, also, Figure S-6 and Figure S-7.
According to the 1992 review of landslides conducted by Philip Williams & Associates and Peter Warshall
& Associates there are approximately 250 mapped landslides in the area. The 15 largest landslide areas con-
tain 350 homes, not all of which are endangered, and are surrounded by at least 285 other homes which
could be affected by sliding in the future.
Of the major slides listed in the Williams and Warshall report, sizes range from about eight acres up to the
Big Rock Mesa landslide which is about 220 acres. Most of the large landslide areas involve housing units.
Many of these are threatened. Public utilities have been affected, particularly those underground. To address
the problem, underground piping has often been rerouted onto the ground surface with flexible connections.
The majority of slides in the study area are slump failures involving surficial deposits and weathered and
faulted bedrock formational material. Of the numerous slides mapped by Weber and Wills as active in 1983,
most were slump failures and 16 were reactivated during the winters of 1978-1980. The landslide limits have
been plotted on a 1000-scale Geohazards Maps of Malibu available for inspection at City Hall, and the better
known slides have been labeled with their commonly recognized name from the geologic literature and the
listing provided in the 1992 Wastewater Management Study.
Debris Flow: The many canyons that drain the Santa Monica Mountains and cross through Malibu to empty
into the ocean, provide avenues for future debris/mud flow events during wet winters and intense rain
storms. Debris flow events have been experienced in Topanga Canyon, Las Flores Canyon, and others, and
will occur again in the future. These phenomenon are potentially deadly to the public because many of the
mountain failures that contribute soils and debris to the canyon bottoms tends to occur during the early A.M.
hours following intense rainfall that is most likely during the night time. The public tends to be inside and
asleep, not expecting catastrophic hillside failures to affect them.
Past storm tracks that caused significant debris flows in the 1982-83 storms, indicates that intense, continu-
ous rainfall exceeding 0.25 inches per hour can, and does, occur in the Santa Monica Mountains.
The work of Russell H. Campbell (1975) for the Santa Monica Mountains indicates that when intense rain
storms follow after the rainy season has experienced 10 to 15 inches of rainfall (antecedent rainfall), slopes
steeper than 2:1 (26 degrees) up to steepness of 45 degrees, are prone to slippage and failure of the surficial
several feet of slope. When there are numerous failures that take place within a short span of time, and that
flow into main drainage courses, then there is the potential for downstream debris flow damage.
Debris flow potential from the Santa Monica Mountains has been greatly underestimated for its possible im-
pact on the City of Malibu.

SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
Mudflows have a potential for occurring wherever land development has constructed fill slopes that are
steeper than 2:1. If such slopes are above other occupied properties, there is a potential for failure of these
slopes during wet winters.
The generally recognized landslide areas in Malibu include (listed from east to west):
• Las Tunas Beach Slides                                      •  Big Rock Mesa

Soils: Soil types in the City of Malibu have been classified by the United States Department of Agriculture,
Soil Conservation Service (SCS). These SCS classifications are associated with identified soil capabilities
which may be used in planning for agricultural, urban, watershed, recreational and wilderness uses. SCS has
identified 22 soil series and 45 soil phases in the Malibu area (Malibu Soil Survey, 1967).*
*   Soil series are soils that are grouped together because they have a similar set of soil profile characteristics. The soil phase is a division of the soil
    series in which the soils are grouped together by common surface and substrata characteristics. Important characteristics used to determine soil
    phase are surface texture, slope and quantity of stones.
      Expansive Soils: Of the various geologic hazards that affect the State of California, expansive soils
      have caused millions of dollars in damages, particularly to single-family residences and private prop-
      erty improvements. The State Department of Natural Resources estimates that to the year 2000, expan-
      sive soils will be a 150 million dollar problem in the state.
      Each of the different geologic formations mapped in the Malibu area consists of various units which
      may possess expansive potential. Typically, these would be mudstones, claystones, siltstones, and clay
      fault gouge. Clay fault gouge is clay along the fault planes that slice through the rock. Silt and clay de-
      posits near and around the Malibu Creek lagoon would possess expansion potential. Geologic units
      mapped as colluvium or slopewash, would commonly be expansive in nature. The terrace deposits
      shown along the coast also generally contain expansive soils.
      Collapsible/Compressible Soils: Potential collapsible soils may exist in areas of Malibu where geo-
      logic units of alluvium or colluvium are present at the lower end of sloping terrain where it begins to
      flatten and become less steep, but particularly where debris flow deposits have been recognized (see
      Figure S-10). Russell H. Campbell (1980) mapped what he believes are old deposits from debris flows
      in the Point Dume-Zuma Beach area. Similar types of deposits are likely along Las Flores Canyon,
      Malibu Creek, Zuma Canyon, and Trancas Canyon. Compressible soils would be very likely in the
      Malibu Lagoon area, along Malibu Creek, Dume Canyon, and Trancas Canyon. Undetected, develop-
      ment on these type of soils may become distressed to collapse or consolidation of the foundation soils.
Coastal Hazards: Because of the age of the community (1920’s, 1930’s, to present), there are a wide range
of buildings and coastal protective devices present along the Malibu coast. It has generally been observed by
                                                                         244

local geologists and engineers that during the major storms, construction that is most severely impacted is
generally older construction.
In all situations, the potential exposure of a property is also a direct function of the setback of the structure
from the ocean, the beach, and the cliff or bluff. Adequately setback construction provides the best protec-
tion.
Older bluff top properties with reduced bluff top setbacks, become more exposed to the risks of bluff failure
and landsliding due to coastal erosion and earthquake ground shaking.
Some areas of the—Malibu coastal bluffs are retreating variably because of either the neglect, or special at-
tention, given to surface drainage control. Rapid coastal bluff, or sea cliff top, retreat can occur when surface
runoff is not controlled by collection and proper disposal. Damage to properties can be seen where concen-
trated surface runoff has generated surficial failures of the bluff, or where erosion has quickened the advance
of gullies and ravines that have been cut into the bluff face and bluff top.
There still continues to be widespread debate among coastal experts and engineers regarding the possible
adverse affect on beach widths relative to coastal protection. There is also wide disagreement about what
types of coastal protection are best suited to a backshore. Economics of the property owner, or entity respon-
sible for the protective device no doubt play a role in the type of coastal protection that is ultimately con-
structed.
Cooperative efforts to armour (protect) stretches of beach where protective devices may be hit, or miss,
seem to provide the most appropriate methods to protect all the properties involved. Apparently, attempts by
the County of Los Angeles in the past to coordinate homeowners has been largely unsuccessful.
There will be a continuing threat to beach structures from wood and floating debris that become battering
rams when introduced to the surf during storms and coastal erosion events. As the building of decks, patios,
housing, and other improvements become more sophisticated and permitted, the percentage of damages due
to floating debris should be reduced.
Tsunamis and Seiches: Tsunamis, seismic sea waves, can be expected rarely from distant sources, but may
be generated immediately offshore of Malibu by surface ground rupture of the faulting just offshore, or by
the occurrence of submarine landslides immediately offshore. Displacement of the sea floor could generate a
local wave and would include wave runup to elevations 12 feet above Mean Lower Low Water of the Pacific
Ocean in this area. The runup heights for the Malibu coast in general are between five and seven feet for the
100-year zone and between eight and 12 feet for the 500-year zone. The higher runups occur in the eastern
part of Malibu because of the amplification effects related to the Santa Monica Bay resonant oscillations.
(See also Figures S-11 to S-15 and the Safety Background Report for a more detailed discussion.)
Most of the coastal dwellings and low lying coastal areas can expect to be damaged some time in the future
by an earthquake generated tsunami. Damage due to flooding in the Malibu Civic Center area can be ex-
pected. The most vulnerable objects would be people on the beaches, houses or other buildings constructed
on or near the beach, and bridges over the streams near the beach, such as along the Pacific Coast Highway
at Malibu Creek and Corral Creek. People could be swept away by the waves and drowned; buildings and
bridges could be undermined and collapse or carried away by the currents; buildings and other structures
could be battered by debris carried by the currents.

SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
Seiche, resonant oscillations in semi-enclosed water bodies such as Santa Monica Bay, may be triggered by
moderate or larger local submarine earthquakes, and sometimes by large, more distant, regional earthquakes.
Seiching was recorded at Santa Monica following moderate (Mw = 5.0-5.2) earthquakes under Santa Monica
Bay in 1930, 1979, and 1989. The maximum height of these long period waves was about two feet. If such
oscillations occurred during storm, conditions or unusually high tides, damaging coastal inundation could
result. The duration of these oscillations may be several hours.
5.2.3    Climate
The City of Malibu is located within the South Coat Air Basin. The regional air flow is controlled mainly by
four synoptic large scale features, one of which occurs just prior to the winter rainy season and is commonly
referred to as Santa Ana wind; Santa Anas are hot, dry, desert winds usually of relatively high velocity and
are associated with low humidity. The extremely low humidity and high temperature produce an extreme
fire hazard during late summer and fall.
5.2.4    Crime
A crime report for the area is completed by the County Sheriff’s Department monthly and submitted to the
City Manager’s office. Since Malibu is primarily a residential community, the main enforcement problems
are burglary, traffic and tourist-related crimes. Areas of noticeable crime impact within the City are pocket
beaches along the coastline that are not patrolled regularly. With residential development occurring in the
canyon areas, the physical distance from the Sheriff’s stations makes it more difficult for patrols to respond
to calls in these northern reaches. Additionally, the increase of commercial activity and development along
Pacific Coast Highway, together with development in adjacent communities, has caused a concomitant in-
crease in traffic accidents along Pacific Coast Highway.

way.
Pacific Coast Highway is also the main connector road of Malibu to surrounding communities. Due to its
close proximity to fault lines and floodplains, Pacific Coast Highway must have adequate security for patrol-
ling and regulating the area in the event of a natural catastrophe.
5.2.5    Fire Hazards
The City of Malibu is served by the Los Angeles County Fire Department, as well as the California Depart-
ment of Forestry, if needed. According to the California Department of Forestry and the County Fire De-
partment, Malibu is considered to be an extreme fire hazard zone. There are seven County fire stations serv-
ing the City, including four stations located in the City. In the event of major fires, the County has “mutual
aid agreements” with cities and counties throughout the state so that additional personnel and fire fighting
equipment can augment the County Fire Department.
Wildland fires are inevitable and are a part of the natural regeneration cycle of the native California land-
scape. Structure losses are not necessarily directly due to wildland fires but instead result from: (a) inappro-
                                                       246

                                                                            SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
priate siting of structures; (b) flammable ornamental landscaping; (c) surrounding structures located too
close together; and (d) flammable accessory structures (such as fences, decks, arbors, etc.).
The majority of the City has experienced major brush fires in the past 10 to 30 years, the most recent fire
being the Old Topanga/Malibu Fire of November 2-5, 1993. This fire began along Old Topanga Road near
Calabasas and, fanned by strong Santa Ana winds, burned southerly into the City of Malibu. This fire re-
sulted in the destruction and damage of approximately 300 homes in the City, while it burned over 18,000
acres between Malibu, Topanga and Calabasas. The most significant loss to property due to the Old To-
panga/Malibu Fire was in the Las Flores, Ramblo Pacifica, Carbon Mesa and Big Rock areas of the City,
although the fire stretched from Topanga Canyon/Pacific Coast Highway on the east to the Pepperdine Uni-
versity campus on the west.
The Old Topanga/Malibu fire was very similar to the most recent fires that have struck Malibu — primarily
destroying property and burning hillside in central Malibu, between Carbon Canyon Road and Kanan Dume
Road, north of Pacific Coast Highway, and western Malibu, between Encinal Canyon Road and the City’s
western boundaries, north of Pacific Coast Highway. There have not been any fires in Point Dume in over
30 years.
Although these are the areas of the City where fires have most recently occurred in the past, it cannot be
concluded that these areas are at greater risk than others. No single area can be determined as being more
susceptible to fires than another due to the fact that the location of fires varies from year to year.
Native vegetation plays a significant role in wildland fires. Malibu is located in the Santa Monica Moun-
tains, bordering the Pacific Ocean and is subject to massive fire hazards due to highly flammable chaparral
vegetation covering thousands of acres in brushlands. Fires in these brushland areas are inevitable because
of the flammability of both living and non-living brush and the variable weather conditions that exist. Ap-
proximately three fourths of the mountains in the surrounding area have burned more than once in the past
50 years.
The lack of intense development reduces the occurrence of urban fires. Malibu primarily consists of low
density residential with a supportive commercial area.
The residential areas are affected by fire more than any other area in the City. Houses which are nestled
among the heavily vegetated canyons are surrounded by a great deal of underbrush making this area highly
vulnerable to fires. However, some preventive measures, required by County and/or City ordinances, have
been taken to offset the risk factors involved:
•     Elimination of wood shake roofs for new construction;
•     Establishment of minimum greenbelt systems along new subdivisions;
•     Improvement in existing water systems and vehicular access in a number of areas;
•     Improvements made in the “Incident Command System” used by the Los Angeles County Fire De-
      partment and in the emergency communications and coordination among various fire resource agen-
      cies;
•     Installation of smoke detectors in homes and sprinkler systems in commercial buildings; and
•     An aggressive brush clearance program that has been undertaken in the past few years.
                                                        247

SAFETY AND HEALTH ELEMENT
Construction plays a major role in fire prevention. Horizontal roofings are an important concern because
they catch and hold flying firebrands (pieces of burning wood). Firebrands can endanger structures as far as
a mile away.
During the autumn months Malibu is very dry and, therefore, highly susceptible to fires, even with fire re-
tardant materials. Most fires occur under Santa Ana conditions in September to March. Large picture win-
dows and sliding doors allow radiated heat into buildings. Overhangs and balconies are dangerous because
flames sweep against the underside of these projections of the building. While preventive construction
measures reduce these problems, nonetheless the fire risks in Malibu remain significant.
Although fire is a hazard to the Malibu area, it is also a necessary element in the Santa Monica Mountains
ecosystems. Classified as a chaparral habitat, many of the native evergreen plants require fire to open their
seeds, as well as to create new open areas for the young plants to become established. In order to minimize
the fire risk to homeowners, selective clearance of flammable vegetation is required around all structures.
However, removing all vegetation surrounding a residence could result in an erosion hazard leading to land-
slides and slope failures. By selectively thinning the more flammable vegetation and landscaping with fire
retardant plants, it is possible to minimize both fire danger and erosion problems.
Statewide, approximately 90% of all fires are caused by human activity with the remaining 10% resulting
from natural activity (primarily lightning). However, in the Malibu/Santa Monica Mountains areas, about
99% of all fires result from human activity, particularly arson, with one percent caused by natural activity.
The increased tourist population to the area in the warm summer months increases the potential for fire in
the area.

NOISE ELEMENT
                                              6.1      Introduction
6.1.1    Legislative Authorization
The State of California has mandated that each county and city prepare a noise element as part of its general
plan. Section 65302(f) of the California Government Code requires that the element shall:
      identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The noise element shall recognize the guide-
      lines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall
      analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and pro-
      jected noise levels for all of the following sources:
      •     Highways and freeways;
      •     Primary arterials and major local streets;
      •     Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems;
      •     Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operations, aircraft over-
            flights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to
            airport operation;
      •     Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards; and
      •     Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the commu-
            nity noise environment.
6.1.2    Purpose and Scope
The purpose of the Noise Element is to provide guidance for comprehensive local programs to control and
abate excessive noise and to protect residents from adverse noise impacts. The element provides information
on the existing and projected noise environment and includes, goals, objectives, policies and implementation
programs to ensure an acceptable noise environment. The element also identifies criteria to be used by deci-
sion makers in evaluating the noise implications of proposed projects.
The typical community noise environment is comprised of a background noise level and higher noise levels,
frequently transportation oriented. Because the background noise level is lower at night, the problems posed
by higher noise levels are more pronounced at night.
The predominant noise source in Malibu is vehicular traffic from Pacific Coast Highway, the major canyon
roads, and the local arterials. Stationary sources within the City include a wide range of recreational, com-
mercial, and business activities.
6.1.3    Related Information and Terminology
Noise is most often defined as unwanted sound. Sound levels can easily be measured, but the variability in
subjective and physical response to sound requires a more detailed analysis to determine the impact on peo-
ple. People judge the relative magnitude of sound sensation in subjective terms such as “loudness” or “noisi-
ness.” Physically, sound pressure magnitude is measured and quantified on a scale which indicates the sound
level in units of decibels (dB). All sound pressure levels discussed in this study are referenced to the stan-
dard reference pressure of 20 microPascals.
                                                         286

                                                                                           NOISE ELEMENT
The human hearing system is not equally sensitive to sound at all frequencies. Because of this variability, a
frequency-dependent adjustment called an A-weighting has been devised so that sound may be measured in
a manner similar to the way the human hearing system responds. The use of the A-weighted sound level is
often indicated by using the abbreviation “dBA” for expressing the sound level. An increase in the sound
level by 10 dBA is judged by most people to be approximately twice as loud as the former, whereas most
people are unable to detect a change in less than 3 dBA. To acquaint the reader with sound levels produced
by common noise sources, measured sound levels for various sources are provided in Figure N-1.
It is desirable to describe a noise environment with a single number representing an hour or even a whole
day so that easy reference and comparison can be made. Common methods which are widely used in the
United States and abroad consider the average noise level and the maximum level recorded over a period of
time, referred to as the Equivalent Level (Leq), the Minimum Level (Lmin), and Maximum Level (Lmax), re-
spectively. Leq is a single-number noise descriptor that represents the average sound level in an environment
where the actual noise level varies with time, Lmin and Lmax are the lowest and highest noise level that oc-
curred during that time.
In a typical outdoor environment, the noise level varies during the day according to various activities in the
community. Noise that may be acceptable during the day may be unwanted sound at night; e.g., automobile
traffic on a nearby street, aircraft overflight, or dog barking. Thus, additional units of measurements have
been developed to evaluate the longer term characteristics of sound. The Community Noise Equivalent
Level (CNEL) and the day-night level (Ldn), along with Leq, are the measurements commonly used in Cali-
fornia.
CNEL is a single-number noise descriptor. However, CNEL represents the average noise level over a 24-
hour period and is appropriate in assessing long-term roadway noise impacts. CNEL is similar to a 24-hour
Leq, but with a 10 dBA penalty added to nighttime (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) sound levels and a 5 dBA penalty
added to evening sound levels (7 p.m. to 10 a.m.) before the 24-hour average is computed. These penalties
are applied to account for the increased annoyance that is generally felt by a person of normal sensitivity
during the evening relaxation and nighttime sleep hours.
CNEL is the noise metric currently specified in the State Aeronautics Code for evaluation of the noise im-
pact of airplanes. Additionally, CNEL is specified by the State Noise Insulation Standards for new multiple
family dwellings. Local compliance with these standards requires that community noise be specified in
terms of CNEL.
Intermittent or occasional noise, such as that associated with a stationary noise source sometimes is not loud
enough to exceed the CNEL or Leq community noise standards. To account for such intermittent noise,
acoustical engineers characterize noise in terms of percent noise level (L percent). The percent noise level is
the level exceeded “x” percent of the time during the measurement period. For example, in an area where
noise levels exceed 65 dB 90% of the time, L90 is 65 dB.

6.2.1     Noise and Land Use Compatibility Guidelines
Noise has the potential to affect human health in various ways. Community decision makers may use avail-
able community noise information, therefore, to ensure that a minimum number of people are exposed to
potentially harmful noise sources. To aid decision makers, several federal and state agencies have estab-
lished noise/land use compatibility guidelines. These guidelines are all based upon cumulative noise criteria,
such as Leq, CNEL, or Ldn. These land uses and compatibility guidelines are illustrated in Figure N-2.
6.2.2     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
In March 1984, the EPA published a document which for the past nine years has served as the primary
source of information about noise and its effects on land use and people. The document entitled Information
of Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare With an Adequate Margin
of Safety (EPA 550/9-74-004), contains a table which identifies indoor thresholds requisite for protecting
human health in both indoor and outdoor environments.
According to this publication, 55 Ldn is described as the threshold level with an adequate margin of safety
for areas for outdoor activities associated with residential development and recreational activities. The
document and the thresholds are not considered standards, specifications, or regulations.
6.2.3     Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
The FHWA has adopted and published noise abatement criteria for highway construction projects. The
FHWA abatement criteria establishes an exterior noise goal for residential land uses of 67 Leq. The interior
goal for residences is 52 Leq. The criteria apply to private yard areas and assume that typical wood frame
houses with open windows provide a 10 dB noise reduction and a 20 dB noise reduction with the windows
closed.
6.2.4     State of California
The State of California has adopted noise standards in areas of regulation not preempted by the federal gov-
ernment*. State standards regulate noise levels of motor vehicles, freeway noise affecting classrooms, sound
transmissions, occupational noise control, and airport noise. The purpose of the standards is to establish
minimum noise insulation performance standards to protect persons within new hotel, motels, apartment
houses, and dwellings other than detached single-family dwellings. The standards specify that interior noise
levels, with windows closed, attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed an annual noise level of 45 dB
CNEL in any habitable room. In addition, residential buildings or structures within a 60 dB CNEL exterior
noise environment due to airport, vehicular, or industrial noise sources are required to have an acoustical
analysis prepared indicating that the proposed building has been designed to limit intruding noise to the al-
lowable 45 dB CNEL interior noise level.
In 1976, the Department of Health, State Office of Noise Control published a recommended noise/land use
compatibility matrix which many jurisdictions have adopted as a standard in their general plan noise ele-
ments. This matrix indicates that residential land uses and other noise sensitive receptors generally should
locate in areas where outdoor ambient noise levels do not exceed 65 to 70 dBA (CNEL or Ldn).
*   The California Sound Transmission Control Standards are found in California Administrative Code, Title 25, Building Standards, Chapter 2.5,
    as adopted March 1, 1986.

                                   6.3    Existing Noise Environment
6.3.1    In General
The City includes a wide variety of land use and development types that are noise sensitive. Noise sensitive
land uses include, single and multiple family residences, schools, libraries, medical facilities, retirement/rest
homes, and places of religious worship. The predominant land uses in the City are noise sensitive residential
uses.
The existing measurable noise environment was documented through both a community noise survey and
computer generated noise contours. The noise survey identified existing noise levels generated by various
sources at specific locations within the City while the computer analysis predicted existing and future road-
way noise levels.
6.3.2    Community Noise Survey
A community noise survey was conducted on July 16, 1992 to document the existing noise environment
within the City of Malibu. Noise measurements were conducted at 10 sites between 9:28 a.m. and 3:03 p.m.
The locations were representative of residential, commercial and public use areas. Noise measurement sur-
vey data forms for each location are provided in Appendix A of the Background Report to this Element. The
approximate locations of the noise measurements are illustrated in Figure N-3 and the results are presented
in Table 6-1. Each site was measured for 15 minutes. The quantities measured are in Leg, Lmin, and Lmax. The
noise measurement results summarized in Table 6-1 should be used as a guide or indication of noise levels
throughout the community.
The land uses in the locations surveyed included predominantly noise sensitive land uses such as residential
neighborhoods. Commercial uses also exist at three of the measurement sites and one location contains only
commercial uses. Public open space such as the Malibu Bluffs Park were also surveyed for noise levels. The
noise sources in most of the locations surveyed included vehicular traffic, street maintenance, animals, heli-
copter and other aircraft; and lawn equipment. The noise survey recorded Leg noise levels throughout the
City of 74 dBA and below. Most of the noise levels in these areas are compatible with the land uses, there
are however, a few areas identified on Table 6-1 in which the noise levels exceed the normally acceptable
levels for the existing land uses.

6.3.3     Roadway Traffic Noise
The dominant noise source in Malibu is roadway traffic from Pacific Coast Highway which runs east/west
throughout the City. Additional roadway traffic noise arises from some of the canyon roads including,
Malibu Canyon Road and Kanan Dume Road which run north/south.
6.3.4     Noise Contours
The noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure, just as the lines on a weather map indicate equal
temperature or atmospheric pressure. The contours provide a visualization of estimates of sound level. Land
forms and man-made structures have very complex effects on sound transmission and on noise contours.
Generally, barriers between a source and receiver absorb or reflect noise resulting in a quieter environment.
Where barriers or land forms do not interrupt the noise transmission path from source to receiver, the con-
tours prove to be good estimates of the average noise level. In areas where barriers or land forms interrupt
the sound transmission, the noise contours overestimate the extent to which a source intrudes into the com-
munity. The noise contour distances describe worst-case conditions because they do not account for any ob-
structions to the noise path, such as walls, berms, or buildings. There were 16 roadway segments that were
analyzed; Table 6-2 provides the results of the analysis along Pacific Coast Highway during the summer
months which are the peak traffic months.
A graphic display of the 55, 60, 65, 70 and 75 dB CNEL noise contours for the existing major roadway noise
sources is provided in Figures 6-4(A-D) and 6-5(A-D). Figure 6-4(A-D) presents an overall picture and sev-
eral detailed maps of the contours for annual roadway noise. Figure 6-5(A-D) presents an overall picture and
several detailed maps of the contours for the summer months/peak season roadway noise along Pacific Coast
Highway. The noise contours represent unmitigated conditions. Therefore, on roadways where walls, berms
or structures block the noise path, the contours overestimate the noise impact.
It is not possible for a general plan noise element to analyze each roadway segment of the City for barrier
noise attenuation. Therefore, where specific projects are proposed within noise impacted areas, an acoustical

6.3.5     Interpretation of Roadway Noise Contours
Figures N-4 and N-5 display the 75, 70, 65, 60 and 55 dB CNEL noise contours that were generated using
the FHWA noise model for existing roadway noise sources in the City of Malibu. The contours portray areas
of equal noise level within an equivalent distance from the roadway centerline.
The eastern segment of Pacific Coast Highway which runs from the eastern City limits to Serra Road, is
characterized by the highest noise levels. This area generates a 75 dB CNEL contour which extends 55 feet
from the roadway centerline, a 70 dB CNEL contour which extends approximately 140 feet from the road-
way centerline, and a 65 dB CNEL contour which extends approximately 400 feet from the roadway center-
line. The average half-width of Pacific Coast Highway is 25 feet. Therefore, the 75 dB CNEL extends 30
                                                         291

feet beyond the outer boundary of the roadway. A significant number of the residential dwelling units are
located along Pacific Coast Highway with no setbacks. Many of these homes are exposed to noise levels as
high as 75 dB CNEL depending on the type of landscaping or other noise-attenuating barriers located at each
structure. The 65 db CNEL extends as far as the Pacific Ocean, encompassing all of the beach side residen-
tial units along this segment of Pacific Coast Highway. Noise levels of 65, 70 and 75 dB CNEL are consid-
ered incompatible with single-family residential dwelling units.
Along Pacific Coast Highway east of the Civic Center area, Serra Road to Cross Creek Road, noise contours
of up to 75 dB CNEL are generated approximately 52 feet from the roadway centerline. Undeveloped/open
space areas dominate the land adjacent to the street along this segment of Pacific Coast Highway. Noise lev-
els of 75 dB are acceptable with this type of land use. There are noise contours of 70 dB CNEL generated
approximately 87 feet from the roadway centerline along the segment of Pacific Coast Highway running
through the Civic Center area, Cross Creek Road to Civic Center Road. The land uses along this segment of
Pacific Coast Highway are primarily commercial. Noise levels of 70 dB CNEL and lower are compatible
with commercial uses. However, most uses such as the Hughes Market are set back from the roadway and/or
have large parking lots adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway and therefore the actual use is exposed to even
lower noise levels.
The segment of Pacific Coast Highway which runs from Civic Center Way to Ramirez Canyon Road gener-
ates noise contours of 70 dB CNEL approximately 74 feet from the roadway centerline. Much of the land
along this segment of the road is undeveloped/open space, however there is some commercial and a signifi-
cant amount of residential land uses along there as well. The undeveloped/open space areas and commercial
land uses are compatible with noise levels of 70 dB CNEL and below and are therefore not incompatible
with the noise levels. The 65 dB CNEL contour extends 143 feet from the roadway centerline. Therefore
residents along Pacific Coast Highway are exposed to noise levels of 65 dB CNEL and to some extent 70 dB
CNEL which is incompatible with the state guidelines. Along Cross Creek Road, the noise levels are lower,
with the 65 dB CNEL contour extending approximately 51 feet from the roadway centerline. The primary
land use along Cross Creek Road is commercial and therefore the noise levels are compatible with the land
uses.
Noise contours of up to 65 db CNEL are generated along Malibu Canyon Road between Pacific Coast
Highway and Civic Center Way and extend approximately 51 feet from the roadway centerline. The area to
the east of the roadway is undeveloped/open space and the area to the west is not within the City limits.
North of Civic Center Way, contours of up to 65 dB CNEL extend approximately 82 feet from the roadway
centerline. The land uses along this segment of Malibu Canyon Road include the Hughes Aircraft Research
Facility, religious facilities and residential uses. Most of the structures are set back from the roadway and are
not exposed to this noise level. Noise levels of 60 dB CNEL and below are compatible with all land uses.
There are similar noise contours generated along Pacific Coast Highway running west of Ramirez Canyon
Road to Morning View Drive. The noise levels of up to 70 dB CNEL are compatible with the commercial
uses in the area, however these noise levels are incompatible with both the multifamily and single-family
residential land uses located in the area. The 70 dB CNEL contours extend approximately 70 feet from the
roadway centerline and many of the residential uses may be set back farther than 45 feet from the edge of
the roadway and would not be exposed to these noise levels. Noise contours of 65 dB CNEL extend ap-
proximately 133 feet from the roadway centerline. Multifamily residential uses are compatible with this

noise level but 65 dB CNEL noise levels are incompatible with the existing single-family residential land
uses.
Along Kanan Dume Drive north of Pacific Coast Highway the highest noise contours are 60 dB CNEL
which extend approximately 63 feet from the roadway centerline. This noise level is compatible with all land
uses.
The segment of Pacific Coast Highway that runs from Morning View Drive to the western City limits is
dominated by undeveloped/open space areas, single-family residential uses, and a limited number of com-
mercial uses. The 70 dB CNEL noise contours extend approximately 56 feet from the roadway centerline or
approximately 30 feet from the edge of the roadway. The undeveloped/open spaces areas and commercial
uses are not incompatible with this noise level. Many of the single-family residential land uses are set back
farther than 30 feet from the edge of the roadway and are not exposed to this noise level. The 65 dB CNEL
noise contour extends approximately 100 feet from the roadway centerline, or 75 feet from the edge of the
roadway. Many of the single-family residential units may have setbacks of greater than 75 feet or have land-
scaping or some other form of sound barrier and therefore may not be within the 65 dB CNEL contour. The
single-family land uses that are within 65 dB CNEL are exposed to noise levels incompatible with the land
uses.
Figure N-5 represents noise contours generated by vehicular traffic along Pacific Coast Highway during the
peak traffic months, typically June through September. The noise contours generated by peak vehicular traf-
fic extend slightly farther than the noise contours generated during the non-peak months. There are few dif-
ferences in the distances of the contours, the higher contours extend approximately two to three feet (75 dB
CNEL) farther, three to 11 feet longer (70 dB CNEL), and nine to 30 feet longer (65 dB CNEL) during the
peak season. The same land uses which are affected by high noise levels during the off-peak season are af-
fected during the peak season, with no additional uses affected. The exception occurs on the segment of Pa-
cific Coast Highway which runs from Cross Creek Road to Civic Center Way. The 75 dB CNEL contour
extends approximately 52 feet from the roadway centerline during the peak season and there is no 75 dB
CNEL contour during the off-peak season. The commercial uses along this segment of the road are set back
from the highway and would not be exposed to the higher noise levels.
The noise measurements described above indicate that noise levels in the majority of the areas surveyed in
the City are compatible with the surrounding land uses according to State guidelines. The noise contours in
Malibu indicate that the eastern portion of the City experiences greater noise levels than the western portion
and that, according to State guidelines, homes not located along Pacific Coast Highway are generally not
exposed to unacceptable levels of noise. However, comments made during all phases of the citizen participa-
tion process indicate that City residents have found the level of noise, particularly during peak visitor days,
to be unacceptable.

N Implementation Measure 4: Require acoustical studies for major commercial development projects, and
impose noise mitigation measures accordingly.
N Implementation Measure 5: Restrict the hours and days of construction, grading, and filming to reduce
noise from this source.
N Implementation Measure 6: Require an acoustical analysis as part of proposed development to ensure
that noise mitigation is included in the project where activities associated with proposed uses are likely to
produce noise levels exceeding the adopted City noise level standards, at existing or planned noise-sensitive
uses, including but not limited to, residences, schools, hospitals, long term in-patient medical treatment and
care facilities, churches and libraries,
N Implementation Measure 7: Use site planning and project design as noise mitigations to achieve the
specified standards for transportation or non-transportation sources.
N Implementation Measure 8: Use open space, wherever practical, to provide an adequate spatial separator
between noise sources and sensitive land uses. Use noise barriers as a supplemental means of achieving the

noise standards after all feasible design related noise mitigation measures have been integrated into the pro-
ject.
N Implementation Measure 9: Encourage Caltrans to fund only those re-pavement projects that utilize
low-noise paving materials to minimize traffic noise.
N Implementation Measure 10: Incorporate the consideration of noise impacts on significant wildlife habi-
tats into the development review process.

7.1.0     Overview
State law requires the preparation of a Housing Element (“Element”) as part of a jurisdiction’s General Plan
(California Government Code § 65302(c)). The Element is to consist of an identification and analysis of ex-
isting and projected housing needs, and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives and scheduled
programs for the preservation, improvement and development of housing in the City of Malibu (“City”). The
Element shall also identify adequate sites for housing and to make adequate provision for the existing and
projected needs of all economic segments of the community (§ 65583).
Guidelines adopted by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (“HCD”) are
also to be considered in the preparation of the Element (§ 65585). Periodic review of the Element is required
to evaluate: (1) the appropriateness of its goals, objectives and policies in contributing to the attainment of
the state housing goal; (2) the effectiveness in attaining the community’s housing goals and objectives; and
(3) the progress of the City in implementation of the Element (§ 65588). (Resolution Nos. 14-04, 1/13/14;
13-34, 8/26/13)
7.1.1     Purpose of the Housing Element
State law recognizes the vital role that local governments play in the supply and affordability of housing.
Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive, long-term General Plan for the
physical development of the city or county. The Housing Element is one of the seven mandated elements of
the General Plan. Housing Element law, first enacted in 1969, mandates that local governments plan to meet
the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The law recognizes
that, in order for the private market to adequately address housing needs, local governments must adopt land
use plans and regulatory systems that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing devel-
opment. As a result, housing policy in California rests largely upon the effective implementation of local
General Plans and, in particular, local Housing Elements. Housing Element law also requires that HCD re-
view local housing elements for compliance with state law and to report its written findings to the local gov-
ernment.
As mandated by state law, the planning period for this Housing Element extends from 2013 to 2021*. This
Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on: 1) providing diversity in housing opportunities;
and 2) maintenance and preservation of the City’s housing stock.
*   The planning time frame for the Regional Housing Needs Assessment process is from January 2014 through October 2021.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
•      An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends (Chapter 7.2);
•      An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to address the City’s housing
       goals (Chapter 7.3);

7.1.2      Public Participation
Section 65583(c)(5) of the California Government Code states that “[t]he local government shall make a
diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development
of the housing element, and the program shall describe this effort.” Public participation played an important
role in the formulation and refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies, and in the development of a
Land Use Plan that determines the extent and density of future residential development in the community.
Residents and other stakeholders had many opportunities to review and provide comments on the Housing
Element and related implementation actions. Please refer to Appendix C for additional information regard-
ing the City’s efforts to encourage public involvement and how comments and concerns have been ad-
dressed. (Resolution Nos. 14-04, 1/13/14; 13-34, 8/26/13)
7.1.3      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
The City’s General Plan sets forth broad policy guidance in the areas of land use, housing, transportation,
conservation, open space and recreation, noise, and public safety. The various General Plan elements pro-
vide a consistent set of policies and programs intended to preserve and enhance the quality of life, while ac-
commodating growth and change in a proactive manner. For example, residential development capacities
established in the Land Use Element, and constraints to development identified in the Conservation, Public
Safety, and Noise Elements, are reflected in the Housing Element. This Housing Element builds upon the
other General Plan elements and is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the General Plan.
As the General Plan is occasionally amended, the City will review the Housing Element for internal consis-
tency, and make any necessary revisions.
Senate Bill (SB) 1087 of 2005* requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Element to local water and
sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority to affordable housing developers. SB
1087 further prohibits local water and sewer providers from denying services to affordable housing develop-
ers, unless they find that the capacity is unavailable to all applicants. The Housing Element will be provided
to these agencies immediately upon adoption.

7.2.0     Overview
The City of Malibu (“City”) lies within an approximately 21-mile strip of coastline at the western edge of
Los Angeles County (“County”). Malibu is primarily a residential community consisting of beachfront resi-
dential lots and large estate lots in the hillsides and canyons overlooking the ocean. Some multi-family de-
velopment and neighborhood/visitor-serving commercial development is located in the flatter portions of the
City along Highway 1 (Pacific Coast Highway). The City has a highly scenic rural character that it seeks to
preserve. Development within the City is constrained by numerous land features including steep slopes, en-
vironmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHA), geologic instability, flood hazards, and extreme wildfire haz-
ards. The entire City lies within the Coastal Zone as defined by the California Coastal Act of 1976.* Be-
cause of these constraints, a large portion of the City remains undeveloped and rural in character. Growth is
also limited by the lack of a centralized sewer system.
*   California Public Resources Code, Division 20.
Since its incorporation in 1991, the City has grown from a population of approximately 11,700 to 12,699
residents in 2012, according to recent Census data. The City is approximately 19.9 square miles in area and
is bounded by unincorporated County to the west and north, the City of Los Angeles (Pacific Palisades) to
the east and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Further to the east is the City of Santa Monica. The Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area lies just to the north. The City’s population is affluent with a
median household income, according to recent Census data, of $132,926. Malibu’s median household in-
come was significantly higher than that of Los Angeles County ($56,266) and California as a whole
($61,632).
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends, such as age, race and
ethnicity, employment, household composition and size, household income, and special needs. Characteris-
tics of the existing housing stock (e.g., number of units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also
addressed. Finally, the City’s projected housing growth needs based on the 2014-2021 Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA) are discussed.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the U.S. Census, the California Depart-
ment of Finance (DOF), the California Employment Development Department (EDD), the Southern Califor-
nia Association of Governments (SCAG), and other relevant sources. Supplemental data were obtained
through field surveys and from private vendors, where appropriate. (Resolution Nos. 14-04, 1/13/14; 13-34,
8/26/13)
7.2.1     Population Characteristics
(a)   Population Growth Trends
In 1990, the unincorporated community of Malibu had a population of 11,643. The City of Malibu was in-
corporated on March 28, 1991. From 1990 to 2000, the population of the newly incorporated City grew by
about 8% to 12,575. During the decade 2000 to 2012 the City’s population grew by only 124 persons, or one
percent compared to almost four percent for Los Angeles County as a whole (see Table 7-1).

(b) Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age groups require dif-
ferent accommodations based on lifestyle, family type, income level, and housing preference. Table 7-2 pro-
vides a comparison of the City’s and County’s population by age group in 2010. This table shows that the
age distribution of the City’s population differs from Los Angeles County as a whole, in that a lower propor-
tion of the City’s population is 19 years of age or younger (20% in the City versus 28% in the County) and a
higher proportion of the City’s population is 45 years of age and above (55% in the City versus 36% in the
County). The median age of the City’s population is 13 years older than the median age in the County (47.8
years in the City versus 34.8 years in the County).

(c)    Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the City differs from that in the County, in that a lower proportion of
City residents are Hispanic/Latino or other racial minorities. Approximately 87% of City’s residents are non-
Hispanic white, contrasted with 28% for the County as a whole. The percentage of Hispanics residing in the
City, at 6.1%, is approximately one-eighth that of the percentage of Hispanics residing in the County.
Asians, at 2.6%, represent the largest non-Hispanic minority group in the City (Table 7-3).

7.2.2     Household Characteristics
(a)    Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a city. The Cen-
sus defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing unit, which may include single persons living
alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in
group quarters such as dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table 7-4 provides a comparison of households by type for the City and County as a whole, according to
recent Census data. Family households comprised approximately 61% of all households in the City, some-
what lower than the County with 68%. Household composition in the City differs from that of the County
with the most significant difference being non-family households with individuals under 18 years of age
(City 26% versus County 38%). Other less significant differences include non-family households headed by
individuals 65 and older (City 32% versus County 24%) and family households headed by a female with no
husband present (8% City versus 15% County). The City’s average household size of 2.37 is somewhat
lower than the County as a whole (2.98).

(b) Housing Tenure and Vacancy
Housing tenure (owner versus renter) is an important indicator of the housing market. Communities need an
adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in order to accommodate a range of households
with varying income, family size and composition, and lifestyle. Table 7-5 provides a comparison of the
number of owner-occupied and renter-occupied units in the City in 2010 as compared to the County as a
whole. It reveals that the level of homeownership for the City (54.1%) is higher than for the County
(44.8%).
This table also shows that the vacancy rate in the City is very high (23%) due to the large number of second
homes.

(c)    Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The U.S. Census Bureau
considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than one person per room, excluding bath-
rooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room. Table 7-6
summarizes overcrowding for the City of Malibu.

According to recent Census data, overall overcrowding in the City was substantially lower than in the
County as a whole (1.4% occupied units in the City versus 23.6% occupied units in the County). In the City,
overcrowding was more prevalent among renter-occupied units than for owner-occupied units. Approxi-
mately 1% of the City’s renter-occupied households were overcrowded, compared to only 0.4% of owner-
occupied households. The relatively high cost of housing in Malibu is the primary cause of overcrowding.
Several programs in the Housing Plan (Chapter V) that are designed to address housing affordability will
also help to alleviate overcrowding. These programs include: Program 1.1 - Code Enforcement; Program 1.3
- Housing Rehabilitation Assistance; Program 1.4 - Preserve Existing Mobile Home Parks; Program 1.5 -
Conserve Affordable Housing in the Coastal Zone; Program 2.2 - Ensure Adequate Capacity to Accommo-
date Housing Needs; Program 2.3 - Encourage Mixed-Use and Adaptive Reuse Development in Appropriate
Locations; Program 2.2A - Second Units; Program 2.3 - Streamline Development Review and Assist Af-
fordable Housing Developments; and Program 3.3 - Provide Financial Support and Referral Information to
Persons in Need of Assistance.
(d) Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community. According to recent Census
data, the median household income in the City was $132,926, approximately 226% higher than the County
median income of $56,266 (Table 7-7).

(e)     Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of gross household
income. According to SCAG, 46% of all renter households and 42% of all owner households in the City
were overpaying for housing.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits that help to compensate
for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to defer maintenance or repairs due to limited
funds, which can lead to deterioration. For lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to
double up resulting in overcrowding.
The relatively high cost of housing in Malibu is the primary cause of overpayment for lower-income house-
holds. Several programs in the Housing Plan designed to address housing affordability will also help to alle-
viate overpayment. These programs include Program 1.1 - Code Enforcement; Program 1.3 - Rehabilitation
Assistance; Program 1.4 - Preserve Existing Mobile Home Parks; Program 1.5 - Conserve Affordable Hous-
ing in the Coastal Zone; Program 2.2 - Ensure Adequate Capacity to Accommodate Housing Needs; Pro-
gram 2.2A - Second Units; Program 2.3 - Streamline Development Review and Assist Affordable Housing
Development; and Program 3.3 - Provide Financial Support and Referral Information to Persons in Need of
Assistance.
Extremely Low Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of extremely-low-
income (ELI) households. ELI is defined as households with income less than 30% of area median income.
The 2013 area median income for the County was $64,800 (see Table 7-14). For ELI households, this results
in an income of $25,600 or less for a four-person household. Households with extremely low incomes have a
variety of housing problems and needs.
Existing Needs
According to ACS data reported by SCAG, approximately 342 ELI households resided in the City, repre-
senting 6.3% of the total households.
Projected Needs
The projected housing need for ELI households is assumed to be 50% of the very-low-income regional
housing need of 1 unit. As a result, the City has a projected need for 1 ELI unit. The resources and programs
to address this need are the same as for low-income housing in general and are discussed throughout the
Housing Element, including the Housing Plan. Because the needs of ELI households overlap extensively
with other special needs groups, further analysis and resources for ELI households can be found in Section

7.2.3     Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs available in each
employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and size of housing residents can afford.
(a)    Current Employment
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing needs during this
planning period. Table 7-8 shows that the City had a workforce of 6,173 persons, or 58% of the working-age
population, according to recent Census data. The table shows that the characteristics of the City’s working
population are generally similar to those countywide with a slightly lower proportion of the working-age
population in the labor force (58% City versus 65.2% County). Approximately 42% of City residents were
not in the labor force.

According to recent Census data, approximately 61.7% of the City’s working residents were employed in
management and professional occupations (Table 7-9). A significant percentage of workers (22.6%) were
employed in sales and office-related occupations. A relatively low percentage of workers (11.1%) were em-
ployed in service-related occupations such as waiters, waitresses, and beauticians. Blue collar occupations
such as machine operators, assemblers, farming, transportation, handlers, and laborers constituted 4.6% of
the workforce.

HOUSING ELEMENT
In a high-cost area like Malibu second units provide an important option for low-wage workers, including
household employees. Program 2.2 in the Housing Plan describes the City’s strategy for expanding the
availability of second units.
(b) Projected Job Growth
Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during this planning period.
Table 7-10 shows projected job growth by industry for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale Metropolitan
Statistical Area (Los Angeles County) for the period 2010-2020. Total employment in Los Angeles County
is expected to grow by 15.5% during this time period. The overall growth is expected to add about 658,000
new jobs and bring the employment of Los Angeles County to about 4.9 million by 2020.
Generally, residents who are employed in well-paying occupations have less difficulty obtaining adequate
housing than residents in low-paying occupations.

Notes
1. Self-Employed persons work for profit or fees in their own business, profession, trade, or farm. Only the unincorporated self-employed are
    included in this category. The estimated and projected employment numbers include all workers who are primarily self-employed and wage and
    salary workers who hold a secondary job as a self-employed worker.
2. Unpaid family workers are those persons who work without pay for 15 or more hours per week on a farm or in a business operated by a member
    of the household to whom they are related by birth or marriage.
3. Private household workers are employed as domestic workers whose primary activities are to maintain the household. Industry employment is
    based on QCEW.
4. Temporary U.S. Census workers are included in the base and projected year employment numbers.
(c)    Jobs-Housing Balance
A regional balance of jobs to housing helps to ensure that the demand for housing is reasonably related to
supply. When the number of jobs significantly exceeds the housing supply, the rental and for-sale housing
markets may become overheated, requiring households to pay a larger percentage of their income for hous-
ing. In addition, a tight housing market can result in overcrowding and longer commute times as workers
seek more affordable housing in outlying areas. The current jobs-housing objective within the SCAG region
is one new housing unit for every 1.5 jobs.*

According to recent Census data, 96% of employed City residents worked in Los Angeles County, and ap-
proximately 40.4% of all workers were employed within the City limits (Table 7-11).

7.2.4      Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing stock and helps in
identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the number and type of housing units, re-
cent growth trends, age and condition, tenure, vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable
units at-risk of loss due to conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile
home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as sepa-
rate living quarters.
(a)    Housing Type and Growth Trends
According to recent Census data, the housing stock in the City was comprised mostly of single-family de-
tached homes, which made up about 78% of all units, while multi-family units comprised about 15% of the
total. Mobile home units comprised about 8% of the total. Table 7-12 provides a breakdown of the housing
stock by type along with growth trends for the City compared to the County as a whole for the period from
2000 to 2012.
                                                                     327                                    (Malibu General Plan Supp. No. 4, 12-14)

HOUSING ELEMENT
Second units provide an important source of housing for lower-income persons in Malibu. A discussion of
second unit production and affordability is presented in Appendix B. Program 2.2 in the Housing Plan de-
scribes the City’s strategy for expanding the availability of second units.

Between 2000 and 2012, only single-family detached homes were added to the City’s housing stock (second
units are not reported in these data). The number of multi-family units and mobile homes in the City were
reduced during that same period by 29.9% and 9.3%, respectively. Approximately 61.6% of new residential
units in the County as a whole were single family units and 35.7% were multi-family units.
(b) Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior to 1978, before
stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have interior or exterior building compo-
nents coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation
and to have deteriorated lead-based paint. Table 7-13 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in the
City compared to the County as a whole.
This table shows that about 44% of the units in the City were constructed prior to 1970. The fact that a sig-
nificant percentage of the City’s housing stock is more than 30 years old suggests that there may be some
need for rehabilitation, which is typical of most jurisdictions in Southern California.

In general, the quality of housing is exceptional in the City. At a minimum, most dwelling units are well-
maintained, especially with respect to the harsh environmental conditions that they are subject to. There are
areas where older housing units exist, such as along Pacific Coast Highway in the eastern portion of the
City. However, even these units are maintained given their economic value. It is estimated that about 2% of
the housing units within the City are in need of minor repair, and two are in need of major structural repair
or replacement due to landslides.
A goal of the City’s Building & Safety Division as well as Code Enforcement staff is to address housing
concerns before they become serious problems. Staff has helped to reduce structural deterioration by identi-
fying problems and informing residents of programs to assist with improvements. In addition, the City ad-
dresses issues related to lead-based paint and asbestos removal through adding standard conditions of ap-
proval to include Best Management Practices for all projects that include the demolition or remodeling of
older structures.
(c)    Housing Cost
Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on the County’s area
median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-low (31-50% of AMI), low (51-80% of
AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above-moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing affordability is
based on the relationship between household income and housing expenses. According to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the California Department of Housing and Commu-
nity Development (“HCD”)*, housing is considered “affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than
30% of a household’s gross income. In some areas (such as Los Angeles County), these income limits may
be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
*   HCD memo dated 4/18/07. Also available at http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/hrc/rep/state/inc2k9.pdf.
Table 7-14 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for housing in the City
(and County)* by income category. Based on state-adopted standards, the maximum affordable monthly rent
for extremely-low-income households is $640, while the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income
households is $1,068. The maximum affordable rent for low-income households is $1,708, while the maxi-
mum for moderate-income households is $1,944.
*   Affordable rent and purchase prices are based on the county median income.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage interest rates and
qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments, homeowner association fees, property in-
                                                                      329                                (Malibu General Plan Supp. No. 4, 12-14)

 For-Sale Housing
 As expected, housing sales price statistics for calendar year 2012 reveal that real estate continues to be very
 expensive in the City. According to DataQuick’s DQNews*, the median single-family home price in the
 City during 2012 was more than $2 million, while the median condo price was $550,000. Based on the esti-
 mated affordable purchase prices shown in Table 7-14, only upper-income residents can afford to purchase a
 home in the City.

 Rental Housing
 A recent survey of rental housing units in the City* found that rents ranged from $3,675 to over $5,000 per
 month. When market rents are compared to the amounts that low-income households can afford to pay (Ta-
 ble 7-14), it is clear that it is not possible for low-income households to find market-rate rental housing
 without overpaying.

 7.2.5       Special Needs
 Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to special circumstances.
 Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income, family characteristics, disability, or
 other conditions. As a result, some of the City’s residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpay-
 ment, overcrowding, or other housing problems.
 State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with disabilities, the elderly,
 large households, female-headed households, homeless people, and farmworkers. This section contains a
 discussion of the housing needs facing each of these groups.

(a)   Persons with Disabilities
The most recent available Census data reported that the City had approximately 605 people between 16 and
64 years of age, or about 7% of the working age population, who reported a work-related disability (Table 7-
15). Of those aged 65 and above, 299 (about 17.5%) reported some form of physical disability. Reported
disabilities included persons whose disability hinders their ability to go outside the home (1.7% of the work-
ing age population and 10.2% of the senior population). Housing opportunities for the handicapped can be
maximized through housing assistance programs and providing universal design features such as widened
doorways, ramps, lowered countertops, single-level units and ground floor units. During the previous plan-
ning period an ordinance establishing procedures to ensure reasonable accommodation for persons with dis-
abilities was adopted pursuant to SB 520*.

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual
that:
•     Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical impairments;
•     Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
•     Is likely to continue indefinitely;
•     Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activ-
      ity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) ca-
      pacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency;
•     Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or generic
      services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration
      and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities as a separate category of disability. According to the
U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population
that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally disabled persons can
live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals
require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Be-
cause developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the devel-
opmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based services
to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide sys-
tem of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Westside
Regional Center (WRC) located in Culver City (http://www.westsiderc.org/) provides services for people
with developmental disabilities in Malibu. The WRC is a private, non-profit community agency that con-
tracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities
and their families.

HOUSING ELEMENT
There is no charge for diagnosis and assessment for eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, most services
are free regardless of age or income. There is a requirement for parents to share the cost of 24-hour out-of-
home placements for children under age 18. This share depends on the parents’ ability to pay. There may
also be a co-payment requirement for other selected services.
Regional centers are required by law to provide services in the most cost-effective way possible. They must
use all other resources, including generic resources, before using any regional center funds. A generic re-
source is a service provided by an agency that has a legal responsibility to provide services to the general
public and receives public funds for providing those services. Some generic agencies may include the local
school district, county social services department, Medi-Cal, Social Security Administration, Department of
Rehabilitation and others. Other resources may include natural supports. This is help that disabled persons
may get from family, friends or others at little or no cost. According to the latest available WRC Perform-
ance Report*, the Center served approximately 7,400 individuals during 2012. Of those, 64 clients resided in
Malibu and over three-quarters of whom were children or young adults age 22 or under**.

In addition to the services provided by the WRC, City housing programs that respond to the needs of this
population include 1d (Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing) and 3a (Section 8 Rental
Assistance).

According to recent Census data, there were 1,272 households in the City where the property owner was 65
or older (Table 7-16). Many elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes or have disabilities. Elderly
homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs

of this group can be addressed through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes, shared living
arrangements, congregate housing, and housing assistance programs.
Second units provide an important source of housing for elderly family members as an alternative to institu-
tional facilities (see Housing Plan, Program 2.2).

(c)    Large Households
Large households are defined as those with five or more members. Approximately 65% of owner households
and 70% of renter households in the City have only one or two members. About 7% of renter households
have five or more members, while about 6% of owners were large households (Table 7-17). This distribution
indicates that the need for large units with four or more bedrooms is expected to be significantly less than for
smaller units. The City responds to the needs of large households through participation in the County’s Sec-
tion 8 program and other housing assistance programs (see Housing Plan Program 3.3).

(d) Female-Headed Households
Of the 4,673 households in the City, 6.4% or 297 households were headed by a female (Table 7-18). While
female-headed households represent a small portion of households, 8.1% of these households were below
the poverty level*. The City responds to the needs of female-headed households through the following:

(e)     Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary income is from seasonal agricultural work.
Farming activities in the City are limited horticultural activities on approximately 25 acres of land scattered
throughout the City. For example, there are two nurseries located west of Trancas Canyon, two orchards lo-
cated north of Point Dume, one nursery located just west of Pepperdine University, and two nurseries and
two orchards located in the Civic Center area. These horticultural activities are not a significant source of
employment and do not generate a demand for permanent onsite farm worker housing.
Recent Census estimates published by SCAG reported about 4,573 persons employed in agricultural occupa-
tions living in Los Angeles County, with none reporting Malibu as their place of residence.
(f)     Homeless Persons
Throughout the country, homelessness has become an increasing problem. Factors contributing to the rise in
homelessness include the general lack of housing affordable to lower-income persons, increases in the num-
ber of persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions in public assistance for the poor, and
the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.
The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1986* defines a “homeless” person as an individual who
lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, or an individual whose primary nighttime residence
is:
1.      A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommoda-
        tions;
2.      An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or
3.      A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, regular sleeping accommodations for
        human beings.
*    42 U.S.C. § 11301, et seq.
Federal agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), interpret the
McKinney-Vento definition to include only those persons who are on the streets or in shelters and persons

who face imminent eviction (within a week) from a private dwelling or institution and who have no subse-
quent residence or resources to obtain housing.*
*    “Who is Homeless?” 2009. Published by the National Coalition for the Homeless, July 2009, p.1
People are also at risk of homelessness when they experience a sudden drop in income or a rise in housing
costs, and/or they do not have the skills necessary to manage their limited resources. According to the Na-
tional Coalition for the Homeless (NCH), most individuals at risk of homelessness are on a fixed income or
are marginally employed and have few ties to family and friends.
The 2008-2013 Los Angeles County Consolidated Plan* estimated that there may be 71 homeless persons in
the City. In 2009, information regarding the estimated number of homeless in the city was obtained from the
Malibu Police Services Division of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LACSD). LACSD esti-
mates there are perhaps 25 homeless individuals living in the undeveloped hillside areas and other vacant or
isolated areas of the City. While there are no homeless facilities within the City, the homeless can be found
in public parks and near public restroom facilities. This LACSD figure is considered to be a more accurate
assessment. Recent Census estimates published by SCAG reported no homeless persons in Malibu.
*    Los Angeles Urban County Five-Year Consolidated Plan, Table VI.2, May 28, 2008
The needs of the homeless vary by subpopulation. Mentally ill persons require housing supported by mental
health care and counseling. Alcohol and drug abusers require treatment facilities and medical and social
support services. Victims of domestic violence need shelter and social services to assist in the transition to
independent living. Runaway and recently emancipated youths require shelter, combined with counseling
and social services, in order to reintegrate them with their families or enable them to live independently.
Emergency Shelters
Emergency shelters are generally geared toward providing immediate housing to persons without shelter.
Emergency shelters are housing facilities with minimal supportive services for homeless persons, and are
limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. Stays in emergency shelters are typically
limited to a short period of time (1 to 90 days). No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter
because of an inability to pay. A few service agencies located near the City provide emergency shelter and
services for the homeless; however, most of these facilities have restricted service areas and are not available
to the City’s homeless at this time (see Table 7-19). Based on this data, there are no emergency shelter beds
available to serve the City’s homeless population.

SB 2 of 2007* strengthened the planning requirements for emergency shelters and transitional housing.
Unless adequate capacity is available to serve the existing emergency shelter need, SB 2 requires that shel-
ters be allowed “by-right” (i.e., without a conditional use permit or other discretionary approval) in at least
one zoning district. As an alternative, the requirements may be satisfied through a multi-jurisdictional
agreement. In accordance with SB 2, the City amended the Local Coastal Program (LCP) and Malibu Mu-
nicipal Code (M.M.C.) with respect to emergency shelters during the previous planning period in confor-
mance with SB 2.
*    Senate Bill 2 (Cedillo) [Stats. 2007, ch. 633 Sections 1—3]
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional and supportive housing are types of supportive housing used to facilitate the movement of
homeless individuals and families, or those at risk of homelessness, to permanent housing. Specifically,
transitional housing means rental housing operated under program requirements that call for the termination
of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predeter-
mined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months. Supportive housing has no limit on the
length of stay and is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining
the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible,
work in the community. As with emergency shelter facilities, all transitional and supportive housing pro-
grams that serve the City’s homeless are located in neighboring communities.
SB 2 requires that transitional and supportive housing be treated as a residential use subject to only those
requirements that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The LCP and M.M.C.
were amended in the previous planning period with respect to transitional and supportive housing in con-
formance with SB 2. (Resolution Nos. 14-04, 1/13/14; 13-34, 8/26/13)
7.2.6      Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
State law requires that the Housing Element identify any residential projects in the City that are under an
affordability restriction, along with those housing projects that are at risk of losing their low-income af-
fordability restrictions within the ten-year period from 2013-2021. According to the SCAG, the California
Housing Partnership Corporation and City records, there are no assisted units in the City, and therefore, no
housing units at risk of losing their low-income affordability. (Resolution Nos. 14-04, 1/13/14; 13-34,

7.2.7       Housing Constructed, Demolished or Converted within the Coastal Zone
California Government Code § 65588(d) requires that the Housing Element update take into account any
low- or moderate-income housing provided or required in the Coastal Zone pursuant to § 6590 (the Mello
Act*). State law requires that jurisdictions monitor the following:
•       The number of new housing units approved for construction within the Coastal Zone (after January 1,
        1982);
•       The number of low- or moderate-income units required to be provided in new developments either
        within the Coastal Zone or within three miles of the Coastal Zone;
•       The number of existing housing units in properties with three or more units occupied by low- or mod-
        erate-income households that have been authorized for demolition or conversion since January 1, 1982;
        and
•       The number of low- or moderate-income replacement units required within the Coastal Zone or within
        three miles of the Coastal Zone.
*    The Mello Act requires, in part, the replacement of affordable units demolished or converted within the coastal zone.

7.2.8       Future Growth Needs
(a)     Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
The RHNA is a key tool for local governments to plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the an-
ticipated need for housing within each jurisdiction for the period from January 2014 to October 2021. Local
governments then determine how they will address this need through the process of updating the Housing
Elements of their General Plans.
The current RHNA was adopted by the SCAG in 2012. Future housing needs are determined primarily by
the forecasted growth of households in a community. Each new household, created by a child moving out of
a parent’s home, by a family moving to a community for employment, and so forth, creates the need for a
housing unit. The housing need for new households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy
to promote housing choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost
due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these factors – household
                                                                         337                                     (Malibu General Plan Supp. No. 4, 12-14)

growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the construction need for a community. Total
housing need is then distributed among four income categories on the basis of the County’s income distribu-
tion, with adjustments to avoid an over-concentration of low-income households in any one community.
(b) 2014-2021 Growth Needs
In October 2012, SCAG adopted the final RHNA growth needs for each of the cities in Los Angeles County,
as well as the unincorporated areas. The total housing growth need for the City during the 2014-2021 plan-
ning period is 2 units. This total is distributed by income category as shown in Table 7-21.

7.3.1      Land Resources
(a)    Inventory of Sites for Housing Development
Government Code § 65583(a)(3) requires Housing Elements to contain an “inventory of land suitable for
residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis
of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed analysis of potential
development sites has been prepared (see Appendix B) and the results of this analysis are summarized in
Table 7-22 below. This analysis also addresses the unaccommodated need from the previous planning pe-
riod, as required by Government Code § 65584.09 (AB 1233).

As summarized in Table 7-22, this analysis determined that there are sufficient vacant or underutilized sites
with appropriate zoning to accommodate the City’s housing need for this planning period.
(b) Infrastructure Capacity
Wastewater - There is no municipal sewer service in the City of Malibu. All properties in the City are cur-
rently served by individual onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS); with the exception of those served
by five small package treatment plants within the City: Latigo Bay Shores, Point Dume, Trancas Canyon,
Malibu Mesa, and Maison de Ville. Any new development that is not served by the five treatment plans will
be required to install its own OWTS in order to serve its wastewater disposal needs.
Water - Domestic water for City residents is supplied by County Waterworks District No. 29 (“District 29”)
from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). The MWD obtains its water from the
State Water Project and the Colorado River. Wholesalers of water in the Malibu/Santa Monica Mountains
areas are the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District and the West Basin Municipal Water District. These
wholesalers distribute to three retailers, which include District 29, Silvas Park Mutual Water Company, and
Las Virgenes Metro Water District. Many of the City’s water mains and tanks have been identified by the
City and by District 29 as severely undersized. However, for projects located in areas with limited to no ser-
vice by District 29, property owners may install water tanks to serve the property’s needs. With the inclusion
of private water tanks, domestic water supply is not expected to limit development. (Resolution Nos. 14-04,
1/13/14; 13-34, 8/26/13)

HOUSING ELEMENT
7.3.2       Financial and Administrative Resources
(a)     State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) - The City does not have any housing that
qualifies for CDBG funding. The City receives approximately $80,000 a year in CDBG funding. Of this to-
tal, 15% is spent on administration and program services (e.g., Malibu Community Labor Exchange). In re-
cent years, the City has exchanged the remaining funds with other cities as Malibu does not have eligible
projects.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program was created
by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 in order to provide an alternate method of funding low- and moderate-
income housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based upon population, toward funding housing that meets
program guidelines. The tax credits are then used to leverage private capital into new construction or acqui-
sition and rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the Tax Credit pro-
grams include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-restricted, based upon
median income.
Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC) - This program provides a federal tax credit for income-qualified
homebuyers that is equivalent to 15% of the annual mortgage interest. Generally, the tax savings are calcu-
lated as income in order to help buyers qualify to purchase a home. Using an MCC, first-time homebuyers
can save between $700 and $2,500 a year on their annual federal tax bill. The program is initiated by the
homebuyer applying through a participating lender, who then submits an application to the Los Angeles
County Community Development Commission*. The City is not involved in administering this process or
approving loans.

(b) Local Resources
The City does not currently have a housing department. The only local revenue source for affordable hous-
ing is through the City’s approval of the Patriot Homes Overlay condominium project. The City Council
resolution approving the project requires an in-lieu payment of $30,000 per unit, required at the time of the
close of escrow, to be used for programs consistent with the City’s Housing Element. An Affordable Hous-
ing Trust Fund, which contains in-lieu funds generated through development agreements, was established in
2013 (Ordinance No. 375). (Resolution Nos. 14-04, 1/13/14; 13-34, 8/26/13)
7.3.3       Energy Conservation Opportunities
State law (Government Code § 65583(a)(8)) requires all new construction to comply with “energy budget”
standards that establish maximum allowable energy use from depletable sources. These requirements apply
to such design components as structural insulation, air infiltration and leakage control, setback features on
thermostats, water heating system insulation (tanks and pipes) and swimming pool covers if a pool is
equipped with a fossil fuel or electric heater. State law also requires that a tentative tract map provide for
future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision, including designing the lot sizes
and configurations to permit orienting structures to take advantage of a southern exposure, shade or prevail-
ing breezes.

Southern California Edison (SCE) and the Southern California Gas Company offer energy conservation pro-
grams, including audits of home energy use to reduce electricity consumption, refrigerator rebates, appliance
repair and weatherization assistance to qualified low-income households, buyer’s guides for appliances and
incentives by the Gas Company to switch from electric to gas appliances. Direct assistance to low-income
households is provided by the Gas Company through the California Alternate Rates for Energy Program and
by SCE through its Energy Management Assistance Program.
Both companies have programs to encourage energy conservation in new construction. SCE’s energy rebate
program applies to residential developers as well as to individual customers. SCE also offers an Energy
STAR new home program and a Sustainable Communities Program, offering design assistance and financial
incentives for sustainable housing development projects. The Gas Company’s Energy Advanced Home Pro-
gram is offered to residential developers who install energy-efficient gas appliances that exceed California
energy standards by at least 15%.
In addition, simple water conservation techniques can save a family thousands of gallons of water per year,
plus many dollars in water and associated energy consumption costs. It is now possible to obtain plumbing
products that reduce water waste by restricting the volume of water flow from faucets, showerheads, and
toilets. The use of plant materials that are adapted to the climate of Southern California’s coastal areas can
also measurably contribute to water conservation by reducing the need for irrigation.
A household can save water by fixing dripping faucets and using water more conservatively. In addition,
such conservation practices save on the amount of gas and electricity needed to heat water. By encouraging
residents to conserve water and install water saving devices, the City can greatly reduce its water consump-
tion needs and expenses.
Actions the City of Malibu has taken to encourage energy conservation include the following:
•     City policy regarding processing permits for water tanks, rainwater collection structures, etc. was cre-
      ated for the ease of the applicant
•     Solar panels are processed with a ministerial Over-the-Counter (OC) Permit which takes only a few
      days to approve and costs under $100
•     A draft Exemplary Green Building Projects Fast-Tracking Pilot Program has been prepared
Finally, the City has recently adopted the Local Energy Efficiency Standards Ordinance and the Landscape
Water Conservation Ordinance. The energy ordinance preserves and enhances the environment, by setting
forth minimum energy efficiency standards within the City for all new single-family dwellings, multi-family
residential construction, nonresidential construction and substantial remodels. The City’s ordinance includes
measures which are more restrictive than the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Title 24).
The water conservation ordinance applies to: 1) projects for a commercial, institutional, or multi-family use
or a subdivision, any of which propose a new or altered landscape area, including public agency projects;
and 2) projects for a single-family residential use proposing a new or altered landscape area of 2,500 square
feet or more; in the case of a project associated with an existing single-family residence, the new or altered
landscape area is subject to this Chapter when the landscape area is 5,000 square feet or more. The water
conservation standards are intended to promote water conservation while allowing the maximum possible
flexibility in designing healthy, attractive, and cost-effective water efficient landscapes. (Resolution Nos.

7.4.1      Governmental Constraints
(a)     Land Use Plans and Regulations
General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General Plan to guide its future
development. The Land Use Element of a City’s General Plan establishes the basic land uses and density of
development within the various areas of the city. Under state law, the General Plan elements must be inter-
nally consistent and the city’s zoning ordinance, and Local Coastal Program, as applicable, must be consis-
tent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable locations and densities in order to
implement the policies of the Housing Element.
The City of Malibu’s (“City”) General Plan Land Use Element provides for five residential land use desig-
nations, as shown in Table 7-23.

     Not to exceed 4 units per lot

     As determined by the PD process
While the City has a considerable amount of vacant land, only a small portion is suitable for development
because of steep hillsides, unstable soils and subsurface conditions, extreme fire hazards, and environmen-
tally sensitive habitat areas (ESHA). Since its incorporation in 1991, the City has focused its efforts on pre-
serving its rural character, protecting environmental resources, and improving fire safety.
With highly constrained land, limited infrastructure, and high land costs, the City’s approach to accommo-
dating affordable housing is to identify unconstrained sites at appropriate densities and to successfully lever-
age state and federal subsidies for affordable housing. The encouragement of second units is also important,
as most of Malibu’s development consists of single-family homes and associated accessory structures.
Zoning Designations and Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development through Title 17 of the
M.M.C. (Zoning Ordinance/Zoning Map). Additionally, because the City of Malibu lies entirely within the

Coastal Zone, all of the zoning designations and development standards have been incorporated into the
LCP. The LIP includes additional development standards and coastal resource protection policies that are
intended to augment the M.M.C. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan and are designed
to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents. The M.M.C. and LCP also help to
preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods. The M.M.C. and LCP set forth residential
development standards for each zoning district.
Zoning districts that allow residential units as a permitted use are as follows:
RR             Rural Residential
SF             Single-Family Residential
MF             Multi-Family Residential
MFBF           Multi-Family Beachfront
MH             Mobile Home Park
PD             Planned Development
AHO            Affordable Housing Overlay
A summary of the LCP/M.M.C. development standards for the zoning districts permitting residential devel-
opment is provided in Table 7-24. These development standards are reasonably necessary to protect the pub-
lic health, safety and welfare and maintain the quality of life, and are not considered to be constraints to the
development of housing.
In the previous planning period, the LCP and M.M.C. were amended to establish an Affordable Housing
Overlay (AHO) district that allows multi-family development by-right at a density of 20 units per acre when
units exceeding the base density are reserved for low- and moderate-income households.

Zoning for Lower-Income Housing
As shown in Table 7-25, the LCP and M.M.C. provide for a variety of housing types including single-family
homes, multi-family (both rental and condominiums), manufactured housing and second units. Low-income
housing can be accommodated in all residential districts. Second units, which are a tool in facilitating af-
fordable housing, are permitted by right in all districts that permit detached single-family housing, specifi-
cally the RR, SF, MF, and MFBF Districts.

Density, Units per Parcel, Floor Area and Lot Coverage Limitations. Pursuant to Assembly Bill 2348*, the
“default density” for small Los Angeles County jurisdictions, including the City, is 20 dwelling units per
acre**. The default density refers to the density at which low-income housing development is presumed to
be feasible, although state law allows jurisdictions to propose alternative densities that are sufficient to fa-
cilitate affordable housing based on local experience and circumstances. The MFBF zone allows develop-
ment of more than 20 units per acre. While the MFBF zone limits development to four units per parcel, this
is not a constraint to development since there are no vacant parcels large enough to accommodate more than
four units at the maximum allowable density. In the previous planning period the City amended the General
Plan, LCP and M.M.C. to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) zone allowing multi-family de-
velopment at a minimum density of 20 units/acre by-right when affordable housing is provided. This
amendment also included revisions to development standards to facilitate such development, such as maxi-
mum building square footage and lot coverage.

LCP Local Implementation Plan
The entire City is located in the Coastal Zone and is subject to the City’s LCP Local Implementation Plan
(LIP). The LIP includes development standards to protect environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHA)
(LIP Chapter 4), native trees (LIP Chapter 5), scenic, visual, and hillside resources (LIP Chapter 6), shore-
line and bluff areas (LIP Chapter 10), archaeological/cultural resources (LIP Chapter 11), public access (LIP
Chapter 12), and water quality (LIP Chapter 17). Projects that contain or are located near identified coastal
resources may require modifications or reductions in density to protect the identified resource. While the
LIP is a City document, it must be consistent with the California Coastal Act, and any modification is sub-
ject to certification by the Coastal Commission. For a discussion of potential constraints raised by the LIP,
see Chapter IV: Residential Permit Processing/Coastal Development Permit and Non-Governmental Con-
straints/Environmental Constraints.
Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs may include those in residential care facilities, persons with disabilities, the eld-
erly, farm workers, or persons needing emergency shelter, transitional living arrangements, or single room
occupancy units. Many of these groups also fall under the category of extremely-low-income households.
The City’s provisions for these housing types are discussed below.
Extremely Low-Income Households
Many of the persons and households discussed in this section under the topic of special needs fall within the
extremely-low-income category, which is defined as 30% or less of area median income, or up to $25,600
per year for a four-person household in Los Angeles County (2013).
A variety of City policies and programs described in the Housing Plan address the needs of extremely-low-
income households, including those in need of residential care facilities, and persons with disabilities. How-
ever, it must be recognized that the development of new housing for the lowest income groups typically re-
quires large public subsidies, and the level of need is greater than can be met due to funding limitations, es-
pecially during these times of declining public revenues.
                                                                  345                         (Malibu General Plan Supp. No. 4, 12-14)

Residential Care Facilities and Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Residential facilities refer to any family home, group care facility, or similar facility that provides non-
medical care to persons in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the
activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual*. Health and Safety Code §§ 1267.8 and
1566.3 require local governments to treat licensed group homes and residential facilities with six or fewer
residents no differently than other by-right single-family housing uses. “Six or fewer persons” does not in-
clude the licensee, the licensee’s family, or persons employed as facility staff. The City shall not require a
conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance of a residential facility which serves six
or fewer persons which is not required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same zone**.
*    California Health & Safety Code § 1502
**   California Health & Safety Code § 1566.3(c)
Residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential districts in
conformance with state law. The M.M.C. and the LCP allow large family day care facilities in the CG zone
subject to a conditional use permit. The City has no requirements for minimum distance between residential
care facilities.
The City’s building codes require that new residential construction comply with the federal Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA). ADA provisions include requirements for a minimum percentage of units in new
developments to be fully accessible to the physically disabled. Provisions of fully accessible units may also
increase the overall project development costs. However, unlike the Uniform Building Codes (UBC), en-
forcement of ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is mandated under federal law.
Compliance with building codes and the ADA may increase the cost of housing production and can also im-
pact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties required to be brought up to current code standards.
However, these regulations provide minimum standards that must be complied with in order to ensure the
development of safe and accessible housing. In order to facilitate the processing of requests to reduce archi-
tectural obstacles for persons with disabilities, a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance and associated
amendments to the LCP and M.M.C. were adopted in the previous planning period.
Farmworker Housing
As discussed in Chapter 7.2, Housing Needs Assessment, the City of Malibu does not have major agricul-
tural areas nor has it identified a need for permanent on-site farm worker housing. However, the Employee
Housing Act* requires that farmworker housing for up to 12 units or 36 beds be permitted by-right in zones
that allow agricultural uses. Amendments to the M.M.C. and LCP were adopted in the previous planning
period in conformance with the Employee Housing Act.
*    California Health & Safety Code §§ 17021.5 and 17021.6
Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
Emergency shelters are facilities that provide a safe alternative to the streets, either through a shelter facility
or through the use of motel vouchers. Emergency shelter is short-term, usually for 30 days or less. Transi-
tional/supportive housing is longer-term housing, typically up to two years or more. Transitional housing
typically requires that residents participate in a structured program to work toward the established goals so
that they can move on to permanent housing. Residents are often provided with an array of supportive ser-
vices to assist them in meeting goals.

Senate Bill (SB) 2 of 2007* strengthened the planning requirements for emergency shelters and transi-
tional/supportive housing. Unless adequate capacity is available to serve the existing emergency shelter
need, SB 2 requires that shelters be allowed “by-right” (i.e., without a conditional use permit or other discre-
tionary approval) in at least one zoning district. In accordance with SB 2, in the LCP and M.M.C. were
amended in the previous planning period to allow permanent emergency shelters by-right in the Commercial
General (CG) and Institutional (I) zoning districts subject to appropriate development standards. The CG
zoning district encompasses approximately 26 acres and the Institutional district encompasses approximately
208 acres (see Figure IV-1). Parcels in these districts range in size from 0.1 acre to 14 acres. The majority of
CG parcels are located within the Civic Center area, in the middle of the city. Several of the parcels along
Malibu Creek are vacant and tucked away from surrounding commercial and residential development. The
Institutionally-zoned parcels are scattered throughout the city and although the majority of them contain ex-
isting development (fire stations, schools and churches), the parcel in the Civic Center that contains the court
house is currently underdeveloped and could accommodate a shelter.
*   Senate Bill 2 (Cedillo) [Stats. 2007, ch. 633 Sections 1—3]
SB 2 also requires that transitional and supportive housing be treated as a residential use subject to only
those requirements that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The LCP and
M.M.C. allow transitional and supportive housing subject to the same standards and procedures as apply to
other residential uses of the same type in the same zone in conformance with SB 2.
Single Room Occupancy
Single room occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units designed for extremely-low- and very-
low-income persons. SRO facilities are permitted by-right in the CG zone subject to the following require-
ments:
•     Minimum 150 sq. ft./maximum 400 sq. ft.
•     Occupancy limited to 2 persons
•     Laundry facilities must be provided on-site
•     If bathroom facilities are not provided in each unit, common bathrooms must be provided in accor-
      dance with the California Building Code for congregate residences with at least one full bathroom per
      floor.
•     If kitchen facilities are not provided in each unit, at least one common kitchen must be provided per
      floor.
•     24-hour on-site management

Off-Street Parking Requirements
The City’s parking requirements for residential uses vary by residence type. Single-family dwellings require
two enclosed and two unenclosed spaces per unit. Multi-family dwellings require two parking spaces per
efficiency (studio) unit and three spaces per one- and two-bedroom units. One additional parking space is
required for each additional bedroom above two. The parking requirements are summarized in Table 7-26.
Through the provisions of state density bonus law*, senior housing and other affordable housing projects are
eligible to request reduced parking standards. It is widely accepted that senior and lower-income households
have fewer cars on average than higher-income households. In order to reduce potential constraints to af-
fordable housing development, reduced parking standards are allowed for multi-family projects that provide
affordable housing consistent with state density bonus law.

Second Dwelling Units
In response to state-mandated requirements and local needs, the City allows the development of second
dwelling units as a permitted accessory use (i.e., no discretionary approval required) in the RR, SF, MF, and
MFBF zones. Second units must meet the following requirements:
•      Second units shall be limited in size to a maximum of 900 square feet, which includes the total floor
       area of all enclosed space, including lofts, mezzanines, and storage areas, but excludes a garage up to
       400 square feet.
•      One on-site parking space shall be required for the exclusive use of any second residential unit.
•      New development of a second unit that includes plumbing facilities shall demonstrate that adequate
       sewage disposal can be provided on the project site.
•      Comply with the same development standards (e.g., height, setbacks) as the primary unit.
Second units serve to augment resources for senior housing or other low- and moderate-income segments of
the population. The development standards are reasonable to ensure neighborhood compatibility, and do not
present an unreasonable constraint to development. During 2000 - 2010, 34 second units and 50 guest
houses were permitted in the City. Guest houses do not have kitchen facilities and are not intended for full-
time occupancy.
In order to expand opportunities for second units, Housing Plan Program 2.2A describes actions the City
will take to encourage and facilitate the increased development of this type of housing.
Density Bonus
As part of the LCP, the City has adopted a residential Density Bonus Ordinance (LIP Section 3.7). Under the
City’s ordinance, a density increase of up to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density
is available to developers who agree to construct housing developments with units affordable to low- or
moderate-income households. The density bonus is applicable only to projects where the land use designa-
tions in the LCP allow development of at least five residential units on the property where the project is lo-
cated. Additionally, the Density Bonus Ordinance requires that the project be consistent, to the maximum
extent feasible and in a manner most protective of coastal resources.

HOUSING ELEMENT
Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant, rather than on site, thereby reducing
cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the installation of mobile homes on permanent
foundations on single-family lots. It also declares a mobile home park to be a permitted land use on any land
planned and zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a new mobile home
park to be less than that permitted by the LCP and M.M.C.
In the City, manufactured housing is allowed in all residential zones as a permitted use, provided the instal-
lation complies with the site development standards for the applicable zoning district. Mobile home parks, in
existence as of City incorporation on March 28, 1991, are allowed as permitted use within the MH District.
Modification to the number, layout, or density of mobile home spaces, or internal roads or parking areas re-
quires a conditional use permit. The City currently has two mobile home parks, both located south of Pacific
Coast Highway. The first is Paradise Cove Mobile Home Park (257 units), located just east of Point Dume
and the second is the Point Dume Club Mobile Home Park (297 units), located just west of Point Dume.
The City’s mobile home parks are its most significant source of affordable housing. Many mobile home park
residents have limited or fixed incomes. The City has adopted mobile home park rent control regulations
(M.M.C. Chapter 5.16) to ensure that mobile homes continue to provide affordable housing opportunities.
Building Codes
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local geographic, cli-
matic, or topographic conditions and requires that local governments making changes or modifications in
building standards must report such changes to the California Department of Housing and Community De-
velopment (HCD) and file an expressed finding that the change is needed.
The City has adopted the latest 2011 Los Angeles County Building Codes, with all amendments which are
based on the 2010 California Code. The City currently enforces the following codes: California Building,
Residential, Plumbing, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire, Energy, and Green Building Standards.
As noted in Chapter III, the City has recently adopted the Local Energy Efficiency Standards Ordinance and
the Landscape Water Conservation Ordinance. The energy ordinance preserves and enhances the environ-
ment, by setting forth minimum energy efficiency standards within the City for all new single-family dwell-
ings, multi-family residential construction, nonresidential construction and substantial remodels. The City’s
ordinance includes measures which are more restrictive than the California Building Energy Efficiency
Standards (Title 24). The water conservation ordinance applies to: 1) projects for a commercial, institutional,
or multi-family use or a subdivision, any of which propose a new or altered landscape area, including public
agency projects; and 2) projects for a single-family residential use proposing a new or altered landscape area
of 2,500 square feet or more; in the case of a project associated with an existing single-family residence, the
new or altered landscape area is subject to this Chapter when the landscape area is 5,000 square feet or more.
The water conservation standards are intended to promote water conservation while allowing the maximum
possible flexibility in designing healthy, attractive, and cost-effective water efficient landscapes. Implemen-
tation of the two ordinances has begun. These standards may result in an incremental increase in develop-
ment cost, but are offset by water and energy savings throughout the life of the home.

Transfer of Development Credit Program
For each new single-family residential parcel which is proposed to be created, an applicant must acquire one
transfer of development credit (TDC). That is, the applicant must demonstrate that the development potential
on the equivalent of one developable parcel has been extinguished. This is normally done by recording an
offer to dedicate an open space easement over the subject property. The open space easement prohibits con-
struction of a residence and most other types of development.
As implemented by the California Coastal Commission (CCC), the TDC Program in Malibu (LIP Chapter 7)
is mandatory for applicants who propose to intensify land use through subdivisions or construction of con-
dominiums or rental housing projects (except for qualifying affordable housing developments, which are
exempt from TDC requirements). Any property owner may choose not to participate in the program by sim-
ply applying for a coastal development permit for no more than one residential unit on each existing residen-
tial parcel.
The CCC has recognized several ways to “generate” a TDC (that is, to assemble the equivalent of one de-
velopable parcel which can then be restricted to open space). For instance, in a small-lot subdivision, a credit
will be considered “generated” according to a formula which measures the “buildability” of the site. To
qualify property as a TDC generator, site-specific soil studies, percolation tests, and the like are not typically
performed, due to the often considerable expense which such tests involve. Instead, the formula is based on
the criteria of slope, road access, and water service, which can be measured without undue expense to the
property owner.
The number of small lots required to equal one TDC depends on the application of the formula to the lots in
question: the more gentle the slope, the greater the credit value of the lots, since a more generous dwelling
could be constructed. For example, one or more lots capable of supporting a small-to-medium sized dwelling
(one with 1,500 square feet of floor space) are determined to generate one TDC.
Where small lots are less suited to development, TDCs may be generated based on their size rather than
slope. Thus, the second way of generating a TDC would be based on 500 square feet of “credit” for each lot
which has at least 4,000 square feet of area; three such lots, generating 1,500 square feet of credit, are con-
sidered to generate one TDC.
A third way to generate TDCs, for lots smaller than 4,000 square feet, is to assign a value of one TDC for
any combination of lots adding up to a total of one acre. The assumption here is that an acre of land, even if
steep, can probably accommodate at least a small dwelling. Of course, if the property were determined to be
completely unbuildable, no TDCs would be generated, since the whole point of the program is to avoid de-
velopment which could otherwise occur.
However TDCs are generated, the mechanism by which development potential is extinguished is recordation
of an offer to dedicate an open space easement. In general, the open space easement allows no development
as defined by the Coastal Act, except for removal of vegetation that constitutes a fire hazard, installation of
underground utility lines or septic systems, passive public recreational use, directional or no-trespassing
signs, and fences which are necessary to protect natural resources and/or private property. Residential use, as
a primary use, is not allowed, although some easements allow uses associated with a residence, such as cor-
rals or decks. Such ancillary uses are appropriate where the underlying fee interest in the land is under the
ownership of an adjacent home owner who can assume the necessary responsibility for property taxes and

weed abatement. In other instances, where other public land holdings are adjacent or nearby, fee ownership
of the land is turned over to a public agency, such as the California Department of Parks and Recreation.
Existing regulations generally limit development in the MF and MFBF zones to one unit per existing parcel
unless development credits are obtained. The developer of the recipient site must purchase development
credits on a unit-for-unit basis to attain the maximum density allowed in the MF and MFBF zones. LCP
regulations specifically exempt low-income units from the requirement to purchase TDCs; therefore, this
policy does not represent a constraint to the development of affordable housing.
(b) Development Processing Procedures
Residential Permit Processing/Coastal Development Permits
State planning and zoning laws provide permit processing requirements for residential development. Within
the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its development review process in order to
minimize the time required to obtain permits, and ensure that projects receive careful review.
All residential development is reviewed by City staff for LCP/M.M.C. and Building Code compliance prior
to the issuance of building permits. These reviews are conducted concurrently with the planning review
process, which therefore shortens the overall processing time for projects:
        City Biologist/Environmental Review Board: Biological review is required if a project is near an en-
        vironmentally sensitive habitat area (ESHA) or includes landscaping. The City Biologist reviews all
        new residential projects to determine whether or not they should be reviewed by the Environmental
        Review Board (ERB). The City Biologist’s review process typically takes three weeks. If the City Bi-
        ologist determines that ERB review is required, then the process typically extends another two months.
        Additionally, the review process may be extended if the application includes the installation of 2,500
        square feet of landscaping, as the project must be reviewed for conformance with the M.M.C. Land-
        scape Water Conservation Ordinance.
        City Coastal Engineer: The City Coastal Engineer reviews projects that are located along the coast
        and can be potentially affected by tidal forces. Although the requirement that the application include a
        wave uprush report can extend the permit process, and thereby raise the cost of residential develop-
        ment, these reports are necessary to ensure public safety in Malibu. On average, the City Coastal Engi-
        neer will respond within one month of receiving submitted materials. The entire review process varies
        greatly depending upon the complexity of the project and the promptness of the applicant’s consultant.
        City Environmental Health Administrator: The City Environmental Health Administrator reviews
        the adequacy of onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) for all those properties in the City that
        are not served by a package wastewater treatment plant. Review by the City Environmental Health
        Administrator is necessary because the City has no public sewer system and approximately 84% of the
        dwelling units in the City have no access to a local/neighborhood sewer system. The entire review
        process varies greatly depending upon the complexity of the project and the promptness of the appli-
        cant’s consultant.
        City Geologist and City Geotechnical Engineer: Due to complex geologic and geotechnical condi-
        tions in the City, development is subject to review by the City Geologist and/or City Geotechnical En-
        gineer. Although the requirement that the applicant submit geological and geotechnical reports can ex-
        tend the permit process, and thereby raise the cost of residential development, these reports are neces-

      sary to ensure public safety in Malibu. On average, the City Geologist and/or City Geotechnical Engi-
      neer will respond within one month of receiving submitted materials. The entire review process varies
      greatly depending upon the complexity of the project and the promptness of the applicant’s geotechni-
      cal consultant.
      City Public Works Department: The City’s Public Works Department is responsible for reviewing
      projects that include grading, drainage, demolition and right-of-way improvements. On average, com-
      ments will be provided by the Public Works Department within one month of submittal. The entire re-
      view process varies greatly depending upon the complexity of the project and the promptness of the
      applicant’s geotechnical consultant.
      Additional reviews: Although additional reviews may not be required for all applications, reviews by
      the City Engineer, Los Angeles County Fire Department, Los Angeles County Waterworks District No.
      29 (“District 29”), California Department of Fish and Game, California State Lands Commission, and
      California Department of Transportation may be required so that appropriate conditions can be placed
      on projects. The amount of time required for review varies depending on the complexity of the project.
All residential projects require either an Over-the-Counter (OC) permit, Administrative Plan Review (APR)
or a Coastal Development Permit (CDP). OC permits are issued for such projects as free-standing garden
walls, on-grade patio slabs, interior remodels and other smaller residential improvements. APR permits in-
clude projects that are exempt from requiring a CDP. A list of exemptions from a CDP are provided in LIP
Section 13.4 and include improvements to single-family residences, such as the addition of garages, swim-
ming pools, fences, storage sheds, certain types of landscaping, and a minimal amount of grading. Typically,
projects located on beachfront properties do not qualify for an APR permit. A CDP is required for projects
that are not exempt and ensures that development within the Coastal Zone (the entire City of Malibu) is con-
sistent with the LCP, the California Coastal Act, and California Code of Regulations Title 14 Division 5.5.
Other discretionary requests, such as a site plan review, minor modification, conditional use permit, string-
line modification, or variance, are processed concurrently with an APR or a CDP.
Permit Processing Times
Processing times vary and depend on the size, complexity, and location of the project. APR projects are re-
viewed and approved by the Planning Director. CDPs are separated into two types - Administrative CDP
(ACDP) and full CDP. Administrative CDPs are reviewed and approved by the Planning Director and re-
ported to Planning Commission. A regular CDP requires a public hearing and is approved by the Planning
Commission. Some discretionary requests, such as conditional use permits and variances, require a public
hearing before the Planning Commission. Projects that involve ESHA must also be reviewed by the City’s
ERB prior to a decision by the Planning Director or Planning Commission. This process typically adds from
one to two months to the permit process. The City does not require architectural review; however, a visual
impact analysis requiring the installation of story poles on-site is required for all projects that are visible
from a scenic area or include a discretionary request unless waived by the Planning Manager.
Tentative parcel maps and tentative tract maps require approximately six to eight months to process and both
are processed concurrently with a CDP. However, review time depends greatly on the promptness of the ap-
plicant. Projects reviewed by the Planning Commission and the City Council, such as amendments to the
General Plan, LCP and M.M.C., typically add, at a minimum, six months to the process.

Certain steps of the development process are required by state laws rather than local laws. The state has de-
fined processing deadlines to limit the amount of time needed for review of required reports and projects. In
an effort to provide an efficient permit processing system, the City has implemented the following time and
cost saving developmental processes:
•       Prepared permit processing guidelines to assist residential builders in applying for development per-
        mits for single-family residences, multi-family residential developments, and subdivisions.
•       Located all City divisions involved in the permitting process in one central location.
•       Developed an “early consultation” pre-application process to identify issues as soon as possible and
        reduce processing time.
•       Encouraged processing of one comprehensive project to avoid multiple applications on one property.
•       Provided a GIS (Geographic Information System) application on the City’s website with land use in-
        formation and hyperlinks to important information, such as General Plan and Zoning Code documents.
•       Allowed for planning-related inquiries to be addressed Mondays through Fridays at the public counter
        and through a Planning Department telephone hotline.
While the City has adopted procedures to minimize the review time for development applications, such as
concurrent processing of all related applications, the additional complexity of state Coastal Commission in-
volvement and sensitive environmental conditions on nearly every site results in more lengthy processing
times than is often the case in non-coastal areas. While lengthy review procedures can present a constraint to
housing development and affordability, the City has few options for expediting permits that have not already
been implemented. Table 7-27 summarizes the review process and associated timelines for the permitting of
single-family and multi-family projects.

Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all development projects under the California Environmental Quality
Act* (CEQA). An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required for all developments that have the poten-
tial of creating significant impacts that cannot be mitigated. Typically, residential projects in the City are

either Categorically Exempt or require an Initial Study and Negative Declaration or Mitigated Negative Dec-
laration under CEQA. The Negative Declaration process typically takes six to eight weeks to prepare, plus
the mandated public review period. Categorically Exempt developments, such as second residential units,
require a minimal amount of time. As a result, state-mandated environmental review does not pose a signifi-
cant constraint to housing development.

(c)    Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits the amount of fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost of pro-
viding the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are charged by the City and
other public agencies in order to cover the costs of processing permit applications and providing services
and facilities such as schools, parks and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro
rata share system, based on the magnitude of the project’s impact or on the extent of the benefit that will be
derived.
Table 7-28 provides a list of fees the City charges for new, standard residential development. Table 7-29 and
Table 7-30 provide a summary of fees charged for a typical single-family and multi-family project. The rates
charged by the City are inclusive and based on standardized unit sizes. Because of environmental and infra-
structure constraints, residential development consists primarily of infill projects that do not involve LCP,
M.M.C. or General Plan amendments. Development fees will vary from project to project but are currently
estimated to be approximately $29,000 per unit for single-family units and $14,000 per unit for multi-family
units.

The City annually evaluates the actual cost of processing the development permits when revising its fee
schedule.
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’ property tax revenues, cities and
counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services and facilities to serve their residents.
One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from
general tax revenues to development impact fees and improvement requirements on land developers. The
City requires developers to provide onsite and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects. Such
improvements may include water and other utility extensions, street construction and traffic control device
installation that are reasonably related to the project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required
of a project for improvements to the right-of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites,
consistent with the Subdivision Map Act*.
*    California Government Code §§ 66410 – 66499
The City requires the payment of three impact fees prior to the issuance of building permits: the Los Angeles
County Fire Department Developer Fee, the Santa Monica - Malibu Unified School District (SMMUSD)
Developer Fee, and the Quimby Act/Parkland Development Fee. The Fire Department Developer Fee was
initiated by the Los Angeles County Fire Department and is the same fee charged by most of the cities and
in the unincorporated areas of the County surrounding the City of Malibu. The fee is necessary to assure
adequate fire equipment and services are available as Malibu is designated as a Very High Fire Hazard Se-
verity Zone. The fee is $0.9276 per square foot of new construction. The School District Developer Fee was
initiated by the SMMUSD and is used to fund school improvements in the district. The fee is $2.63 per hab-
itable square foot of new residential (both single-family and multi-family) construction. The Quimby
Act/Parkland Development Fees are designed to ensure that new development meets local park space obliga-
tions. The Quimby Act fee is applied to new subdivisions while the Parkland Development Fee applies to
new construction other than subdivisions. The Parkland Development Fees are $3,425 per single-family unit,
$2,714 per unit in a multi-family project containing less than five dwelling units per building, and $2,178
per unit in a multi-family project containing five or more units per building. These fees are typical of other
cities in environmentally constrained areas and are not considered to be a constraint to development.
Development and growth in the City are limited by geologic and environmental constraints, steep slopes,
and dependence on private OWTS for wastewater management. Public works facilities that exist in the City
include roads and highways, public water and telephone utilities, and all publicly financed recreational fa-
cilities. Major capital improvement projects completed by the Department of Public Works in Malibu consist
of road repairs, maintenance, and improvements.
The majority of new housing development that has occurred in the City during the previous housing cycle
has been single-family homes on infill sites, including large rural estate parcels. These projects typically do
not require off-site improvements but are dependent on public roads that must be maintained by the City.
The City’s roads are vulnerable to damage by winter storms, and considerable expense is required to keep
the roads open. Local streets are defined in the General Plan Circulation Element as two-lane, undivided
roadways with frequent driveway access and 48- to 58-foot rights-of-way, although many of the City’s can-
yon access roads have narrower rights-of-way. To maintain the rural character of its residential areas, the
General Plan discourages the use of curbs and sidewalks. Malibu’s standards for local streets are modest
when compared to more urbanized cities in Los Angeles County and do not act as a constraint to develop-
ment.

HOUSING ELEMENT
The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improvements including
streets, stormwater and wastewater treatment facilities, parks, and other public works projects to facilitate
the continued build-out forecast in the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of pub-
lic improvements is coordinated with private development.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of housing, cities have little
choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations on property taxes and other revenue sources
needed to fund public services and improvements. (Resolution Nos. 14-04, 1/13/14; 13-34, 8/26/13)
7.4.2      Non-Governmental Constraints
(a)     Environmental Constraints
Malibu is located on a narrow coastal strand on the southern slope of the Santa Monica Mountains, which
are characterized by steep and rugged hillsides and canyons draining into the Pacific Ocean. More than 80%
of Malibu is hillside area; the remaining relatively flat land is subject to ocean and/or canyon (creek) flood-
ing, or other significant environmental constraints. Geologic and seismic hazards include landslides, soil
erosion, mudflows, and liquefaction potential. Additionally, the City is located in the Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zone, and the majority of the City has experienced major brush fires in recent decades. The City’s
environmental constraints are well documented in the General Plan. Since its incorporation in 1991, the City
of Malibu has had six federally declared disasters and one federally declared emergency.
Although the City is characterized by a large amount of vacant land, only a small portion of that land is suit-
able for development due to these natural constraints. Development in steeply sloping properties would re-
quire substantial modification to the natural terrain, which would significantly add to the cost of develop-
ment. Development on the steep hillsides would also add to erosion and landslide potential. Additionally, all
new single-family residences and multi-family residential development in the City require a Coastal Devel-
opment Permit pursuant to the development requirements of the LCP, which limit grading on steep slopes
and encroachment into environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHA). Development is also constrained by
federal and state laws (e.g., Federal Emergency Management Agency floodplain regulations, Clean Water
Act, Endangered Species Act; and California Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zon-
ing Act).
While environmental conditions constrain development throughout the city, these factors have been consid-
ered in the analysis of potential development sites described in Appendix B, and are not expected to pre-
clude projects from achieving the estimated level of development.
(b) Infrastructure Constraints
Infrastructure in the City is designed to serve resident needs in a manner that respects environmental con-
straints and retains the City’s rural residential character. As discussed previously under Development Fees
and Improvement Requirements, the City requires developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements
necessary to serve their projects. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for
rights-of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities, and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map
Act.
Additionally, the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improvements
including streets, public structures, stormwater conveyance and wastewater treatment facilities, parks and
other public works projects to facilitate the continued build-out of the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to

                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
ensure that construction of public improvements is coordinated with private development. As a result of
these policies, any infrastructure constraints that currently exist must be fully mitigated and financed as
growth occurs. While infrastructure requirements can add to the cost of housing, these improvements are
necessary to ensure public health and safety, and would not preclude the level of development that is neces-
sary to accommodate the city’s housing needs.
Wastewater
There is no municipal sewer service in the City. All properties in the City are currently served by individual
onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS); with the exception of those properties served by five small,
community-serving package wastewater treatment plants: Point Dume (serving the Point Dume Mobile
Home Park), Trancas Canyon (serving Malibu West and a number of homes on Broad Beach Road and Vic-
toria Point), Malibu Mesa (at Pepperdine University, serving the Malibu Country Estates), Tivoli Cove Con-
dominiums, and Maison de Ville (serving three condominium complexes). The lack of a municipal sewer
system constrains the amount of development that the City can accommodate; however, the underlying con-
straint is the steep terrain that is better suited to onsite systems than a community sewer system. Additional
high-density residential development to accommodate the City’s assigned regional housing need would re-
quire either the construction of a municipal wastewater treatment system or small package treatment plants
to serve individual developments.
Water
Domestic water for City residents is supplied by District 29 from the Metropolitan Water District of South-
ern California (MWD). The MWD obtains its water from the State Water Project and the Colorado River.
Wholesalers of water in the Malibu/Santa Monica Mountains areas are the Las Virgenes Municipal Water
District and the West Basin Municipal Water District. These wholesalers distribute to three retailers, which
include District 29, Silvas Park Mutual Water Company, and Las Virgenes Metro Water District. Many of
the City’s water mains and tanks have been identified by the City and by District 29 as severely undersized.
However, for projects located in areas with limited to no service by District 29, property owners may install
water tanks to serve the property’s needs.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) has recently adopted new water supply requirements
for the issuance of final approval. New construction projects will not receive final approval unless they can
show adequate fire flow capacity. Furthermore, the Fire Department will no longer accept onsite water tanks
to be used as a primary source of water for fire-fighting purposes. The problem with these new requirements
is that the majority of remaining vacant properties in the City are located within the mountain canyons.
These properties do not have ready access to water lines; therefore, they cannot prove adequate fire flow.
The problem has been compounded by the aging water infrastructure regulated District 29. In many of the
more remote areas of the City, there is no infrastructure currently. In the past, properties in these areas have
relied upon wells and/or large water storage tanks to provide water in times of fire.
Currently, the LACFD will not issue final approval without District 29 sign-off and LACFD approval. The
City is in negotiations with both departments, but has not rectified the problems to date.
Storm Water Drainage
The City has numerous streams and creeks that drain the hillsides and canyons. The majority of stormwater
runoff follows natural drainage courses to the ocean. The City has recently completed construction of two
                                                         359                         (Malibu General Plan Supp. No. 4, 12-14)

HOUSING ELEMENT
stormwater treatment projects to remove pollutants: Paradise Cove Storm Water Treatment Facility and the
Civic Center Storm Water Treatment Facility, which is tied into Legacy Park. The LIP provides provisions
to ensure development projects will not result in the increase of stormwater runoff. The City Public Works
Department reviews hydrology reports for all new development to ensure compliance with stormwater run-
off provisions; therefore, with these existing facilities and review procedures in place, the City’s flood con-
trol system is not expected to limit development during the planning period.
(c)     Land and Construction Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing. Land values fluctuate
with market conditions, and steadily increased from 2000 until the current real estate recession began in
2007. Changes in land prices reflect the cyclical nature of the residential real estate market. It appears as if
the market has begun to recover and real estate prices are increasing.
The natural resources, commitment to a rural character, and location of the City has made Malibu a very de-
sirable place to live. Additionally, much of the buildable land in the City has already been developed. The
high demand for housing in the City combined with a limited supply has made land prices considerably
higher than in most other areas of Los Angeles County, and this trend is expected to continue in the foresee-
able future.
The cost of construction is affected by the price of materials and labor, development standards, and general
market conditions. The City has no influence over the cost of materials and labor, and the building codes and
development standards are not substantially different than most other cities in the County. Construction costs
for materials and labor in the City have increased at a slightly higher pace than the general rate of inflation,
according to the Construction Industry Research Board.
(d) Cost and Availability of Financing
The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the availability of real estate loans, although for those
with excellent credit, mortgage interest rates are at historic lows. However, the changes in mortgage under-
writing standards have had greater impacts on low-income families than other segments of the community.
Programs such as 2.7 and 3.2 in the Housing Plan help to reduce financing costs for low- and moderate-
income homebuyers.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire neighborhoods
in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in the area (“redlining”). In monitoring
new construction sales, resales of existing homes, and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that red-
lining is practiced in any area of the City. (Resolution Nos. 14-04, 1/13/14; 13-34, 8/26/13)
7.4.3      Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property transactions, and it is the
City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. Program 3.1 in the Housing Plan includes a commitment to
identify and contract with an appropriate organization to provide fair housing services to Malibu residents.

7.5.1     Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Implementation Programs
This chapter outlines the City of Malibu’s plan to encourage the provision of adequate housing to meet the
needs of residents from all economic segments throughout the 2013-2021 planning period. The overriding
housing goal of the City is:
GOAL:       Adequate Housing for the Existing and Projected Needs of All Economic Segments of the
            Community
The City’s policies and implementation programs designed to support this goal are organized into four gen-
eral areas as described below.
1. Preserve and Improve the Existing Housing Stock
Policy 1.1        Ensure compliance with existing codes to protect health, safety and community sus-
                  tainability
Policy 1.2        Assist property owners in repairing or rebuilding damaged or deteriorated housing
                  units, especially affordable housing
Policy 1.3        Preserve existing mobile home parks as an important source of affordable housing
Policy 1.4        Conserve affordable housing in the Coastal Zone
      Program 1.1 - Code Enforcement
      Ensure compliance with the City’s codes and regulations. Particularly in the case of code violations in
      units that are occupied by lower-income persons or persons with special needs, direct property owners
      and renters to programs that are available to provide assistance. Offer amnesty and legalization for ex-
      isting housing units where:
            1)    The unit is “livable” and meets basic health and safety requirements;
            2)    The unit existed at the time of the City’s incorporation; and
            3)    The unit is restricted for owner-occupancy or rental by low- or moderate-income persons at
                  an affordable rate.

     Program 2.1 - Regional Housing Needs Identification
     Work with the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the Las Virgenes-Malibu
     Subregional Council of Governments (COG) to encourage an appropriate fair share allocation of future
     regional housing needs based on population need, existing supply/demand, ability to accommodate
     growth given the physical/environmental constraints and the jobs-to-housing ratio.

     Objective:                  Encourage fair and realistic RHNA allocations
     Program 2.2 - Ensure Adequate Capacity to Accommodate Regional Housing Needs
     The City’s residential land inventory provides adequate capacity to accommodate the City’s housing
     needs as identified in the 2014-2021 RHNA (see Appendix B). The City will pursue a two-part strategy
     to provide sites for lower-income housing: 1) Opportunities and incentives for second units; and 2)
     Zoning regulations to facilitate affordable multi-family or mixed-use development in suitable locations.
     A.    Expand the Supply of Second Units
     Second units represent an important source of affordable housing in Malibu (see Appendix B for fur-
     ther discussion of second unit production). Due to extraordinarily high land cost and environmental
     constraints, development of new affordable housing is very difficult. Since second units can be ac-
     commodated on developed sites at no additional land cost, they represent an excellent option for ad-
     dressing the needs of seniors, university students, household employees, local service workers, and ex-
     tended family members. In order to maximize the availability of additional second units, the City will
     implement the following actions:
           1.   Promote the Development of Second Units - Develop a brochure to provide information
                on the City’s second unit standards and incentives to promote their development. The bro-
                chure will be distributed at City Hall, posted on the website, and provided to all applicants
                for new residential development.

                2.      Amnesty Program for Second Units - Continue to implement the Second Unit Amnesty
                        Program for legalized second units that meet all health and safety requirements. The am-
                        nesty program may include the waiver of City fees and penalties and will allow the legal
                        registration of both second units and converted guest houses.
                3.      Financial Assistance for Second Units - Contact local service providers, including the Wa-
                        ter District and School District, to pursue reduced development impact fees on second units
                        dedicated for occupancy by lower-income households. Evaluate mechanisms to subsidize
                        impact fees using local, state, and nonprofit sources, including the City’s Affordable Hous-
                        ing Trust Fund.
                4.      Pre-Approved Second Unit Prototypes - Make available pre-approved second unit proto-
                        type plans to assist applicants and streamline the approval process.

        Objective:                          21 second units during 2014-2021
        B.      Facilitate New Affordable Housing Development
        In order to accommodate lower-income housing, the M.M.C. and LCP regulations were amended in the
        previous planning period to establish an Affordable Housing Overlay allowing multi-family or mixed-
        use development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre for projects that include affordable housing. In
        order to qualify for the increased density incentive, all “bonus” units (i.e., additional units allowed
        above the base density of 6 units per acre) must be deed-restricted for low- and moderate-income
        households for a minimum of 30 years at a ratio of 50% low- and 50% moderate-income. As an alter-
        native, very-low-income units may offset the requirement for moderate-income units on a one-for-one
        basis.* Any developer utilizing these incentives shall be required to screen tenants or buyers for com-
        pliance with income limits and establish a monitoring system to ensure the unit’s continued afforda-
        bility. This program creates a strong incentive for affordable housing development because of the addi-
        tional units allowed at 20 units per acre compared to the base density of 6 units per acre. The allowable
        density of 20 units per acre does not include the state-mandated density bonus, and it is anticipated that
        all projects utilizing this option will also qualify for a density bonus of up to 35%.
*    For example, a 20-unit qualifying project may provide 7 low-income units, 7 moderate-income units and 6 market-rate units; or as an alterna-
     tive, 7 very-low-income units and 13 market-rate units.
        This program does not represent an “inclusionary” requirement because property owners who do not
        wish to take advantage of the density incentive would be allowed to develop market-rate housing at the
        allowable base density of 6 units/acre.
        Incentives and concessions for ELI units will include a variety of housing types such as SROs and sup-
        portive housing. Incentives may include priority processing, density bonus, modified development
        standards, administrative support with funding applications, and/or fee waivers or deferrals.

     In order to facilitate development of affordable housing, including housing for persons with develop-
     mental disabilities and other special needs, the City will contact non-profit developers annually to im-

     bonus and modified development standards, administrative support with funding applications, and fee
     waivers or deferrals if feasible. The City has already had conversations with nonprofit developers re-
     garding affordable housing opportunities on the La Paz site.

        Program 3.2 - Provide Financial Support and Referral Information to Persons in Need of Assis-
        tance
        Malibu is a small jurisdiction without a redevelopment agency or housing department, and is not an en-
        titlement jurisdiction for federal grants, such as Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and
        the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME). Therefore, the City does not have any re-
        sources for direct financial housing assistance, other than a small Affordable Housing Trust Fund. The
        City will provide referral information to extremely-low-, very-low-, low-, and moderate-income per-
        sons and families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities regarding affordable and special needs
        housing, such as Section 8 Rental Assistance and the Mortgage Credit Certificate program. If feasible,
        the City will seek CDBG and HOME funds.
        a.      Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Maintain an Affordable Housing Trust Fund and use the pro-
                ceeds to leverage other sources of funding for affordable housing.
        b.      State and Federal Grants. Where feasible, seek state and federal grant funds, such as CDBG
                and HOME, in order to provide support for affordable housing activities.
        c.      Section 8 Rental Assistance. Provide referral information to low-income persons seeking rental
                assistance by publicizing the program in flyers posted at City Hall, the City’s website and other
                public locations.

Appendix A - Evaluation of the Previous Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the effectiveness of the exist-
ing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies, and the progress in implement-
ing programs for the previous planning period. This appendix contains a review of the housing goals, poli-
cies, and programs of the previous housing element, and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period, 2008 through 2013. This analysis also includes an
assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies of the previous housing element. The
findings from this evaluation have been informative in determining the City’s 2013-2021 Housing Imple-
mentation Program.
The City’s goal and policy statements were revised as part of prior Housing Element update and are still ap-
propriate for the new planning period. Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Hous-
ing Element, along with the City’s accomplishments, and implications for future policies and actions.
Table A-2 summarizes the new units built during the previous Housing Element period.

zoning regulations to facilitate affordable multi-family or mixed-use development in suitable locations.
A. Expand the Supply of Second Units
Second units represent an important source of affordable housing in Malibu (see Appendix B for further
discussion of second unit production). Due to extraordinarily high land cost and environmental
constraints, development of new affordable housing is very difficult. Since second units can be
accommodated on developed sites at no additional land cost, they represent an excellent option for
addressing the needs of seniors, university students, household employees, local service workers, and
extended family members. In order to maximize the availability of additional second units, the City will
implement the following actions:
1. Promote the Development of Second Units
Develop a brochure to provide information on the City’s second unit standards and incentives to promote
their development. The brochure will be distributed at City Hall, posted on the website, and provided to
all applicants for new residential development.
2. Amnesty Program for Second Units
Adopt a Second Unit Amnesty Program for legalized second units that meet all health and safety
requirements. The amnesty program may include the waiver of City fees and penalties and will allow the
legal registration of both second units and converted guest houses. These newly-created affordable units
can be counted towards meeting the City’s RHNA requirements as allowed for in Government Code
Section 65583.1(c).
3. Financial Assistance for Second Units
Contact local service providers, including the Water District and School District, to pursue reduced
development impact fees on second units dedicated for occupancy by lower-income households.
Evaluate mechanisms to subsidize impact fees using local, state, and nonprofit sources, including the
City’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
4. Pre-Approved Second Unit Prototypes
Make available pre-approved second unit prototype plans to assist applicants and streamline the approval
process.

include revisions to current standards for total development square footage, grading quantities,
impermeable coverage, building envelope, minimum unit size, or subterranean parking.
Incentives and concessions for ELI units will include a variety of housing types such as SROs and
supportive housing. Incentives may include priority processing, density bonus, modified development
standards, administrative support with funding applications, and/or fee waivers or deferrals.
The zoning regulations will include a “no net loss” provision that requires the City to make the findings
required by Government Code §65863 if a project were approved at lower density than assumed in the
Housing Element land inventory. This provision will require that adequate sites for high-density multi-
family development be maintained throughout the planning period.
In order to facilitate affordable housing development, the City will contact non-profit developers
annually to implement a strategy for developing housing, including site identification, priority
processing, density bonus and modified development standards, administrative support with funding
applications, and fee waivers or deferrals if feasible. The City has already had conversations with
nonprofit developers regarding affordable housing opportunities on the La Paz site.

Appendix B - Residential Land Inventory
The assumptions and methodology for the Residential Land Inventory are provided below.
METHODOLOGY FOR INCOME CATEGORIES AND REALISTIC CAPACITY OF VACANT
SITES
Vacant sites in the Multi-Family Beach Front (MFBF) zone allow one unit per 1,885 square feet of lot area
(23.1 units/acre). These sites were assigned to the lower-income category based on the “default density” of
20 units/acre established under Assembly Bill (AB) 2348*. Sites in the Multi-Family (MF) zone allow a
density of six units/acre and were assigned to the moderate-income category. Potential new single-family
detached units were assigned to the above-moderate category based on prevailing market conditions.
*   Assembly Bill 2348 of 2004
In the previous planning period, the Zoning Code was amended to create an Affordable Housing Overlay
(AHO) District and apply this designation to three vacant sites shown in Table B-2. The AHO allows multi-
family development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre. These sites were assigned to the lower-income
category.
Table B-3 summarizes approved projects while Table B-4 lists vacant multi-family parcels suitable for resi-
dential development. Vacant multi-family parcels, shown on Figure B-1, can accommodate a total of 19
lower-income units and 60 moderate-income units. Vacant parcels zoned for single-family development can
accommodate an estimated 870 units. A listing of vacant single-family parcels is on file with the Planning
Department.
SECOND UNITS
Trends in Second Unit Construction. In a high-cost housing market such as Malibu, second units represent
an excellent opportunity to provide housing that is affordable to lower-income persons such as college stu-
dents, the elderly, household employees and service workers. City records indicate that during the period
2006-2013, 21 second units were completed. By definition, second units contain both kitchen and bathroom
facilities that are separate from the main house. Additional “guest houses” that did not contain both kitchen
and bathroom facilities were not counted in second unit totals.
Income Levels for Second Units. In 2011, City staff conducted a direct mail survey of all second unit permit
applicants since 2000 (approximately 60 persons). A total of 38 completed surveys were returned. Of 11 oc-
cupied second units, eight (73%) were available with no rent charged and three (27%) were rented at market
rate. Seven of the second units were vacant at the time of the survey. The remainder of the units surveyed
either were not complete second units or it was not possible to determine the status of the unit from the re-
turned questionnaire.
Based on the survey of second units, it is estimated that about three-quarters of second units will be made
available with no rent charged, while one-quarter of second units will be rented at above-moderate market
rates. This estimate is consistent with other sources such as the 2008 survey of second units conducted in
San Mateo County* which found that at least 75% of second units are affordable to lower-income house-
holds.

Appendix C - Public Participation Summary
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in the City of Malibu. This update to
the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties with numerous opportunities for
review and comment on this document. For example, public notices of all Housing Element meetings and
public hearings were published in the local newspaper in advance of each meeting, as well as posted on the
City’s website. Meeting notices were also posted on bulletin boards at City Hall.
The draft Housing Element was made available for review at City Hall and posted on the City’s website, and
a public meeting was conducted by the Planning Commission on October 21, 2013 to review the draft Hous-
ing Element. After receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the California Housing and
Community Development Department (HCD), a proposed final Housing Element was prepared and made
available for public review prior to consideration by the City Council at public hearing on January 13, 2014.
The City encouraged participation of low-income groups through direct mail or e-mail notices of all Housing
Element meetings. Table C-1 contains a list of parties that were sent notices. This list includes a number of
non-profit housing providers, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations including the following:

and how those comments are reflected in the element.
Comment                                            Response
What timeframe does the new Housing Element cover? The 5th cycle Housing Element planning period runs from October 2013 to October

Why has the City’s RHNA allocation changed?        At the beginning of each Housing Element cycle, a new Regional Housing Needs
                                                   Assessment (RHNA) is prepared to identify each jurisdiction’s housing need for the
                                                   new planning period. The new RHNA reflects the latest growth forecast prepared
                                                   by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), which is also
                                                   used for transportation planning purposes. One of the noteworthy changes in the
                                                   new growth forecast is the emphasis on linking housing with transportation, as
                                                   required by SB 375. Malibu’s location away from major transportation routes such
                                                   as freeways and transit corridors helps to explain its reduced RHNA allocation for
                                                   the 5th planning cycle.

Appendix A               Glossary of Terms
The following glossary of terms is based on several sources. The sources for the glossary include the Cali-
fornia Planning Roundtable, a nonprofit association affiliated with the California Chapter of the American
Planning Association. In addition, the glossary also includes terms and definitions developed by the League
of California Cities and the City of Calabasas.
The purpose of this glossary is to define the terms used to describe the City of Malibu’s policy commit-
ments.
Adaptive Reuse
      The conversion of an existing building from one type of use to another type of use. The purpose of
      adaptive reuse is to encourage retaining the primary constructed structure while minimizing new con-
      struction. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: (a) converting a church sanctuary to a
      performing arts theater; (b) converting an elementary school to an office complex; (c) converting a gas
      station to a restaurant; (d) converting retail space to residential uses; and other similar conversions.
Adverse Impact
      A negative consequence for the physical, social, or economic environment resulting from an action or
      project.
Adopt
      Action will be undertaken to formulate policy, guidelines, or ordinances or revisions thereto. The ex-
      pectation is that resources would be devoted to creating the policy, guidelines, ordinances, or revisions,
      and that they will be formally enacted by appropriate City decision makers.
Affordable Housing
      Housing capable of being purchased or rented by a household with very low, low, or moderate income,
      based on a household’s ability to make monthly payments necessary to obtain housing. Housing is con-
      sidered affordable when a household pays less than 30% of its gross monthly income for housing in-
      cluding utilities.
Affordability Requirements
      Provisions established by a public agency to require that a specific percentage of housing units in a
      project or development remain affordable to very low- and low-income households for a specified pe-
      riod.
Alluvial
      Soils deposited by stream action.
Ambient
      Surrounding on all sides; used to describe measurements of existing conditions with respect to traffic,
      noise, air and other environments.
Annex
      To incorporate a land area into an existing district or municipality, with a resulting change in the
      boundaries of the annexing jurisdiction.

Composting
    The treatment of solid organic refuse through aerobic, biologic decomposition.
Congestion Management Plan (CMP)
    A mechanism employing growth management techniques, including traffic level of service require-
    ments, development mitigation programs, transportation systems management (TSM), and capital im-
    provement programming, for the purpose of controlling and/or reducing the cumulative regional traffic
    impacts of development. AB 1791, effective August 1, 1990, requires all cities, and counties that in-
    clude urbanized areas, to adopt and annually update a CMP.
Conservation Element
    One of the seven State-mandated elements of a local general plan, it contains adopted goals, policies,
    and implementation programs for the conservation, development, and use of natural resources includ-
    ing water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife,
    minerals, and other natural resources.
Coordinate
    Action will be taken to expend time and money in jointly pursuing an implementing activity with other
    entities. The expectation is that implementation will definitely result, and that it will be accomplished
    cooperatively with other organizations, possibly with the City in the lead.
Cumulative Effect or Cumulative Impact
    “Cumulative impacts” refers to two or more individual effects which, when considered together, are
    considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts. The incremental effects of
    an individual project are reviewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other
    current projects, and the effects of probable future projects.
dB
    Decibel; a unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by the human ear.
dBA
    The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels; weighs or reduces the effects of low and high
    frequencies in order to simulate human hearing. Every increase of 10 dBA doubles the perceived loud-
    ness though the noise is actually ten times more intense.
Dedication
    An action by a property owner which turns over private land for a public use, and its acceptance for
    such use by the government agency in charge of the public function for which it will be used. Dedica-
    tions for streets, parks, school sites, or other public uses are often made conditions for the approval of a
    development.
Density Transfer
    A process permitting unused allowable densities in one area to be used in another area. Where density
    transfer is permitted the average density over an area would remain constant, but allow internal varia-
    tions. Within a single development, the result would normally be a clustering of buildings on smaller
    lots with some land retained as open space.

Development
     The physical extension and/or construction of structures, subdivision of land, roads or other facilities,
     installation of septic systems; grading which requires a permit; and deposit of debris or fill materials.

     tenance and remodel are not “development.”
Development (Proposed)
     Development for which an application for approval/permits has been submitted to the City, but not yet
     approved.
Dispersion
     A measure of the “scattering” of a component of water (e.g., pathogens or nitrates) in various direc-
     tions.
District
     1.    An area of a city or county that has a unique character identifiable as different from surrounding
           areas because of distinctive architecture, streets, geographic features, culture, landmarks, activi-
           ties, or land uses.
     2.    A portion of the territory of a city or county within which uniform zoning regulations and re-
           quirements apply; a zone.
Disturbed Sensitive Resource Areas (DSRAs)
     Those areas which would historically have met the Coastal Act definition of an environmentally sensi-
     tive habitat but which have been substantially modified as a result of coastal development. DSR’s typi-
     cally possess remnant biota which remain important biological resources.
Diversity
     Differences among otherwise similar elements that give them unique forms and qualities, e.g., housing
     diversity can be achieved by differences in unit size, tenure, or cost.
Downzoning
     A change in the zoning classification of land to a classification permitting development that is less in-
     tensive or dense, such as from multifamily to single-family or from commercial to residential. A
     change in the opposite direction is called “upzoning.”
Drainfield
     A means to finally treat and dispose of septic tank effluent by means of subsurface soil-absorption and
     adsorption. Also known as disposal field or leachfield.
Dwelling Unit
     A room or group of rooms (including sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation facilities, but not more
     than one kitchen), which constitutes an independent housekeeping unit, occupied or intended for occu-
     pancy by one household on a long-term basis.

GLOSSARIES
Easement, Conservation
     A tool for acquiring open space with less than full-fee purchase, whereby a public agency buys only
     certain specific rights from the land owner. These may be positive rights (providing the public with the
     opportunity to hunt, fish, or ride over the land), or they may be restrictive rights (limiting the uses to
     which the land owner may devote the land in the future).
Ecology
     The interrelationship of living things to one another and their environment; the study of organisms as
     affected by the factors of their environments.
Ecosystem
     The fundamental unit in ecology, comprising the living organisms and the nonliving elements interact-
     ing in a certain defined area.
Effluent
     Water, sewage, or any other liquid (partially treated or in its natural state) that is flowing out of a res-
     ervoir, septic tank, or treatment plant.
Eminent Domain
     The legal right of government to acquire or take private property for public use or public purpose upon
     paying just compensation to the owner. While originally used only when land was to be kept in public
     ownership, i.e., for highways, public buildings or parks, property has been condemned under eminent
     domain powers for private use in the public interest, such as urban renewal.
Encourage
     The action will receive positive treatment in written policy, and will be transmitted as appropriate to
     influence others. In cases where the City can compel action, such as in the application review process,
     the City will commit resources to assist others to achieve the action or condition being encouraged.
     The expectation is that, to the extent that the action or condition meets both the objectives of the City
     and the other party, that the action or condition will occur. In cases where the City cannot compel the
     actions of others, encourage is synonymous with support.
Endangered Species
     A species of animal or plant that is considered to be endangered when its prospects for survival and re-
     production are in immediate jeopardy from one or more causes. Both the California Department of Fish
     and Game (pursuant to Title 14 of the California Administrative Code) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
     Service (pursuant to the Federal Endangered Species Act) identify endangered species.
Endemic
     A species or habitat type that is restricted to a particular geographic area or soil type and which occurs
     in no other area.
Encroachment
     Any obstruction or protrusion into a right-of-way or adjacent property, whether on the land or above it.
Enhance
     To improve existing conditions by increasing the quantity or quality of beneficial uses or features. Ac-
     tion will be taken to improve existing conditions by increasing the quantity or quality of beneficial uses

     or existing actions. The expectation is that a desirable condition exists, and is to be improved by the ac-
     tion.
Ensure
     Action will be taken to guarantee a certain outcome or result. The expectation is that, in guaranteeing a
     particular result, the City will commit resources, and has the legal right to compel other parties to take
     a particular action or perform in a prescribed manner.
Environmentally Sensitive Area or Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area (ESHA)
     Any area in which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of
     their special nature or role in an ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human
     activities and developments. Malibu’s ESHAs include, but are not limited to, the following:

           types of limited distribution recognized to be of particular habitat value including wetlands, ripar-
           ian scrub, riparian woodlands, oak woodlands, and oak savannahs (Table 3-5).
     3.    Those areas designated by the County of Los Angeles as Significant Ecological Areas (SEAs)
           which meet the definition of environmentally sensitive habitat areas as defined in Section 30107.5
           of the Coastal Act (Table 3-4).
     4.    Any areas which through professional biological evaluation meet the criteria enumerated in (2)
           and (3), above.
     5.    Those marine areas designated by the State of California as areas of Special Biological Signifi-
           cance (ASBS).
Evapotranspiration
     The actual loss of water by evaporation from soil and water bodies as well as transpiration from plants.

     Soils which swell when they absorb water and shrink as they dry.
Feasible
     Capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time taking into
     account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors.
Fiscal Impact Analysis
     A projection of the direct public costs and revenues resulting from population or employment change
     to the local jurisdiction(s) in which the change is taking place. Enables local governments to evaluate
     relative fiscal merits of general plans, specific plans, or projects.

GLOSSARIES
Flood - 100 Year (Base Flood)
     The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the average every 100 years, based on historical data.
     The 100-year flood has a 1/100, or one percent, change of occurring in any given year.
Floodplain
     The land area on either side of the banks of a stream regularly subject to flooding from any source.
     That part of the flood plan subject to a one percent chance of flooding in any given year is designated
     as an “area of special flood hazard” by the Federal Insurance Administration.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
     The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net area of the site, expressed in decimals
     to one or two places. For example, on a site with 10,000 net sq. ft. of land area, a Floor Area Ratio of
     1.0 will allow a maximum of 10,000 gross sq. ft. of building floor area to be built. On the same site, a
     FAR of 0.5 would allow 5,000 sq. ft. of floor area; an FAR of 0.25 would allow 2,500 sq. ft.; and an
     FAR of 0.15 would allow only 1,500 sq. ft. Also, as commonly used in zoning, FARs typically are ap-
     plied on a parcel-by-parcel basis to an average FAR for an entire land use or zoning district.
“Granny Flats”
     A secondary housing unit, no greater than 1,200 sq. ft. in floor area, developed on a residential lot or
     parcel for the purpose of providing additional affordable housing opportunities, typically for extended
     elderly family members. Granny flats include kitchen and bathroom facilities.
Grasslands
     Lands in which grasses are the predominant vegetation.
Greywater
     “Wastewater” generated by household appliances and fixtures with the exception of the toilet, possibly
     the garbage grinder (garbage disposer), and non-bathing water bodies (jacuzzis, swimming pool, spas).
Ground Failure
     Ground movement or rupture caused by strong shaking during an earthquake. Includes landslide, lat-
     eral spreading, liquefaction, and subsidence.
Ground Shaking
     Ground movement resulting from the transmission of seismic waves during an earthquake.
Groundwater
     Water under the earth’s surface, often confined to aquifers capable of supplying wells and springs.
Groundwater Recharge
     The natural process of infiltration and percolation of rainwater from land areas or streams through
     permeable soils into water-holding rocks which provide underground storage (“aquifers”).
Growth Management
     Policy for future growth to be controlled or otherwise regulated by various ordinances and programs.
     The land use element of the general plan identifies future growth, including both residential and non-
     residential development. Growth management is a process, through ordinances and programs, to ensure
     that the growth identified in the general plan’s land use element occurs at a pace consistent with the
     agency’s objectives.

      A facility offering transient lodging accommodations to the general public and providing additional
      services, such as restaurants and meeting rooms.
Households, Number of
      The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more persons. The concept of households
      is important because the formation of new households generates the demand for housing. Each new
      household formed creates the need for one additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing
      unit be shared by two households. Thus, household formation can continue to take place even without
      an increase in population, thereby increasing the demand for housing.
Household, Low-Income
      A household with an annual income usually no greater than 80% of the area’s median family income
      adjusted by household size, as determined by a survey of incomes conducted by a city or a county, or
      in the absence of such a survey, based on the latest available eligibility limits established by the U.S.
      Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Household, Moderate-Income
      A household with an annual income between the lower income eligibility limits and 120% of the area’s
      median family income adjusted by household size, as determined by a survey of incomes conducted by
      a city or a county, or in the absence of such a survey, based on the latest available eligibility limits es-
      tablished by the U.S. Department Of Housing and Urban Development.
Household, Very-Low Income
      A household with an annual income no greater than 50% of the area’s median family income adjusted
      by household size, as determined by a survey of incomes conducted by a city or a county, or in the ab-
      sence of such a survey, based on the latest available eligibility limits established by the U.S. Depart-
      ment of Housing and Urban Development for the Section 8 housing program.
Housing and Community Development, Department of (HCD)
      The state agency that has principal responsibility for assessing, planning for, and assisting communities
      to meet the needs of very-low, low- and moderate-income households.

Housing Element
      One of the seven State-mandated elements of a local general plan, it assesses the existing and projected
      housing needs of all economic segments of the community, identifies potential sites adequate to pro-
      vide the amount and kind of housing needed, and contains adopted goals, policies, and implementation
      programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. Under State law, Housing
      Elements must be updated every five years.
Impact
      The effect of any direct man-made actions or indirect repercussions of man-made actions on existing
      physical, social or economic conditions.
Impact Fee
      A fee, also called a development fee, levied on the developer of a project by a city, county or other
      public agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts the project will produce. California
      Government Code Section 66000, et. seq., specifies that development fees shall not exceed the esti-
      mated reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged. To lawfully impose a de-
      velopment fee, the public agency must verify its method of calculation and document proper restric-
      tions on use of the fund.
Impervious Surface

     than 1.0 indicates a net in-commute (that is, workers commute to the area because there are more jobs
     available than residents to fill the jobs); a ratio less than 1.0 indicates a net out-commute (that is, resi-
     dents commute out of the area to find employment).

Level of Service (LOS)
     A scale that measures the amount of traffic a roadway may be capable of handling on a roadway seg-
     ment or at an intersection of roadways; typically measured by a ratio of traffic volume to roadway ca-
     pacity (V/C), as follows:
           Level of Service A: indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on vehicle
           movement or speed; the V/C is 0.60 or less.
           Level of Service B: describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle movement
           and speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle; the V/C is 0.61 to 0.70.
           Level of Service C: denotes a reasonably steady, high-volume flow of traffic, with some limita-
           tions on movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical approaches; V/C is 0.71 to 0.80.
           Level of Service D: denotes the level where traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections still func-
           tion, but short queues develop and cars may have to wait through one cycle during short peaks;
           V/C is 0.81 to 0.90.
           Level of Service E: describes traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent (although
           momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe, but is not uncommon at
           peak traffic hours, with frequent stopping, long-standing queues, and blocked intersections; V/C
           is 0.91 to 1.00.
           Level of Service F: describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by “traffic jams”
           and stoppages of long durations. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait through
                                                        405

     persons who drive along on the roadway during the commute period and to increase the number in car-
     pools, vanpools, buses and trains, walking and biking. TDM can be an element of TSM (see below).
Transportation Management System (TSM)
     A comprehensive strategy developed to address the problems caused by additional development, in-
     creasing trips, and a shortfall in transportation capacity. TSM focuses on more efficiently utilizing ex-
     isting highway and transit systems rather than expanding them. TSM measures are characterized by
     their low costs and quick implementation time frame, such as computerized traffic signals, metered
     freeway ramps, and one-way streets.
Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)
     Development rights are separated from the land in an area in which a community wishes to limit de-
     velopment. The concept permits these rights to be sold for use in an area desirable for development. It
     has been promoted as a way to retain farmland, preserve endangered natural environments, protect his-
     toric areas, stage development, promote low- and moderate-income housing, and achieve other land-
     use objectives.
Trip Generation
     The dynamics that account for people making trips in automobiles or by means of public transporta-
     tion. Trip generation is the basis for estimating the level of use for a transportation system and the im-
     pact of additional development or transportation facilities on an existing, local transportation system.
     Trip generations of households are correlated with destinations that attract members for specific pur-
     poses.
Tsunami
     A great change in sea-level, usually manifested as a wave, caused by submarine earth movement or
     volcanic eruption.
Vehicle Trip
     A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a destination via a single mode of transportation;
     the smallest unit of movement considered in transportation studies. Each trip has one “production end”
     (or origin, usually from home but not always) and one “attraction end” (or destination).

GLOSSARIES
View Corridor
     The line of sight — identified as to height, width, and distance — of an observer looking toward an ob-
     ject of significant to the community (e.g., ridgeline, river, historic building, etc.); the route that directs
     the viewer’s attention.
Viewshed
     The area within view from a defined observation point.
Visitor-Serving
     Non-residential land uses (included but not limited to restaurants, stores, motels, etc.) that are primarily
     oriented to visitors to the City of Malibu.
Volume-to-Capacity Ratio (V/C)
     A measure of the operation capacity of a roadway or intersection, in terms of the number of vehicles
     passing through, divided by the number of vehicles that theoretically could pass through when the
     roadway or intersection is operating at its designed capacity. Abbreviated as “V/C.” At V/C ratio 1.0,
     the roadway or intersection is operating at capacity. If the ration is less than 1.0, the traffic facility has
     additional capacity. Although rations slightly greater than 1.0 are possible, it is more likely that the
     peak hour will elongate into a “peak period.” (See “Peak Hour” and “Level of Service.”)
Wastewater Irrigation
     The process by which wastewater that has undergone appropriate treatment is used to irrigate land.
Watershed
     The total area above a given point on a watercourse that contributes water to its flow; the entire region
     drained by a waterway or watercourse which drains into a lake, ocean or reservoir.
Wave Uprush Study
     A study that identifies the potential area that would be inundated along the coast from ocean waves,
     accounting for the typical wave height of typical storms. The purpose of the study is to identify areas
     that may be affected by and potentially at risk from ocean waves.
Wetland
     Lands which may be covered periodically or permanently with shallow water and include saltwater
     marshes, freshwater marshes, open or closed brackish water marshes, swamps, mudflats, fens, and per-
     ennial streams.
Wildlife Habitat Linkages
     Areas of relatively undeveloped open space which, by virtue of their geographic location or habitat
     characteristics, have the potential to facilitate wildlife or plant migration between major habitat areas in
     the Malibu Coastal Zone including Topanga State Park, Malibu Creek State Park, Zuma/Trancas, Leo
     Carrillo and Mugu State Park. They are identified on Figure CO-3 of the Conservation Element of the
     Malibu General Plan.
Zoning
     A measure enacted by a city or county to divide a community into districts or zones within which per-
     mitted and special uses are established, as well as regulations governing lot size, building bulk, place-
     ment and other development standards. Requirements vary from district to district, but they must be

    uniform within districts. The zoning ordinance consists of two parts: the text and the map. Zoning a
    program to implement policies of the general plan.
Zoning Map
    Government Code Section 65851 permits a legislative body to divide a county, a city or portions
    thereof, into zone of the number, shape, and area it deems best suited to carry out the purposes of the
    zoning ordinance. These zones are delineated on a map, or maps, called the “Zoning Map.”
