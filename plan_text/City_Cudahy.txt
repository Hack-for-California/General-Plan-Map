SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
THE CITY OF CUDAHY
The City of Cudahy is 1.07 miles located in the south central section of Los Angeles County. It is 8 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles and immediately west of the Los Angeles River and the Long Beach Freeway (SR-710). Exhibit 1-1 shows the regional location of Cudahy. The Union Pacific Railroad and Southern Pacific Railroad tracks run along the western and southern edges of the City. Cudahy’s northern boundary is mid-block of Florence Avenue and Live Oak Street. Cities which border Cudahy are Bell on the north, South Gate on the south, Huntington Park on the west, and Bell Gardens on the east. Exhibit 1-2 shows Cudahy’s city boundaries.
Cudahy is located within an industrial belt which includes the cities of Vernon, Huntington Park, Commerce, Montebello, Pico Rivera, and Santa Fe Springs. As industrial development occurred in the area, Cudahy along with the neighboring communities of Bell, Bell Gardens and Maywood provided residential areas and commercial services for those working in the nearby industrial areas.
The Cudahy area started as an agricultural ranch in the late 1800*s. Surrounding cities in the area incorporated early and although the Cudahy area was relatively developed, it remained unincorporated. On November 10,1960, the City of Cudahy incorporated to bring together residential and industrial areas in southeast Los Angeles that were not part of the adjacent cities. In 1970, the City’s population was 16,998 persons. In 1980, it had 17,984 residents. The Census estimates the City’s 1990 population at 22,817 persons. Growth in the City paralleled the boom in southern California in the 1950’s, with nationwide migration, and in the 1980’s, with international migration.
Today, Cudahy is one of the most densely-populated cities in the County. The majority of the City is zoned High Density Residential (R-3) but is developed with single family developments which, over the years, are redeveloping or recycling to higher density residential uses. The resulting residential development is characterized by a mix of single family units at high densities and duplex, triplex, and multiple family developments. Commercial uses in the City are found along Atlantic Avenue and a few street intersections and industrial uses are located near the railroad tracks on the City’s southern section.
The major issues facing the City are:
■	The need to maintain and preserve existing viable residential neighborhoods • Rehabilitation of housing to improve the quality of the environment.
■	Provision of housing that meet the affordability and needs of residents

Introduction (continued)
■	Redevelopment and revitalization of the commercial area along Atlantic Avenue
■	Rehabilitation of the City’s older industrial areas
■	Conservation of mobile homes and affordable housing developments
■	Reduction in crime, violence, drug traffic and gang activity
THE CUDAHY GENERAL PLAN
The Cudahy General Plan will serve as the constitutional framework of the City and will guide future planning and development. It is being updated in response to the growing diversity in the City and recent changes in state law. The General Plan will serve as a guide to growth and development in the City. It will reflect the values and needs of the community and will provide City staff, residents and developers the policy direction needed to achieve the goals of the City.
The General Plan for the City of Cudahy represents the efforts of the residents, City staff, the Planning Commission, and the City Council to plan for the maintenance of residential neighborhoods and improvement of the living environment. While the City is largely developed, the General Plan provides direction and sets goals to achieve as the area redevelops and evolves through time.
The General Plan begins with an analysis of existing conditions in the City, including the physical, social, cultural and environmental resources. It looks at trends, issues and concerns that affect the community and provides goals and programs to address these concerns.
State law regulates the content of General Plans. Sections 65300-65403 of the California Government Code require local jurisdictions to prepare and adopt a general plan for the physical development of the City and its sphere of influence. There are seven mandatory elements that comprise a General Plan: Land Use, Housing, Transportation, Open Space, Conservation, Safety and Noise. Other elements may be adopted to address specific concerns in the community. The Cudahy General Plan will consist of the seven mandatory elements and an Air Quality Element.
■	Land Use Element - The Land Use Element designates the general location, distribution, and extent of the various land uses for the area within the City. The Element identifies standards for population density and development intensity.
■	Housing Element - The Housing Element evaluates the existing and projected housing needs of the City and establishes goals, policies, objectives, and programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing to meet local and regional housing needs.

Introduction (continued)
■	Transportation Element - The Transportation Element discusses the general location and the extent of the existing and proposed roadways, highways, railroads and transit routes, terminals, and public utilities and facilities. In recent years, the Element has been expanded in scope to consider alternative means of transportation.
■	Open Space and Recreation Element - The Open Space and Recreation Element details plans and measures for the preservation of open space for outdoor recreation, the management of natural resources, and public health and safety. This Element has been expanded to consider recreational resources and facilities in the area, as well.
■	Conservation Element - The Conservation Element provides for the conservation, development, and use of natural resources including water, air, wildlife, mineral, and other natural resources. The Element also considers the preservation of important cultural resources in the community.
■	Public Safety Element - The Public Safety Element establishes standards and plans for the protection of the community from a variety of hazards including earthquake, flood, fire, and geologic hazards. In 1985, the requirement for a separate Seismic Safety Element was eliminated. The statute now requires components of the Seismic Safety Element to be incorporated into the Public Safety Element.
■	Noise Element - The Noise Element examines the existing and future noise environment and the major noise sources in the City. It provides an analysis of noise problems which may be used in setting land use policies to encourage noise-compatible uses and to aid in the establishment and subsequent enforcement of a local noise ordinance.
■	Air Quality Element - In response to recommendations in the Air Quality Management Plan for the South Coast Air Basin, the City is preparing an Air Quality Element as a measure to help abate regional air pollution. The Air Quality Element contains a discussion of local and regional air quality, stationary and mobile emission sources, and programs to reduce pollutant emissions generated within the City.
These elements form an integrated and comprehensive statement of the goals and policies of the City. They comprise the administrative framework for Cudahy. Ordinances, programs, and actions of the City shall be made consistent with this General Plan, where required by State Law.

Introduction (continued)
Organization of the General Plan
The Cudahy General Plan consists of two separate sections: Policy Plan and Profile Reports. The Policy Plan and Profile Reports are organized around the eight elements. The Policy Plan contains goals, policies and implementation plans to address major issues in the City, according to the different elements. The Profile Reports provide a discussion of existing conditions and opportunities in the City. They are the basis for the goals, policies, and programs developed in the policy document.
In compliance with CEQA, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared to discuss the potential impacts of adoption of the Plan. The EIR contains a discussion of the environmental setting (similar to the Profile Reports) and impacts that may occur with future development under the Plan. Alternatives to the Land Use Plan are also discussed. The Planning Process
The General Plan Update started with the analysis of the existing conditions in the City and the identification of needs and opportunities. This was accomplished by the preparation of City Profile Reports that evaluate the resources, needs and opportunities in Cudahy. From the Profile Reports, a clear picture of the needs and resources of the City was seen. Goals and policies were then formulated to address each issue and need. The development of goals and policies helped identify the direction for future planning efforts. Programs for the implementation of goals are identified and include ongoing and proposed City programs. Regional plans and the Cudahy Redevelopment Plan have been reviewed and the Cudahy General Plan made consistent with the objectives of these plans.
The Cudahy General Plan has been reviewed by City staff, the Planning Commission and the City Council. Public participation and comments were solicited during study sessions, the public review period, and hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council, prior to adoption of the Plan.
Amendments to the General Plan
State law allows local jurisdictions to amend the General Plan four times a year to keep the General Plan relevant to current issues and will allow changes to respond to new concerns and interests in the City. It allows the elements to be updated as new information is available and helps to maintain a General Plan which reflects the direction that best meets the needs of the City. The City is required to perform an annual review of the General Plan to report the City’s progress in meeting the goals and to reflect any change in direction. Optional criteria which may be used to evaluate proposed amendments to the General Plan are as follows:

■	The proposed amendment will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare.
■	The proposed amendment will better serve the goals and purposes of the City.
«	The proposed amendment request has a potential for compatibility with either
existing or planned uses in the area.
■	The proposed amendment does not conflict with plans and programs adopted by the City and its Redevelopment Agency for the same area or the vicinity of the request.
■	The proposed amendment does not create a spot land use designation which is inconsistent with the intent and policies of the General Plan and with the density and land use of surrounding properties.
■	The proposed amendment does not share significant similarity to amendments denied by the City Council within the last 12 months.
■	The proposed amendment does not conflict with General Plan amendments that have been adopted in the past 12 months.
Element Consistency
The Cudahy General Plan has been written so that each element is consistent throughout. Because some issues are addressed in more than one element, the policy matrix below shows the interrelationships between the various issues and policies in the General Plan. It provides a guide for determining related goals and policies and references all issues in the General Plan. Also, in order to avoid confusion, programs and implementation measures that apply to a number of different elements are given references or are restated in each element. Table 1-1 will allow the City to identify elements and policies in other sections of the General Plan that may be similar or relate to an issue in one element.

SECTION 2: LAND USE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element of the Cudahy General Plan provides a strategy for the coordination and integration of all physical development in the City. It outlines goals and policies which promote orderly growth and minimize the potential for land use conflicts. The Land Use Element will serve as a guide for public and private decision-making regarding existing and future land uses. It responds to opportunities for growth and development in the area, with respect to present land uses and resources. The goals of the Land Use Element also address environmental and economic constraints related to land availability, capacity of public services and infrastructure, and other factors which may constrain future development.
The Land Use Element is a state-mandated element and fulfills the requirements of Section 65302(a) of the California Government Code. The Element contains the goals and policies for development, a land use plan to implement these goals, and a discussion of the issues and opportunities that affect land use planning in the area.
Land use issues that are considered in the Land Use Element include the type and condition of existing and future developments. Existing land uses in the City of Cudahy are primarily residential. Industrial uses are found in the southern section of the City and commercial uses are found along Atlantic Avenue and major street intersections. Mobile home parks are located within the commercial and industrial areas. Existing developments are made up of low intensity structures built 30 to 40 years ago. Many structures show signs of deterioration and the need for rehabilitation. Blight is also present in the form of unsafe buildings due to structural design, overcrowding, lack of recreational facilities, age and deterioration.
A number of new commercial buildings can be found on Atlantic Avenue and several high density residential projects have recently been completed at scattered sites throughout the City. With the majority of the City zoned for high density residential (R-3) uses, housing density is relativelyhigh VacanFiots account for only 1.9percent of the City land area with land recycling for higher density residential uses continuing to be the precursor of development in the City.
Future development in the City will depend on population growth and the availability of public services. Population growth in the City has been rapid during the past few years. Cudahy's population density has increased to 10 times the county average. The demand on public services and infrastructure that accompanies growth has led to school overcrowding and the need for additional park, library, fire protection, police and solid waste disposal and other public services. Utility consumption has also been growing, although service agencies
2-1
City of Cudahy
General Plan
Land Use Element (continued)
and companies have been able to meet the increases in demand. These and many other concerns are addressed in the Land Use Element.
The Land Use Element is probably the single most important element of the Cudahy General Plan, because it regulates land uses and development in the City. The Element’s scope is far wider than that of the other elements, although it is directly related to all of them. For example, the capacity of the existing roadway network (Transportation Element), parks and recreation areas (Open Space and Recreation Element), areas with earthquake and geologic hazards (Public Safety Element) and land uses affected by major noise sources (Noise Element) are some of the issues that the Land Use Element considers. The Land Use Element considers these issues and has been made consistent with other elements of the General Plan.
Individual property owners may not be aware of the city-wide and regional impacts of their development. Through the designation of the land use pattern and allowable densities of development, the Land Use Element provides the framework on which individual property owners may develop their properties. This is made possible by the Land Use Plan. The Plan establishes a classification of land uses, designates the general location and distribution of these uses, and sets standards of population density and development intensity for each type of use. The Plan is also designed to accommodate the economic and social activities of a community through the provision of areas for these activities.

Land Use Element (continued)
GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Land Use Element were developed in response to land use issues and opportunities identified in the Land Use Element Profile Report. With most of the City developed and many structures being 30 to 40 years old, new development in the City will involve the recycling of land. The goals and policies below address the concerns of the City with regard to existing and future developments, various land use types, parks, public services and economic development.
Issue: Existing and Future Developments
Land uses in an area contribute to the quality of the environment and the character and identity of the place. Cudahy’s concern with existing and future land uses stem from its primary goal of providing residents with an environment which meets residents’ needs and interests. By regulating the type of development in Cudahy, the City hopes to improve the quality of life and create a sense of place.
Goal 1 Ensure that developments enhance the quality of life in the City.
Policy 1.1	Improve the quality of housing in existing residential
neighborhoods.
Policy 1.2	Encourage developments which complement and enhance the
community.
Policy 1.3	Enhance the quality of the environment through the enforcement
of land use controls designed to preserve the environment and to reduce pollution, traffic and congestion, and overcrowding.
Policy 1.4	Provide for improved vehicular circulation within the City by
evaluating traffic and parking impacts prior to development or redevelopment.
Policy 1.5	Establish a community identity and pride through the emphasis on
high quality development.
Policy 1.6	Revitalize the residential, commercial and industrial land uses in
the City.
Policy 1.7	Work to reduce existing adjacent incompatible land uses in various
areas in the City.
City of Cudahy
General Plan

LAND USE PLAN
The Land Use Plan for the City of Cudahy identifies existing and planned land uses which reflect the best use of the land, in accordance with the goals and policies of this General Plan. It designates areas for various land use types and intensities, with recognition of the constraints and opportunities for future development and redevelopment. The Plan provides a mechanism to change development trends in the City and to encourage more desirable development. It redirects the City’s planning efforts, in order to create a better environment for all residents.
The development of the Land Use Plan came after the analysis of the existing development types and conditions, identification of land use incompatibilities, and the creation of a desired development scenario for the City. With this analysis, the major objectives of the Land Use Plan were formulated. They are:
■	To preserve existing single-family neighborhoods characterized by low densities on small lots.
■	To stabilize exiting medium density residential land uses on small lots.
■	To promote land assembly and the recycling of residential developments on large lots.
■	To work towards the relocation of trailer parks into residential neighborhoods.
■	To preserve neighborhood commercial uses for area residents.
■	To recognize opportunities for an integrated commercial area to serve local and regional customers.
■	To encourage spin-off development and linkages along Atlantic Avenue.
■	To promote the rehabilitation of industrial sites.
■	To provide for the development of a regional commercial center in the City.
■	To allow future relocation of the City Hall to the City center.
These objectives respond to the issues and opportunities presented by existing developments in the City. The City of Cudahy is an urbanized area with most structures 30 to 40 years old. The lack of large areas of vacant land limits future development to the recycling and rehabilitation of existing developments. Thus, the Land Use Plan promotes recycling and redevelopment, in order to achieve a more desirable pattern of land uses.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
2-9
Land Use Element (continued)
There are viable residential neighborhoods in Cudahy which the City seeks to preserve. These are single family developments on small lots. High density developments on long and narrow lots are a particular concern. Land assembly is one way of eliminating the development constraints of narrow lots and allowing more creative housing projects. Because it is unlikely that property owners will assemble lots during land recycling projects, an incentive to land assembly and redevelopment is needed. This is provided through a sliding scale of allowable densities, with increasing dwelling unit capacity on larger lots. The potential increase in economic return from additional dwelling unit capacity is expected to promote land assembly with recycling projects. High density developments on small lots are not expected to benefit from this incentive and are maintained at their current densities.
The location of mobile home parks within commercial and industrial areas presents adverse impacts on mobile home residents. Thus, it would be beneficial to integrate them into the City’s residential neighborhoods in the long term. This would eliminate conflicts between residential land uses and heavy commercial and industrial uses.
The Atlantic Avenue corridor is the City’s commercial area. Business and retail commercial activities along this corridor could be integrated to establish complementary uses and allow all businesses to derive the benefits of agglomeration. Major stores in the area can serve as nodes for spin-off development. They include Tianguis Market which could encourage other community commercial use; the K-Mart, Pic-n-Save and Kaiser Permanente area which could become a service commercial node; and the southern industrial section which could redevelop as a regional commercial center.
The development of the regional commercial center in the existing industrial section is seen as a major opportunity when older and underutilized industrial developments are redeveloped or recycled to other uses. The area presently accommodates a mix of old and new, small to medium-sized industries. Future redevelopment of the area is promoted in the Land Use Plan by allowing retail commercial land uses, light industries and a potential regional commercial development. As the major commercial node of the City, it can attract a larger patronage which would benefit the Atlantic Avenue commercial corridor and the City.
The City has been looking for a new site for the Civic Center. The relocation will provide more space to accommodate city operations. Also, by locating at the city center, it can be accessible to more individuals. The existing City Hall can then be part of Cudahy Park as a community center. These features have been incorporated in the Cudahy Land Use Plan. Developments in accordance with the Plan are expected to improve the environment and enhance the quality of life for Cudahy residents.
The Land Use Plan for Cudahy has seven land use designations. These designations correspond to the types and intensity of developments allowed under each category. Exhibit 2-1 is the Land Use Plan of the City and Table 2-1 is a breakdown of land use designations.

du/ac - dwelling unit per acre refers to the number of dwelling units that may be built on a gross acre of			
land. This is not the same as the "Cudahy acre"	which is only 40,420 square feet.		
FAR - floor area ratio refers to the allowable floor area in a structure, expressed as a factor of the net			
area of the site. The net area of a site is the portion of land which can be built upon, excluding public			
or private rights-of-way, public open space and flood ways.			
( ) - these areas are within the Commercial and Commercial-Manufacturing designations.			
Low Density Residential - The Low Density Residential designation refers to single-family developments on small lots. These developments have densities up to 9 dwelling units per acre. They are located on the City’s southeastern section and on the northern section, west of Atlantic Avenue. They cover approximately 36.72 acres or 5.3 percent of the City. The maximum population density of these neighborhoods is 39 persons per acre with 9 units per acre and 4.34 persons per unit.
Medium Density Residential - The Medium Density Residential designation applies to areas of the City with one or two single-family units on a lot or multi-family developments of 12 dwelling units per acre. These developments are found on lots with an average size of 9,000 to 9,500 square feet. They are located on the northwestern section of the City and cover 59.62 acres or 8.6 percent of the City. The population density of this area is 52 persons per acre with 12 units per acre and 4.34 persons per acre.

Land Use Element (continued)
High Density Residential - The High Density Residential designation refers to single-family and multi-family developments on lots which are predominantly one-half acre in size. This designation applies to a major portion of the City, 297.65 acres or 43.0 percent. This designation has been created to counteract the limitations imposed by the City’s long and narrow lots (52.5 feet by 387 feet). Maximum density under this designation is a sliding scale with higher densities permitted for developments on larger lots. The higher densities are intended to encourage the recycling of existing developments, as well as encourage developers to construct more creative housing. The allowable density under this designation varies from as low as 10 dwelling units per acre on lots less than 1 acre to 16 dwelling units per acre for lots 5 acres or greater. Table 2-2 provides a detailed breakdown of allowable density. The population density can be as much as 70 persons per acre at 16 units per acre and 4.34 persons per unit.

3 acres to less than 4 acres	14 du/ac
4 acres to less than 5 acres	15 du/ac
5 acres and above	16 du/ac
Neighborhood Commercial - The Neighborhood Commercial designation refers to small retail stores located near residential neighborhoods to serve the daily needs of residents. These stores and services include but are not limited to groceries, coin laundries, liquor stores, convenience shops, video stores, and service stations. Neighborhood commercial uses in Cudahy are found at 3 intersections: Clara/Otis; Clara/Wilcox, and Santa Ana/Wilcox. They cover 2.66 acres or 0.4 percent of the City. Maximum allowable intensity of these developments is a floor area ratio (FAR) of 1.5. With parking, lot coverage and other development standards, the average FAR is 0.5.
Community Commercial - The Community Commercial designation refers to service and retail stores as found along Atlantic Avenue. These stores and services include supermarkets, department stores, banks, shoe stores, mini malls, business and medical offices, restaurants, and other similar uses. Community commercial areas in the City cover 65.16 acres along both sides of Atlantic Avenue from Florence Avenue to south of Santa Ana Street. This area accounts for 9.4 percent of the City. The maximum floor area ratio
City of Cudahy
General Plan
2-12
Land Use Element (continued)
of the Community Commercial designation is 1.2. Developments have an average FAR of 025, when considering building height, setback, parking and landscaping requirements.
Commercial Manufacturing - The Commercial Manufacturing designation applies to the City’s industrial area on the southern edge. It covers 87.49 acres or 12.6 percent of the City, as well as areas in Huntington Park that are subject to annexation to the City. The area is developed with small and medium sized industrial uses. It has a potential for retail commercial and commercial-manufacturing uses when older industrial developments are recycled. The maximum floor area ratio of this designation is 3.6, with an average FAR of 0.5.
Public Uses - Public uses in the City include schools, parks and the Civic Center. The four school sites in Cudahy cover 34.53 acres. Parks cover 11.46 acres and the Civic Center, 4.20 acres. The total area devoted for public uses is 50.06 acres or 73 percent of the City. The maximum floor area ratio on these sites is 1.2, with most developments having an average FAR of 0.5.
Aside from these designations, the Land Use Plan features two overlays: the Civic Center Overlay and the Regional Center Overlay. These designations require compliance with the standards of the underlying and the overlay designations.
Civic Center Overlay - The Civic Center Overlay is located near the center of the City and covers 11.79 acres; more than adequate to provide for a civic center. It serves as a floating land use which will allow the development of a new Civic Center within this overlay designation. This designation recognizes that the existing Civic Center will be relocated to the City center at some time in the future, but does not designate a specific site.
Regional Center Overlay - The Regional Center Overlay is located in the southern section of the City along Atlantic Avenue; Like the Civic Center overlay, it serves as a floating land use to allow the development of a regional commercial center in the City. This designation is expected to promote the redevelopment of the area and the creation of a major commercial node for Cudahy and surrounding cities. The "mercado" concept has been mentioned as a potential development for the site, to serve as a major commercial node in the area. The Regional Center Overlay covers 31.19 acres or 4.5 percent of the City.
Agricultural, natural resources extraction, solid and liquid waste disposal activities are not found in Cudahy. Also, there are no lands in the City which are subject to regulation by state and federal land agencies. Thus, the Land Use Plan does not contain these designations.

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
The implementation of the land use goals, policies and the Land Use Plan will be accomplished by a number of specific actions and programs. The various programs correspond to the major land use goals of the City. These are:
■	Existing and Future Developments - improvements to existing land uses and construction of quality developments
■	Residential Areas - preservation of residential neighborhoods and improvement of the living environment
■	Commercial Areas - revitalization of commercial areas to serve the City and surrounding areas
■	Industrial Areas - rehabilitation and redevelopment of industrial land uses to light industries, commercial-manufacturing, or commercial uses
■	Parks and Recreation - provision of parks and recreational facilities to serve City residents
■	Public Services - provision of public services to support existing and future developments
■	Economic Development - development of investment opportunities in the City to create a stable tax base
Responsible agencies, time-frames for implementation, and funding sources are also included for each program. The identification of a funding source does not exclude the use of other available funding sources.
EXISTING AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The quality of developments in Cudahy may be improved through controls on the maintenance of existing land uses and on the type and design of new structures. Because of the age of existing structures, maintenance efforts are necessary and rehabilitation programs need to be increased. Also, existing land use conflicts need to be removed or buffered from one another. Future developments can be more easily regulated through the plan review process. Major programs that address the quality of existing and future developments are discussed below.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
2-14
Land Use Element (continued)
Rehabilitation Programs
Rehabilitation programs help preserve existing developments and prevent the creation of risks to the health and safety of the users of existing structures. The City’s has ongoing rehabilitation programs for residential projects through the Federal CDBG Program. Information on these programs can be found in the Housing Element.
Code Enforcement
The City shall continue code enforcement efforts to encourage property maintenance. This includes the identification of nuisances which endanger public health and safety and the provision of technical support or other incentive to allow early correction of the problem. The City shall also work towards the renovation of structures which do not meet current seismic safety standards and electrical code requirements. Code enforcement is an ongoing activity and will continue to be financed through CDBG funds. The rehabilitation of substandard structures shall be the responsibility of individual property owners, with CDBG funds available for qualified homeowners. To the extent available, redevelopment funds may also be used for this program.
Cudahy Redevelopment Plan
The Cudahy Redevelopment Plan was established to remove blighting conditions identified in the project area and to promote economic revitalization. The goal of the Redevelopment Plan is to eliminate and prevent the spread of blight in the project area through the undertaking of various activities, including the rehabilitation of commercial, industrial and residential areas in the City. Infrastructure and public services are improved to encourage private rehabilitation efforts. The City also assists area developers in land assembly through redevelopment funds. Ongoing programs by the Redevelopment Agency are financed through redevelopment funds.
Non-conforming and Incompatible Uses
The elimination of non-conforming uses will reduce hazards to public safety and improve the environment. All non-conforming uses in the City shall be identified and compliance time periods set. A reasonable return on investment prior to the required rehabilitation or removal of the use or structure will be permitted. The City shall also identify incompatible land uses throughout the City and develop programs for buffering, change in land use, or other measures to protect negative impacts on existing land uses. This will include the provision of landscaped areas along the Los Angeles River and the railroad tracks to better blend with adjacent areas. This program shall be established in 1993 by the Community Development Department and financed by the General Fund. To the extent available, the Redevelopment Agency may use redevelopment funds for this program.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
2-15
Land Use Element (continued)
Development Controls
The primary tools for regulating changes in land uses in the City are the Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance. The City shall continue to implement the General Plan land use policies and the Zoning Ordinance. This will provide for the development of the desired land uses throughout the City. In order to implement the Land Use Plan, the City shall add standards in the Zoning Ordinance which provide development incentives, density bonuses, and incentive requirements for the assembly of residential lots. The assembly of lots will eliminate the development constraints posed by the existing long, narrow lots. Standards for regulating adult businesses and bingo parlors shall also be incorporated into the Zoning Ordinance. Towards this end, these uses are now incompatible with the General Plan. The new zoning standards shall be developed starting in 1992 by the Community Development Department, and financed by the General Fund, to the extent available. Implementation of the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance are ongoing programs in the City.
Consistency Reviews
After adoption of the revised General Plan and other General Plan amendments, the City needs to review the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map for consistency with the General Plan land use policies. Also, it shall review existing City ordinances for consistency with the General Plan land use policy and evaluate the consistency of proposed ordinances with the General Plan prior to adoption. The primary consistency review will be initiated in 1992 by the Community Development Department. It will be financed through the General Fund, to the extent available.
Development Review
The City shall continue to review proposed projects for compliance with existing City ordinances before the projects are approved. Pre-application meetings with developers are encouraged to help inform developers of City requirements and standards before beginning the formal application process. This will establish a cooperative relationship between the City and the developer, and help to promote the development of quality projects.
During the application process, the City shall continue to analyze the potential environmental impacts of a project, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). This includes the evaluation of impacts on earth, air quality, water quality, plant and animal life, noise, light and glare, natural resources, risk of upset, land use, population, housing, traffic, public services, energy, utilities, human health, aesthetics, recreation, and cultural resources. Mitigation measures shall be developed for identified adverse impacts and made as conditions of approval for the project. A mitigation monitoring program shall also be developed to ensure mitigation measures are implemented. This is an ongoing program by the Community Development Department, as financed through the General Fund and through development application fees.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
2-16
Land Use Element (continued)
Design Guidelines
The City shall develop design guidelines for new development and make copies readily available to developers. The guidelines shall outline the general principles of design and planning that the City would like to see in projects. This may include architectural treatments and styles, building facades, public spaces, parking lot layouts, landscaping concepts, grading techniques, buffers, exterior lighting, signs, utility areas, setbacks, compatibility with adjacent structures, and other design characteristics. Because of overcrowding problems in the City, larger dwelling units through incentives shall be explored. The guidelines shall be used in the design review of proposed developments. They will promote quality development and reduce City development review time. The Community Development Department shall develop the guidelines in 1993.
Community Participation
The City shall continue to encourage community participation in all city programs. It shall encourage residents to attend City Council and Planning Commission meetings or keep them informed of City programs and activities. Active community participation provides the City with information on the concerns and interests of residents and helps the City develop programs that are more responsive to these needs. Community participation also raises the level of awareness of residents and tends to encourage cooperation with City programs. It can even promote voluntary efforts for the improvement of the community. This is an ongoing activity by the Community Services Department and financed by the General Fund. Promotional Campaign
Because development in the City depends primarily on private investment, it is important that the City work with area developers and investors to promote land recycling and rehabilitation projects. The City shall encourage new investment in the City through promotional campaigns to local developers and businesses. It shall also encourage the development of high quality housing on vacant and underutilized lots by disseminating information on the development potential of individual lots in the City. The Community Development Department and the Redevelopment Agency shall establish this program in 1994 with the General Fund and redevelopment funds, to the extent available.
RESIDENTIAL AREAS
The preservation of residential neighborhoods in the City can be accomplished through the provision of support services and infrastructure that are necessary to provide a comfortable and interesting community life to residents. Aside from the programs above (Rehabilitation, Code Enforcement, Design Guidelines, Community Participation and Redevelopment), other programs to achieve the policies regarding the City's residential areas are discussed below.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
2-17
Land Use Element (continued)
Beautification Program
The City shall initiate a Beautification Program for the City’s residential neighborhoods. This will involve the removal of graffiti, landscape installation, tree planting, trash removal, regular yard upkeep, and other activities that will help improve the aesthetic quality of public places and private yards in the City. It may include a more active program of City maintenance of existing sidewalks and parkways, along with volunteer efforts for day-long "cleaning" projects, and individual maintenance of street trees abutting each property. Also, the City shall encourage the landscaping and maintenance of residential front yards along heavily used streets such as Santa Ana, Clara and Wilcox Streets. The beautification program shall be initiated in 1993 by the Department of Community Services and funded by the General Fund, to the extent available.
Home Ownership Program
The City has a very high rental population. Almost 80 percent of the housing stock is occupied by renter households. This may be contributing to the low citizen participation in City programs and the disregard for property. The City shall encourage the development of single family residences for home ownership rather than rental purposes. This may be promoted by assisting local residents to buy their dwellings through the formation of a resident association or with the help of local non-profit agencies. This program shall be established by the Community Services Department in 1995 and financed with the General Fund. The Redevelopment Agency shall use redevelopment funds for this program, to the extent available.
Public Service Provision
The City shall continue to coordinate the provision of the necessary public services (sewer, parks, storm drainage, fire protection, police protection, and other city services) to all areas of the City, in order to maintain and support existing developments. Because of the costs associated with service provision, the City shall regularly review facility fees and charges to ensure that they are equitable and reflect the costs associated with the service provision for new developments. Also, it shall request local law enforcement officials and the County Fire Department to review proposed development plans. In this way, local law enforcement officials and the Fire Department can recommend measures that will decrease the potential for fire and crime and facilitate emergency response. Public service provision and inter-department review is an ongoing program by the Community Development Department and the Department of Community Services and funded by the General Fund, to the extent available.

Recreation Areas
The provision of recreation areas will enhance the quality of life. With the high density developments in Cudahy and the lack of vacant land for parks, it is important that individual residential projects provide public or private open space areas for recreational use. The City shall continue to require the provision of recreational areas within multi-family developments. The Community Development Department is implementing this program with funding from developer fees and the General Fund.
Truck Traffic
Truck traffic from industrial areas in the City and surrounding communities leads to congestion and safety concerns in Cudahy’s residential neighborhoods. The City shall discourage trucks and through traffic from using residential streets by posting signs on designated truck routes. The Department of Building and Public Services will begin this program in 1994 with the General Fund, to the extent that resources are available.
COMMERCIAL AREAS
The City’s commercial areas need to be consolidated and interrelated to promote shopping at a variety of stores. Rehabilitation efforts need to be increased to make the area a more attractive commercial destination and to increase the economic base of the City. Programs for Cudahy’s commercial areas are discussed below.
Business Development
It is in the City’s best interest to be involved in the revitalization of businesses in Cudahy. It shall encourage local businesses and developers to invest in commercial developments along Atlantic Avenue through promotional materials to area chambers of commerce and other business organizations. This may lead to private rehabilitation projects and the acceleration of commercial revitalization in the area. The Redevelopment Agency shall initiate this program in 1994 with redevelopment funds, to the extent available. Development Review
With the standard development review process discussed earlier, proposed commercial developments shall be subject to site plan, design and environmental review. Compliance with parking, landscaping, lighting and other standards will be examined, as well as the project’s impacts on traffic, air quality, adjacent uses and public services. This is an ongoing program by the Community Development Department as financed by the General Fund, to the extent available.

Buffers
The City shall develop standards for the buffering or landscaping of proposed commercial developments where they abut residential uses, to help prevent impacts from traffic, noise, and light. The buffering requirements would be incorporated into the development review of proposed projects. The Community Development Department shall implement this program in 1993 through conditions of approval on new developments.
Street Improvements
The City shall study the advantages and disadvantages of constructing a raised landscape median strip along Atlantic Avenue to improve traffic flow and safety in the City. This program shall be implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services in 1993 and financed by the General Fund and gas tax funds.
Atlantic Avenue Plan
Atlantic Avenue is the only commercial corridor in the City and serves as the main entryway to the City. The City shall work with local businesses to develop a building facade plan for Atlantic Avenue. This may require technical and financial assistance from the Redevelopment Agency. The Atlantic Avenue Plan shall be initiated in 1995 by the Redevelopment Agency and funded by redevelopment funds, to the extent available.
Sign Ordinance
The City shall implement the sign ordinance to limit visual clutter in the City. This applies primarily to the commercial uses on Atlantic Avenue. Non-conforming signs shall be identified and termination periods set for the future elimination of these signs. The Community Development Department shall be responsible for implementing this program, which will be started in 1992 with the General Fund, to the extent available.
INDUSTRIAL AREAS
Industrial areas in the southern section of the City have been designated as Commercial Manufacturing to allow both commercial and industrial developments. This will encourage the recycling of land for commercial uses or light industry and the strengthening of the City’s economic base. The programs that will promote rehabilitation and recycling of industrial areas include redevelopment, code enforcement, design guidelines, development review and non-conforming uses, as discussed above. Other programs are provided below.

Industrial Development
Together with promotional campaigns and business development, the City shall encourage light industrial developments in Cudahy through promotional and informational campaigns to major developers and investors. The City shall also inquire into companies needing small warehouses and other non-technical industries and encourage them to locate in Cudahy. This can lead to the redevelopment of older industrial uses in the City, the removal of negative impacts on adjacent uses and the increase in employment opportunities. This program shall be initiated in 1994 by the City Manager and the Redevelopment Agency with redevelopment funds and the General Fund.
Industrial Rehabilitation
In order to promote the rehabilitation of smaller and older industrial land use in the City, the Redevelopment Agency shall provide the necessary technical support and incentives. It shall also submit the names of small local industries, who could benefit from equipment or industrial process modernization to the SCAQMD for the distribution of information regarding compliance with Regulation 13. This program shall be started in 1993 by the Community Development Department and funded by the General Fund. The Redevelopment Agency shall work with the City and property owners to promote the rehabilitation of smaller and older industrial land uses in Cudahy.
PARKS AND RECREATION
The provision of parks and recreation areas in the City will create opportunities for relaxation, leisure and recreation. They help improve the living environment and make Cudahy a more attractive residential location. They also provide open space areas to lower the density of developments. Programs for the provision and development of parks in the City are discussed below.
Recreational Programs
The City has ongoing recreational programs for residents. They include ongoing sports, classes, excursions and other activities for children, adults and the elderly. The City shall continue to improve recreational facilities and programs at existing parks to better serve residents. This is the responsibility of the Department of Building and Public Services and funded by the General Fund and the Quimby Act.

acquisition program and cooperative agreements with other agencies in park development. All future park facilities shall be developed in accordance with the plan. The Parks Master Plan shall be developed in 1993 by the Parks and Recreation Commission and the Department of Community Services, and shall be funded by the General Fund, to the extent available.
Joint Use Agreements
School sites provide potential sources of recreational facilities. The City shall work with the LAUSD in making school facilities available for public use after school hours. It shall also establish joint use/maintenance agreements with the LAUSD for future recreational facilities, where appropriate. This program shall be initiated by the Department of Community Services whenever the opportunity presents itself and will be funded by the General Fund, to the extent available.
Park Designation
The Land Use Plan designation existing City parks as Public areas. This will help prevent the conversion of parks to other urban uses. The City will continue to designate public parks and open space areas in the Land Use Plan as they are acquired and/or developed to prevent their change to other uses. This will be the responsibility of the Community Development Department and funded by the General Fund, to the extent available.
PUBLIC SERVICES
Public services to serve existing and future developments will continued to be provided by the City. Specific programs to achieve this goal are discussed below.
School Services
The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) provides educational services to the City of Cudahy and surrounding areas. The City shall coordinate with the LAUSD on the provision of school services in the area. It shall inform the LAUSD of proposed developments to permit LAUSD to determine the future impacts on school services and the measures needed to maintain the services offered by LAUSD to city residents. This is an ongoing program by the Community Development Department and is funded by the General Fund, to the extent available.
The City shall also promote continuing education programs at the LAUSD for area residents. It shall have copies of school requirements, schedules and contact persons readily available at City Hall. This will be implemented by the Department of Community Services in 1992 and funded by the General Fund.

Service Capacity
The City shall develop a system for service capacity monitoring to ensure that adequate utility capacity exists to accommodate new developments. This may include requiring service commitment letters from utility companies prior to development approval. It shall coordinate with the County Sanitation District and the County Department of Public Works on sewer and storm drain line capacity and utilization. It shall also establish a monitoring network with the local water companies for water service requirements. Garbage collection services in the City shall also be monitored for adequacy. This program will be implemented by the Community Development Department and the Department of Building and Public Services. It will be funded by the General Fund, to the extent available. Capital Improvement Program

a recreation building. This program shall be implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services. General Funds shall be used for implementation costs, to the extent available.
Water Companies
The City shall explore the feasibility of joining the three water companies serving Cudahy. This may create greater efficiencies and standardization in water services. A more aggressive water conservation program can also be developed with a single entity or when cooperative agreements between the companies are in place. The City may also consider the feasibility of acquiring the water companies, as a means of coordinating local water services. This program shall be initiated by the Department of Building and Public Services in 1994 through the General Fund, to the extent available.
Institutional Reuse
The City shall encourage area schools, churches, libraries and other institutional uses which are declared surplus or are determined to be no longer needed, to be reused as other needed institutional uses. This will allow the City to maintain public areas that serve local residents. This program shall be implemented by the Community Development Department starting 1992 and will be financed by the General Fund, to the extent available.
Utility Line Undergrounding
The City shall continue to require new utility lines to be underground and shall work with utility companies for the undergrounding of existing overhead utility lines. This program shall be made in accordance with Rule 20 A of the Public Utilities Commission. It shall be initiated in 1993 by the Department of Building and Public Services and funded by the Rule 20 A fund and the General Fund, to the extent available.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Economic development in the City of Cudahy can be achieved through programs which encourage private spending and investment in local businesses. The City can attract a larger population into the area by improving the availability, convenience, attraction, and range of services provided by local merchants. Also, an aggressive advertising campaign on the presence of businesses in the City will increase patronage of Cudahy businesses. Programs for economic development include Business Development, Atlantic Avenue Plan, Industrial Development, rehabilitation programs, and other programs discussed earlier, as well as the ones listed below.

To promote the interests of commercial businesses along Atlantic Avenue, the City shall encourage local businesses to form an Atlantic Avenue Association for the revitalization of the area. The association shall consist of local businessmen and city staff. They shall formulate programs for the improvement of the Atlantic Avenue corridor and the increase in business activity in the area. This program shall be initiated by the Redevelopment Agency in 1994 with the use of redevelopment funds, to the extent available. Assessments may also be levied on participating businesses to finance public improvements such as parking facilities, benches, trash receptacles, street lighting, decorative parks and fountains and to promote activities that benefit businesses along Atlantic Avenue.
Business Fund
The Redevelopment Agency is authorized to establish a fund to assist in business development in the City. The fund shall be used for the economic equivalent of low interest loans and grants for facade improvements, small business development, expansion and rehabilitation projects and other activities which will promote the commercial revitalization of the City. This program shall be initiated in 1994 with the use of redevelopment funds. Atlantic Avenue Improvements
The City shall identify capital improvement projects needed along Atlantic Avenue and include them in the City’s Capital Improvement Program or make them part of the Atlantic Avenue Plan, street improvements or other projects developed by the Atlantic Avenue Association.

SECTION 3: HOUSING ELEMENT PROFILE REPORT
INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element Profile Report discusses the issues and opportunities concerning housing in the City of Cudahy. In order to adequately house all residents of Cudahy, there must be a match between the type of housing needed and the available housing stock. The existing housing needs and resources of the City are analyzed in this report.
The Housing Element Profile Report discusses the population and housing characteristics of the City. This includes the age distribution, race, disability, income, household size, and groups with special housing needs. Also, the existing housing stock, overcrowding, tenure, overpayment, housing conditions are discussed. This will help determine the housing needs of residents in terms of housing types, affordability, number of units, special construction, assistance, and other factors. An analysis of the constraints to the development of affordable housing is also provided.
Data and information on population and housing characteristics were derived from the most recent studies available. This included the 1990 census, the Department of Finance Annual Population and Housing Estimates and data from various local agencies. Until the full results of the 1990 Census is made available, the most comprehensive source is the 1980 U.S. Census. For those issues where no more current data was available, the 1980 U.S. Census was used. In order to avoid confusion, proportional estimates are made for 1990 based on percentages prevailing in 1980.
Estimates by SCAG for the City’s 2010 population have been surpassed. Thus, information from SCAG is limited to the housing needs of Cudahy as provided in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment.
The City of Cudahy is a relatively new City but is predominantly developed and built out. It incorporated only 30 years ago. But by then it had almost 80 percent of the land area developed. The City’s 1.07 square mile area is largely developed with residential land uses. Commercial activities are concentrated along Atlantic Avenue with scattered commercial sites at street intersections throughout the City. Industrial uses are located near the railroad tracks, on the southern sections of the City.
POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
In 1970, the City had a population of 16,998 persons. In 1980, the census estimated the population at 17,984 persons and the 1990 census estimates the population at 22,830

persons. This is a 6 percent growth from 1970 to 1980 and a 27 percent growth from 1980 to 1990. Table 3-1 summarizes population growth in the City since 1960.

Growth was greatest in the 1950’s when California and Los Angeles were the popular migration destinations for residents of other states. The population growth of Cudahy in recent years may be attributed to the migration of young Hispanic families into the area. Close family ties and racial agglomeration has led to the continued increase in the City’s population.
With limited areas for additional growth, Cudahy is expected to grow at a lesser rate in the future. Assuming a growth similar to that observed from 1970 to 1980 (6 percent), Cudahy may have 24,150 residents in the year 2000.
The City is made up of Census Tracts 5343, 5344.01 and 5344.02. The 1990 Census estimates for Cudahy show that 7,894 persons reside within Census Tract 5343; 8,551 persons within Census Tract 5344.01 and 6,385 persons within Census Tract 5344.02. The lower population in Census Tract 5344.02 is due to its smaller lots and total land area. Table 3-2 shows the population and percentage breakdown of Cudahy by census tract.

Age
In the 1970 and 1980 census reports, the largest age group of Cudahy residents was school age children less than 20 years old. The median age for the City was 21.9 years old in 1980, compared to the County’s median age of 29.8 years old. This shows that the City has a large percentage of children and young adults than other areas in the County.
The elderly population consisted of 7.6 percent of the total population in 1970. In 1980, persons aged 65 and over represented only 4.8 percent of the total population. A decreasing elderly population is observed as young adults migrate to the City while elderly persons may be leaving the area. Table 3-2 and Exhibit 3-1 summarizes the 1980 age data.

Assuming the same proportions for the 1990 population of 22,830 persons, there would be 10,570 school age children, 8,675 persons aged 20 to 44, 2,489 persons aged 45 to 64 and 1,096 persons aged 65 and older.
According to preliminary estimates from the 1990 census, Cudahy had 14,116 persons (61.83 percent of the population) aged 18 and older. This means that the children make up 38.17 percent of the population. This is lower than the 1980 proportion and may be due to a lower birth rate, an aging population, and less families with young children.
Race and Ethnicity
Cudahy has a predominantly Hispanic population. In 1970, 4,536 persons were of Spanish language or surname. In 1980, 69.55 percent or 12,508 persons were of Hispanic origin. In 1990, this percentage has increased to 88.9 percent (20,293 persons). Table 3-4 provides the breakdown of race and ethnicity by census tract.

The Hispanic majority has resulted in White, Black, American Indian and Asian minority groups. The Cudahy area held a large American Indian population in the 1960’s. Today, American Indians represent less than 1 percent of the population. Census Tracts 5344.02 and 5343 had higher percentages of White persons than the city average. Census Tract 5343 had a higher percentage of Black persons and a lower percentage of American Indians than the City average. Asians represented a higher percentage in Census tract 5344.01.

The trend in the racial distribution of the City is towards increasing Hispanic populations. While the city had 69.9 percent of its population as Hispanic in 1980, it now has 88.9 percent of the population as persons of Hispanic origin. Table 3-5 provides the change in race and ethnicity from 1980 to 1990. Exhibit 3-1 shows the race compositions for 1980 and 1990.

Disability
Disabled persons are identified as those with visual and hearing impairments and mental handicaps. Information on disabled residents in Cudahy was taken from the 1980 Census. Persons limited in mobility were also identified by the 1980 Census. These persons have special housing needs such as ramps instead of stairs, modified bathrooms, lower cabinets and shelves and wider doorways. Although new housing units are required to be accessible to the handicapped, existing units are not likely to be designed for disabled residents.
Table 3-6 (which is based on 1980 Census statistics) shows that approximately 934 persons with work disabilities and 410 persons with public transportation disabilities were living in Cudahy in 1980. Of the elderly population, 20.6 percent had public transportation disabilities. Almost 43 percent of the residents with public transportation disabilities were in Census Tract 5344.01.

Source: 1980 U.S. Census.		
Assuming percentages of disabled persons have remained the same since 1980, there would be 1,186 persons with work disabilities in 1990. Of these, 893 persons would be prevented from working. Also, 521 persons would have public transportation disabilities of which 225 would be persons aged 65 or over.
Homelessness
The homelessness crisis has become a national concern. The causes for homelessness in Southern California may be attributed to the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, drug and alcohol abuse, economic displacement, lack of affordable housing and domestic violence. Services and support for the homeless have not been adequate to help all persons. The length of lines and waiting lists with each service provider attests to the fact that the homelessness problem is not a temporary phenomena. In an effort to assist the homeless population, the State of California has mandated that housing elements analyze and address the homelessness problem in each locality.
Homeless persons are generally not seen in Cudahy. This may be due to the lack of homeless services in the City. Person seeking assistance are referred to the Department of Public Social Services on Atlantic Avenue and local community services (Chicano Service Action Center, Human Services Association) in neighboring cities.
The nearest homeless shelter is the Bell Homeless Shelter at Mansfield Way (see Exhibit 3-3). The shelter was opened in 1988 by the Salvation Army and provides 250 beds in

Housing Element Profile Report continued
winter and 150 beds in summer. There are fewer persons looking for shelter in summer due to the favorable weather at night. The winter colds have resulted in overcapacity at the shelter with a maximum of 318 persons at one time. Twenty percent of the persons served are female and eighty percent are male. No children are served by the shelter.
Walk-in persons are not entertained at the shelter, rather the Salvation Army has pick-up points in Hollywood, Eastmont, Huntington Park, Compton, Maywood, Long Beach and downtown Los Angeles. At these points, homeless individuals are gathered in the afternoon and brought to the shelter for dinner, bed and breakfast. By morning, the homeless are brought back to their pick-up points. The nearest pick-up point for persons in Cudahy is at 2965 E. Gage Avenue in Huntington Park.
Aside from food and a place to stay the night, the Bell Shelter offers counselling services, legal advice, social security income assistance, religious advice, social activities and games. A maximum stay of 60 days is permitted for people who are looking for work, are working or are in training classes.
HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
The City of Cudahy had 5,071 households in 1980. In 1990, the Department of Finance estimates 5,339 households in the City. This is a 5.3 percent increase in ten years or approximately 27 new households per year.
Large Households and Overcrowding
In Cudahy, the average hop^ehold size in 1980 was 3.5 persons per household. The Department of Finance estimates a higher household size for 1990 at 3.8 persons per household. Compared to /the Los Angeles County average household size of 2.7 and 2.8 persons per household for 1980 and 1990 respectively, the City of Cudahy has continued to have larger households/EhatJiie rest of the County. A trend toward even larger households in the future is seen. Thismay be due to the Hispanic majority population who have close family ties and prefer more children than the average American household.
Large households are households that have 5 or more members. An increase in the number of persons in a household is often the addition of children and does not necessarily increase the earning capacity of the household. This brings on a need for large but inexpensive housing. Large households often require larger dwelling units which may not be readily available in the community.
City of Cudahy General Plan
Profile Reports
3-7
Housing Element Profile Report continued
In 1980, there were 1,443 large households in the City or 28.5 percent of the total households. Census Tracts 5343 and 5344.01 had percentages of large households greater than 28.5 percent (see Exhibit 3-4). Assuming proportional growth of large households, there would be 1,522 large households in 1990.
When large households do not find appropriate housing, overcrowding results. Also, overcrowding occurs whenever there is an insufficient supply of suitably-sized housing for the households who need it. The Census defines overcrowding as units with 1.01 or more persons per room. The 1980 Census reported that 1,604 households in the City of Cudahy lived in overcrowded conditions in 1980. This represented 31.6 percent of all occupied units. Exhibit 3-5 shows the 1980 overcrowding concentrations in the City. Census tract 5344.01 had 33.4 percent of its households living in overcrowded conditions. This tract also had a higher percentage of large households and school age children. With nearly a third (31.6 percent) of the households in overcrowded conditions, garage conversions and the addition of back units have been common in the city.
Female-headed Households
In 1980, there were 993 female-headed households representing 19.6 percent of the total households in the City. Of these, 523 female-headed households were below poverty level and 497 households had children below 18 years of age. Using proportional growth, approximately 1,045 female headed households could be residing in Cudahy in 1990, 550 of them below poverty level and 523 households with children below 18 years of age. Because of limited income and added responsibility, female-headed households present a special housing need. They require affordable housing that are near schools and day care centers. Minority Households
The trend toward increasing Hispanic populations in the region has been more pronounced in the residential neighborhoods of Cudahy. The majority of households in Cudahy are made up of persons with Hispanic origins. There were 368 owner households in 1980 and 2,578 renter households who were Hispanic in origin. These represent 7.3 percent and 50.8 percent of the total households respectively. Minority households consisting of White, Black, American Indian and Asian households represented 41.9 percent of the total households. Assuming the same proportions with 1990 households, there would be 3,102 Hispanic households (58.1 percent) out of 5,339 households in the City.

Elderly Households
Elderly households need housing assistance because they frequently have fixed incomes (social security) which cannot accommodate rent increases or major home repairs. The 1980 Census reported 266 households in Cudahy were headed by person 65 years or older. Of these households, 24 households had incomes below the federally defined poverty level. With proportional estimates for 1990, 280 households would be elderly and 25 would have incomes below poverty level.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers have special housing needs because they need affordable housing near places of work on a seasonal basis only. There were 44 farmworkers in the City of Cudahy in 1980. This was 0.7 percent of the labor force and included jobs in gardening, landscape maintenance, greenhouses and nurseries and stables. Cudahy currently does not have any remaining agricultural use, nor are neighboring cities engaged in agricultural production Thus, farmworkers are not expected to be residents of the City at this time. Migrant laborers may permanently reside in the City when they are not in the field. As such, they do not present a special housing need to the City.
Household Income
The City’s median household income in 1980 was $11,216. This is 64 percent of the Los Angeles County average of $17,551. Cudahy was within the low income category (50 to 80 percent of the County median income) in 1980. Almost 39 percent of the households had very low incomes (less than $8,775); 22.2 percent had low income (between $8,775 and $14,041); 19.7 percent had moderate incomes (between $21,061 and $14,041) and 19.2 percent of the households were within the high income limit. All census tracts had median incomes within the low income category. Also, 1,133 households had incomes below the poverty level. This is approximately 29.5 percent of all households in the City.
While Census Tract 5344.01 had 37 percent of the lower income households (very low and low income households) in the City, a higher percentage of lower income households were found in Census Tract 5343 (64.8 percent) than the City as a whole (60.8 percent). Also, Census Tract 5343 had a greater percentage of households below the poverty level. Table 3-7 and Exhibit 3-6 show the breakdown of households by income category.

Estimates from market profile reports on the area show that Cudahy has a median income of $17,967 in 1990. Compared to the County median income of $38,900, the City’s median income is 46 percent of the County median income. Thus, Cudahy has become a very low income City since 1980. Census Tract 5343 has the lowest median income at $16,636 and the only tract with an income lower than the City average. Census Tract 5344.01 has a median income of $18,321 and Census Tract 5344.02 has $19,017.
The median income of households in Census Tract 5344.02 was higher than the City average in 1980. This same census tract had a higher percentage of elderly persons. Today, it continues to have a median income that is higher than the two other census tracts.
Low income households require housing with low rents and payments below market rate housing. Often, payment assistance is needed from local, state and federal governmental agencies to assist these households in getting adequate housing. Programs available for housing assistance should be taken advantage by the City of Cudahy to provide its residents with affordable housing.

Public Assistance
The 1980 Census reported 1,131 households were receiving public assistance and 849 households had social security income. The total of persons receiving public assistance and having social security incomes represented 11 percent of the population.
As of December 1990, the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) stated that 4,617 households in the City of Cudahy were receiving public assistance. Approximately 33 percent of these persons lived in Census Tract 5343; 41 percent in Census Tract 54344.01 and 26 percent in Census Tract 5344.02. Table 3-8 shows the breakdown of public assistance for Cudahy residents.

Employment
The labor force in Cudahy for 1980 consisted of 6,235 persons, of which 5,540 persons or 88.9 percent were employed. Table 3-9 provides a breakdown of employees by job type. The majority of residents are blue collar workers. Jobs in the manufacturing sector were held by 3,461 employees or 62.5 percent of the labor force. Approximately 18 percent were in the wholesale and retail trade and only 394 persons or 7 percent of the labor force were in the professional occupations.

Approximately 35.2 percent of the labor force in the manufacturing sector lived in Census Tract 5344.02 while 44.8 percent of the professional workers in the City resided in Census Tract 5344.01.
Information of the job opportunities in the City in 1984 showed that there were approximately 1,995 jobs, 813 of which were in the manufacturing sector. The percentage of jobs in manufacturing (40.8 percent) is due to the presence of industrial areas south of the City and large industrial bases in the surrounding cities of Huntington Park, South Gate, Vernon and Commerce. There were no agricultural or mining jobs in the City, and 15.8 percent of the jobs were in the service sector.
The commuting patterns of residents could be inferred from the location of nearby industrial sites. Residents are likely to be employed in the manufacturing businesses in surrounding cities. A dependable public transportation system by the Southern California Rapid transit District runs through the City which allows residents to go to schools, jobs, and support services in and around the City. The Transportation Element Profile Report discusses circulation and transportation in greater detail.
HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
The City’s housing stock in 1970 numbered 5,467 units, 5,259 in 1980 and 5,417 in 1990. An decrease in housing units was experienced from 1970 - 1980. This may have been due to the demolition of units before new construction is in place. From 1980 - 1990, the stock

Profile Reports

Housing Element Profile Report continued
increased by 158 units. This is a 3 percent growth over 10 years. The slow growth is expected with the majority of the land area fully developed. New housing is often through the recycling and redevelopment projects of lots to higher density uses.
The Department of Finance (DOF) estimates a larger housing stock (5,665 units) than the 1990 census (5,417 units). Part of the difference may be the acquisition and demolition of 145 dwelling units for the construction of a new junior high school near Elizabeth Street School between the time of the January DOF estimate and the July 1990 Census. Another factor in the difference may be the construction of units at the back of existing units which may not have been counted in the Census survey.
The Department of Finance estimates the Cudahy housing stock to be primarily single family units (44.9 percent) and large multi-family units with 5 units or more (39.0 percent). There are 14 mobile home (trailer) parks in the City providing a total of 345 units.
Housing growth from 1980 to 1990 was greatest with 2 to 4 attached units. Single-family units decrease by 2.8 percent and large multi-family developments increase only slightly. The increase in mobile homes is insignificant between 1980 and 1990. Table 3-10 shows the breakdown of the housing stock for 1980 and 1990 and indicates the change in stock distribution within the ten-year period.
Mobile homes in the City represent a larger share of the housing stock than mobile homes in Los Angeles County (1.5 percent). In Cudahy, they have been a stable source of affordable housing for decades. Recent legislation in the City has granted permanent status to mobile home parks (they are now considered permanent housing units, instead of temporary or transitional housing).
New developments in the City include condominium projects and single family units on recycled lots. From 1990 to 1991, 59 single family units were approved for construction plus 45 condominium units and 15 room additions. The housing stock has increased by at least 104 units from 1990.

The breakdown of housing stock by census tract in 1980 and 1990 is provided in Table 3-11. The loss of housing units in Census Tract 5344.01 would be due to the demolition of 145 units to construct the new junior high school. The increase in stock within Census Tract 5343 is evidenced by the addition of back units on single family lots.

concerns for residents. The City has developed more stringent standards for hotels and motels to address this problem.
Tenure
Cudahy’s housing units are mainly renter-occupied (78.6 percent) even though the type of housing is predominantly single family units (44.9 percent). Table 3-12 provides the tenure by census tract in 1980 and Exhibit 3-7 shows the concentration of owner-occupied in Census Tract 5344.02 and renter occupied housing units in Census Tract 5344.01. Owner-occupied units are concentrated in the same census tract as those with a large percentage of elderly households and higher income households. Renters are found in Census Tract 5344.01 where large households, overcrowding and school age children are predominant.
The development of multi-family housing in the City jvrfl continue to keep the majority of residents as renters. Property owners who do not <$ccupiecj)their units would generally have less regard for the maintenance and condition of houSiagunits. Renters, on the other hand, have very little incentive to spend for the rehabilitation of units that will not have a tangible return on investment.
The City should encourage the maintenance of housing units, through strict property maintenance enforcement, low-interest renter improvement loan, and other incentives.

Age and Condition
Housing age is a factor for determining the need for rehabilitation. Without proper maintenance, housing units are most likely to deteriorate over time. Also, older houses are not built to current building standards for fire and earthquake safety. The 1980 census showed that the majority of the city’s housing stock was built from 1950 to 1969. This

coincides with the development boom in Southern California. More than 1,660 of the houses were built in the 1950’s making them 32 to 41 years old by now. These older units are found throughout the City. Relatively new housing, built from 1980 to the present represent only 4.6 percent of the current stock.

A survey of the housing stock was conducted in late March and early April 1991. This included observation of exterior facades of housing units and yards. Because the lots were deep, units further at the back of the lots were not surveyed, it was assumed that the condition of the front unit would be representative of the condition of all back units. There are approximately 1,189 residential lots in the City. With a total of 5,417 housing units, the average density is 4.6 units per lot.
The survey showed that many of the housing units in the City are in need of repair. This could be directly related to the age of the housing stock (32 to 41 years old). Approximately 119 lots had units with uneven or flaking paintwork and 47 lots had units with stucco or sidings in disrepair. This is 14 percent of all properties in the City. Fifteen properties were identified to have units with faulty roofs and 75 had units with roof trims that showed signs of peeling. Three properties had units with damaged doors. Also, there were 23 properties with garages showing major damages and 22 with fences in need of repair.
There were 109 properties which needed yard maintenance and 46 had unsightly trash in their front or side yards. Driveways on 103 properties were in bad condition as well. While
City of Cudahy General Plan
Profile Reports

yards, trash and driveways do not have a direct relation to the condition of the unit, it presents a negative image of the neighborhood. A number of units were identified which required maintenance beyond the norm<il upkeep. These were units which had four or more items in need of repair, that cumulatively added to the decrepit look of the units.
Exhibit 3-8 shows the general location of units in need of rehabilitation. Lots in the eastern and western sections of the City had units in need of repair more than the lots in the central section. Because the lots in the eastern section are deeper and more likely to have more units, this area would have a higher percentage of units in need of rehabilitation.
Vacancy
The availability of vacant housing units provides households continued choices on different unit types to accommodate their changing needs. (Single persons, newly-married couples and elderly households need smaller units than households with school age children.) Vacant units also serve as a damper to market rents and prices. The 1990 Department of Finance estimates show a vacancy rate of 5.74 percent. This seems adequate to meet the vacancy needs of the City.
But the Regional Housing Needs Assessment by the Southern California Association of Governments estimates the 1987 vacancy rate of Cudahy at 2.4 percent. This is lower than the ideal rate of 3.6 percent overall or 2 percent of single family unit and 5 percent for multi-family units. Thus, approximately 70 vacant units are needed in the City to increase vacancy rates to 3.6 percent (ideal).
Housing Costs and Rents
The affordability of housing is a major factor in the provision of adequate shelter. In 1980, the median housing value of an owner-occupied home was $63,600 with a mortgage of $294 and the median gross rent was $265. Neighboring cities had housing values greater than and less than those in Cudahy but gross rents in Cudahy were highest. Table 3-14 shows housing costs and rents in the area.

Data from documentary transfer taxes show that existing homes in Bell, Compton, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Lynwood and South Gate have a median price of $125,000 to $155,000 and condominiums are at $81,000. This is a slight decrease in last year’s prices, owing to the housing slump in early 1991. The median price for new homes cannot be derived because there were very few sales to reflect a reliable housing value. Information from area developers indicate that 3 bedroom units with 1,400 square feet of floor area sell for $225,000 to $235,000. Units with less than 1,200 square feet sell for approximately $200,000.
A limited survey of rents in 1991 showed that the average rent for a one-bedroom unit is $485 and the median is $495. Table 3-15 shows rental average and median rents in 1991.

Comparison with the maximum rent that HUD will subsidize for lower income households show that rents in Cudahy are lower for all unit types. This could mean that more than half of the housing units in the city are affordable for lower income households and that there are opportunities for residents to use Federal Section 8 rent assistance on housing voucher programs.
The higher rents in Cudahy compared to adjacent cities may be attributed to low vacancy rates in the City and the large transient population. With a high demand for rental housing, rental properties are able to raise their prices to meet the highest bidder.
Overpayment
Overpayment is defined as having less than 80 percent of the regional median income and paying more than 30 percent of one’s income for housing. When low income households have to pay high rents, less money is available for food, medicine and clothing needs. Also, overpayment limits the money available for home improvement projects. Almost 70 percent or 3,657 households in the City were earning less than $20,000 and 50 percent of these were overpaying in 1980. Table 3-16 summarizes housing expenditures in 1980.

Households with lower incomes are more likely to be overpaying for housing. More than half of the renters in Cudahy who are earning less than $20,000 are paying 30 percent or more of their incomes for housing. Census Tracts 5343 and 5344.01 have a greater percentage of households who are overpaying compared to the City as a whole. Exhibit 3-9 shows overpayment concentrations. These census tracts are same ones with large households.
Existing Housing Need
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment prepared by SCAG identified the existing housing need of Cudahy for 1989 based on overpayment. Table 3-17 summarizes existing housing needs.

There are 3,343 households in 1988 who were considered lower income and 1,809 of these were overpaying. More than one-third of the households in Cudahy are currently overpaying for housing and need some form of payment assistance. The majority of these overpaying households are renters. Rental subsidies can lessen the number of overpaying households in the City. Such programs should be encouraged to alleviate overpayment.
Cudahy’s households make up 0.2 percent of the County’s households but the existing housing need represents 0.3 percent of Los Angeles County’s total existing housing needs. Thus, Cudahy has an unproportionate share of lower income households and overpaying households.
As of February 1991, the City had 132 households who were participating in the Los Angeles County Section 8 program. Clara Street Commons, a senior housing project provides housing for 49 of these households.
Future Housing Need
SCAG also projected future housing needs of cities in the region based on estimated household growth, vacancy adjustments, and demolition adjustments. Revised numbers for Cudahy shows that the City will need 232 new housing units by 1994. These units will accommodate the projected growth of 142 households, 40 units for vacancy adjustments and 50 units to replace estimated demolitions.

Cudahy’s 232 future housing need represents only 0.2 percent of the county’s future housing needs. The share is relative to the small size of the City and the lack of vacant sites. Publicly Assisted Housing Projects
The City of Cudahy has two publicly-assisted housing projects with a total of 126 units as listed in Table 3-19. The projects are both located on Elizabeth Street (see Exhibit 3-11) and have been provided low interest loans and rental assistance payments in return for providing affordable housing units in the City. The developments have subsidy terminations within the next five years through the expiration of the contract with the Department of Housing and Urban Development or by loan pre-payment by the owner.

Termination will mean the cancellation of all rent controls and restrictions on the household income of tenants. At the termination of subsidy for these projects, unit rents are likely to return to market rate or may be subject to condominium conversion, non-residential uses and even demolition. Although the Department of Housing and Urban Development requires approval of pre-payment, it is in the interest of the City of Cudahy to develop programs for retaining these projects as low-income housing.
These programs may initially include contact with the owners of the projects to determine if they intend to prepay the projects or continue the low-income housing through HUD incentives. If prepayment is contemplated, the City may try to set-aside funds to buy the project or look for a non-profit agency who is wiling to take over the project. If the City opts for a more passive involvement in the developments, it could still provide predevelopment funds, technical assistance and other forms of incentives to the County, a nonprofit agency or other parties interested in maintaining the units for low-income households. Community Services
The Chicano Service Action Center, Inc. (CSAC) is a non-profit corporation providing support and employment training programs in the region. The agency provides training, employment referral, child care, counselling, self-sufficiency programs; temporary housing, and day care. It has a shelter in East Los Angeles at 831 N. Bonnie Beach Place. This facility can hold a maximum of 14 persons. It concentrates on training and employment of its primarily women clients. But it has an East Los Angeles Bilingual shelter for victims of domestic violence. Services at the facility include a hotline, temporary residential facility,

counselling, advocacy and referrals to other social services in the community. The CSAC office is located on Pacific Boulevard in Huntington Park.
The Free Spirit Shelter provides a hotline and residential facility to American Indian communities and victims of domestic violence. The shelter program consist of a 6 month stay at a mobile unit for a low fee, counselling, referrals and housing search assistance. Due to the sensitive nature of the service, shelter locations cannot be disclosed.
The Human Services Association (HSA) is an outreach service of the Presbyterian Church for the City of Bell Gardens. It is partly funded by the LA County Area Agency on Aging through the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended. It now serves southeast Los Angeles with offices at Florence Avenue in Bell Gardens and is non-sectarian. Services include emergency food, clothing locker, and motel vouchers. It has welfare counselling, advocacy and referral services. It meets needs of low income families in Southeast LA. It has programs for alcoholics, handicapped children, senior citizen support services, transportation, registry for home chore workers and seniors, telephone reassurance, senior citizen day care and nutrition programs. As part of the Older Americans Act, HSA provides the congregate Meal program monthly at 5 locations in the area. These are the Albert Little Community Center in Artesia, Simms Park in Bellflower, Senior Center in Bell Gardens, Senior Center in Commerce and Rio San Gabriel Park in Downey. Meals may also be delivered to inbound senior citizens.
In its own effort to help residents, the City of Cudahy has a monthly food distribution program for low income households. The bags that are handed out contain canned goods, peanut butter, bread, flour and butter.
Fair Housing Council of Long Beach is contracted by the City to promote equal access to housing and prevent discrimination. The Council is a private agency funded by federal grants and private donations. Its services include housing discrimination, landlord/tenant conflicts, education and community outreach, and Spanish speaking counsellors. All services offered are free for residents of Cudahy. In the past year, the council assisted 161 residents and landlords with information and referrals to resolve their housing concerns.
Maravilla is a county-funded non-profit agency which provides services to low income households in terms of home weatherization, installation of water-saving appliances, heater repair and even payment of utility bills. Maravilla works with the Southern California Gas Company, the Southern California Edison Company and local utility companies in provided this free service to households in need.

CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING PRODUCTION
Constraints to the provision of adequate and affordable housing are posed by governmental, economic and physical factors. These factors increase housing costs and result in units that are not affordable to lower income households in the City or lead to the neglect and deterioration of the housing stock and the living environment. Constraints to housing production significantly impact lower income households and those with special needs.
Governmental Constraints
Governmental actions which discourage housing construction or indirectly increase housing costs serve as constraints to adequately meeting the housing needs of the City. The identification of factors which may serve as governmental constraints will lead to positive changes in the City in order to encourage residential construction and affordable units.
Land Use Controls. The zoning ordinance poses the greatest constraint in the provision of housing because it regulates where residential uses may or may not be constructed. In Cudahy, almost 60 percent of the City is zoned for residential use. There are three residential zones; Single-Family Residential (R-l), Light Multiple Residential (R-2) and Medium Multiple Residential (R-3). The existing zoning map shows that approximately 32 acres of land are zoned as Single-Family Residential and 415.2 acres as Medium Multiple Residential. There is no land zoned Light Multiple Residential Zone.
Table 3-20 provides an acreage breakdown of the different zoning categories.

Buildout capacity of the zoning map is 5,033 units. As of January 1990, there were more dwelling units (5,416 units according to the US Census) than the buildout capacity. This is
;ause the lack of land has led to residential developments in areas zoned for commercial nd industrial use. The 14 mobile home parks with 345 units are located within commercial id industrial areas. Multi-family and single-family residential uses are also located on commercial areas at street intersections and near the Atlantic Boulevard commercial corridor. Hotels and motels in the City have been used as permanent dwelling units. Thus,
the City’s zoning map has not limited residential development to the residential zone^,
The mobile home parks within the commercial and industrial zones were considered non-conforming uses in the past. The permits for these parks were due to expire in uTewy^ars? In early 1991, the City Council designated these trailer parks as permanent residential developments subject to a Conditional Use Permit. Thus, the residential capacity of the City has increased by 345 units.
Codes and Enforcement. Cudahy uses the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Plumbing Code, Uniform Fire Code and Mechanical Code and the 1990 National Electric Code, Title 24 and 35 of the State Energy and Insulation Regulations and the Handicap Persons
City of Cudahy General Plan
Profile Reports
3-26
Housing Element Profile Report continued
Standards for new development. These codes promote public health and safety and ensure the construction of safe and decent housing in the City.
On and Off-site Improvements. Development standards for dwelling units influence the cost of housing. The zoning ordinance regulates yard setbacks, minimum lot sizes, maximum density and unit size that add to building costs. The Single-Family Residential Zone requires a minimum lot area of 5,000 square feet and 2,500 square feet per dwelling unit. Lot widths of 50 to 100 feet are required depending on lot size. Five feet wide side and rear yards are also required. Seventy square feet of open space should be provided for each unit in the zone. Maximum height is set at two stories or 25 feet, whichever is less. A minimum floor area of 1,110 square feet is required for each dwelling unit. At least two parking spaces per unit shall be provided.
The Light Multiple Residential and the Medium Multiple Residential Zones require a minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet. Lot width and setback requirements are similar to those required in the Single-Family Residential Zone. Light Multiple Residential Zone requires 700 square feet of open space per unit and the Medium Multiple Residential Zone requires 1,000 to 1,500 square feet of open space per unit. Height limits are set at two stories or 35 feet for both zones. Also, two parking spaces are required per unit.
These regulations coupled with the narrow and deep lots in Cudahy have led to the development of strip units in the City. Rigid regulations can stifle creativity and serve as a cookie cutter for housing development. The unique characteristics of each lot and development should be considered against the standards of development in order to eliminate hardship and encourage desirable developments. Variances, density bonuses, and incentives help accommodate the needs of both developers and residents. The City has developed an overlay zone and allows planned unit developments but these have not been utilized by area developers.
Fees and Exactions. City fees offset the cost of reviewing proposed developments for compliance with City regulations and ordinances. The schedule of planning and development fees is provided in Table 3-21.

A moratorium on the R-3 zone is in effect from July 1990 until June 1991. City may have to extend this until new standards could be in place. The City is trying to find ways of limiting overcrowded conditions and high density developments through standards that encourage higher quality projects and improvements to the living environment.
Constraints to Lower Income Housing. Affordable housing is even more difficult to develop than market rate units. The limited availability of Federal and State subsidy funds serve as a hindrance to the provision of affordable housing units. More stringent construction wage standards for federal housing programs also discourage construction under these programs.
The limit of $740 per unit on the amounkSpent for the modification of existing units to provide handicap access does not ensure/the/all units are accessible to handicapped persons. It is more expensive to modify older units to accommodate ramps, widened doorways, elevator shafts and railings than to build these features into new construction.
3-29

Housing Element Profile Report continued
Economic Constraints
Economic constraints to housing production include the availability of financing loans, land prices and the cost of construction. Energy costs and conservation is discussed as an issue that affects housing design and maintenance costs.
Housing and Construction Loans. Financing loans for the purchase of homes have interest rates ranging from 6 to 12 percent for a 30-year loan. Interest rates have been decreasing in recent months with changes in the national economy. This decrease has been advantageous for households who buy at the time when rates are down. Increased rates create differences in the monthly mortgage payment by as much as a few hundred dollars for each interest point.
Construction loans currently range from 10 to 12 percent. These rates affect the market rents for multi-family projects and the cost of construction. The approval of loans has generally been based on the economic feasibility of a project and the stability of the development company.
Land Prices. Land costs make up 10 to 30 percent of housing costs. Land in some areas cost more than others due too available services, neighborhood quality, distance to business and commercial centers and other factors. Because of the limited vacant land, land prices in Cudahy are tied to the cost of developed land. Existing housing units need to be bought and demolished in order to acquire land for development. Information from area developers place the cost of a half-acre in Cudahy at around $250,000. These lots can hold up to five dwelling units.
Construction Costs. Construction costs determine the feasibility of building low income housing. Rising energy and labor costs have driven up construction costs in the last decade. This has led to more expensive housing in the region. Average construction costs are $60 per square foot, with more complex plans at $65 per square foot. Thus, for a 1,000-square-foot unit, construction costs are about $60,000; and for a 1,400-square-foot unit, construction costs are $84,000.
Energy Costs and Conservation. Rising energy costs increase the cost of construction and the maintenance of housing units. While construction activities use gas and electricity for the operation of equipment and facilities, these are short-term uses. The occupancy of the housing unit has a greater energy demand for the long-term. Reducing the need for energy will present long term savings on housing expenditure and the conservation of environmental resources. Opportunities for conservation that may be used during construction include
City of Cudahy General Plan
Profile Reports

Housing Element Profile Report continued
energy-efficient equipment and building orientation and landscaping that takes full advantage of climate and site characteristics.
Dwelling units can minimize energy use through the installation of extra insulation, passive solar systems, use of gas instead of electricity, fluorescent lighting and other technologies. This would increase the initial building costs and keep housing beyond the affordability of lower income households.
The Southern California Gas Company offers home weatherization improvements at no cost to low income customers. These energy saving measures include attic insulation, weather striping, caulking, water heater insulation blankets, hot water saving showerheads, heating and cooling duct insulation, and limited repairs to make a housing unit energy-efficient.
Energy conservation practices may be used by households to reduce their energy bills. They include adjustments in heating demands, laundry and cooking practices and other measures that reduce the use of gas and electricity.
Physical Constraints
The major physical constraints to housing development include the availability of land and the capacity of existing infrastructure. Both factors serve to limit housing stock growth in the City.
Land. The biggest constraint to the development of new housing units in Cudahy is the availability of vacant land for residential development. The scarcity of land for development leads to a shortfall in housing units to accommodate all residents and a subsequent increase in home prices and rents.
The lots in the City were subdivided initially as agricultural and single family lots approximately 105 feet wide by 387 feet deep. Urbanization of the area has led to further subdivision into 52.5 feet wide and 387 feet deep lots. The lack of available residential land has led to the recycling of these lots to accommodate more units. With deep and narrow lots, strip detached and attached units have been the most common development.
Vacant lots would be the primary location for new residential development. Under-utilized sites can also hold additional units. Units in major disrepair should be subject to recycling and redevelopment through private or public investments. Because of the City’s concern for strip development, plan review should be made before approval of land recycling or redevelopment.
City of Cudahy General Plan
Profile Reports
3-31
Housing Element Profile Report continued
Vacant land in the City are shown in Exhibit 3-12. They consist of 34 lots with a total area of approximately 12.9 acres. These lots can hold up to 139 new units. Without much vacant land, the City’s housing stock has increased through second units, the subdivision of large lots, and the construction of units at maximum density.
The zone change of lower density areas for high density residential uses or the construction of multi-family projects in commercial zones can further increase the housing stock. This may not be advisable considering that the majority of the City is already zoned for high density residential development and most commercial areas are developed.
Infrastructure Capacity. The capacity of existing infrastructure and services to handle future increase in population presents an important constraint to housing development. Schools in the area are overcrowded. Streets are operating at LOS E during peak hours and water, sewer, electric demands can not be met by infrastructure built over 30 years ago. Although these deficiencies may be mitigated by improvements and upgrading projects, the City has limited financial resources to implement them.
SUMMARY OF HOUSING NEEDS
The housing demand in Cudahy is directly related to the number of residents and the types of households in the City. As provided by the discussion on population and households characteristics, Cudahy has a unique population which require housing other than conventional market rate units.
Affordability
A major housing problem in Cudahy is housing affordability. The City of Cudahy is currently within the very low income category. This means that households do not have the resources to pay for market rate housing. With limited and low incomes, households are likely to rent smaller, less equipped, or older units which command lower rents.
The City should exhaust all means to develop low income housing, lessen overpayment and provide housing assistance to residents. This will address the needs of elderly, femaleheaded, and other overpaying households.
Aside from housing affordability, the City has other special housing needs. They include large units for large households and those with school age children, units accessible to the handicapped, low income units at risk of conversion and equal access to housing.

Housing Element Profile Report continued
Maintenance
Housing maintenance is another issue that concerns the City. With the age of the majority of housing units, maintenance and rehabilitation efforts are needed at this time. Since households in Cudahy are primarily renters, housing maintenance takes on a different dimension. Homeowners are more likely to spend for maintenance than renters. Low-income households are unlikely to spend any more money for housing costs.
Housing Development
The growth of the population in the City has not been matched by the growth in housing stock. While the garage conversions and back units have tried to accommodate the demand for housing in the area, it would be appropriate to encourage the development of housing in the more conventional way. The population growth of the City is likely to slow down with the lack of vacant land. But the City still needs to plan for housing the future population. Otherwise, the current housing problems of overcrowding, garage conversions, homelessness and overpayment will exacerbate.
Additional units needed to raise the vacancy rate should be planned in future housing development. This will help lower rents and provide suitable housing for households. The City may also look at ways of eliminating governmental constraints to housing production in order to encourage new developments.
Housing Conversion
The increasing trend toward the demolition of dwelling units on large lots to accommodate more single family units or multi-family developments will continue as long as the demand for housing is unmet and lots are under-utilized. Older units provide a source of affordable housing. Their replacement with new units will be accompanied by the loss of affordable housing in place of higher housing costs and rents. Garage conversions and hotel and motels should be monitored to ensure that safe and decent living conditions are maintained.
Evaluation of Past Element
The current Housing Element of the City of Cudahy contains 6 goals on housing availability, affordability, suitability, community development, accessibility, and environmental conservation. The City has been trying to increase the local housing supply, reduce the cost of housing, rehabilitate the existing stock, and provide support services, equal access and opportunities for the conservation of the housing stock.
City of Cudahy General Plan
Profile Reports
3-33
Housing Element Profile Report continued
The programs designed to meet these goals include a Rehabilitation Loan Program. The program has provided loans to households resulting in the conservation of 92 single-family homes and 347 rental units in multi-family developments since 1975. Code enforcement has also been identified as a way of monitoring property maintenance and the deterioration of housing conditions.
The City of Cudahy has 132 households currently receiving Section 8 Federally Subsidized Housing Assistance. The Los Angeles County Housing Authority administers this program. There are applications from Cudahy residents for this subsidy that cannot be granted by the Housing Authority at this time.
Public participation programs have encouraged citizen input at City programs through published meetings and hearings. Public review periods have allowed the City to get comments and suggestions from the general public.
The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has allowed the City to upgrade and maintain housing quality in the City. Cudahy has invested over $4 million in residential neighborhoods through this program. The City’s Home Improvement Program is funded by CDBG monies and provides rebates, below market rate loans, deferred loans, grants, and emergency grants.
The program provides grants of up to $7,000 and rebates for landlords of $10,000 and for homeowners of up to $7,000. Deferred loans are granted for a maximum amount of $30,000. The program is also available for owners who want to correct code violations and health and safety concerns to meet City standards. Housing rehabilitation efforts with CDBG funds have led to the rehabilitation of 18 homes in the past year. The City anticipates helping another 18 households in the next year.
Redevelopment programs have helped meet the housing needs of the City. The City’s only Redevelopment Project Area covers approximately 329.8 acres. It was established primarily to remove blight, develop affordable housing and increase the housing stock. Redevelopment projects have included the installation, construction, and reconstruction of streets, utilities and other public improvements (sewer lines and storm drainage); rehabilitation and development of low and moderate income housing; rehabilitation of industrial and business structures; and revitalization and upgrade of existing developments. These programs help increase sales taxes and revenues in the City, promote aesthetic and environmental considerations and remove dilapidated structures. A large area within the Redevelopment Project area is devoted for residential uses. The City Redevelopment

Agency has brought about the construction of the senior citizen housing project "Cudahy Commons" beside the Clara Street Park.
The City sponsors a monthly food drive for low income households in Cudahy. The program distributes staples and USDA commodities to approximately 350 households every month. This is funded by the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds in cooperation with the Human Services Association (HSA). Also, a senior citizen nutrition program is offered at the Leo? Turner Center. Lunch is provided to all senior citizens Mondays to Fridays. Approximately 80 persons are served every day. This program is funded by CDBG, Older Americans Act, USDA and other non-profit agencies in the area.

SECTION 4: TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The transportation system in Cudahy consists of a roadway network of highways and local streets, the adjacent Long Beach Freeway, private transportation, and public transit systems. The Long Beach Freeway (State Route-710) is just east of Cudahy. Also, the City’s central location in Los Angeles County provides Cudahy with easy access to most parts of the region. Local circulation generally follows a grid pattern, except for Atlantic Avenue which runs north-south at a slight angle and Salt Lake Avenue which follows the curve of the railroad tracks. Atlantic Avenue is the only major highway running through the City. It connects Cudahy to as far north as Alhambra and south to Long Beach. Traffic volumes on most City streets are currently approaching or at maximum capacity and leading to traffic congestion.
Public transit is available through the Southern California Rapid Transit District (SCRTD) and the Cudahy Area Rapid Transit (CART). The Union Pacific Electric Railroad runs along the western edge of the City and the Southern Pacific Railroad runs along the southern edge. Neither railroad line provides freight service to the City.
The Transportation Element of the Cudahy General Plan evaluates the existing roadway circulation system and identifies measures for the system to accommodate existing and future traffic volumes. The Transportation Element contains goals and policies for providing an efficient circulation system and a plan for improving the existing network to handle traffic increases due to regional and local growth. The Element includes a Circulation Plan, which provides for a comprehensive circulation system designed to accommodate the projected transportation needs of the City. Other issues addressed in the Element include public transit systems, parking areas and pedestrian safety.
The Transportation Element complies with California Government Code Section 65302(b), which requires that the Transportation Element identify the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes and other public utilities and facilities. The Cudahy Transportation Element looks at existing transportation issues in the City through the Transportation Profile Report. The goals, policies, plan and programs of the Transportation Element respond to identified traffic concerns, as well as projected traffic conditions. It provides ways to reduce future traffic volumes and prevent the creation of traffic problems at buildout of the Land Use Plan. Public utilities and facilities are addressed in the Land Use Element.

Transportation Element (continued)
GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Transportation Element address the major issues identified in the Transportation Profile Report. A primary concern in Cudahy is the adequacy of the existing transportation system to handle existing and future traffic. The capacity and utilization of the existing system raises the need for roadway and traffic improvements and transportation management programs. While the City seeks to accommodate vehicular traffic, it gives the same consideration for pedestrian and motorist safety. The prevention of vehicle-related injury and accidents is another major issue in Cudahy. Cudahy also promotes the use of public transportation and the requirements of adequate parking areas to serve residents and businesses.
Issue: Transportation System
The City’s roadway system consists of Atlantic Avenue as a major highway; a number of secondary highways which provide connection to adjacent cities; and several local streets serving the inner residential areas. Major and secondary highways are currently operating at capacity and future increases in traffic volumes could lead to severe congestion on City streets. Improvements to the existing transportation system will help abate any traffic problems that may occur at buildout of the City.
Goal 1 Maximize the efficiency, convenience and safety of the existing transportation system.
Policy 1.1 Encourage motorists to use major streets and avoid short-cuts through local (residential) streets.
Policy 1.2 Work towards a level of service of "D" along Atlantic Avenue.
Policy 1.3 Designate truck routes for commercial and industrial truck traffic.
Policy 1.4 Improve the local circulation system. This may be accomplished by increasing the number of surface streets, widening local streets, extending Alamo Street to Elizabeth Street, developing River Road from Live Oak Street to Clara Street, or other measures.
Issue: Safe Driving Conditions
While the City seeks to provide an adequate circulation system for vehicular traffic, it recognizes that motorist and pedestrian safety is just as important. The provision of safe driving conditions and the protection of pedestrians from vehicular hazards is a basic consideration in transportation planning. This is critical for residential areas, schools sites,
City of Cudahy
General Pion

Transportation Element (continued)
parks, institutional uses, commercial sites, and other areas with a large number of users.
Goal 2 Work to improve roadway conditions and promote safety in the City.
Policy 2.1 Provide comprehensive and ongoing evaluation of streets and intersections within the City and provide a program for future improvements.
Policy 2.2 Discourage large trucks and truck through-traffic on local residential streets.
Policy 2.3 Cooperate and participate with Los Angeles County and adjacent cities in their efforts to reduce unsafe driving conditions and to enforce speed limits and other traffic safety laws.
Policy 2.4 Promote the use of crossing guards at appropriate school crossing locations for pedestrian safety and to facilitate efficient traffic flow, to the extent of available resources.
Policy 2.5 Provide convenient, safe, and efficient pedestrian and vehicular access throughout the City.
Issue: Public Transportation
Cudahy’s location within the Los Angeles metropolitan area provides the City with a public transit system through the SCRTD. Rail transit systems are also within easy access to the City. This allows Cudahy residents to avail themselves of the convenience and economy offered by the use of public transportation. The City actively promotes the use of public transportation systems to reduce vehicle trips and the associated traffic congestion, pollutant emission, energy use, and noise.
Goal 3 Encourage the expansion of existing public transportation routes and facilities.
Policy 3.1 Continue to encourage, promote, and expand the use of public transportation including car pools, van pools, and bus services.
Policy 3.2 Participate in and encourage cooperation among adjacent cities to provide a more reliable public transportation system in the area.
Policy 3.3 Support the continued development of a regional transportation system that will serve area residents.
Policy 3.4 Re-evaluate public transportation needs in terms of fixed route buses, when ridership exceeds present services.

Policy 3.5 Continue to use Prop A funds for the operation of a public transit system in Cudahy.
Issue: Parking Areas
The availability of parking areas affects traffic congestion in various ways. The inadequate off-street parking leads to slow-moving vehicles looking for vacant parking space. The provision of on-street parking areas reduces street capacity and adds to traffic congestion. Adequate off-street parking, however, could encourage the use of single-occupant vehicles which, in turn, add to traffic volumes. The City of Cudahy is seeking a balance between a reduction in single-occupant vehicle use and improved traffic flows.
Goal 4 Promote efficient, safe and convenient parking facilities within the commercial areas of the City.
Policy 4.1 Require that parking lots be designed to provide easy access to nearby retail areas.
Policy 4.2 Promote off-street parking in commercial areas to reduce the need for onstreet parking along Atlantic Avenue.
Policy 4.3 Encourage existing retail and commercial sites with substandard circulation or parking conditions to upgrade their facilities to established design standards.
Policy 4.4 Require adequate off-street parking for all future residential and commercial developments.
Policy 4.5 Regulate overnight on-street parking and the parking of commercial and recreational vehicles and trucks in commercial areas.

CIRCULATION PLAN
The adequacy of the transportation system can be evaluated by its capacity to handle traffic volumes at buildout of the City. Potential development under the Land Use Plan was used to estimate future trip generation in the City. Exhibit 4-1 shows number of trips that would be generated by land uses at buildout.
With limited vacant land left for new development, land recycling projects will be accompanied by changes in traffic from new land uses and the removal of existing uses. Land recycling is expected to occur throughout the City. This includes the High Density Residential areas, Commercial uses along Atlantic Avenue and Commercial-Manufacturing areas in the south. Minor recycling may occur on Low and Medium Density Residential areas.
The distribution of traffic volumes at buildout were assumed to maintain current proportions throughout the City. A direct 1.5 percent annual growth was factored into existing traffic volumes on major roadways to achieve projected traffic. These streets are the major and secondary highways in the City and two of the more travelled local streets. They are also segments that have been subject to past traffic counts and will provide a basis of comparison for future traffic volumes. Table 4-1 and Exhibit 4-2 shows traffic volumes and roadway levels of service at the year 2010.

Transportation Element (continued)
Traffic at buildout will lead to all city streets operating over capacity, with heavy traffic and congestion. With heavy peak hour traffic on several street segments, increases in traffic volumes may cause congestion throughout the day. Because the City of Cudahy does not have much land to build new streets or widen existing roadways to a considerable extent, the Circulation Plan for the City basically shows the same street network, with a few new streets to improve access from residential streets to secondary highways. The Plan calls for the construction and maintenance of all roadways to county standards. This will include lane restriping, minor roadway widening, sidewalk provision, and other modifications. Also, traffic improvements (such as signals, signs, etc.), transportation management programs and other measures will be implemented to enhance the capacity of the City’s transportation system. These are discussed in the next section.
The Circulation Plan of the City of Cudahy shows the classification of roadways in the City, to reflect their uses and ultimate right-of-way widths. The Plan shows three types of roadways: Major Highway, Secondary Highway, and Local Street.
■	Major Highway - A Major highway is a roadway designed to move large volumes of traffic through the community to other major arterial roadways or freeways. They permit through traffic to flow in and out of the City. Atlantic Avenue is the only major highway in Cudahy. It runs from north to south and provides through access to the City. It is 90 feet wide with two travel lanes provided in each direction and left-turn pockets at major intersections.
■	Secondary Highway (Collector Road) - Secondary Highways moves traffic from local streets to the major highway and serve as collector roads. They keep through traffic off the local streets and out of residential areas. Otis Avenue, Salt Lake Avenue, Wilcox Avenue, Clara Street, and Santa Ana Street are classified as secondary highways in Cudahy. They have a minimum of two travel lanes (one lane in each direction) and a 50 to 76 foot right-of-way.
■	Local Street - Local Streets provide access to individual parcels. They generally have one travel lane in each direction. The majority of the streets in Cudahy are local streets with widths ranging from 40 to 60 feet.
Exhibit 4-3 shows roadway standards and Exhibit 4-4 shows the City’s Circulation Plan.

Exhibit 4-4 Circulation Plan
Transportation Element (continued)
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
The Circulation Plan of the City of Cudahy is primarily developed, but some right-of-way modifications are needed to fully implement it. Because not all transportation issues can be resolved by the construction of roadways, the implementation programs below address the need to reduce trip generation, maintain good traffic flow, mitigate traffic impacts from new development, improve pedestrian safety, increase public transit use, and enhance overall circulation patterns in the City. The identification of a funding source does not exclude the use of other funding sources that may be available.
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
Programs to help improve the existing transportation system are discussed below. They include ways to maintain the circulation system and reduce the number of trips from and through the City. These programs will help maintain circulation, access, and traffic flows, despite future increases in population and development in the City.
Roadway Improvements
The City of Cudahy shall continue to maintain existing roadways, traffic signals and other traffic control devices. It shall work toward the widening of city streets, where feasible, and the extension of Alamo Street to Elizabeth Street and the continuation of River Road from Clara Street to Live Oak Street.
The City shall also install traffic control devices, as needed. These may include speed bumps, no parking signs, speed limit signs, and other traffic signs. Roadway maintenance shall include pavement repair, lane restriping, roadway widening, landscape maintenance, street lights, and other roadway projects. It shall explore ways to reduce traffic through a variety of traffic control measures. The City shall consider synchronizing traffic signals for improved traffic flow. It shall upgrade existing signals for left-turn and right-turn arrows and increase left-turn and right-turn pockets at congested intersections.
The City shall evaluate the location of bus stops and turnouts and work towards the reduction in congestion due to the bus queuing. The elimination of on-street parking shall also be studied as an option to increase roadway capacity. These projects shall be included in the City’s Capital Improvement Plan as implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services. They shall be financed by the General Fund and gas tax funds.

Transportation Element (continued)
Signal Warrant
The City shall continue to monitor traffic volumes on city streets and determine the need for additional traffic signals or other traffic improvements. This shall be implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services with funding from the General Fund. Street Improvements
As stated in the Land Use Element, the City shall study the advantages and disadvantages of constructing a raised landscape median strip along Atlantic Avenue to improve traffic flow and safety in the City. This program shall be implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services in 1993 and financed by the General Fund and gas tax funds. Atlantic Avenue Improvements
The City shall identify capital improvement projects needed along Atlantic Avenue and include them in the City’s Capital Improvement Program or make them part of the Atlantic Avenue Plan, street improvements or other projects developed by the Atlantic Avenue Association. Measures to improve traffic flow on Atlantic Avenue shall be explored, which may include the removal of on-street parking. This program shall be implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services with financing from the General Fund, or through assessments to Atlantic Avenue businesses.
Truck Routes
The City shall designate truck routes, post signs, and enforce the regulations to discourage the use of local streets. Potential truck routes include Atlantic Avenue, Salt Lake Avenue, Clara Street (east of Atlantic), Wilcox Avenue, and Santa Ana Street (west of Atlantic). The route designation will promote traffic safety and reduce roadway loads on local streets. This program shall be implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services in 1994, with financing from the General Fund.
Capital Improvement Program
Public works and infrastructure improvements in the City are planned through a Capital Improvement Program which sets priorities and funding for needed for infrastructure projects. The City shall continue to prioritize street improvements and roadway projects with other infrastructure and public service projects in its Capital Improvement Program. This program is ongoing and coordinated by the Department of Building and Public Services with funding from the General Fund, to the extent available. Gas tax funds, federal aid and other funding sources are also used for capital facilities in the City.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
4-8
Transportation Element (continued)
Transportation Demand Management Program
The City shall establish a City-wide transportation demand management program. This will include ways to reduce trip generation to and from the City and may be accomplished through carpools, vanpools, ridesharing, public transit use, walking, planned trips, and other measures. This program shall be initiated by the Community Development Department in 1994, with funding from the General Fund.
SAFE DRIVING CONDITIONS
Hazards associated with vehicular traffic can be reduced through programs that promote pedestrian and motorist safety over good traffic flow. Aside from roadway improvements and truck routes discussed earlier, the programs below will improve street safety in Cudahy.
Pedestrian Crosswalks
The City shall maintain and provide pedestrian crosswalks at major street intersections and near schools and city parks. It shall encourage walking by providing continuous sidewalks, street furniture, landscaping and other pedestrian amenities along city streets. It shall also continue to provide crossing guards at school locations to prevent hazards to students and motorists. This program shall be implemented by the Department of Community Services and the Department of Building and Public Services. It is ongoing and financed by the General Fund, to the extent available.
Street Safety
The City shall continue to promote street safety through information brochures, local newspapers, the City newsletter, and other public information methods. It shall work with transportation agencies, local enforcement officials, and other groups (such as the Auto Club of Southern California) in promoting safe driving techniques to local drivers. It shall support street safety programs at local schools, including the "Don’t Drink and Drive campaign by non-profit agencies in the region. This ongoing program is implemented by the Department of Community Services with funding from the General Fund. Development Review
With the development review process discussed in the Land Use Element, proposed commercial developments shall be subject to site plan, design and environmental reviews. This will allow evaluation of a proposed project’s compliance with the City’s parking, landscaping, lighting and other standards. It will also identify the project’s impacts on traffic, circulation, access, parking and public transit systems. This is an ongoing program by the Community Development Department as financed by the General Fund.

Transportation Element (continued)
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
A large number of Cudahy’s resident population use existing public transportation systems. Also, the proximity of commercial and industrial areas to Atlantic Avenue allows employees to use public bus services. The City of Cudahy supports public transportation as an efficient means of travel in the City and surrounding areas. The programs below will increase the use of public transportation in the City.
Cudahy Area Rapid Transit
The City shall continue to operate the Cudahy Area Rapid Transit (CART) to serve residents’ transportation needs within the City and adjacent areas. Increased ridership on the CART shall be accommodated by additional vans, extended schedules or more frequent runs. This program is being implemented by the Department of Community Services through Prop A funds.
Public Transportation
The City shall support public transportation and transit projects which have the potential to serve Cudahy residents. It shall also continue to provide bus pass subsidies for students and senior citizens. While these systems may not be located within the City, their availability at nearby locations will allow residents to use the service. Coordination with SCRTD on bus routes and schedules shall be continued. This program is implemented by the Departments of Community Development and Community Services with funding from the General Fund and transit funds.
Carpooling and Vanpooling
The City shall develop a program to promote carpooling and vanpooling in the City. While there are no large employers in the City, the proximity of commercial sites to one another and other public offices will allow individuals to establish cooperative or joint carpools. Also, carpools for residents shall be promoted through a public information program. The Department of Community Services shall serve as an information resource for individuals interested in carpooling or vanpooling. This program shall be initiated in 1993 with financing from the General Fund.
Inter-agency Coordination
The City of Cudahy shall work with adjacent cities and other agencies (County Transportation Commission, Southern California Rapid Transit District, California Department of Transportation) for the planning of transportation needs of the area. This includes the coordination of public transit programs, congestion management, traffic
City of Cudahy
General Plan

Transportation Element (continued)
improvements and other transportation programs. The City shall be involved in the development of state and regional transportation plans which may impact the City’s circulation system. This includes the County Congestion Management Plan and plans of the Long Beach Freeway. This program shall be initiated by the Department of Community Development in 1992 with financing from the General Fund.
PARKING AREAS
Parking areas serve as destination points for vehicle trips and influence traffic flows. Adequate off-street parking reduces congestion at access points while on-street parking decreases available roadway capacity. The City’s parking concerns shall be addressed through the Zoning Ordinance Development Review and the Atlantic Avenue Improvement programs discussed above. Parking availability in the City shall also be resolved through the programs below.
Non-conforming and Incompatible Uses
As part of this program (Land Use Element), non-conforming commercial and industrial developments with deficient parking areas shall be identified. The property owners shall be encouraged to provide additional parking, where feasible. Otherwise, compliance periods shall be set to allow for the eventual upgrade of parking areas. This program shall be established in 1993 by the Community Development Department and financed by the General Fund, to the extent available.
Overnight Parking
The City shall continue to regulate overnight on-street parking and the parking of commercial and recreational vehicles in commercial areas. This program is implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services, with funding from the General Fund.

SECTION 5: OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Open space refers to land or water which is unimproved and devoted for the preservation of natural resources; for outdoor recreation; or for public health and safety concerns. It includes habitats of wildlife species, rivers, groundwater recharge areas, and areas with mineral deposits. Trails, parks, outdoor recreation areas, utility easements, scenic highway corridors, and areas requiring regulation of hazardous conditions such as earthquake fault zones, unstable soils, flood plains, and watersheds are also considered open space. Recreation areas include public parks and private facilities offering recreational facilities and programs. It consists of city, county or regional parks, golf courses, bicycle and hiking trails, community centers, game fields, gymnasiums, and other sports facilities. Open space areas suitable for outdoor recreation may also be identified as recreation areas.
There are limited open space areas in Cudahy. They include city parks, public easements and the adjacent Los Angeles River. Private open space areas consist of yards and recreational open spaces in residential developments. The City parks are the main recreation areas in Cudahy. They provide residents with opportunities for recreation and outdoor activities. Adjacent public and private recreation facilities also serve Cudahy residents. Cudahy’s population density has led to the full utilization of the available recreational facilities. The lack of vacant land has constrained the provision of additional facilities.
The Open Space and Recreation Element fulfills the requirements of Section 65560 to 65570 of the California Government Code regarding the preparation of an open space plan for the City. Open space and recreation issues are brought together because areas preserved as open space are valuable resources for both outdoor recreation and scenic enjoyment. Also, the major open space areas in Cudahy are the City parks. The preservation and managed production of natural resource areas and the scenic, historic and cultural resources of the City are addressed in the Conservation Element.
The Open Space and Recreation Element of the Cudahy General Plan establishes a long-range program for the preservation of public parks in the City and the provision of recreation areas and facilities to serve the needs of residents. It also addresses the need for the enhancement of opportunities for recreation in the City. The Element includes an inventory of both public and private open space and a plan for the continued protection of these areas.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
5-1
Open Space and Recreation Element (continued)
GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Open Space and Recreation Element have been developed to address two issues: Open Space and Recreation. Because there are limited vacant areas in the City, the issues deal with the acquisition and development of public and private areas, which may be preserved as open space or used for park purposes. The goals and policies below outline the City’s goals for developing new open space areas and providing facilities for increased recreational opportunities.
Issue: Open Space
Open space areas in Cudahy include city parks, currently undeveloped lots, open areas in private developments, school grounds and the adjacent Los Angeles River. The limited amount of open space adds to the look of high density residential development. Increasing open space areas will help lessen the appearance of high density development and help create a better living environment.
Goal 1 Secure a safe, healthful, and wholesome environment through the preservation of existing public open space resources and provision of private open space.
Policy 1.1 Encourage the dedication of open space for public rest areas, parks, and other aesthetic improvements in new developments.
Policy 1.2 Consider the acquisition of surplus land owned by public agencies for future open space and recreational use.
Policy 1.3 Explore all possible funding sources for the acquisition of open space, including, but not limited to, Federal, State, County, and private sources.
Policy 1.4 Explore the feasibility of developing a new multi-use park in the City.
City of Cudahy

Open Space and Recreation Element (continued)
Issue: Parks and Recreation
Parks and recreational facilities provide areas for leisure, enjoyment and well-being. Cudahy’s resident population provides a challenge in meeting the different needs of various age groups and interests. Continued provision of parks and recreational opportunities will enhance the quality of life for residents and create a better living environment.
Goal 2 Strive to provide a sufficient range of recreation opportunities to meet the needs of all ages and interests in the community.
Policy 2.1	Preserve existing parks and encourage the development of new parks and recreational facilities in the City.

Open Space and Recreation Element (continued)
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
With major open space areas in Cudahy consisting of City parks, the main focus of the Open Space and Recreation Element is park acquisition and development. It is recognized that there is a significant need for additional parks n the City and for increased funding for site acquisition and facilities development. Future growth in the City will further increase parkland deficiencies unless an aggressive program is undertaken. The goals and policies of this Element will be implemented through an interdependent set of programs which may all be brought together under a Master Plan for Parks and Recreation.
PARKS MASTER PLAN
As identified in the Open Space and Recreation Profile Report, some areas of the City are not within easy access to a park. The City shall explore the potential for developing a park on northwestern and northeastern sections of the City. With the new elementary school planned on Wilcox Avenue, the City may be able to establish an agreement to have school grounds available for public use after school hours. The City Manager shall negotiate with the LAUSD for this agreement.
The limited amount of parkland in contrast to the population of Cudahy has led to full use of existing facilities. The City shall identify potential sites for a future multi-use park which will add to recreational facilities in the City. These sites may include existing vacant lots, publicly-owned lots and other available for-sale parcels. Private and public funding sources for acquisition and development shall also be explored. The Department of Community Development be responsible for this program.
The City shall work with the Los Angeles County Department of Recreation for the development of new parks in or near the City. The City shall also post signs along roadways to identify access points to the Los Angeles River trail. This shall be undertaken by the Department of Building and Public Services.
The City shall also initiate the establishment of joint use or maintenance agreements with the LAUSD for future school/recreational facilities, if appropriate. This shall be initiated by the Department of Community Services.
At the same time, the City of Cudahy shall work with adjacent cities in providing parks for area residents and in developing facilities that complement, rather than duplicate, one another. Residents shall be informed of adjacent public and private facilities and programs which can accommodate their recreational pursuits. This may be done through various information media, such as the City newsletter, local newspapers, boards in City parks, flyers, etc. It shall include information on the Los Angeles River trail and connecting trails throughout the County. These programs shall be the responsibility of the Department of Community Services.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
5-4
Open Space and Recreation Element (continued)
By designating City parks as public areas in the Land Use Plan, they are preserved for future use. As new parks are developed in the City, they shall also be designated as public areas. This will make it more difficult to change their use when development pressures rise. The City shall also require the dedication of public areas, mini parks and aesthetic improvements to prevent their conversion to other uses. The Community Development Department shall initiate the redesignation of new parks.
In order to continue to meet the demand for parks and recreational facilities, the City shall properly maintain public parks through landscaping, trash collection and graffiti removal, playground equipment repairs, and other services. The City shall continue to offer a variety of recreational programs such as tournaments, sports competitions, classes, excursions, and special events. These programs shall be coordinated by the Department of Community Services through the General Fund. State park bonds are also available for recreational facilities development in the City. Other funding sources shall be explored and used for park development in the City. The Master Plan shall be developed in 1994 by the Department of Community Services with assistance from Department of Community Development. Overall coordination with various City departments and other agencies for implementation of the different measures shall be the responsibility of the Department of Community Services.
As part of the development review process, the Department of Community Development shall encourage the provision of private on site recreational areas in multi-family residential projects, condominiums, and residential subdivisions. It shall continue to collect impact fees from new development for future park development, as allowed under the Quimby Act. Parkland exactions which are obtained from property owners who develop previously subdivided property shall be reviewed for adequacy to provide future park facilities. The Community Development Department shall also assist in the redesignation of future parks as public areas.

SECTION 6: CONSERVATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The earth’s resources are limited and often non-renewable. Ignorance, indifference and misuse could easily lead to their exploitation, destruction or neglect. As such, it is the City’s responsibility to inform residents of the importance of local resources in relation to regional concerns. The City of Cudahy may regulate the use of local resources to prevent their destruction and exploitation and to ensure that conservation efforts are consistent and equitable. Conservation programs deal with resource utilization, preservation techniques and the conduct of activities which affect or preclude the utilization of resources.
Natural resources that affect the planning area include water, energy and land. (Air quality is addressed in a separate element.) Cultural resources include potential historical sites and structures in the City. The Conservation Element of the Cudahy General Plan deals with the management of natural and cultural resources in the planning area. The Element identifies the significant resources within the City and establishes a plan for the conservation, management, or preservation of these resources. The City’s conservation plan will consist of independent programs for the protection of groundwater resources, the reduction in demand for energy resources, the recycling of products to conserve regional resources, and the preservation of local cultural resources.
The Conservation Element is a state-mandated element, as required by regulations in Section 6§30i(d) of the California Government Code^nS the State Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA). This Element is intended to increase public awareness on the availability of local resources and to promote the advantages of conservation and management through specific goals, policies and programs.
6-1
City of Cudahy
General Plan
Conservation Element (continued)
GOALS AND POLICIES
The Conservation Profile Report identifies the presence or absence of sensitive resources in the planning area. The City of Cudahy does not have many resources primarily because of its limited land area and highly urbanized state. Of the available resources, local groundwater resources provide the sole source of water for the City. Energy resources are consumed in the area but come from off site sources throughout the State. Landfill capacity at county landfills is a regional concern that is tied to waste generation and product recycling. While the City has been found to have a low sensitivity for archaeological, paleontological and historical resources, there may be identified resources with future excavation and site investigation.
The goals of the Conservation Element have been tailored to address four main issues: the natural environment, cultural resources, energy resources, and waste recycling. These issues address the different concerns regarding the protection of the environment from degradation cause by carelessness and disregard for our limited resources.
Issue: Natural Environment
Environmental issues have been receiving greater attention in recent times due to problems that have surfaced after years of neglect and exploitation of the environment. The City of Cudahy does not have sensitive ecological communities, but indirectly affects regional resources through practices, programs and private activities. By establishing policies to preserve the natural environment, the City can help prevent future environmental problems. Goal 1 Preserve the environment through the conservation of resources.
Policy 1.1 Participate in management programs of the County of Los Angeles for water conservation, liquid and solid waste management, and flood control.
Policy 1.2 Inform residents of the environmental concerns regarding air quality, water resources, land and other ecological resources to solicit cooperation and support in the City’s conservation plans.
Policy 1.3 Encourage the long-term protection of the environment as a primary consideration in approving development projects.
Policy 1.4 Conduct environmental studies for future projects to the extent required by CEQA, in order to address the cumulative impacts of other projects on traffic, regional air quality, sewage generation and other environmental constraints of the area.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
6-2
Conservation Element (continued)
Policy 1.5 Promote water conservation through programs and projects in cooperation with local utility companies.
Policy 1.6 Encourage the use of drought-tolerant landscaping and/or xeriscape, particularly in open areas of the City.
Policy 1.7 Prevent toxic waste dumping within the City to avoid the contamination of the local groundwater by cooperating with the appropriate enforcement agencies.
Policy 1.8 Actively discourage the placement of waste incineration uses and use the siting criteria in the County’s Hazardous Waste Management Plan for the approval of hazardous waste facilities in the City.
Issue: Cultural Resources
While the history of the Cudahy area is tied to that of the Los Angeles region, significant cultural resources have not been identified in the City. Future demolition and excavation activities may uncover archaeological, paleontological or historical resources. The goal, policies and programs on cultural resources will provide direction on procedures to follow for the preservation of these resources in Cudahy.
Goal 2:	Promote the preservation of cultural, historical and natural resources within
the City.
Policy 2.1 Increase public awareness of the City’s history and cultural resources in the area.
Policy 2.2 Establish guidelines for the protection of sites of historical or cultural significance.
Issue: Energy Conservation
The use of energy for a wide variety of operations and activities has increased the demand for and the prices of available resources. While alternative sources of energy are under constant experimentation, decreases in the reliance on energy will help extend future availability and reduce costs associated with development and providing energy. Energy conservation is advocated by the City to help conserve dwindling resources.
Goal 3	Reduce energy consumption in public and private developments.
Policy 3.1 City facilities and equipment that utilize energy shall incorporate the most economically feasible energy-efficient design standards.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
6-3
Conservation Element (continued)
Policy 3.2 Encourage the incorporation of energy conservation features in the design of all new construction and the installation of conservation devices in existing developments.
Policy 3.3 Promote the use of passive design concepts, such as building orientation and landscaping, which make use of the natural climate to increase energy efficiency.
Policy 3.4 Encourage the use of cost-effective solar energy systems on new construction and consider enactment of a comprehensive solar access ordinance.
Policy 3.5 Encourage the efficient use of all energy resources through innovative, modern, and rational physical planning and architectural design.
Issue: Recycling
The conservation of land and other resources can be promoted by waste and product recycling practices. Waste recycling will help extend the life of landfills and reduce the demand for land devoted to waste disposal. Recycling also allows the more efficient use of natural resources by decreasing the demand for raw materials.
Goal 4 Increase the recycling of solid waste and the use of recycled material by glass and paper manufacturers.
Policy 4.1 Establish and implement solid waste management programs which reduce waste at the source, promote the reuse of all possible waste materials, and promote recycling and composting.
Policy 4.2 Promote programs for the recycling of waste products such as paper, aluminum, bottles and motor oil.
Policy 43 Maintain the efficiency of solid waste collection services in the City.

Conservation Element (continued)
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
The goals and policies of the Conservation Element will be implemented through a variety of programs for public and private developments. The City can encourage individuals to practice conservation measures in existing and future developments. It also has control on the conservation practices at City-owned offices, properties, and facilities. The following implementation programs will help achieve the City’s goals and policies regarding conservation. They are grouped under the same issues as the goals and policies in the previous section. The identification of funding sources for individual programs does not exclude the use of other funds that may be available.
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The natural environment and its resources can be protected from careless utilization through cooperative programs with other agencies, public awareness programs, and standards for existing and new developments. Programs that the City of Cudahy will implement to achieve the goals for protection of the environment are discussed below.
County Programs
The City of Cudahy shall cooperate with Los Angeles County departments on the implementation of programs for water conservation, stormwater discharge, solid waste management, and flood control. This will include projects and programs for the maintenance and use of the Los Angeles River. The City shall also coordinate with the Central Basin Municipal Water District on the management and use of local groundwater resources. This is an ongoing activity by the Department of Building and Public Services. It is financed by the General Fund.
Public Awareness
The City shall develop a public awareness program to encourage residents practice conservation measures and to discourage carelessness in activities that affect the environment. The program shall include articles on various environmental issues (air, water, hazardous materials, land, energy, etc.) and programs in the City newsletter; free water conservation tips, brochures and kits; advertisement of energy conservation alternatives and rebate programs; and the hazards of disposing household hazardous wastes with municipal wastes. Some of these programs are ongoing but the Department of Human Services shall coordinate the different activities with funding from the General Fund.

Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Adequate environmental review shall be provided for major projects and those that will have a potential to adversely impact the environment. Issue areas that will be addressed in the environmental review of development proposals include: earth and geology, air quality, water and hydrology, plant life, animal life, noise, light and glare, land use, natural resources, risk of upset, population, housing, traffic and circulation, public services, energy, utilities, human health, aesthetics, recreation, and cultural resources. In compliance with CEQA, the City shall also assign responsibilities for the verification of the implementation of mitigation measures. This is an ongoing program by the Community Development Department and is funded by the General Fund.
Environmental Laws
There are various federal, state and county regulations that deal with environmental protection and pollution control. The City shall keep abreast of all regulations and standards and shall cooperate with other agencies in the enforcement of these laws in Cudahy. This includes stormwater discharge regulations for construction activities and specific industries. The Department of Community Development is responsible for this program. It is ongoing and funded by the General Fund.
City Water Conservation
The City shall develop water conservation programs for City facilities (Civic Center, City parks, maintenance yards, etc.) This may include the retrofit of City facilities for water-efficient plumbing fixtures; the use of drought tolerant and/or xeriscape landscaping in City parks; and the posting of water conservation practices at all City facilities. This program shall be implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services in 1993 and will be funded by the General Fund.
Water Companies
The City shall explore the feasibility of joining the three water companies serving Cudahy. This may create greater efficiencies and standardization in water services. A more aggressive water conservation program can also be developed with a single entity or when cooperative agreements between the companies are in place. The City may also consider the feasibility of acquiring the water companies, as a means of coordinating local water services. This program shall be initiated by the Department of Building and Public Services in 1994 through the General Fund, to the extent available.
Drought Tolerant Landscaping
The City shall develop standards to promote the use of drought-tolerant and/or xeriscape landscaping in private developments. This will include measures to reduce irrigation requirements for yards (drip irrigation, tree wells, mulch, etc.) and recommended plant

SECTION 7: PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Public Safety Element of the Cudahy General Plan presents a citywide approach for preventing the creation of hazards in the planning area and for minimizing the potential for injury, damage and disruption brought by natural catastrophes and emergencies. The Element establishes safety standards and programs to protect life and property. Public safety standards include guidelines for activities involving risk to the public, as well as measures to follow when development occurs in areas susceptible to natural or manmade hazards. Public safety programs include procedures for the elimination and avoidance of hazards, emergency response during disasters and a reconstruction plan for the City after a disaster.
The Public Safety Element discusses both natural and manmade hazards such as earthquakes, floodplains, landslides, geologic hazards, urban and wildfire, and hazardous materials/wastes. The City of Cudahy is not located near any earthquake fault. Still, it will be subject to earthquake hazards associated with regional faults. While flood hazards do not exist in the City, inundation from dam failure of upstream dams and overflow of the Los Angeles River will affect the City. Geologic hazards in Cudahy are limited to the potential for liquefaction in certain sections of the City. Fire hazards consist of industrial uses, substandard structures, high pressure gas lines, high voltage power lines, and hazardous material handlers. Crime and violence are major threats in the City although they cannot be easily evaluated.
In dealing with hazards, it is prudent to consider prevention as the first step in hazard mitigation, where this is possible. This is accomplished by elimination of the hazard, isolation/avoidance of the hazard, or the regulation land uses and structures in known hazard areas. When prevention is not possible, the hazard must be planned for. Emergency planning means the formulation of strategies to minimize human injury, property damage, economic and social disruption. It prepares the City for a disaster and outlines ways to return the functions of the City to normal conditions soon after the disaster.
As a state-mandated element, the Public Safety Element of the Cudahy General Plan fulfills the requirements of Section 65302(g) of the California Government Code. It sets goals and policies which address public safety issues in the City. The Element also serves as a public safety plan, identifies standards and programs to promote public safety, and outlines adequate facilities and services to serve the emergency needs of the City. The Public Safety Element maps the location of known hazard areas and available evacuation routes, indicates peak water supply requirements, minimum road widths, clearances around structures, and provides safety and emergency procedures. This Element shall be submitted to the Department of Conservation - Division of Mines and Geology and the Office of Emergency Services for review prior to adoption.

City of Cudahy
General Plan
Public Safety Element (continued)
GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Public Safety Element were developed in response to safety issues affecting the City of Cudahy. The Public Safety Profile Report has identified manmade and natural hazards that may compromise the safety of residents. These are related to regional earthquakes, liquefaction potential, dam inundation, fire from industrial uses, gas pipes, substandard structures, hazardous material spills, crime, and accidents. Available emergency services have also been evaluated to determine their adequacy. The goals and policies below address the major safety issues in Cudahy. These are hazard reduction, emergency preparedness, and crime prevention.
Issue: Hazard Reduction
Disasters and emergencies are sometimes the result of natural and manmade factors that combine to endanger life and property. By recognizing the factors that contribute to the creation of hazards and developing ways to prevent such conditions, the City will be able to counteract or minimize the potential for harm and destruction. Hazard reduction is a major component in protecting life and property in the City.
Goal 1 Work to provide an environment that is reasonably safe from hazards.
Policy 1.1 Require geologic studies prior to the construction of critical facilities (hospitals, schools, fire stations, etc.).
Policy 1.2 Support the enforcement of state and federal laws on the control of hazardous wastes, landfills, and other issues.
Policy 1.3 Conduct an inventory of substandard structures and utilize the Uniform Building Code abatement process to eliminate or abate these hazards. In areas to be annexed by the City, the inventory of substandard structures and the abatement process shall be conducted after annexation.
Policy 1.4	Increase awareness of the hazards of fire and ways to prevent fire.
Policy 1.5	Establish emergency procedures for evacuation and/or relief for
identified hazards in the City.
Policy 1.6 Request that Fire Department and local law enforcement officials comment on proposed large developments during the environmental review process.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
7-2
Public Safety Element (continued)
Policy 1.7	Develop and implement programs to assist residents and businesses to dispose of household quantities of hazardous materials.
Policy 1.8	Develop health and safety programs as part of recreational services of the City.
Policy 1.9	Encourage the remediation of historic dumpsites and other identified contaminated sites in the City.
Issue: Emergency Preparedness
For hazards that cannot be predicted or prevented, the City can only provide the services necessary to reduce human injury, property damage, and social and economic disruption. These include fire protection and emergency services, police and law enforcement, hospital services, and emergency evacuation and shelters. Emergency preparedness will not reduce the potential for disaster, but will help to reduce the magnitude of human injury, property damage and social disruption.
Goal 2 Promote emergency preparedness.
Policy 2.1	Maintain the City’s emergency response system.
Policy 2.2	Provide for the highest quality of fire, police, and health protection possible, within reasonable economic limits, for all Cudahy residents.
Policy 2.3	Solicit volunteers to assist city operations during a disaster.
Policy 2.4	Maintain contingency plans which will help Cudahy citizens respond to and recover from an earthquake as quickly and effectively as possible.
Policy 2.5	Disseminate educational information to residents and businesses on ways to prepare for and prevent a disaster.
Policy 2.6	Encourage the LAUSD to teach emergency preparedness to students.
Policy 2.7	Regularly monitor the water quality, distribution and supply facilities to determine if capacity is adequate to meet emergency fireflow needs.
Policy 2.8	Explore the feasibility of requiring smoke detectors in private homes upon their sale or transfer of ownership.
City of Cudahy General Plan	7-3
Public Safety Element (continued)
Issue: Crime Prevention
Another major concern in Cudahy is the high incidence crime and violence that creates an unsafe environment for all residents. It is difficult to determine the actual factors that contribute to criminal or violent behavior, and police response must be a continuous activity. Efforts to control crime in Cudahy will protect residents from constant threats to their property and safety. Policies and programs to reduce, deter, and punish crime will increase area-wide public safety.
Goal 3 Minimize crime incidence in the City.
Policy 3.1 Work with local law enforcement officials and neighboring police departments to eliminate gang violence.
Policy 3.2 Develop programs to reduce and/or prevent graffiti and drug abuse.
Policy 3.3 Encourage the development of neighborhood watch programs and inform residents and businesses of ways to prevent crime.
Policy 3.4 Promote crime prevention through public information and awareness programs.

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
The following implementation programs identify existing and planned programs that will help improve public safety in Cudahy. The programs address various ways for the City to prevent hazardous situations and provide services to keep disasters under control. Exhibit 7-1 shows existing hazards in the City and Exhibit 7-2 locates emergency services and facilities. The hazards in the planning area cannot be totally eliminated and emergency service provision will depend on the level of safety that is economically viable to the City. The commitment to public safety programs outlined below will depend on the level of safety that the City would like to achieve, with consideration of the available physical and financial resources and manpower. The identification of a funding source(s) for individual programs does not exclude the use of other funding sources that may be available.
HAZARD REDUCTION
Hazard reduction is the primary goal for providing an environment that is safe and secure. With the identified hazards in the planning area, the programs below address the reduction and/or elimination of hazardous conditions and the prevention of future hazardous conditions.
Geologic Studies
As part of the development review process, the City shall require the preparation of geologic studies prior to the approval of critical facilities, uses which involve the assembly of large numbers of people, large scale residential developments, and major commercial and industrial projects. The studies will help define the potential environmental impacts on earth and geology of new development, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The environmental review process for proposed projects prior to approval analyzes impacts on other issue areas. Mitigation measures to reduce adverse impacts shall be made conditions of approval, along with the mitigation monitoring program. This is an ongoing program by the Community Development Department, with funding from the General Fund.
Environmental Laws
There are various federal, state and county regulations that deal with environmental protection and pollution control. The City shall keep abreast of all regulations and standards and shall cooperate with other agencies in the enforcement of these laws in Cudahy. The Department of Community Development is responsible for this program. It is ongoing and funded by the General Fund.

Hazardous Materials Regulation
The City shall encourage the implementation of the County’s Hazardous Waste Management Plan. It shall maintain a current inventory of hazardous material users and generators and incorporate their emergency response programs into the City’s Emergency Plan. It shall work with the County Fire Department in requiring hazardous materials users and generators to prepare safety procedures for responding to accidental spills and emergencies. The City shall also work with local law enforcement officials in regulating the transport of hazardous materials through the City. Hazardous waste facilities shall be regulated in compliance with the siting criteria contained in the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan. The City shall coordinate the disposal of small quantities of hazardous wastes from residences and businesses in the City. This program shall be initiated by the Department of Community Services and the Department of Community Development in 1993. It shall be funded by the General Fund.
Toxic Waste Dumping and Waste Incineration
The City shall develop deterrents to toxic waste dumping in the City and inform residents and businesses of fines and penalties associated with such acts. Waste incineration shall also be discouraged through regulations of the physical, operational and environmental characteristics of such uses. This will help prevent soil, air, and groundwater contamination in the planning area. The siting criteria in the County’s Hazardous Waste Management Plan shall be used to review proposed hazardous waste facilities in the City. This program shall be initiated in 1993 by the Department of Community Development with funding from the General Fund.
Groundwater Wells
The Public Safety Profile Report briefly discusses the soil contamination problems on the current site of the Park Avenue School. While measures have been provided to prevent the seepage of contaminants to the surface, ground remediation is necessary to remove soil contamination and prevent future groundwater contamination. The City shall encourage continued monitoring of groundwater wells near the Park Avenue School and Cudahy Park for potential groundwater contamination. Water quality at local wells shall also be monitored for contaminants. The City shall encourage and coordinate with other agencies on site remediation projects at the earliest possible time. This is an ongoing program by the Department of Community Development with funding from the General Fund.
Code Enforcement
The City shall continue code enforcement efforts to encourage property maintenance. This includes the identification of nuisances which endanger public health and safety and the provision of technical support or other incentive to allow early correction of the problem.

The City shall also work towards the identification and renovation of structures which do not meet current seismic safety standards and electrical code requirements. In areas that are subject to annexation, the inventory and rehabilitation of substandard structures shall be made after these areas are annexed to the City. Code enforcement is an ongoing activity and will continue to be financed through CDBG funds. The rehabilitation of substandard structures shall be the responsibility of individual property owners, with CDBG funds available for qualified homeowners. To the extent available, redevelopment funds may also be used for this program.
Fire Prevention
The City shall develop fire prevention programs to promote fire safety in the City. This shall include fire prevention and protection information and tips in the City newsletter and local newspapers. It shall also include Fire Department and law enforcement officials review of proposed buildings plans to solicit recommendations on fire protection, crime prevention, and other safety measures. The City shall also encourage periodic inspections by the Fire Department of existing structures, for compliance with fire safety standards and practices. This is an ongoing program by the Department of Building and Public Services. It is financed by the General Fund. As part of this program, the City shall explore ways to require existing single family homes to install smoke detectors prior to a transfer of ownership.
Fire Access
The provision of adequate roadway widths will facilitate emergency response during a disaster. Roadway standards have been established by the County Fire Department to ensure access for firefighting equipment to all areas in the City. The standards specify that every building should be accessible to Fire Department apparatus by way of access roadways with all-weather driving surface capable of supporting the imposed loads of fire apparatus of not less than 20 feet of unobstructed width, clear to the sky, and with adequate roadway turning radius. Fire lanes are needed when an exterior wall of a building is located more than 150 feet from a public vehicle access. This applies to Cudahy's long and narrow lots. Minimum driveway widths are required to be maintained clear at all times. Fire access standards are implemented by the Fire Prevention Bureaus during the plan check process. This ongoing program is coordinated by the Department of Building and Public Services. Emergency Plan
The City has an Emergency Plan which outlines responsibilities and procedures to follow in the event of an emergency or city-wide disaster. It discusses the potential emergency situations in the City and outlines responsibilities for emergency preparedness and emergency response. Specific emergency functions and operations, available resources (fire stations, emergency shelters, hospitals and clinics, resource persons, etc.), and mutual aid
City of Cudahy

agreements are also provided. Exhibit 7-3 shows designated evacuation routes in Cudahy. The City shall regularly update and implement its Multi-Hazard Functional Plan for Emergency Operations. This is an ongoing activity by the Emergency Services Coordinator, with binding from the General Fund. In order to keep city staff informed of their responsibilities, annual reviews and drills shall be performed. Also, a summary or pamphlet of the procedures and responsibilities shall be provided to involved individuals for easy reference.
Plan Check
All new development shall continue to be subject to the plan check process. This ensures compliance with the Uniform Building Code, Fire Code, Mechanical Code and other development codes and standards. It will help guarantee that all structures are built with sound construction and engineering methods, can resist groundshaking from earthquake events, and incorporates fire prevention and protection features. The Department of Building and Public Services is responsible for this program. It is financed by the General Fund.
Safety Measures
The City shall continue to use the City newsletter and local newspapers to increase public awareness on safety, crime prevention, fire prevention, earthquake preparedness and other practical safety measures. Also, it shall offer earthquake preparedness, first aid and CPR classes as part of the recreational and library programs in the City. These and other public programs to increase emergency preparedness and promote public safety for residents and businesses shall be initiated by the Department of Community Services in 1993, with funding from the General Fund.
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
The City of Cudahy can reduce the impacts of natural hazards by emergency preparedness programs. Although the City of Cudahy is not within or near a seismic hazard zone, it will be subject to groundshaking and other hazards associated with earthquake events. Emergency preparedness provides the City and its residents with established procedures to minimize human injury, property damage, and economic and social disruption during a disaster. By setting standards for emergency response and services, the City will be able to control the degree of injury and damage that accompanies an emergency situation. By encouraging individuals make their residences and businesses safe and equipped to deal with a disaster, there would be less demand for public emergency services. The following programs will increase emergency preparedness in the City.

Police and Fire Protection Services
The City shall regularly review the adequacy of police/law enforcement services and fire protection and emergency services in the City. This shall be part of the annual budget review of contracts with the County Fire Department and the local law enforcement officials. The City shall work with local law enforcement officials and the County Fire Department to correct any identified deficiencies. It shall also request that local law enforcement officials and the Fire Department to review proposed development plans. In this way, they can recommend measures that will decrease fire potential and crime and facilitate quicker response. This program is ongoing and performed by the Department of Community Services and Community Development. It is financed by the General Fund, to the extent available.
Fireflow Capacity
The City shall work with local water companies to determine the adequacy of emergency water in their systems. Reservoir capacity is considered adequate if it can hold enough water to provide continuous fireflow for at least 10 hours plus peak day demand. The City’s total fireflow need is estimated at 2.8 million gallons per day or 4,640 gallons per minute from all three water companies. This figure plus peak day demand shall be the minimum reservoir capacity available to the City. The City shall regularly monitor the pressure of existing fire hydrants to determine fireflow capacity for emergency situations. Any new development shall be required to upgrade fire hydrants, in order to supply the minimum fireflow needs of their service area. This ongoing program is implemented by the Department of Building and Public Services, with funding from the General Fund. Volunteer Program
The City shall seek to utilize volunteers in disaster recovery programs and other emergency situations. It shall actively solicit for volunteers to serve the City during emergencies and offer a training program for these volunteers. All volunteer resources persons shall be included in the City’s list of resources with their individual responsibilities. This program shall be implemented in 1993 by the Department of Community Services through the General Fund.
Disaster Reconstruction Plan
The City shall include a disaster reconstruction plan in its Emergency Plan. The plan will outline measures to maintain control and organize operations after a disaster. It shall include responsibilities for clean-up, aid and funding acquisition, private development assistance, and other projects to minimize the economic and social disruption of the disaster. This will be initiated by the Emergency Services Coordinator in 1994, with funding from the General Fund.

This shall include schools, auditoriums, gymnasiums, hospitals, and other structures which have large open areas to accommodate cots and provide mass care and emergency assistance. Additional structures shall be explored and agreements sought with property owners for the potential use of the facilities in cases of a disaster or emergency. The list of emergency shelters shall be made available to all residents, along with emergency facilities and evacuation routes. This will inform them of the services available in the event of a city-wide disaster. This program shall be initiated by the Emergency Services Coordinator in 1994 with funding from the General Fund.
CRIME PREVENTION
With limited understanding on the forces that drive a person to commit crimes, acts of violence, or unlawful activities, crime prevention takes on a defensive position. The main objectives of crime prevention include establishing ways that make it difficult to commit a crime, or promote features that resist criminal elements, and apprehend perpetrators. Ongoing and proposed programs to reduce crime incidence in Cudahy are discussed below. Anti-gang and Anti-drug Programs
The City shall work with local law enforcement officials on anti-drug and anti-gang programs. This will help reduce crimes in the City that are due to gang activity and drug abuse. The program also allows the use of confiscated property for increase anti-drug and anti-gang efforts. This program is ongoing and coordinated by the City Manager.
Graffiti Removal
The City shall develop guidelines for the landscaping of large areas of blank walls to hide and prevent vandalism and graffiti.

SECTION 8 : NOISE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Excessive noise levels disturb and disrupt human activities and can affect the physical and psychological health of individuals. They depreciate the quality of the environment by affecting work, sleep, and recreation. The Noise Element of the Cudahy General Plan provides measures to minimize noise problems in the City. With the majority of the planning area devoted to residential uses, it is important that noise sources are controlled at the source, are located away from residential communities, or buffers are provided between the sources of noise and residential areas. The noise mitigation program in the Noise Element explores these options, along with noise insulation standards and land use compatibility along major noise corridors.
The Noise Element Profile Report contains a discussion of the characteristics and effects of noise, state and federal guidelines on noise control, and an evaluation of the existing noise environment in the City. Noise levels from traffic along major roads and highways are provided and noise contours are plotted to show areas which are subject to noise impacts. The Profile Report discusses the location of noise-sensitive land uses and the various noise sources, with the intent of buffering and/or separating these uses.
Projections of the future noise environment at build-out of the Land Use Plan are provided in the Noise Element. They serve as a basis for determining noise problems that may occur with future development. The Noise Element can then more effectively establish guidelines for controlling noise levels in the City and control, reduce or prevent significant increases in noise levels.
As mandated by the California Government Code Section 65302(f), the Noise Element follows the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control of the State Department of Health Services. Noise contour maps identify existing noise levels in the City and projected noise levels due to future traffic. Goals, policies, and guidelines for minimizing increases in ambient noise levels are outlined below.
8-1
City of Cudahy
General Plan
Noise Element (continued)
GOALS AND POLICIES
The two main areas of concerns of the Noise Element is the protection of noise-sensitive land uses from excessive noise and the control of noise sources from affecting other land uses in the City. The goals and policies below address these issues. They were developed in recognition of existing noise sensitive uses and noise sources in the City. The goals and policies separate noise sources, where possible, and regulate uses that would occur within or near these areas.
Issue: Noise Sensitive Uses
Noise-sensitive land uses in the City of Cudahy include the residential areas (which cover nearly 60 percent of the land area), mobile home parks, schools, the library, and local churches. They represent users and activities that could be easily disturbed or annoyed by noise levels beyond acceptable standards. The mitigation of existing and protected noise problems will include the reduction of noise levels within these areas.
Goal 1 Prevent any increase in the established acceptable ambient levels of sound in the residential areas of the community.
Policy 1.1 Consider the inclusion of noise-impacted areas in redevelopment or other programs which would permit assistance for the residents with relocation, rehabilitation, or insulation of their structures and properties.
Policy 1.2 Consider steps to correct existing noise problem areas through the establishment of buffers and barriers or through abatement procedures.
Policy 1.3 Discourage the location of unbuffered noise sources near residential areas and schools.
Issue: Noise Sources
Noise in the City comes primarily from roadway traffic. Roadway noise levels are highest along Atlantic Avenue, Salt Lake Avenue, and the Long Beach Freeway. Train noises affect areas on the western and southern edge of Cudahy. Stationary noise sources include commercial uses on Atlantic Avenue and industrial uses on the southern section of the City. Noise from these uses need to be controlled to reduce their impacts on adjacent uses.

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM OF LAND USE PLAN AND NOISE
Noise issues in the City may be addressed by a city-wide noise mitigation program. The program will include various ways to control noise in the City, prevent the creation of noise problems, and improve the living environment.
As identified in the Noise Profile Report, noise problems in the City include vehicular traffic on city streets and the Long Beach Freeway. Industrial and commercial activities also present noise concerns to adjacent uses. The location of mobile home parks within industrial and commercial areas exposes all mobile home residents to stationary noise from these land uses. Residential areas beside the railroad tracks are affected by train noise. Schools, the library and City parks are not located in noisy areas, although they may be exposed to freeway noise.
The Land Use Plan for the City of Cudahy recognizes the existing noise concerns in the City. Thus, it calls for the eventual relocation of mobilehome parks from the industrial and commercial areas and into the more quiet residential neighborhoods. Also, Atlantic Avenue is a high-volume traffic corridor and land uses along this roadway have been limited to commercial and commercial-manufacturing uses. The Regional Center Overlay is located in the southern section of the City, where it is least likely to impact residential areas. And the future relocation of the Civic Center to a site on Atlantic Avenue will help reduce vehicle noise on Santa Ana Street. These land use decisions respond to the need to avoid increases in noise levels within residential areas and to control noise sources from adversely affecting City residents.
Aside from the existing noise environment, noise levels at buildout of the Land Use Plan were estimated using projected traffic volumes for 2010. As with the existing noise levels, the Federal Highway Administration Noise Prediction Model was used estimate roadway noise levels along City streets. Table 8-1 provides the distance of the 65, 60 and 55 CNEL noise contours from the roadway centerline and Exhibit 8-1 shows the future noise contours. Although the exhibit does not account for noise buffers and barriers within each development, uses in areas within the 65 CNEL contour will generally be subject to high noise levels.

The Land Use Plan recognizes the continued operations of railroad operations through the City. Several variables must be taken into account in determining actual noise levels produced by line operations. For the locomotive, the noise emitted by the engine is independent of the train’s velocity; however, the noise output of the locomotive is highly dependent on track grade conditions. Slowing down or movement on the spur tracks will result in increased noise output emanating from braking equipment.
8-5
City of Cudahy
General Plan
Noise Element (continued)
Car noise, attributed to wheel/rail noise, is highly dependent on speed, increasing approximately 6 dB for each doubling of train velocity. A number of other variables, primarily relating to physical track or wheel conditions, is also significant in influencing wheel/rail generated noise.
These factors include:
■	Type of rails (welded or joints) 4 to 8 dBA increases.
■	Condition of wheels on cars up to 8 dBA
■	Configuration of railroad right-of-way (linear vs. curved) 10 to 15 dBA
■	Grade crossings and signal controls - 6 to 8 dBA
The lines through the City are generally linear and with the exception of the rail spurs that provide connections to the individual parcels. The Southern Pacific rail line travels along the southern border of the City and does not impact any noise sensitive land uses. The greatest potential for noise impacts or noise sensitive land uses comes from the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad located immediately adjacent to Salt Lake Avenue. On the average, train noise will range from between 60 to 70 dBA at fifty feet depending on the length and speed of the train. Noise contours from the railroads are depicted in Exhibit 8-1.
The redesignation of the City’s industrial section to Commercial Manufacturing, with a Regional Center Overlay in some areas is expected to promote the redevelopment of the existing smaller and older industrial uses. This will help reduce noise from industrial activities in the City. Present industrial noise levels would then represent a worst case estimate of future noise levels in the area. Potential areas of significant stationary noise sources are shown in Exhibit 8-1.
NOISE MITIGATION PLAN
In order to protect residents from the disruptive and health effects of excessive noise, the City shall develop a noise mitigation program. The noise mitigation program for Cudahy shall expand existing regulations relating to noise and establish standards for controlling noise sources and their impacts. This may include the provision of noise barriers (berms, walls, etc.), buffer areas or setbacks, increased insulation, blank exterior walls, double-paned windows, noise-masking sounds, mufflers, and other noise control devices and building features. Vibration that affects adjacent properties shall also be regulated.

The City shall require an acoustical analysis for projects that have the potential for generating excessive noise levels or those uses which would be developed adjacent to a noise source. The study shall include existing ambient noise levels from mobile and stationary sources. It shall estimate cumulative noise levels at implementation of the project. The estimates shall be provided for both interior and exterior areas on site. Specific measures to reduce projected noise levels to acceptable standards shall be identified. Table 8-2 provides noise compatibility criteria by land use.

City of Cudahy
General Plan
Noise Element (continued)
with the noise regulations of federal and state agencies, as summarized in the Noise Profile Report, shall be monitored by the City. They include noise standards for industrial operations, federally-funded projects, motor vehicles, airport noise, classrooms, libraries and other educational facilities, multi-family residential uses, hotels, and motels.
With most of the City developed, noise abatement can be implemented during rehabilitation or redevelopment activities, or as part of the code enforcement process. Redevelopment projects shall comply with City noise standards and, to the extent funds are available for these purposes, the Agency shall provide assistance to the residents of affected properties with relocation, rehabilitation, or insulation of their structures and properties.
The noise mitigation program shall also identify noisy activities and operations and provide guidelines to reduce disturbance on adjacent uses. Noise-generating activities will include construction equipment and activity noise, sports events, use of play areas, power mowers and leaf blowers, garbage collection and truck traffic and deliveries, false car or security alarms, large gatherings and other outdoor activities. Limitations in the hours of operation and the length of operation will contribute in large part to the reduction of noise from these uses. Noise during the nighttime and the early morning hours are more disruptive and the regulation of activities during these times will prevent adverse noise impacts.
The City shall also work with agencies who may be involved in noise control or noise creation in the City. They include the California Department of Transportation (freeway noise), L.A. Department of Airports (overhead aircraft), local law enforcement officials (helicopters and sirens), Southern Pacific and Union and Electric Railroad Companies (train traffic), Department of Motor Vehicles (vehicle noise), Department of Labor (OSHA workplace noise), Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (subsidized housing projects), California Office of Noise Control (noise standards) and others. Coordination with these agencies will allow the City to work towards preventing or minimizing future increases in noise levels in Cudahy. The noise mitigation program shall be initiated and implemented by the Department of Community Development in 1993, with financing from the General Fund, to the extent available. Other funding sources may be used for this program, as they become available.

NORMALLY ACCEPTABLE
Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation features included in the design. Conventional construction, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally suffice.
NORMALLY UNACCEPTABLE New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features indued in the design.
CLEARLY UNACCEPTABLE
New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.
CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINATION OF NOISE-COMPATIBLE LAND USE
A.	NORMALIZED NOISE EXPOSURE DESIRED	C.	SUITABLE INTERIOR ENVIRONMENTS
Where sufficient dale exbte, evaluate land uee suitability with respect to a ‘normalized" value of CNEL or Ldn . Normalized values are obtained by adding or subtracting the constants described in Table 1 to the measured or calculated value of CNtL or Ldn.
B.	NOISE SOURCE CHARACTERISTICS
The land use-noise compatibility recommendations should be viewed in relation lo the specific source of Ihe noise. For example, aircraft and railroad noise b normally made up of higher single noise events than auto traffic but occurs less frequently. Therefore, different sources yielding the same composite noise exposure do not necessarily create Ihe same noise environment. The State Aeronautics Act uses S5dB CNEL as the criterion ahrieh airports must eventually meet to protect existing residential communities from unacceptable exposure to aircraft noise. In order to tacltHate the purposes of the Act, one of which b to encourage Land uses compatible with the S5dB CNEL crtlerton wherever possible end in order lo fsciidate the ability of airports to comply with the Act, residential uses located In Community Nobe Exposure Areas greater than 65dB should ba discouraged and considered located within normally unacceptable areas.
One objective of locating residential units relative to a known noise source is to maintain a suitable Intenor noise environment at no greater then 45 dB CNEL of Ldn. Thb requirement, coupled with the measured or calculated nobs reduction performance of the type of structure under consideration, should govern the minimum acceptable distance to a nobe source.
D. ACCEPTABLE OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS
Another consideration, whkh in some communiles b an overriding factor, b the desire tor an acceptable outdoor noise environment When thb b the case, more restrictive standards for land use compatibility, typically below the maximum considered 'normally acceptable' for that land use category, may be appropriate.

SECTION 9: AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Southern California’s air quality is severely degraded, despite 45 years of the most stringent pollution control in the nation. State and federal air quality standards for many pollutants, which are set to protect public health, are violated more frequently than in other sections of the United States or California.
The South Coast Air Basin of California, which includes Orange County and the non-desert areas of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties, has the most polluted air in the nation. It is the only area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as having "extreme" air pollution. Congress enacted amendments to the federal Clean Air Act in 1990 that extended the deadline for attainment, based on the severity of a region’s pollution. The deadline for the South Coast Basin is 2010.
Early efforts in air pollution control focused on reducing industrial emissions, later expanding to include emissions from automobiles. More recently, efforts have also been directed to changing the use of automobile, land, and energy sources of emissions rather than on technological controls. Both the federal and California Clean Air Acts require that areas of the nation and state that do not meet air quality standards must implement transportation control measures and reduce overall emissions by 3 to 5% a year. The California Clean Air Act gave air pollution control and air quality management districts authority to adopt indirect source regulations over facilities that attract large numbers of automobiles.
Because implementation of these actions is largely a local responsibility, local governments are being asked to take a stronger role in air pollution control than they did in implementing the 1979 and 1982 AQMP’s. Although air quality elements are not required by state law, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), which are the agencies designated by the governor to develop and revise the regional air quality plan, strongly encourage local governments to adopt air quality elements or their equivalents in their general plans in order to conform to requirements of the adopted 1991 AQMP.
The 1991 AQMP was developed by SCAG and the SCAQMD to address requirements of the California Clean Air Act. It was approved by the SCAQMD on July 12, 1991, after prior approval by SCAG, and is the implementation plan for state and local purposes. Additional revisions are required to conform to the federal Clean Air Act; therefore, the 1991 AQMP is not the approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) for federal purposes.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
9-1
Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
Guidelines for the Development of Local Air Quality Elements have been prepared by SCAG. These guidelines contain a number of actions which are recommended or required for local governments in order to conform to the 1991 AQMP.
Local Implementation Requirements of the 1991 Air Quality Management Plan
Local governments are required by the 1991 AQMP to implement specified AQMP measures, but the 1991 AQMP differs from the earlier 1989 AQMP in how local governments must comply. Truck restriction and parking management, including policies to revise parking codes, are the only measures required by the 1991 AQMP for inclusion in an air quality element for a city without a large special event center. Bicycle routes which facilitate home/work commuting are required in a general plan, although not necessarily in an air quality element. Other measures can be implemented through adoption of ordinances at least as stringent as model ordinances to be developed by the SCAQMD.
The 1991 AQMP requires local governments to adopt ordinances for the following strategies:
■	Person Work Trip Reduction
■	Non-motorized Transportation
■	Employer	Rideshare and	Transit	Incentives
■	Auto Use	Restrictions
■	Parking Management
■	Merchant	Transportation	Incentives
■	Auto Use	Restrictions
■	Truck Dispatching, Rescheduling and Rerouting
The SCAQMD declared its intent to adopt backstop rules that would be imposed in any city where implementation ordinances are determined by the SCAQMD to be inadequate. Additional local government measures, including control of emissions associated with new construction and reducing emissions from energy use, are also suggested in the AQMP.
Those measures for which the SCAQMD intends to adopt model ordinances are described in Appendix IV-E of the 1991 AQMP and summarized in Table 9-1:

Southern California cities differ significantly in size and character. Therefore, some recommended actions are not applicable to all cities. Other programs need to be tailored to meet the unique conditions of each city.
AQMP Conformity
Large development projects are required by the 1991 AQMP to demonstrate that they conform to the adopted AQMP. The type and size of projects that are covered by the conformity review requirements and for which an analysis must be provided to the Southern California Association of Governments are listed in Table 2. Because Cudahy is small in area and because it is already developed, there are few large tracts of land available for projects of the size requiring conformity review. Redevelopment projects are likely to be in-fill projects and not of a type or size threshold that requires a demonstration of conformity.

Existing City of Cudahy Conditions Impacting Air Quality Planning
All transportation, and some land use, measures in the 1991 AQMP are directed at reducing emissions from automobiles, but not all are equally applicable to the region’s cities. Each city has unique economic, demographic, growth, size, etc. characteristics that make some of the measures infeasible and require that others be adapted to meet the City’s needs in order for them to be effective. Therefore, adoption of uniform ordinances is not practical for every city.
The goals, policies and implementation programs contained in the City of Cudahy Air Quality Element have been developed to meet the underlying goals of the 1991 AQMP, but
City of Cudahy
General Plan
9-6
Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
have been tailored to support other elements of the General Plan and to achieve regional air quality goals through strategies appropriate for the City of Cudahy.
Existing programs and conditions in the City of Cudahy that impact on air quality in order to identify opportunities and constraints for new or modified programs are summarized below:
Land Uses
The City is largely residential, with only a very small portion of the City zoned R-l. The remainder of the residential area is R-3. Cudahy is almost entirely built out, with virtually no open land remaining. Population density is very high. Housing conditions are described in detail in the Background Report for the Housing Element. The Draft Land Use Plan promotes recycling of older residential units, which will have the potential to slightly increase the number of units in the City.
Many of the multi-residential lots have limited off-street parking. Parking is prohibited on city streets between the hours of 2 AM and 4 AM, thus eliminating streets as a place to supplement on-site parking.
The City’s industrial area lies along the southern boundary with the City of South Gate and along Salt Lake Avenue. Approximately one tenth of the City is in industrial use. Industrial facilities are small and are largely engaged in light manufacturing and fabricating iron, steel, plastic, and fiberglass products. As indicated by emissions totals for the City, the cumulative impact of these industries on air quality is small compared to cities with one or more large industrial emitters.
Cudahy’s commercial area is along Atlantic Avenue. There are no large subregional shopping centers, but several large grocery stores, convenience malls, and restaurants attract some visitors from adjacent communities.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
9-7
Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
Job/Housing Balance
One of the major objectives of the 1989 AQMP was to achieve greater balance between housing and employment opportunities throughout the region. The basis for this policy was that workers could be expected to reduce vehicle miles traveled if they lived where there was greater opportunity for employment in the vicinity of their residences. The 1991 AQMP retained the emissions reductions achievable through jobs/housing balance, but allows local governments to consider the substitution of other programs which achieve equivalent reductions in vehicle miles traveled as well as achieving the jobs/housing targets identified in the 1989 AQMP.
Cudahy is in the Central Los Angeles subregion. For the subregion as a whole, the ratio of jobs to housing units was estimated to be 1.85 in 1984. Jobs and housing are considered to be "balanced" at a ratio of 1.2. The subregion is projected to increase jobs more than housing units by 2010, based on current trends. Therefore, a goal of 1.83 jobs per housing unit was set for 2010.
The jobs/housing ratios do not consider the number of potential employees per housing unit. Areas with high population density usually have both more workers per household and more housing units per acre than areas with lower density. Cudahy’s high population density means that it is contributing workers to jobs in neighboring cities within the subregion. It is likely that population density, as well as the number of housing units, will increase as older single family houses are replaced with higher density townhouses and apartments.
To be consistent with SCAG’s 1991 AQMP growth management goals, Cudahy would either need to add jobs through redevelopment of its industrial area, reach agreements with surrounding cities showing that its housing surplus is being accounted for by countervailing job surpluses in the subregion and by subregional job/housing planning,or implement transportation control measures to achieve the subregional "vehicle miles traveled" (VMT) equivalent targets specified in the 1991 AQMP, or a combination of the above.
Transportation
The City is served by the Southern California Rapid Transit District (RTD), which has intercity routes along Atlantic Avenue, Clara Street and Wilcox Avenue. The nearest freeway access is to the Long Beach Freeway (Route 710), on Florence Avenue across the Los Angeles River through the cities of Bell and Bell Gardens. Through Proposition A funds, the City provides free bus service to all residents on demand anywhere within the city, as well as to adjacent communities within a five mile radius.

Stationary sources are primarily industrial. Local industries covered by SCAQMD regulations include metal platers; manufacturers of fiberglass and plastic products; facilities which store organic solvents; degreasing equipment; and use of materials which emit hazardous air pollutants. Commercial restaurants with charbroilers are subject to AQMD regulations. Roadway dust and construction particulate emissions are also included as stationary sources in the inventory.
Area source emissions include emissions from service stations and from domestic products such as solvents and cleaners, as well as from natural gas used for heating and cooking.
Transportation emissions include all traffic generated or ending in Cudahy, as well as traffic passing through the City. There are no large sources which attract traffic within the city and no employers are covered by the SCAQMD Regulation XV, which XV requires trip reduction plans by all employers of more than 100 persons. The 1991 AQMP proposes to lower the covered threshold to 50 employees.
Communications
Cudahy is served by the weekly Industrial Post newspaper, which also serves the cities of Bell and Maywood. The Cudahy Chamber of Commerce, reinstituted in February 1991, and the Cudahy Businessmen’s Association represent the interests of the business community.

Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
GOALS AND POLICIES
The Goals and Policies of the Air Quality Element were developed to support the regional Air Quality Management Plan by reducing locally-generated emissions. Consistent with the AQMP, goals and policies are directed at reducing emissions associated with automobile use, energy consumption, and building and construction.
ISSUE:	Person Work Trip Reduction.
Light duty automobiles, as a group, will remain a significant contributor to ozone and carbon monoxide air pollution, despite significant reductions from this source that will occur even without additional controls. The California Air Resources Board has adopted stringent new controls on future passenger vehicles that by 2010 will result in reductions of reactive organic gas, an ozone precursor, of 61% and carbon monoxide emissions of 67% from 1987 levels. Without projected population and travel growth, emissions reductions would be even greater. The City can assist regional efforts to reduce vehicle emissions by encouraging automobile trip reduction programs that serve to offset trip increases associated with population growth. These programs can either be directed at reducing the total number of trips or shifting single occupant automobile trips to alternative modes of travel. Examples of such alternatives include bicycle trips.
Goal 1 Reduce automobile use.
Policy 1.1 Allow telecommuting by public employees on a case by case basis, where analysis shows it is feasible.
Policy 1.2 Support trip-reduction programs, such as longer day, shorter week work schedules on a case by case basis for public employees, where analysis show that it is feasible.
Policy 1.3 Support policies that reduce or eliminate obstacles to telecommuting.
Policy 1.4 Encourage employers in surrounding communities to support establishment of a telecommuting center in Cudahy.
Policy 1.5 Encourage development of a Transportation Management Association in Cudahy to serve public and private employees.
Policy 1.6 Support legislation favoring vanpools.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
9-10
Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
Goal 2 Encourage use of non-motorized transportation.
Policy 2.1 Encourage walking trips by residents and local employees in lieu of automobile trips.
Policy 2.2 Encourage bicycle trips by providing bicycle paths or safe bicycle access between residential areas and employment centers, schools and recreation areas, where feasible.
Policy 2.3 Require that any future large employment center provide bicycle lockers and storage, where bicycle access is feasible.
Goal 3 Reduce vehicle emissions through greater use of public transportation.
Policy 3.1 Enhance transit performance and availability, and make the local transit system user-friendly by providing safe, attractive places to wait.
Policy 3.2 Facilitate connections of CART to regional transit.
Policy 3.3 Insure that information on public transit is readily available to Cudahy residents and employees.
Policy 3.4 Insure that new development incorporates features that facilitate transit.
ISSUE:	Truck Programs.
Trucks contribute to air pollution by increasing congestion when competing with automobiles during peak hours, through involvement in freeway accidents which lead to extensive vehicle slowing and idling, and through direct emissions of pollutants, especially particulates. Programs which divert truck traffic to less congested periods increase traffic flow, which reduces emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, as well as improving truck delivery efficiency by reducing travel time.
Goal 4 Reduce Roadway Congestion.
Policy 4.1 Encourage truck operations to divert peak hour travel, whenever feasible, to off peak periods to reduce roadway congestion and associated emissions.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
9-11
Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
Policy 4.2 Encourage local facilities which receive trucks to adjust schedules, wherever feasible, to receive deliveries in off-peak hours.
ISSUE:	Parking Management,
Availability of parking tends to encourage automobile trips that could otherwise be eliminated or made by other means. The 1991 Air Quality Management Plan calls for local measures that will reduce the supply of parking or encourage greater turnover of parking spaces through new restrictions or enforcement of existing restrictions on parking. Poor parking space design or access can also contribute to air pollution by slowing traffic on adjacent streets or by causing idling within the parking lot or structure.
Goal 5 Reduce vehicle emissions through improved parking management and design.
Policy 5.1 Consider reducing parking requirements for both new and existing structures and developments where analysis shows that parking can serve two or more non-competing uses.
Policy 5.2 Review parking requirements for new developments on a case by case basis and consider reducing parking requirements where present and future access to public transportation can be assured.
Policy 5.3 Support community activities where parking is temporarily restricted and walking or public transit is facilitated.
Policy 5.4 Continue existing city policy of restricting parking on city streets between 2 AM and 4 AM to discourage excess automobile use per dwelling unit.
Policy 5.5 Consider limiting parking on congested arterial streets.
Policy 5.6 Promote parking facility designs which discourage queuing.
ISSUE:	Growth Management.
When housing is located far from available employment and necessary shopping and services, residents are forced to drive longer distances than when jobs, housing, and services are in close proximity. Longer trips contributes to greater automobile emissions of air pollutants.
City of Cudahy
General Plan
9-12
Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
Goal 6 Reduce emissions associated with vehicle miles traveled by providing a balance of jobs and housing.
Policy 6.1 Work cooperatively with adjacent job-rich communities to improve overall job/housing balance in the subarea.
Policy 6.2 Support economic development policies which promote opportunities for employment within the City.
Policy 6.3 Support economic development policies which promote a balance of shopping and services necessary for the City’s residential sector.
ISSUE:	Energy Consumption.
Use of electricity and consumption of natural gas produce emissions. As with automobiles, the benefits of recently adopted controls on energy production and appliances are reduced by the increase in usage associated with population growth. Energy conservation programs that reduce current and future consumption can more than offset future usage and maximize the benefits of power plant and furnace and water heater controls.
Goal 7 Reduce emissions associated with energy consumption.
Policy 7.1 Support the use of energy-efficient equipment and design in City facilities and infrastructure.
Policy 7.2 Encourage incorporation of energy conservation features, including passive solar, in new construction and rehabilitation of existing structures.
Policy 7.3 Support recycling programs which reduce emissions associated with manufacture and waste disposal.
Policy 7.4 Utilize drought resistant vegetation in city landscaping to reduce energy needed to pump water.
ISSUE:	Particulate Emissions.
Fine particulate matter (PM 10) is produced by travel on paved and unpaved roadways, by windblown dust when soil is disturbed, and by erosion from exposed soil. It is also produced by chemical processes in the atmosphere that form ozone and other pollutants and by
City of Cudahy
General Plan
9-13
Section 9; Air Quality Element (continued)
emissions from vehicles, particularly diesel-powered vehicles. Air quality projections show that all known controls are insufficient to reach state health-based PM10 standards by 2010. Local government actions can effectively reduce some of the major sources of PM 10. Goal 8 Reduce fugitive dust emissions.
Policy 8.1	Require all feasible fugitive dust reduction techniques to be utilized during construction activities.
Policy 8.2	Support the use of efficient street cleaning equipment and practices.
Policy 8.3	Require reseeding and maintenance of exposed soil that has been previously disturbed.
Policy 8.4	Encourage landscaping and tree planting which trap pollutants and protect sensitive receptors.
Policy 8.5	Encourage alternatives to the use of leaf blowers.
ISSUE:	Building and Operational Emissions.
Materials such as paints and coatings used in building construction contribute to air pollution. Siting of new sensitive receptor sources near existing sources of particulate matter or toxics and expose residents to unsafe levels of pollutants. Review of building and siting plans prior to construction can serve to reduce or eliminate both new sources of pollutants or exposure.
Goal 9:	Reduce air pollution emissions and impacts through siting and building
design.
Policy 9.1	Support the use of low polluting construction materials and coatings.
Policy 9.2	Provide, to the maximum extent feasible, for the separation of sensitive receptors, such as schools and hospitals, from sources of toxic emissions.
Policy 9.3	Encourage design of new commercial developments to allow convenient access to customers and employees using public transportation or bicycles.
City of Cudahy General Plan	9-14
Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
Goal 10:	Improve preconstruction environmental review to reduce emissions and
exposure.
Policy 10.1	Standardize air quality review procedures for all new developments.
Policy 10.2	Facilitate project review and avoid project delays by adopting regional thresholds of significant air quality impact.
Policy 10.3	Provide, to the maximum extent feasible, for the protection of receptors from significant health risks caused by exposure to toxic and hazardous pollutants.
Policy 10.4	Reduce the exposure of sensitive receptors to dust and odors to the extent feasible.
Issue: Intergovernmental Cooperation.
Many air quality and transportation programs require regional and subregional cooperation to be effective. Local support for air quality legislation at the state and federal level is also essential for its passage.
Goal 11:	Maximize the effectiveness of air quality control programs through
coordination with other governmental units.
Policy 11.1	Participate in the SCAQMD rule development process on regulations which impact the City of Cudahy to insure that city concerns are resolved early in the process.
Policy 11.2	Participate in air quality plan development at the Southern California Association of Governments to insure that issues affecting Cudahy are considered in developing local government measures and that legislation that improves air regional quality and does not adversely impact Cudahy is supported.
Policy 11.3	Participate with neighboring cities in efforts to improve regional and subregional transit.
Policy 11.4	Require new local commercial and industrial establishments to demonstrate that SCAQMD permits have been obtained.
City of Cudahy General Plan	9-15
Section 9: Air Quality Element (continued)
Policy 11.5 Cooperate with regional efforts to support air quality legislation that benefits the city and the region.
ISSUE:	Public Education
Many programs that benefit air quality, such as recycling and transit usage, are dependent for their success on public understanding and support. Communication with the public is essential.
Goal 12:	Improve the effectiveness of air quality programs through local education
programs.
Policy 12.1 Support innovative bilingual public education programs that can inform segments of the public on transit availability.
Policy 12.2 Provide bilingual assistance to local businesses in complying with SCAQMD rules and regulations.
Policy 12.3 Utilize the City Newsletter to disseminate bilingual information on air quality, transit and related issues.
ISSUE:	City programs to Reduce Directly Emitted Vehicle Emissions.
City programs which regulate traffic or specify city equipment purchases can also reduce pollutants.
Goal 13 Reduce directly emitted vehicle emissions through city government actions.
Policy 13.1 Work with surrounding communities to reduce idling emissions by increasing traffic flow on major thoroughfares by synchronizing traffic signals.
Policy 13.2 Encourage the use of alternate fuels in city-owned vehicles.

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
Implementation of the air quality goals and policies will be accomplished through a number of specific actions and programs. These have been grouped to correspond to the air quality measures proposed for local action in the 1991 AQMP and identified in the preceding section.
PERSON WORK TRIP REDUCTION
Trip Reduction Programs
The City Manager shall explore the feasibility of permitting modified work schedules for public employees on a case-by-case basis. Most of the City’s 25 employees are single positions and need to work a five day schedule in order to provide full service during the City’s posted work week. The City Manager shall also explore the feasibility of modifying the present work week schedule to determine if alternative schedules could better meet the City’s needs. The City shall support the formation of a Transportation Management Association for use by employers in the city who may be covered by future amendments to Regulation XV.
Telecommuting
The City shall explore the use of telecommuting and teleconferencing for City employees to serve as a model for potential usage by City residents and businesses. Telecommuting can be through work at home by city employees one or more days a week, with communication through computer and telephone hookups to City Hall. The City will also explore acquisition of electronic communication equipment which facilitates telecommuting by employees and residents. A teleconferencing center could be established in the City’s Bedwell Community Center adjacent to City Hall. The City shall explore the feasibility of such a center in terms of potential community usage and seek funding from the SCAQMD’s Motor Vehicle License Fund if it finds that there is a potential need which could be met through such a center.
Alternate Transportation
The City shall review access to schools, playgrounds, and community centers and take necessary steps, such as providing and timing traffic signals to allow adequate crossing time for safe passage across streets by bicyclists and pedestrians.

RESOLUTION NO. 92-22
A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CUDAHY CERTIFYING THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT PERTAINING TO THE 1992 GENERAL PLAN OF THE CITY OF CUDAHY AND ADOPTING THAT GENERAL PLAN
THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CUDAHY HEREBY FINDS, RESOLVES AND ORDERS AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1, Section 65300 of the State Planning and Zoning Law (Division 1 of Title 7 of the California Government Code) requires every city to adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the city.
Section 2, The City prepared a proposed General Plan dated March 20, 1992, a copy of which is on file in the Office of the City Clerk which is incorporated herein by this reference ("the proposed general plan"). The proposed General Plan was prepared pursuant to California Government Code Sections 65300 et seq. and in accordance with the General Plan Guidelines promulgated by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research.
Section 3. The City has submitted the proposed General Plan to other public agencies for review as follows:
(a)	The draft Housing Element was submitted to the state Department of Housing and Community Development ("HCD") for review on March 31, 1992 pursuant to Government Code Section 65585(b). HCD's comments on the draft were received by the City in the form of a letter dated May 8, 1992. The City Council and City staff have reviewed those comments and the Housing Element has been amended in response to those comments as outlined in a document prepared by the City's consultant entitled, "Housing & Community Development Comments & Responses," which is incorporated herein by this reference and a copy of which is on file in the Office of the City Clerk.
(b)	The City's consultant consulted with the Division of Mines and Geology of the Department of Conservation and the Office of Emergency Services for the purpose of including information known by and available to the department and the office required by Government Code Section 65302(g), but those agencies were able to provide no information to the City. The proposed safety element was submitted to the Division of Mines and Geology on March 31, 1992 for review and comment. To date, the City has received no comments from the Division.
-1-
(c)	The proposed General Plan was distributed for review and comment pursuant to Government Code Section 65352 to the Cities of South Gate, Huntington Park, Bell, Maywood and Bell Gardens, to the County of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the Local Agency Formation Commission of Los Angeles County, and the Southern California Association of Governments on April 8, 1992. The comments on the proposed General Plan received from these agencies are summarized in the Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR”) a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "A” and which is incorporated herein by this reference.
Section 4. The City of Cudahy, in accordance with Section 65351 of the California Government Code, facilitated public participation in the preparation of the General Plan by conducting noticed public hearings before the City Council and Planning Commission jointly on October 9, 1991 and December 9, 1991, in addition to a hearing before the Planning Commission on April 15, 1992, and hearings before the City Council on May 4, and May 26, 1992. These meetings were publicized by the provision of legally required notice, and by the publication of articles in both English and Spanish in the City newsletter. The City Council and the Planning Commission received and considered written and oral evidence at each of the public hearings on the proposed General Plan.
Section 5, The General Plan incorporates all seven mandatory elements required by Government Code Section 65302 and an optional Air Quality Element.
Section 6, The City Council has reviewed the Housing Element Guidelines adopted by HCD pursuant to Section 50459 of the Health and Safety Code and finds that the housing goals, objectives, and policies stated in the revised Housing Element are appropriate for the City of Cudahy and will contribute to the attainment of the state housing goal. The City Council further finds that the adoption of the revised Housing Element will aid the City’s efforts to assist in the development of housing for all members of the community and that the Housing Element reflects the requirements of Government Code Section 65583(b). The revised Housing Element has been amended to reflect the comments of the State Department of Housing and Community Development as noted in Section 3(a) of this resolution and thus has been changed to comply with the requirements of Article 10.6 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code.
Section 7, The Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan prepared by the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission does not apply to any area of the City, because there are no airports within two miles of the City. Therefore, the proposed General Plan is
-2-
consistent with that Airport Land Use Plan within the meaning of Government Code Section 65302.3.
Section 8, The Noise Element was prepared consistently with the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services.
Section 9, Each element includes a profile report containing baseline data, and a statement of issues, goals, ob j ectives, policies and programs in accordance with Government Code Sections 65300 et seq.
Section 10, Pursuant to Government Code Section 65354, the Planning Commission rendered a written recommendation that the City Council approve the proposed General Plan in the form of a resolution adopted on April 15, 1992. The City Council considered all aspects of the General Plan that were considered by the Planning Commission and any changes made in the Commission’s draft by the Council concerned matters that were previously considered by the Commission.
Section 11, An EIR was prepared by a consultant retained and compensated by the City for the purpose of evaluating the environmental impacts of the proposed General Plan and complying with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The EIR has been independently, objectively, and thoroughly reviewed and analyzed by the Planning Commission, the City Council, and the City * s own staff and the draft document circulated for public review reflected the City's own independent judgment and the EIR as certified by this resolution also reflects the independent judgment of the City. The EIR adequately addresses all of the environmental issues raised by the proposed General Plan.
Section 12, The City Council hereby certifies that the Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") and the Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") on the proposed General Plan, and all noticing requirements with respect to those environmental documents, were completed pursuant to the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and the State and local guidelines promulgated with respect thereto and that the City Council has reviewed and considered the contents of the EIR prior to deciding whether to approve the proposed General Plan. A copy of the EIR is on file in the Office of the City Clerk and the EIR is incorporated herein by this reference.
Section 13, The City Council hereby adopts the mitigation monitoring program contained in Section 6 of the EIR to monitor the changes to the project which have been adopted or made a condition of project approval as described in Exhibit "C" to this resolution.
-3-
Section 14, Based upon the initial study, and other information contained in the EIR, including comments and responses to comments, the City Council finds that the proposed General Plan will not cause significant environmental impacts with respect to plant and animal life, noise, natural resources, risk of upset and telephone and cable television services.
Section 15, The City Council finds that the mere adoption of the proposed General Plan will not result in any adverse impacts. However, the EIR identifies potentially significant environmental impacts with respect to earth and geology, air quality, water and hydrology, light and glare, land use, population, housing, traffic and circulation, public services, energy, utilities other than telephone and cable television, human health, aesthetics, open space and recreation, and cultural resources which will likely result from the implementation of the proposed General Plan, especially from the development and redevelopment of land pursuant to the Land Use Plan. With the exceptions of air quality, schools, and open space and recreation, the EIR identifies feasible mitigation measures that reduce impacts to levels of insignificance. With regard to air quality, schools, and open space and recreation, the EIR identifies mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the significant environmental impacts. However, the EIR identifies no feasible mitigation measure that could reduce these impacts to levels of insignificance.
Section 16, The City Council finds, in accordance with Public Resources Code Section 21081(a), that changes or alterations have been incorporated into the proposed General Plan which mitigate or avoid the significant environmental impacts identified in the EIR with respect to earth and geology, water and hydrology, light and glare, land use, population, housing, traffic and circulation, public services other than schools, energy, utilities other than telephone and cable television, human health, aesthetics, and cultural resources. The nature of the impacts under each of these topics and the changes or alterations proposed to mitigate those impacts are summarized in Exhibit "C" to this resolution which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
Section 17, The EIR describes a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed General Plan which might fulfill the basic objectives of the project. Two alternatives have lesser environmental impacts than would the adoption of the proposed General Plan: the No Project alternative and the Existing General Plan alternative. However, the No Project alternative is infeasible as the City lacks the power to bring all development in the City to a halt and the Existing General Plan alternative fails to meet the project objectives stated in the EIR and entails unacceptable adverse impacts, including substantial demolition of existing nonconforming uses and concomitant displacement of
-4-
residents and businesses. Rejection of the Existing General Plan alternative is also justified by the factors identified in Section 18 of this resolution. The Increased Density and Commercial-Manufacturing alternatives would have more severe environmental impacts than would the adoption of the proposed general plan, and neither serves the basic objectives of the project as stated in the EIR. An alternative site could not serve any of the objectives of the project as the City is legally required to maintain a general plan for the territory within its corporate limits.
Section 18. With respect to the environmental impacts identified in the EIR which cannot be mitigated to a level of insignificance, the City Council finds, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21021(c) that there are social, economic and other benefits of the proposed General Plan that outweigh any unavoidable adverse impacts that may occur to air quality, schools, parks and recreation, or other resources. Due to such overriding benefits and considerations and, because alternatives to the project identified in the EIR which might lessen these impacts are infeasible, cannot accomplish the basic objectives of this project, and involve unacceptable adverse consequences, as discussed in Section 17 of this resolution, the City Council finds that any unavoidable adverse environmental impacts of the proposed General Plan are acceptable. This determination shall constitute a statement of overriding considerations within the meaning of CEQA and is based on the following benefits identified in the EIR and the record of proceedings regarding the approval of the proposed General Plan:
A.	The proposed General Plan will upgrade the economy of the region and increase sales and business tax revenues.
B.	The proposed General Pl an will encourage the revitalization and improvement of the City by providing for physical improvements to local roadways, and adopting measures designed to increase the efficiency of transportation services in the City.
C.	The proposed General Plan will encourage the revitalization and improvement of the City by facilitating the provision of additional and improved housing.
D.	The proposed General Plan will encourage the revitalization and improvement of the City by facilitating and proposing measures to reduce flood hazards.
E.	The proposed General Plan will encourage the revitalization and improvement of the City by facilitating improvements to community facilities.
-5-
F.	The proposed General Plan will encourage the revitalization and improvement of the City by planning for and facilitating the elimination of deficiencies in the public infrastructure.
G.	The proposed General Plan will encourage the revitalization and improvement of the City by promoting aesthetic improvements.
H.	The proposed General Plan will encourage the revitalization and improvement of the City by articulating and promoting General Plan goals for land uses which will better serve the social and economic needs of the City’s residents than do the policies of the existing General Plan, which create numerous nonconforming uses.
I.	The proposed General Plan will encourage the revitalization and improvement of the City by adopting land use policies to encourage: (i) the assembly of the City1 s long and narrow parcels and thereby to eliminate the constraints on development imposed by such lots, (ii) the replacement of older, dilapidated structures, and (iii) the relocation of mobilehome parks from industrial zones to more appropriate locations within the City’s residential areas.
J.	The proposed General Plan will create additional employment opportunities in the region by fostering short-term construction projects and long-term economic growth.
Section 19, The proposed General Plan more fully identified in Section 2 of this resolution, as amended by the Housing & Community Development Comments & Responses more fully identified in Section 3(a) of this resolution, and by the errata sheet attached as Exhibit MB” hereto, is hereby adopted as the 1992 General Plan of the City of Cudahy.
Section 20, The Land Use Plan depicted as Exhibit 2-1 to the Land Use Element of the proposed General Plan is hereby adopted as the Land Use Hap of the City of Cudahy and each parcel of land in the City is hereby given the designation indicated for that parcel on that map.
Section 21, The Circulation Plan depicted as Exhibit 4-4 to the Transportation Element of the proposed General Plan is hereby adopted as the Circulation Plan of the City of Cudahy.
Section 22, Development projects approved prior to May 26, 1992 which are inconsistent with the policies or standards of the 1992 General Plan may proceed in accordance with approved plans if a building permit has been issued and construction has commenced on
-6-
or before that date, and such construction is pursued to completion diligently and in good faith.
Section 23, The City Clerk shall endorse the General Plan to show the adoption by the City Council on the date set forth hereinbelow.
Section 24, The City Clerk is directed to file a Notice of Determination with the County Clerk showing that the 1992 General Plan of the City of Cudahy was adopted in compliance with CEQA.
Section 25, The City Clerk is hereby directed to circulate copies of the 1992 General Plan of the City of Cudahy as required by Government Code Section 65357.
PASSED, APPROVED AND ADOPTED THIS 26TH DAY OF MAY 1992.
